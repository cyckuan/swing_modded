ONONDAGA NATION _ Irving Powless Jr.
ONONDAGA NATION _ Irving Powless Jr.
, the 69-year-old chief of the Onondaga Indian Nation, longs to see the day when his people enjoy economic stability and independence _ and not from the revenues of a casino or a bingo hall.
Rather, Powless, whose tribe opposes gambling, hopes that a settlement with the state of New York over ancient land claims will bring his brethren the assets they desperately need to upgrade their 7,300-acre reservation south of Syracuse.
``We have lived in this area for 1,200 years,'' said Powless, a robust man who recalls with pride when, a generation ago, he competed against football great Jim Brown in a lacrosse match and knocked the powerful All-American and Hall of Fame fullback off his feet.
``There was fresh water, fresh air, no pollution''.
Today, the Onondagas are neither financially wealthy nor land rich.
Pollution, from a dump and from a petroleum spill at a cigarette shop, has fouled the Indian territory.
``We're considered poor,'' Powless said.
``How do you measure that?...
How many homeless people do you have in your city?
We have zero''.
Members of the tribe have a right to live on the reservation, but many survive on low-wage jobs and welfare _ the consequence of a people ``living in abject poverty'' for 200 years, according to Robert Coulter, a lawyer with the Indian Law Resource Center, a nonprofit group that is helping the Onondagas on their proposed claim.
The Onondagas haven't yet gone to court to stake their land claim, but the nation is building a case against the state of New York that would follow suits filed by other Iroquois nations _ the Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida and Seneca _ with the federal government as co-plaintiff.
Several Indian law and history experts believe the Onondaga case would be very strong.
The tribe has identified a 10-mile-square section of Onondaga County as an area to which it lays claim.
The land includes a mile surrounding Onondaga Lake and most of Syracuse, a city of 163,000 in upstate New York.
That represents a fraction of the acreage that the Onondagas controlled more than two centuries ago.
Powless said he has been hearing about land claims since he was a boy growing up on the reservation, where his father, Irving Powless Sr.
, also served as chief.
Powless views the reservation as an island representing the hundreds of thousands of acres wrongfully taken by and poorly used by ``the Europeans'' who obtained Indian properties illegally.
He smiles as he talks about his boyhood on the Onondaga territory, where he learned to fish, hunt and play sports.
One of the top three officers among the 14 chiefs of the Onondagas, Powless has proven to have a tough side to him.
And some Onondaga members feel Powless is too powerful.
``No one can have anything unless you go through him,'' says Alice Thompson, 64, who lives on the reservation.
Thompson, according to Powless, was part of an insurgent group that wanted to overthrow his government.
A land-claim settlement would be a way to ease some of the tensions that remain.
It could pump up the tribal government's popularity, pay for toxic cleanups and help the Onondaga government afford better educational, cultural and social programs.
Powless said the Onondaga people want to work with the community outside the reservation to improve the economy of the region, perhaps creating tourism destinations that might include Indian culture, or setting up a free-trade zone at unused manufacturing sites.
The Onondagas say they don't intend to threaten eviction of property owners in whatever suit they file, unlike the Cayugas and Oneidas.
But they have not ruled out governmental and commercial property holders as targets for eviction.
``Maybe they should be subjected to some of the things we were subjected to _ such as taking your land away from you for 200 years,'' Powless said .
PHOENIX _ Victoria Molina wants strangers to stop complaining about her having babies on taxpayer's money and government workers to stop asking how she spends that money.
Most of all, she wants her children to stop complaining because there's only enough money for one meal a day.
Now the welfare mother knows how to make it all stop.
And it's going to start with a screwdriver.
Molina, along with seven other welfare mothers from the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Tucson, have learned to use that screwdriver to tear apart a computer and put it back together.
It's the mothers' first and frightening step in learning to compete for wealth in a system that often treats them with insult and indifference.
It's also the first step in a welfare reform program designed by the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, the first of Arizona's 21 Native American communities to take charge of its own program to get parents from welfare to work.
White Mountain Apache community's welfare program started in April.
Tribes throughout the state and country are just beginning to take advantage of the power and money granted them by the 1996 federal welfare law to customize their own reform programs.
Most of the 16 Indian-run programs across the nation are designed to emphasize education and soften the punitive nature of many state programs.
And most are in need of more money.
The Pascua Yaqui Tribe needs computer technicians, so they're training their own.
By October, some welfare parents in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa community will be attending desk top publishing or nursing courses.
On the remote Navajo Nation, where jobs and training are scarce, welfare parents could soon be asked to tend sheep or chop wood for their elders in exchange for their benefits.
``Our nation, philosophically, certainly supports the ideals of personal responsibility and self sufficiency,'' said Virgil Pablo, a director with the Navajo Nation's Social Services Department.
``With the remoteness on the reservation and limited access to development in remote and isolated areas, we're in the best position to say what is appropriate for us,'' Pablo said.
Jorge Garcia, who designed the Yaqui program, calls the emphasis on education the basic philosophical difference between the Yaquis' program and the state-run program.
``We want to prepare parents to be a successful provider, not someone who lives on the fringes,'' said Garcia, who knows Molina and many of the mothers in her computer class know how to get a job and have supplemented their welfare income waitressing and filing.
``These people have always been on the fringes''.
Now, Garcia said, they want a career.
But if they are to succeed, Arizona Indian leaders told a U.S.
Congressional hearing Friday that Native American governments need more flexibility, more independence and money, and a sincere effort by counties and the state to create jobs in rural areas.
Indian leaders were invited to report their welfare reform progress and problems to Arizona's Congressman J.D.
Hayworth and Rep.
Clay Shaw of Florida, chairman of the U.S.
House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, at a hearing in the state capital.
Most Arizona tribes are grappling with the opportunity to cushion their members from the harsher blows of the state's welfare reform and to refocus their own bureaucracies to aid their neediest families.
``It's a unique opportunity the state can't begin to do because they have thousands of people,'' said Lillia Castaneda, who is in charge of putting the Salt River community's 250 to 400 adults now receiving benefits to work.
``They're not numbers to us, they're people.
They're families''.
But it won't work unless scattered tribal bureaucracies learn to work with each other and with numerous state and federal agencies distributing bits and pieces of welfare funds, said Eddie Brown, Associate Dean at the Center for American Indian Studies at Washington University in St.
Louis, Mo.
He also isn't sure that the federal government is ready to pay the price of putting people to work on the nation's poorest reservations.
Native Americans living on reservations that maintain 50 percent or more unemployment are exempt from the national five-year family limit on welfare benefits.
That limit is pressuring states to move quickly with reform.
Nine Arizona tribes are exempt.
That exemption is a blessing and a curse, said Brown.
``It's a blessing because it understands that living on a reservation is not a normal situation,'' said Brown.
Expensive problems that keep people out of work, such as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, poor education and teen births, and lack of jobs, are more prevelent in Indian communities, he noted.
It's a curse, he contends, because by dropping the five-year limit, the federal government all but admitted it doesn't want to pay for solving those complicated problems.
The mothers in the Pascua Yaqui computer class, among 50 parents who are in jobs or training through the tribe's welfare program, are the cream of the welfare population, young, smart, articulate and easily motivated, said Garcia, Social Service director.
He knows many parents will need more time and cost more money to prepare for work, some are older with more children and less education and more behavioral health and medical problems.
Right now, Garcia said, the community has services to help these families, but some programs, such as childcare, already have waiting lists.
There is little money and staff to help find families who simply drop off of the welfare roles, perhaps because of drug, alcohol or domestic abuse problems _ families Garcia is unwilling to let go.
As Indian communities across the nation struggle with short funds and a long list of problems, they are watching the Navajo Nation's legal battle with the federal government.
Despite the power and money granted to tribes, they still remain dependent on state-run offices to determine eligibility and distribute cash benefits for their members.
The Navajo Nation wants a block grant that will give it state-like authority and funding to take over and streamline the entire welfare program, including eligibility and distribution of cash benefits.
It wants to avoid entering into agreements with the three different states its sprawling reservation covers and avoid working with three different federal regional offices.
While the Navajos continue their legal struggle, the Yaqui Tribe is implementing a gentler program than the massive one run by the state, where welfare roles have been slashed nearly in half in a little more than two years.
The Yaqui communities, where unemployment is 30 percent, are still bound by the five-year welfare limit, but they have eliminated the state-imposed 2-year welfare limit for adults and will still provide benefits to children born while parents are on welfare.
While the state program emphasizes quick job placement, the Yaquis are spending more time and money on education.
The tribe has 350 welfare families, or about 10 percent of its membership, some of whom live in in Scottsdale and Guadalupe.
This tiny, small-town program can provide face to face encouragement.
Molina and her other classmates only agreed to commit to the two-year computer course after people they knew knocked on their doors, tapped them on the shoulder, gave them a little push and took them by the hand to prove to them they could compete.
``Jorge (Garcia) came to my house,'' said Molina.
``I was cleaning.
I told him, `I'm not even dressed'.
He said, `Just go like you are'.
'' Garcia drove the nervous Molina to the tribal offices to interview for the program.
``I was scared,'' Molina said.
``I've just been having kids and staying home and didn't feel I had the knowledge to learn anything''.
Molina's classmates and teacher said she's now the first to volunteer to wrestle the insides of a computer she was once afraid to touch.
But it's Molina's children who keep her coming every day.
She renewed her friendship with her distant 13-year-old daughter with conversations about computers.
``They're telling everybody `My mom's in computer class.
My mom's building computers'.

SYRACUSE, N.Y.
(AP) - New York acted honorably in acquiring Cayuga Indian lands two centuries ago and even took steps to protect the Iroquois tribe, a Canadian anthropologist testified Wednesday.
After two weeks of listening to how New York officials lied, bribed and cheated the Cayugas out of their 64,027-acre reservation, U.S.
District Judge Neal McCurn heard a different historical perspective from the state's first witness, Alexander von Gernet.
McCurn previously ruled that New York illegally acquired the Cayugas reservation land in 1795 and 1807 by purchasing it from the tribe in violation of the 1790 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, which required Congressional approval for all Indian land transactions.
Following a monthlong trial, a federal court jury in February awarded the Cayugas $36.9 million for their lost ancestral lands.
The judge is now weighing historical and economic factors to decide whether the jury's award should be increased.
It is important to look at the pre-Revolutionary War years to understand New York's behavior dealing with Native Americans after that time, said von Gernet, a Native American expert from the University of Toronto.
It was long-standing policy that New York assumed authority over Indian land transactions within its borders, von Gernet said.
Historical documents show that as early as 1684, the colonial governor was required to approve any land deals with Indian tribes, he said.
That policy was carried forward in other treaties, laws and proclamations enacted over the next century, von Gernet testified.
It was a policy also included in the state constitution, he said.
''Congress was a newfangled institution.
Colonial New York had a longrunning relationship with the tribes,'' von Gernet said.
''The idea of dealing firsthand with the Iroquois had a long history in New York.
It was not one that emerged after the Revolutionary War''.
The Cayugas fought on the British side in the Revolutionary War and there was widespread sentiment in the fledgling federal government and among New York lawmakers to treat the tribe as a conquered people and make them wards of the state, von Gernet said.
However, then Gov.
George Clinton ignored the warnings and instead decided to broker a treaty with them, von Gernet testified.
Although the state clearly came out the winner by gaining ownership of Indian lands, the treaty also ensured reservation land would be set aside for the Cayugas and protected them from unscrupulous individuals who were striking private deals to buy their land, he said.
Von Gernet also testified: -That it was the Cayugas who tried to dispose of their land for 22 years before the 1795 sales and first approached the state about buying their reservation land.
-That the Iroquois Grand Council had dissolved during the Revolutionary War, leaving the Cayugas and other tribes to each follow its own course.
The Cayugas' witnesses have testified that in agreeing to the 1795 treaty, New York knowingly ignored Iroquois tradition, which required the Grand Council's consensus to make the treaty binding.
Additionally, von Gernet said, following the war, the Cayugas split into factions led by local chiefs who earned their position through achievement as opposed to inheriting them.
''There was considerable confusion about who was empowered in diplomatic discourse,'' von Gernet told McCurn.
He said the majority faction led by Fish Carrier moved to Buffalo Creek in western New York and tried to sell off the Cayugas lands to private individuals in deals that were determined illegal by state lawmakers.
The minority faction, led by Steel Trap, returned to the Cayuga Lake area, where faced with an onslaught of settlers, it eventually worked out the 1789 lease giving all the tribe's lands to New York except for the 64,000-acre reservation.
BERNALILLO, N.M.
_ With muscular yet elegant curves, the Rio Grande winds its way through the Santa Ana Pueblo reservation.
Stand along its yucca- and cactus-sprinkled shores and face north from the sacred Indian grounds where the Spanish explorer Coronado once trekked, and the Sandia Mountains seem to hang like gods in the sky to the east.
Look just to the west, and the only thing hanging in the sky is a giant neon star bearing the words ``Star Casino''.
Next to the casino, little white golf carts zip over the reservation's 27-hole championship course.
And just beyond that, construction is under way on an $80 million hotel, a spa and second golf course.
After using casino gambling, over the last several years, to help reverse their fortunes, Native-American tribes like this one are beginning to build entire leisure industries on their reservations.
But as the easy-money aura of vacation resorts, gambling, golf, and shopping spreads across the land that these people have for generations cherished and protected from outside intrusion, concern is growing among tribal members that their religion, culture and sovereignty are being pushed aside.
``It's like a leisure virus,'' said Jose Lucero, a member of the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe located about 60 miles north of here.
His tribe is divided over whether they, too, should develop a casino resort.
``We're trading our souls for money,'' he said.
``Some tribe members say `Hey, it's OK.
It's glamorous'.
But that's not what we are supposed to be.
We are supposed to be stewards of this land.
And we're not very good stewards now, allowing all of this stuff to take over''.
With the desperately needed jobs and money that casinos have brought to reservations, few people in the tribes have been publicly critical of casino gambling on their reservations.
But a once-faint drumbeat of disdain is growing louder.
Critics worry that tourists will trample across what they consider to be religious ground, that the business partnerships that the tribes are forming are increasingly being operated by outside professionals and managers.
``Our religious leaders are more or less opposed to the casino and all these companies moving in here,'' said Otis Leon, a member of the tribal council that governs the Santa Ana tribe.
But the medicine men and other protectors of the tribe's religion and culture, he added, ``are getting pushed aside in a way''.
Leon, who voted in favor of the casino development, now expresses mixed emotions.
``Things seemed OK at first,'' he said.
``But then more of the Las Vegas types started moving in''.
Despite such concerns, it is difficult to argue against what appears to be progress.
Of the 22 tribes across New Mexico, 11 now operate casinos, and it is estimated that they take in more than $350 million a year in gambling revenues.
And although there is still poverty on the reservations, jobs are plentiful, recreation centers and libraries have been built, and major investments are being made to augment the success of gambling.
Several tribes are expanding their casinos and planning hotels and vacation resorts, and the tribe that is leading the way is the Santa Ana Pueblo.
Two weeks ago, the tribe announced a partnership with the Hyatt Hotels Corp.
to build what is being billed as ``New Mexico's first major golf and spa resort''.
The 350-room resort hotel will occupy a picturesque section of the 61,000-acre reservation, which is located 15 miles north of Albuquerque.
The tribe will own the resort and Hyatt will manage it.
Additionally, the tribe is doubling the size of its adobe-style Star Casino and adding a Las Vegas-style theater.
A retail shopping center is proposed for a nearby section of the reservation.
Thanks to the profit from its six-year-old casino, the Santa Ana Pueblo tribe is operating a gourmet restaurant on the reservation, next door to its golf course and luxurious clubhouse.
This year, the tribe will host major golf tournaments, including the U.S.
Women's Amateur Public Links Championship and the PGA Western Club Championship.
nn As the tribal members who are leading the development boom see it, they are doing more than investing the casino's profits to increase economic opportunities.
With pending lawsuits and other initiatives that could shut down their casinos or lead to heavy taxes on their revenues, they say they are creating an industry that can survive even if the casinos do not.
``There are so many attacks on Indian casinos,'' said Roy Montoya, who as chief administrator of the 690-member tribe is in charge of all business development.
``What the new resort represents is another step toward self-sufficiency''.
Within the tribe, where most decisions are made by councils comprised of men, the progression from subsistence agriculture to private business has created two camps.
The traditionalists are leery of opening their boundaries to outside interests, and the business leaders like Montoya are pushing to expand.
As the profits from gambling began to add up, ``we considered two approaches,'' Montoya said during an interview in his plain but comfortable office on the reservation.
``Some people said stash the money.
Don't do anything with it.
But we chose to put these different ventures in place''.
The culture and religion, Montoya says, will be strengthened by the economic growth.
``Our culture and religion was very strong when we got our subsistence from farming right here on the reservation,'' he said.
``Then when the economy started changing and Dad had to go off the reservation to work things got weak.
But with jobs on the reservation now you have more time to spend with your family and in 15 to 20 years the religion and culture will become stronger again''.
The business-oriented tribal members seem to be winning.
When the tribal council was discussing the proposed hotel, some members bristled at the notion of building the resort just a half mile from ``The Snake Head,'' one of the reservation's many ancient religious sites.
``But the business types said they needed that site next to the river, overlooking the mountains,'' said Leon, whose grandfather held the revered religious title of medicine man.
The business interests prevailed.
As a result, Leon lamented: ``The religious people are upset with us.
They worry that the public will wander over the reservation''.
One planned aspect of the Hyatt resort that might appease the religious leaders is a small museum with exhibits depicting the tribe's history.
Such museums are becoming a common element in casino and resort developments on reservations.
&QL; Two weeks ago at the Taos Pueblo reservation, located 70 miles north of Santa Fe, tribal leaders two weeks ago approved a plan to buy a nearby hotel and meeting center and move the tribe's existing casino to the site, which would become a part of the tribe's reservation.
But not everyone on the reservation is happy about the growth.
Jerome Marcus, a 38-year-old member of the tribe and former security officer at the casino, said that as the casino has prospered he has witnessed a slow deterioration of tribal values and customs.
``I've noticed a complete lack of participation in ceremonies and understanding by our people, especially with diversions like the casino,'' he said.
Still, the benefits from all of the development are evident in the opportunities that have been created.
One recent afternoon at the Isleta Pueblo reservation, 10 miles south of Albuquerque, Aaron Dailey, a 16-year-old tribal member, was busy washing golf carts at the lush golf course just across Highway 47 from the tribe's casino.
Although he has been playing golf less than three years, Aaron already carries a 10 handicap _ better than most golfers will ever play _ and the golf professionals operating the course have high hopes for him.
``The tribe is trusting us to come in and operate their business enterprises and train their people,'' said Brent Townsley, a teaching professional at the course.
``But our goal is to see someone like Aaron take this course over and become the head pro''.
Nevertheless, the phalanx of corporate interests, lawyers, accountants, casino managers and investment advisers who swirl around the reservation is unnerving to some.
``They're taking a lot of the control of the economic development on the reservation out of the hands of the tribe itself,'' said Tim Giago, a syndicated columnist and member of South Dakota's Oglala Lakota tribe.
``I'm amazed that many of the tribes have turned into what they've deplored all their lives.
They're bureaucracies and they're being run by attorneys and accountants _ white attorneys and accountants''.
But if appearances count for anything, Roy Montoya appears to be in control at Santa Ana.
One day recently, he walked into a closed-door meeting of casino executives because he wanted to have a word with the casino's general manager, a Las Vegas transplant.
Minutes later, he was at the reservation's planning offices, interrupting another meeting of architects and developers who were huddled around a conference table.
When Montoya entered, they all popped to their feet, smiling broadly.
``We own everything 100 percent,'' Montoya said.
``All of these people are on contract, just like out in the rest of the world''.
Montoya oversees a staff of more than 400 employees, and in two years, when current development projects are complete, that number is projected to reach 700 _ more employees than tribal members.
``When I started this job in '84 I had nine employees and I was just called Roy,'' said the 58-year-old Montoya.
``Now people call me sir.
But I'm still Roy.
I get uncomfortable with sir.''

SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y.
_ The road leading into the Shinnecock Indian reservation is not a welcoming one: The sign marking the way reads, ``Trespassers will be arrested''.
Some uninvited people _ drug dealers and government workers _ have been reportedly fired upon after crossing onto tribal lands.
Tourists are simply asked to leave.
The Indians are an insular lot.
The world outside their 800-acre reservation here on the Shinnecock Peninsula knows little about them, and for 350 years, that's the way they have preferred it.
Their dealings with society, they say, have never been good.
``It seems every time we've dealt with the white man, we've come out the worse for it,'' said Harriet Gumbs, a 79-year-old elder and a tribal historian.
The reservation is a postage stamp of marshland swamped by poverty and unemployment.
For years, the Indians watched as land that was once theirs was transformed into housing subdivisions.
Although they complained, there were few sympathetic ears at the local courthouse and Town Hall.
After all, they had signed treaties and land-swap agreements, officials say.
``They built on our ancestors' bones, and we never really did anything to stop it,'' said Elizabeth Haile, 69, a member of the Thunderbird clan who watched over the years as houses and other buildings sprouted up around the reservation.
``That's changing with the young people''.
East End power brokers on Long Island have taken notice as this new breed of Shinnecock have lain in front of bulldozers, marched on Town Hall and protested on the steps of the state Capitol in Albany to stop the development of 62 acres of virgin woodland to the north of the Montauk Highway, the road that separates the reservation from the rest of Southampton.
The news of the protests has spread from Indian-run radio in Canada to the editorial pages of The News From Indian Country, a newspaper.
The young Shinnecock have been radicalized by the success of tribes that were once destitute, like the Oneida Indians.
The Oneida reservation was once a tumble-down 32 acres in upstate New York, but the tribe now owns the state's largest casino and has a land claim wending its way through federal court asking for the return of 250,000 acres between Syracuse and Utica.
As a result, the young group of Shinnecock are talking aggressively about claiming 3,600 acres of prime Southampton real estate that includes three golf courses _ among them the renowned Shinnecock Hills, site of the U.S.
Open in 2004 _ and Southampton College of Long Island University.
It is land that once belonged to the Shinnecock.
It is land they want back.
The tribe filed a petition with the federal government three years ago seeking recognition and has since raised the specter of casinos on the East End.
``A lot of my people are scared about what we're doing,'' said Becky Genia, 43, who left the reservation as a teen-ager in the mid-1970s and learned the politics of protest with the American Indian Movement.
``We're surrounded by very rich people.
The folks on the res think that raising Cain about broken promises and miserable living conditions means they're going to take what little land we got left.
I got news: they aren't going to touch another acre of it''.
Developers say that they hold a title to the disputed 62 acres that dates back more than a century, and their claim to the property is built on firm legal ground.
``The homes are being built as we speak,'' said John Bennet, a lawyer for the developers, Parrish Pond Associates.
``The Indians' lawsuit was thrown out of court''.
The Indians have stopped short of laying formal claim to the 62 acres, but say the wooded site is a small but sacred portion of their heritage that should be preserved.
The Shinnecock are a state-recognized tribe, but one of more than 100 Indian tribes not acknowledged by the federal government.
They have no access to federal education and health money and run no gambling operations.
More important, they receive no legal assistance from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, so their land claims hang in limbo.
According to records, in the early 18th century, the town of Southampton paid the tribe $20 for its land and gave it a 1,000-year lease on the 3,600 acres.
In 1859, town officials convinced the state legislature that the Shinnecock were willing to break that lease to allow the Long Island Rail Road to go through in exchange for outright title to the current reservation on Shinnecock Neck.
John Strong, a professor emeritus of history at Southampton College, said he believes the Shinnecock were pressured into the deal and that the signatures on the document were faked.
If a court should ever rule in the Shinnecock's favor, the tribe would hold legal title to billions of dollars in property.
``This new group of Indians have got people's attention,'' said state Sen.
Kenneth LaValle, a Republican who represents the area.
``The buzzword is casino.
Right now, the Indians don't have a friend in the world, but if they get the feds on board, imagine the fight.
The Hamptons are the playground of the powerful.
You think they'll stand for rabble coming out from the city to play cards, get drunk and urinate on their hedgerows''?
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) New homes are being built on the reservation by retirees who, after living in black society in cities like Washington and Los Angeles, have returned to the reservation, where they pay no property taxes.
The income disparity on the reservation has widened.
The main employers are the smoke shops and hot dog stands that line the highway and serve the weekend tourists.
The tribal schoolhouse has been closed and Indian children attend public schools.
The Shinnecock, for the most part, take a hostile view of politics, whether they are federal, state, town or tribal.
But it is especially the tribal politics that tie the community in knots.
Without a coherent voice of resistance for the tribe, the bulldozers continue to clear trees.
``Those old dogs, they're in it for themselves,'' said Ruben Bess Valdez, 45, a university-trained environmentalist, speaking of the tribal trustees.
He said the leaders have in the past made land-use and right-of-way deals with the state, kept the money for themselves and kept the tribe in the dark.
``If you're in it for yourself, how can you fight for anyone else''?
With little money for court battles, the tribe remains divided over the more aggressive tactics.
On one side are the tribal trustees who hold nearly all the decision-making power in the lives of the 500 people on the reservation.
On the other side are the brash group of college- and street-educated Indians who want a settlement now.
``We need changes now,'' said Chuck Quinn, who has been arrested for sitting on the 18th green at Shinnecock Hills in protest.
``No more selling us out, no more backdoor deals with the whites''.
So the Indians await word of their application for federal recognition.
Such status would give the tribe the right to negotiate gambling deals with the state.
The application process can take years, experts say, and the tribal trustees have yet to respond to a 1998 letter from the Bureau of Indian Affairs requesting more application materials.
Federal recognition would also mean that the tribe would have to draft a new constitution and set up a new government.
``The truth of the matter is that we need to come together on the reservation before we can make our demands to the general public,'' said Harold Dent, a Shinnecock and an adviser to the tribal trustees.
``I am trying to make this point to the trustees.
But people running around shouting willy-nilly isn't going to help our situation''.
The reservation is a world apart from the rest of the Hamptons.
Cancer rates among the Shinnecock are among the highest on Long Island.
In a town where a pool-side bungalow rents for $30,000 for the summer, the median per capita income on the reservation hovers around $6,000.
The reservation, in addition, has yet to be hooked up to the Suffolk County water supply.
The Indians drink from an aquifer that is contaminated with the pesticide Temik at levels seven times the amount considered safe for human consumption, according to the county health department.
``The water authority simply won't run them pipes,'' said the Southampton town supervisor, Vincent Cannuscio.
``Somebody has to pay for it.
And it's going to have to be the Shinnecock''.
The Indians also cannot get home-improvement loans because the land is held in common and they have no mortgages.
What is more, no Indian holds any meaningful elected or appointed town position.
``Their situation is the dirty little secret of Southampton,'' said Bob Zellner, a civil rights activist and adjunct professor of history at Southampton College.
WINDOW ROCK, Ariz.
_ The tranquil shore of Wheatfields Lake, a high-country fishing hole set among the ponderosa and sandstone here on the Navajo Reservation, would seem an unlikely place to encounter violence.
But a 26-year-old Navajo man who called himself Bam Bam was prepared for the worst, filling his battered pickup truck with gas before setting off with his brother to catch some trout.
Too many times, Bam Bam said, gang rivals had beaten him while he was walking home in the dark.
In a few other instances, said Bam Bam, speaking on the condition that he be identified only by his nickname, he had done the attacking and had served time in jail for assault.
``It's gotten almost like the inner city here,'' said Bam Bam, unzipping his jacket to show a pistol hidden inside.
The spread of violent crime here on the Navajo Reservation, a vast territory of dry plains and red rock mesas in the Four Corners region of the Southwest, reflects problems on dozens of the nation's Indian reservations.
While homicide and assault rates have declined across much of the nation in recent years, they have soared in Indian country to rival that of the nation's cities.
As the influences of the modern world grow, many reservations _ especially those in the West _ suffer from problems with gangs and drugs.
The situation is compounded by the poverty that has afflicted many Indian reservations for generations.
``Our kids have satellite TV and are influenced by things going on in Chicago and New York,'' said Leonard Butler, chief of the Navajo Nation Police Department of 280 for the reservation's 200,000 residents.
``They go to Los Angeles and bring back the way of life of the city, like drive-by shootings, graffiti and tattoos''.
In response to the surge in violent crime on reservations, President Clinton proposed increasing the 1999 law-enforcement budget for the Bureau of Indian Affairs by $25 million, to $100 million.
That total was reduced significantly in recent House and Senate votes, and by time the appropriation bill emerges from a conference committee the increase could be below $10 million.
Administration officials are also considering reorganizing the law-enforcement division of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
One option _ criticized by some tribes and praised by others _ would be to transfer the responsibility for law enforcement to the Justice Department.
To be sure, the Navajo Reservation has always had its share of violent crime, but that increased sharply in the mid-1990s.
Homicides went from an average of 35 a year at the beginning of the decade to 67 in 1996, and 57 the year after.
In the first half of 1998, 18 people have been slain on the reservation, dropping the homicide rate closer to what it was early in the decade.
In 1997, Washington had a murder rate of 55 per 100,000 population, Baltimore and Detroit had rates of 46 while Chicago had a murder rate of 27.
The picture is similar on some smaller reservations, like the Fort Peck Reservation in eastern Montana.
There, the murder rate of 1 for 675 residents in 1995 was twice that of New Orleans, according to a federal report last year on Indian law enforcement.
New Orleans, with 1 murder per 1,350 residents in 1995, has one of the highest homicide rates in the country.
Combating the crime wave is proving especially difficult because of a lack of police officers on many reservations in the West, experts say.
For example, there are 1.4 officers per thousand Navajo residents, compared with 2.9 per thousand for other small communities, the federal report said.
The Navajo Reservation is primarily dependent on federal money.
The shortage of officers was apparent here over two recent nights, when the officers intervened in drunken domestic fights, hospitalized a man who drank antifreeze and arrested about a half-dozen people on charges of public intoxication.
Because only three officers are on duty for evening shifts in a district of 3,055 square miles that includes Window Rock, where the reservation's government is based, some calls for assistance went unanswered for hours.
There are seven police districts on the reservation.
``We know we need more police officers,'' said Officer Roanna Buck, ``but that's up to the politicians.
The tribal leadership is overlooking the crime because they don't want to admit that it's happening''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Another disparity frequently cited by the police is the lack of equipment, such as helicopters and computers mounted in squad cars, commonly found in police departments of comparable size to the reservation.
Many reservation residents are frustrated.
Seated in a round hogan, a traditional Navajo home built with logs that has a red dirt floor, Lorraine Nelson, 60, a teacher from Window Rock, recalled an earlier era when children spent their days herding sheep and assisting the tribe rather than getting in trouble.
``Today's kids have lost respect for their parents and their neighbors,'' she said.
``I don't know how to turn it around''.
A dilapidated housing project in Fort Defiance, a few miles north of Window Rock, is considered by many residents to be one of the most dangerous neighborhoods on the reservation.
The barren lots and graffiti-covered houses are the territory of the Cobras, a gang of young men whose members battle their rivals, the Dragons, with baseball bats.
``To stay strong we had to band together,'' said a 24-year-old Navajo gang member who uses the name Strange.
``It was more for fun at first, but then people took it to the next level''.
But gang violence does not fully explain the reservation's predicament.
Often, people are killed by family members or friends in petty disputes, often involving alcohol.
Over the past few years, the Navajo police force has implemented programs intended to curtail crime.
For example, 45 officers were added to the force.
Their salaries were paid with new federal grants, though the police chief complained that the money did not supply the uniforms and patrol cars needed for them.
The department also has a gang unit, a community policing program and school programs intended to discourage children from using illegal drugs.
The tribal leadership and other community leaders have begun summer work programs for young people and, in some cases, are evicting problem families from public housing.
But if such efforts are to succeed, the police say, they will have to reach boys like the three, ages 13 and 14, who were relaxing on a housing project porch on a recent afternoon.
As one of their mothers sewed inside the house, the boys spoke admiringly of drug dealing and violence by two older relatives who are gang members and contemplated joining the gang one day themselves.

CROW AGENCY, Mont.
_ First the Crow were bullied by the Sioux from these red cliffs and rolling yellow hills of buffalo grass.
Later they struck an alliance with the United States and fell here alongside Custer.
In time, Washington force-fed treaties to the Crow, bunching them on the reservation while inviting in white settlers as models of how to run a store or farm the land.
Prosperity has yet to reach the undulating horizon of south-central Montana's Indian country, but the Crow have caught on to that most loathed of European imports _ the tax.
Aimed at the tourist trade, a tribe-levied surcharge sets white fishing guides, shopkeepers and service station owners to griping about taxation without representation.
To those whites who feel unwelcome on the 2.5 million-acre reservation, who feel officially less than Indians living under the same huge sky, the Crow say tough.
``If you don't like it,'' said Carl Venne, the Crow's director of public safety, ``then get the hell out of here''.
Like the Crow, tribes throughout the country move with new resolve to exercise an old asset: sovereignty.
It is that dominion that makes them not just another census category, but hundreds of nations within a nation.
This peculiar status stems from a time when Indians controlled more than three-fourths of what would become the United States, prompting the writers of the Constitution to place tribes on an equal footing with foreign nations.
The ``white fathers'' in Washington underlined that status in 371 treaties that followed.
Since 1830 the Supreme Court has affirmed that although tribes are domestic and dependent, they are still part of an American family of governments entitled to self-rule.
That sovereignty opens the way for casinos, guarantees American Indians extraordinary fishing and hunting rights, allows them to sell gasoline and cigarettes on Indian territory free of state taxes.
Those Indians-only enterprises, in turn, give new resources to some of the poorest Americans in the United States.
That money also serves as life support for hundreds of dying languages and offers a sliver of hope for the survival of customs overwhelmed by European-bred culture.
Yet the show of treaty-backed authority cues wails of protest from non-Indians.
``I can't participate in their government,'' said Gordon Rose, a former lawyer who runs an outfitters shop and a small group of cabins near the Bighorn River.
The Crow have put a lien on his business for not paying the sales tax they first imposed in 1995.
``Why should I be subject to their control''?
That argument, say tribes, overlooks history and the law.
``You hear people talking about special rights that are anachronistic or ancient,'' said Steven Tullberg, who directs the Washington, D.C., office of the Indian Law Resource Center, based in Helena, Mont.
``Most of those rights are younger than our Constitution.
We don't disparage the Constitution by saying it's ancient''.
Assigning different rights to one group based on bloodlines may seem anomalous in this republic born of a declaration that ``all men are created equal''.
But sovereignty clearly means recognizing Indians as not only Native Americans but also as special Americans.
Indians working on reservations avoid state income taxes but pay federal income and Social Security taxes.
They can vote in local, state and federal elections _ a right that didn't exist for them in New Mexico, for instance, until 1948.
But a non-Indian resident of a reservation has no say in tribal government.
An Indian who commits a crime outside a reservation is destined for the usual federal, state or local courts.
Indian authorities deal with tribal members for minor crimes on reservations but turn to the FBI or the U.S.
Bureau of Indian Affairs police to deal with murders, armed robberies or organized crime.
That can get confusing when, for instance, a non-Indian is burglarized on a reservation.
If the burglar is a member of the tribe, then tribal police handle the case.
If the burglar is white, then a county sheriff might step in.
But who's in charge until you catch the thief?
It isn't always clear, either, what constitutes Indian country.
Treaties dating sometimes to the 18th century often contradict each other.
But on land that is theirs, tribes can decide whether to set zoning, to ban alcohol or to open casinos.
``Without (reservations), and the claim to separate government they represent, Indians would, for all practical purposes, be no different from other ethnic minorities in the United States,'' wrote Fergus Bordewich in ``Killing the White Man's Indian''.
Along with granting tribes self-rule and reserving them land, the federal government still pays for vast territory taken from tribes with a promise of sustenance.
Mostly that takes the form of services _ clinics, schools, welfare _ like those provided to poor people elsewhere.
Some tribes, such as the Cherokee in Oklahoma, have worked to wean themselves from federal dependency as funding for Indian programs has waned.
The Cherokee, for instance, generate more than half their tribal income from enterprises that include a ranch, a lumber company and several plants that manufacture wire for corporations and the military.
``Sometimes I really feel discouraged when I imagine our ancestors hearing us saying that we can't live without the (Bureau of Indian Affairs),'' said then-Cherokee Chief Wilma Mankiller to other Indian leaders in 1992.
Indians account for less than 1 percent of the U.S. population today, spread mostly across the West on 314 reservations.
The differences in culture and prosperity among the Hopi, the Mohawks, the Seminoles are as varied as those among the British, the Italians, the Russians.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, gambling has reversed the fortunes of only a few tribes.
Congress' General Accounting Office estimates that 40 percent of Indian gambling revenue comes from eight of 184 tribal casinos.
The country's largest tribe, the Navajo, twice rejected gambling.
Poverty among the Sioux on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota makes theirs the poorest county in the country.
Less than a day's drive to the east finds Minnesota's Mille Lacs band of Chippewa awash in casino profits.
Despite those differences a new Indian movement grows that sees salvation in sovereignty and its foundations in U.S. law.
Thirty years ago, up to three dozen Indians practiced law.
Now most estimates put that number at more than 1,000 _ still small compared with the rest of the population, but a dramatic increase.
``Tribes are trying to come into the modern world,'' said Lawrence Baca, president-elect of the Native American Bar Association.
``Using the law is something just to get the tribes out of a situation of poverty''.
The tribes' new pragmatism also shows in more than $2 million in political donations made in the 1996 election cycle.
Their assertiveness is seen in different ways in different places: The Mashantucket Pequots in Connecticut used their location near large eastern cities to build the country's largest casino _ Indian or otherwise _ and now can guarantee each tribal member a job worth upward of $50,000 a year.
The success of those Pequots and a few other tribes in the gambling business has prompted competitors, most vocally developer Donald Trump, to complain that Indians hold an unfair advantage because they pay no taxes on their profits and enjoy different standards of regulation.
Neighbors to a new prison in south-central Missouri battled mightily, but unsuccessfully, to stop the $73 million project.
But the Iowa tribe of Oklahoma was able to halt construction last month.
The tribe said excavation could upset the remains of their ancestors _ some of the 70,000 American Indians forced to move cross-country by the Indian Removal Act of 1830.
Navajo leaders prompted outrage for briefly considering blocking all the roads into their expansive lands in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah as a declaration of their rule.
The Omaha tribe in Macy, Neb.
, has converted its failed bingo hall into a cigarette manufacturing plant and is marketing its cigarettes on reservations throughout the country.
An Indian-made product sold on Indian land is exempt from state taxes.
Consequently, full flavor, menthol, light and ultra-light Omahas can undercut the non-tribal competition.
A U.S.
Supreme Court case soon will decide whether eight Chippewa tribes may continue hunting and fishing free of any state regulation in Minnesota.
While state officials worry that ruling with the tribes could lead to a plundering of Minnesota's wild game, the tribes insist they've held the right to hunt and fish at will for 150 years.
And at a time when states fight bitterly to keep out nuclear waste, the Skull Valley band of Goshutes, barely 100 strong, is inviting the country's radioactive spent fuel rods onto its small and barren reservation southwest of Salt Lake City.
Taking in the nuclear trash could create an annuity for members of the tribe.
Although Utah hasn't explicitly conceded that the tribe can legally store the waste, the governor and the Legislature have chosen to point their efforts at the transportation of radioactive material over public lands rather than challenge outright what the Goshutes can do on their reservation.
Neighbors, meantime, feel frustrated.
``It's tough fighting somebody like the Goshutes who have that authority,'' said Chip Ward of nearby Grantsville, Utah.
So often, reservations appeared all but worthless until oil or some other bonanza was discovered.
Today, sovereignty and the power to govern a patch of land is the great find.
Consider the Coeur d'Alene tribe in northern Idaho and the lake that bears its name.
Treaties made between the tribe and federal government in 1887 and 1889 reduced the reservation's boundaries but granted the lake to the Coeur d'Alenes.
When Idaho was admitted to the union in 1890, however, it became entitled to the Constitution's promise that new states are granted all the beds, banks and waters of navigable lakes or rivers within their boundaries.
Congress didn't get around to ratifying the 1887 and 1889 treaties until 1891, a year after Idaho became a state.
To complicate things further, a presidential executive order in 1873 promised the lake to tribes, but that action never sought or gained congressional approval.
So far the Supreme Court has said that the northern two-thirds of the lake belongs to Idaho, but the tribe is still pressing a claim on the southern third.
Why does it matter?
``If the tribe owns a portion of the lake, you could have competing water quality standards, disputes over fishing seasons, questions over easements for docks and power lines,'' said Clive Strong of the Idaho attorney general's office.
Likewise, logs floated to sawmills would need to pass through tribe-controlled water.
The tribe, meantime, jealously defends the exercise of sovereignty it credits for turning around the prospects of its members in recent years.
Five years ago, before the Coeur d'Alene tribe opened a casino, unemployment among its 1,600 members was nearly 65 percent.
Now, despite legal challenges from attorneys general in Missouri and other states, the tribe is operating an on-line worldwide lottery at http:
PEACH SPRINGS, Ariz.
(AP) - When American Indians began embracing gambling as an economic development tool in the 1990s, the Hualapai tribe in northern Arizona moved quickly to open a casino at its Grand Canyon West tourist site.
Tribal leaders figured that slot machines would provide new revenue for the tribe's 1,200 members, many of whom have lived in poverty for years.
But they forgot that most of the 100,000 visitors to Grand Canyon West each year come directly from Las Vegas.
''Those people weren't coming to a casino,'' said Louise Benson, tribal chairman.
''They were coming to see the Grand Canyon''.
Less than a year after opening the casino, the Hualapai shut it down.
Instead of providing an economic boom to tribal members, it left them $1 million in debt.
''There were high hopes for that casino, but the reality of it was that we were too isolated,'' said Alex Cabillo, the tribe's director of public works.
The Hualapai tribe is one of only two whose casinos failed during the Indian gambling boom of the past decade, when revenues exploded from $100 million in 1988 to $8.26 billion in 1998.
But an Associated Press computer analysis of federal unemployment, poverty and public assistance records indicates that the vast majority of American Indians, like the Hualapai, have not realized the early ''high hopes'' of the casino boom.
Two-thirds of the American Indian population belong to poverty-stricken tribes that still don't have Las Vegas-style casinos.
Some, like the Navajo, culturally oppose gambling, while others, like the Hualapai, are too far away from major population centers to benefit.
Among the 130 tribes with Las Vegas-style casinos, those near major cities have thrived, while most others have little left after paying the bills, the AP analysis found.
Despite new gambling jobs, unemployment on reservations with established casinos held steady around 54 percent between 1991 and 1997, according to data the tribes reported to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Many of the casino jobs were filled with non-Indians.
''Everybody thinks that tribes are getting rich from gaming and very few of them are,'' Benson said.
Of the 500,000 Indians whose tribes operate casinos, only about 80,000 belong to tribes with gambling operations that generate more than $100 million a year.
Some of the 23 tribes with the most successful casinos - like the Shakopee Mdewakanton Dakota Tribe in Minnesota - pay each member hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
In Scott County, which includes the Shakopee reservation south of Minneapolis, the poverty rate declined from 4.1 percent in 1989 to 3.5 percent six years later.
The reservation's unemployment rate also plummeted from 70 percent in 1991 to just 4 percent in 1997.
Such success stories belong mostly to tribes with casinos near major population centers.
The tiny Mashantucket Pequot tribe of Connecticut reported more than $300 million in revenue in the first five months of this year from its Foxwoods Casino, located between New York and Boston.
And the Seminole Tribe's Hollywood Gaming Center on Miami's Gold Coast generates more than $100 million a year with pull-tab slot machines.
The unemployment rate on that reservation, however, still was 45 percent in 1997, and the average poverty rate in the two counties it touches rose from 10.4 percent in 1989 to 12.1 percent in 1995.
For many tribes with Las Vegas-style casinos, like the San Carlos Apaches in eastern Arizona, gambling revenues pay for casino operations and debt service, with little left to upgrade the quality of life.
In counties that include reservations with casinos, the average poverty rate declined only slightly between 1989 and 1995, from 17.7 percent to 15.5 percent, the AP analysis founds.
Counties that include reservations without casinos saw their poverty rate remain steady at slightly more than 18 percent.
Nationally, the poverty rate hovered around 13 percent during the period.
In California, the Tachi Yokut Tribe in the San Joaquin Valley brags on its Web site that its Palace Gaming Center has provided employment for tribal members, helped raise education levels and upgraded housing.
But the poverty rate in Kings County, which includes the tribe's small reservation, climbed from 18.2 percent in 1989 to 22.3 percent in 1995.
The reservation's unemployment rate dropped slightly to 49.2 percent in 1997.
Jonathan Taylor, a research fellow at the Harvard University Project on American Indian Economic Development, said many investments gaming tribes have made in social and economic infrastructure don't translate into immediate improvements in quality-of-life indicators like poverty.
''You see investments arising out of gaming taking hold slowly in greater educational success, greater family integrity, greater personal health, greater crime prevention,'' he said.
There are some optimistic signs that tribes hope to build on as they begin paying off their casino construction loans.
The analysis indicates casino gambling has slowed, though not reversed, the growth of tribal members on public assistance.
Participation in the Agriculture Department's Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations increased 8.2 percent from 1990 to 1997 among tribes with casinos, compared with 57.3 percent among tribes without them.
And economic development has been spurred in communities near tribal casinos, according to an analysis of the Census Bureau's County Business Patterns for 1990 and 1997.
The Oneida Indian Nation in central New York, for example, has become the largest employer in Oneida and Madison counties, thanks to a casino that's generating more than $100 million in annual revenues.
A championship golf course and convention center are under construction.
But overall, the new jobs have not reduced unemployment for Indians.
Tribes with established casinos saw their overall unemployment rate actually rise four-tenths of a point to 54.4 percent between 1991 and 1997, the AP analysis found.
Jacob Coin, former executive director of the National Indian Gaming Association, said that's because 75 percent of jobs in tribal casinos are held by non-Indians.
At the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation along the California-Arizona-Nevada border, the unemployment rate climbed from 27.2 percent in 1991 to 74.2 percent in 1997.
Tribal administrator Gary Goforth acknowledged few of the 675 jobs at the tribe's two financially troubled casinos are filled by tribal members.
''Not everybody wants to be a dealer, or a housekeeper or even a manager in the restaurant,'' he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to get a more accurate count of the country's American Indian population, the Census Bureau is turning to tribal leaders and residents on reservations to help overcome long-standing feelings of wariness or anger toward the federal government.
The relationship hasn't been stress-free, tribal leaders say, but there has been marked improvement from 1990, when Census officials estimate it missed about 4.5 percent of the American Indian population.
The national undercount rate was 1.6 percent.
For instance, on the 17 million-acre Navajo Nation reservation that sprawls across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, about one in eight Navajos were not counted in 1990.
The tribe is determined not to let that happen again.
''We've created an alliance with the Census Bureau where the Navajo nation has profound control over the count, by way of hiring our own Navajo people to go out and enumerate, and the maps for enumeration were created by Navajo chapters,'' said Mellor Willie, spokesman for tribal president Kelsey Begaye.
More alarming to the National Congress of American Indians governmental affairs director Jack Jackson, Jr.
is that an estimated 12.2 percent of all Indians living on reservations were missed.
Part of the problem in Navajo country and other reservations was that census workers in 1990 were relying on outdated maps, and may have been unaware of tribal customs, Jackson said.
The Navajo government estimates there are about 250,000 Navajos today.
Willie said the Navajos missed out on $110 million in federal funding in the 1990s because of the undercount.
''I don't think a lot of Navajo people within the last census count knew this was helping in their communities,'' Willie said.
To counter that, the Census Bureau sought more input from tribal governments five years ago, said Tom Beavers, partnership specialist for the regional census center in Kansas City, Mo.
''When we hire now, we want to hire people who live in their own communities to work in their own communities, and we have told Indian leaders in our communities that,'' said Beavers, himself an American Indian, who in his job works with tribes in Oklahoma and Minnesota.
Federal programs distributed to American Indians based on census data include the Native American Employment and Training Programs, grants to local education agencies for Indian education, and family violence prevention and services.
Not everything has gone smoothly though.
Earlier this month, leaders on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana threatened to arrest census workers after complaints that local census managers failed to keep him informed of hiring decisions and other business on the reservation.
The order has since been rescinded.
Others like Brenda Boyd, census liaison for the Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa in Onamia, Minn.
, complain that at times, there is too much red tape in getting simple answers from regional census officials.
Everyone agrees, though, that they are better off than in 1990.
''This census is much better,'' Boyd said.
''Last time, the count was way off''.

HIGHLAND, Calif.
_ A century after Indian wars roiled the West, another battle is raging here over a ballot measure that would expand the state's $1.4 billion Indian gambling industry.
It pits California's gaming tribes against an unlikely coalition of Nevada casinos, unions, church groups and other businesses in what may become the most expensive fight in California political history.
A visit to the San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino on a patch of tribal land 60 miles east of Los Angeles makes the stakes clear.
The afternoon sun is still high, but the parking lot is filling fast, and inside the smoky 90,000-square-foot gambling hall, the hopeful already sit glued to most of the 1,000 video slot machines and to row after row of bingo tables.
This 24-hour no-frills casino is an economic miracle for the tiny San Manuel tribe, which once scratched out an income raising apricots and lived in shacks and trailers on a dusty 648-acre reservation.
Now, 40 landscaped houses dot the hillsides behind the casino's walls, and security officers on bicycles patrol newly paved roads.
But the San Manuel Indians have a problem: They and about 40 other tribes began installing slot machines over the last decade without first reaching compacts with the state, as required by federal law.
So Gov.
Pete Wilson and federal prosecutors consider their casinos illegal and have moved to shut them down.
In response, the gaming tribes are sponsoring a hotly contested ballot measure in the Nov.
3 election that would allow broad expansion of casino-style gaming on Indian lands statewide.
In a potent illustration of the power of gambling money in politics, it seems likely to set a new record for spending on a ballot initiative here.
Already, the two sides have raised at least $60 million and spent about $53 million, mostly for a barrage of competing television commercials.
About $43 million has been raised by tribes, $22 million of it from the San Manuel tribe alone, while opponents, led by the casino operators at Hilton Hotels Corp.
and Mirage Resorts Inc.
, who fear untaxed Indian competition, have raised $15.5 million and spent $1 million more.
The previous spending record for a single measure was $57.5 million on a securities fraud proposal two years ago; $84 million was spent on a group of competing insurance reform measures in 1988.
Public polls have shown the gambling measure, Proposition 5, winning majority, but not overwhelming, support among voters, many of whom are sympathetic to decades of Indian privation in a state that paid bounties for Indian body parts in the 1850s.
The gaming tribes contend that nothing less than their historic sovereignty and economic survival is at stake, and their advertisements feature members attesting that Indian gaming has broken the cycle of poverty.
``This is our livelihood,'' said Ken Ramirez, 38, vice-chairman of the San Manuel tribe, who grew up on the reservation when it held only a handful of families, with water too fetid to drink.
He declined to disclose the tribe's revenues from gaming, but noted that about 110 people now live on the reservation, where, with gambling proceeds, the tribe has drilled 16 deep wells and plans to market bottled water commercially.
But opponents of Proposition 5 accuse the gaming tribes of scare tactics.
They say the tribes' campaign exaggerates the threat to Indian welfare and obscures the real menace of a measure that would allow the spread of gambling throughout the state, divert business from privately operated theme parks, racetracks and card rooms and yet provide few economic benefits over all, because Indian casinos pay no taxes on their profits, though gamblers pay income taxes on their winnings.
``Frankly, I think it's an incredible con game,'' said Frank Schubert, who is managing the ``No on 5'' campaign for the Coalition Against Unregulated Gambling, which has run ads in which a jogging couple is stunned by a volcanic eruption of garish casino signs in their neighborhood.
``We've had millions and millions in TV ads bombarding the state for months now about reservations getting electricity and being able to be linoleum on a dirt floor, when in fact it's a handful of tribes spending a fortune to keep a special deal''.
About one-third of the 557 Indian tribes around the nation, including tribes in Connecticut, Minnesota and Wisconsin, now offer some form of gambling.
The 1988 federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act affirmed tribes' rights to offer bingo, and, subject to negotiated compacts with individual states, slot machine games.
But some governors have complained about vagaries in the law and Congress has debated making clarifications.
In other states where Indians are either seeking gambling compacts or negotiating the renewal of existing ones, the California debate is being closely watched.

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn ``From a national perspective, many states and tribes have already resolved this,'' said John Dossett, general counsel of the National Congress of American Indians in Washington, which represents 250 tribes.
``If this issue were to be resolved in California, there'd be less pressure in Congress''.
But resolution here seems unlikely any time soon.
Opponents of Proposition 5 warn that if it passes, it will immediately be tied up in years of litigation, and could well violate the California State Constitution's ban on ``Nevada or New Jersey-type casinos''.
``We're in for a long battle here instead of a politically negotiated solution in which both sides say, `Let's make this work,''' said Cathy Christian, counsel to the Coalition Against Unregulated Gambling.
The gaming tribes say they are prepared to fight.
They complain that they have been caught in an impossible situation because, eager for revenue, they began offering gambling while their right to do so was still being litigated.
Since then Wilson, a Republican and a foe of gambling in general, has refused to negotiate a compact with any tribe that was already gambling.
``Without Proposition 5, the gaming that currently exists on Indian lands in California could be taken away from the tribes,'' said Waltona Manion, a spokeswoman for the tribal alliance known as Californians for Indian Self-Reliance.
``Why remove something that's working, and that's proven to have taken these tribes off of welfare dependency and put them on the road to self-sufficiency''?
But Wilson has offered a clear alternative.
Last spring, he reached an agreement with the Pala Band of Mission Indians in San Diego County that would allow a new form of video slot machine but outlaw those now used by gambling tribes.
In the months since, 10 more tribes, some of them under threat of federal action, have signed the Pala compact, which limits each tribe to 199 of the new machines but allows them to lease rights for unused machines to other tribes, up to a maximum of 990 for any tribe, with a statewide cap of 19,900.
The State Legislature ratified the agreements in August.
Most of the gaming tribes contend that Wilson, who is barred from seeking a third term this year, refused to negotiate in good faith, as required by the 1988 federal law.
So Proposition 5 leaves little to chance, flatly requiring the state to grant a compact allowing slot machines in perpetuity for any tribe that wanted them, though, as is now the case, the measure would only allow games in which players bet against a pool of other players' money, not against the casino house itself, as in Las Vegas and Atlantic City.
Opponents of the measure contend that it is not needed to protect Indian gambling, and to hammer home the point, they are now running television advertisements featuring Paula Lorenzo, head of the Rumsey Band of Wintun Indians, which signed the Pala compact and is expanding its Cache Creek Casino 45 miles northwest of Sacramento.
``We're doing all this without Prop.
5,'' Ms.
Lorenzo says in the 30-second commercial as she walks through the construction site.
``No tribe needs Prop.
5 to operate casinos''.
For their part, supporters of the measure have accused their fellow tribes of being turncoats recruited by ``the big Nevada casinos,'' to oppose the proposition, in an echo of internecine betrayals of the past.
At the San Manuel Casino, which draws 3,000 to 4,000 gamblers a day and where the card dealers now wear bold ``No on 5'' T-shirts, players said they supported the measure.
``What's going to happen to these people if Proposition 5 doesn't go through''? asked Ruth Kennedy, a retired nurse who comes every day to play bingo and the slots from late afternoon until the wee hours of the morning, and who once won a $40,000 jackpot.
``Why is Vegas and them so upset with the Indian halls?
You can't tell me this place doesn't do things for the community''.
In fact, according to Steven Lengel, the casino's customer services director, it sponsors a range of school and community programs in Highland and the neighboring towns of San Bernardino and Redlands, and its uniformed security force of 250 is bigger than those of the three local cities combined.
It sells no alcohol, allows none on the premises and employs more than 1,400 people, the vast majority of them local residents.
But opponents of the measure, including the California Labor Federation AFL-CIO and the United Farm Workers, complain that it would exempt the Indian casinos from environmental and worker health and safety laws, and calls for distributing a maximum of 2 percent of the winnings from casinos with more than 400 gambling machines to non-gaming tribes.
``This idea that they're somehow spending all of their money to help their poor brothers is just not true,'' Ms.
Christian said. &QL;
ETHETE, Wyo.
_ In the face of cutbacks brought about by the overhaul of welfare programs, members of the Northern Arapaho Tribe on the Wind River Reservation have started a seven-acre community garden with donated land, seeds and equipment to grow vegetables for themselves and for the elderly and disabled who cannot work.
``We were concerned that when time runs out, when they are no longer eligible for government assistance, what are they going to do for food''? said Glen Revere, a nutritionist with the Indian Health Services on the 2.8 million-acre Wind River Reservation, about 100 miles east of Jackson, Wyo.
``Then we came up with the idea for this community garden, and it's been bigger than we ever expected in so many ways''.
At the all-volunteer garden, this is the time of year when potatoes grow larger than a man's fist, popping out of the soil, and five-foot-high cornstalks develop ears with red, yellow and white kernels ripening inside.
The conditions on these wide plains near the Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains can be harsh, with high winds, late springs and early autumns limit the growing season to 90 days.
Revere's partner in this effort is Irene Houser, director of the Northern Arapaho Tribe Community Services, who has distributed produce around the Wind River Reservation and to the Pine Ridge Reservation in southwestern South Dakota.
Ms. Houser, a member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, said people were stunned when she brought them bushels of potatoes, onions, squash, zucchini, tomatoes, beets, radishes and other vegetables.
``They asked, `How much are you going to charge me for this'''? she recalled.
``I said, `It's free,' and they were so happy.
Many of them didn't have food in their house when I showed up''.
Mark Soldierwolf, a 70-year-old father of nine and grandfather of nine, said: ``That food lasted us about six weeks.
We dried some things, boiled some.
Just ate all of it''.
Soldierwolf, a Northern Arapaho who served with the Marines in World War II and the Korean War, lives with his wife, Florita, one daughter and one grandchild.
They receive food stamps for a $300-a-month budget for the four of them, but they said they often fed members of their family who stopped by.
Soldierwolf estimated they saved $70 with the free vegetables.
Soldierwolf's family represents the problems that plague many of the 1.3 million American Indians who live on reservations, of whom 49 percent are unemployed.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates that at least half the American Indian population lives in poverty.
Soldierwolf said all but one of his adult children were unemployed.
``If you can make it to the end of the month, you're all right,'' Soldierwolf said, referring to the monthly food stamps.
``It's worse than in the Depression''.
Mrs. Soldierwolf nodded, with tears in her eyes.
The Wyoming Department of Family Services says the Northern Arapaho on the reservation account for 18.9 percent of all welfare cases in Wyoming.
The reservation population of 12,000 _ including 6,000 Northern Arapaho tribal members, about 3,000 Shoshone tribal members and 3,000 from other tribes _ represents about 2.5 percent of the state's population of 480,000.
Revere and Ms.
Houser say the community garden can help reduce dependence on welfare by enabling residents to produce cash crops, traditional Indian plants to be sold on or off the reservation.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) On the Crow Reservation in Montana, at a five-acre garden to be planted this fall, the plan is to let people's work part at the garden count toward fulfillment of their welfare community service requirement.
``We are trying to provide people with skills that they can use here or take with them,'' said Charlene Johnson, a Crow tribal member and nutritionist with Indian Health Services.
``Indians are not horticulturists.
They were hunters and gatherers who were forced to garden when they were put on the reservations.
There is a lack of knowledge about how to plant and water crops''.
In Ethete (pronounced EE-tha-tee), the school is adding horticulture to its natural science curriculum, and students take field trips to the community garden for hands-on experience growing their own food.
Howard Lujan, a father of four, used seeds Ms.
Houser gave him to grow ceremonial Indian corn in a little garden on the side of his house.
``I will give this corn to anyone who wants some, because it is part of our religion,'' he said.
Lujan, an Arapaho tribal member, said he would use all parts of the corn, including the husk to wrap tamales he plans to make the staple of a catering business he is starting.
He is also growing pumpkins, onions and cucumbers.
``I'm pretty sure we're going to save a lot of money this year with what we've grown,'' he said. &QL;
NEW YORK _ Nancy Smith, 28, croaks about the cold weather with a smoked-out voice.
Dressed in a sweatshirt and jeans, her puffy eyes tell a story of chronic alcoholism, an all-too-common syndrome among Native Americans like her.
After returning from a cigarette break in sub-zero temperatures, Smith flops down on a couch, curls herself into a ball and falls asleep.
One of New York City's homeless, she has come for the treatment of her drinking problem.
Smith and thousands like her are seeking help for their substance abuse at the American Indian Community House, the largest of a handful of Native American cultural institutions in the New York area.
``Where else can I go for help''? she asks.
``Any place else, they don't understand you like they do here''.
Native Americans around the country are leaving reservations and relocating in urban areas at a dizzying rate.
With economic opportunities on reservations lagging behind those available in big cities, and with the unemployment rate among Native Americans at three times the national average, thousands of poor, often unskilled Native Americans are rushing off their reservations.
Many find their new urban locales strange and forbidding and often turn to drugs and alcohol.
Nearly 46,000 Native Americans live in the New York City metropolitan area.
Of that number, nearly 7,000 come to the Community House each year for drug and alcohol rehabilitation, health counseling or for job training, according to Rosemary Richmond, executive director.
This is up from around 3,000 just seven years ago.
With the vast majority of its $1.5 million annual budget, mostly federal funds, going to substance abuse treatment and job training, the Community House finds itself at risk of losing the attendance of those in need of cultural support.
As a result, some urban Native Americans feel driven away.
Richmond and her 30-member staff have been inundated with work, but less and less of it involves cultural activities.
``I used to go there all the time and hang out, meet new people,'' says Carlos Rodriguez, 48, a Navajo who works as a librarian at Columbia University.
``Now most of the people there have drug problems, so they don't even let you in without an appointment''.
The Community House, established in 1969, relies on volunteers like Rodriguez to participate in rallies, organize religious events and educate the public about Native American culture.
In recent years, problems of illiteracy and addiction have become the major part of the organization's workload.
The social problems faced by Richmond and her staff are not unique to New York City.
From 1980 to 2000, the urban Native American population has more than doubled.
With this drastic increase came a surge in urban Native Americans in need of substance abuse treatment.
In 1980, approximately 4,000 Native Americans sought treatment for substance abuse in the San Francisco area, according to the Indian Health Service, a branch of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services.
Today, that number has more than doubled, to 9,200.
In Seattle over the same period, addiction cases rose from 3,500 to 7,300.
Over all, the rate of substance abuse among Native American adults is over 20 percent nationwide.
And the migration from the reservations continues.
``Mostly, it's economics,'' says Joanne Dunne, a spokeswoman for the Boston Indian Council, a nonprofit cultural group.
``The reservation typically doesn't provide you with any real opportunities''.
Also, many Native Americans travel between the reservation and urban areas.
``Some tribes traditionally go from one place to another,'' says Dunne.
``The Micmacs always crossed the border from Canada to come from time immemorial''.
In other cities, city and state governments have created agencies to specifically deal with the Native American population.
In Detroit, for example, the municipal government runs the Detroit American Indian Health Center, while the state of Michigan runs the Bureau of Urban Indian Affairs.
``There's also American Indian Health, which is nonprofit and state supported,'' adds Alycia Atkinson, an administrator at Urban Indian Affairs.
``They do youth programs, alcohol, tobacco and drug intervention, and other health services.
Then there's American Indian Services, which does mental health, and also has a youth program, and they're run by the city.
And the state also supports the National American Indian Association here''.
As the state and city governments slice up their services, Detroit Native Americans, already a small group at 20,000, find themselves without a cultural or political center.
In Boston, at Dunne's Boston Indian Council, attendance lags because it does not provide substance abuse treatment, legal services or on-site training programs.
Still, it creates a sense of community among members of 36 tribes from all over the nation.
``Indians are drawn together the same way as everyone else,'' she explains.
``You look for people who look like you''.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- American Indian reservations would get an infusion of $1.2 billion in federal money for education, health care and law enforcement under President Clinton's proposed 2001 budget, a White House aide said.
Lynn Cutler, the president's top adviser on Indian issues, said it's the largest spending increase ever sought for Indians and includes new or expanded programs in nearly all federal agencies.
``It's important that we get every agency of the federal government thinking about Indians and employing Indian people,'' Cutler said Tuesday, one day after she outlined the plan to tribal leaders at a meeting of the United South and Eastern Tribes, which represents 23 tribes from Maine to Texas.
Clinton announced the spending initiative in his State of the Union address last week, but did not mention any specifics.
Those will be included in his 2001 budget proposal, to be announced next week.
Among the spending Clinton will seek: $300 million to build at least six new reservation schools, a $117 million increase for reservation road repairs, about $300 million more for the Indian Health Service and $103 million added to reservation law enforcement, Cutler said.
The head of the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, the main agency funding tribal governments, said the extra money is welcome but won't address all the problems.
``In all, I don't think it's anything to have a party over, because the needs in Indian Country are so great,'' said Kevin Gover, a Pawnee who Clinton picked to head the BIA in 1997.
Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the only American Indian in the Senate and chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, also was skeptical.
``Senator Campbell hates to look a gift horse in the mouth, but he does wonder why it's taken eight budgets for the president to get around to taking a look at Indian Country,'' said Chris Changery, a spokesman for the Colorado Republican.
The extra money for reservation roads will put only a tiny dent in the estimated $4 billion backlog of needed repairs.
And, according to an Interior Department report issued last year, $1.2 billion is needed to repair or replace 170 Indian schools.
``I know half-a-dozen new schools is a drop in the bucket, but at least it's a drop,'' Cutler said.
Reservations are home to some of the gravest poverty and worst health care in the country.
The unemployment rate on reservations is about 10 times the national average and only about two-thirds of Indian adults have a high school diploma, compared to three-quarters of the general population.
The Indian Health Service reports the Indian death rate is 35 times higher than the rest of the population.
Clinton will ask Congress for $13 million in new aid to the 31 tribal colleges, Cutler said.
The colleges, which serve 26,000 students in 12 states, are a vital part of efforts to improve education and economic opportunities on reservations, she said.
A report to be released today says tribal colleges have created jobs and helped increase education levels on the reservations where they operate.
The report from the Institute for Higher Education Policy and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium said median incomes for women on reservations with tribal colleges rose 49 percent faster between 1980 and 1990 than for women on reservations without colleges.
Cutler said other details of Clinton's proposal include: -- $6 million for training teachers to serve schools with large numbers of Indian students.
-- $5 million for training Indians as school administrators.
-- $5 million for a Treasury Department program aimed at attracting companies to reservation areas.
PINE RIDGE, S.D.
(AP) -- President Clinton turned the attention of his national poverty tour today to arguably the poorest, most forgotten U.S. citizens of them all: American Indians.
Clinton was going to the Pine Ridge Reservation for a visit with the Oglala Sioux nation and to participate in a conference on Native American homeownership and economic development.
He also was touring a housing facility and signing a pact with Oglala leaders establishing an empowerment zone for Pine Ridge.
But the main purpose of the visit -- the first to a reservation by a president since Franklin Roosevelt -- was simply to pay attention to American Indians, who are so raked by grinding poverty that Clinton's own advisers suggested he come up with special proposals geared specifically to the Indians' plight.
At Pine Ridge, a scrolling marquee at Big Bat's Texaco expressed both joy over Clinton's visit and wariness of all the official attention: ``Welcome President Clinton.
Remember Our Treaties,'' the sign read.
According to statistics from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, there are 1.43 million Indians living on or near reservations.
Roughly 33 percent of them are children younger than 15, and 38 percent of Indian children aged 6 to 11 live in poverty, compared with 18 percent for U.S. children of all other races combined.
Aside from that, only 63 percent of Indians are high school graduates.
Twenty-nine percent are homeless, and 59 percent live in substandard housing.
Twenty percent of Indian households on reservations do not have full access to plumbing, and the majority -- 53.4 percent -- do not have telephones.
The per capita income for Indians is $21,619, one-third less than the national per capita income of $35,225.
An estimated 50 percent of American Indians are unemployed, and at Pine Ridge the problem is even more chronic -- 73 percent of the people do not have jobs.
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who visited the reservation last August, said Pine Ridge is a metaphor for the poverty tour, for it sits in Shannon County, the poorest census tract in the nation.
``This is generations of poverty on the Pine Ridge reservation, with very, very little progress,'' Cuomo said.
``We didn't get into this situation in a couple of weeks and we're not going to get out of it in a couple of weeks.
It's going to take years''.
To begin addressing the housing problem, Clinton was announcing a partnership between the Treasury Department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, tribal governments and mortgage companies to help 1,000 Indians become homeowners over the next three years -- a small number that nonetheless would double the number of government-insured home mortgages issued on tribal lands.
Under the effort, ``one-stop mortgage centers'' would be opened at Pine Ridge and on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona to help streamline the mortgage lending process.
Cuomo said special steps were needed to help Indians create and own houses because the nature of the land on which they live effectively shuts them out of conventional home loan processes.
``The land is held in trust.
The bank doesn't want to take it as collateral because it's in trust,'' Cuomo said.
``So the main asset on the reservation -- the land -- can't even be used''.
Also, two of the country's largest municipal securities underwriters, Banc One Capital Markets and George K.
Baum &AMP; Co.
, were committing to underwriting $300 million in bonds annually for five years to create a market for reservation mortgages.
Those bonds would help raise $1.5 billion that could then be lent to tribes, tribal housing authorities and individuals for buying homes.
The announcement was part of Clinton's four-day, cross-country tour to highlight the ``untapped markets'' in America's inner cities and rural areas.
NEAH BAY, Wash.
_ Micah McCarty rises with the sun and slips into the chilly waters of Waatch River, just upstream from the untamed edge of the Pacific Northwest.
With each stroke, he mimics the movement of the whale he hopes to slay this fall with a hand-carved wooden harpoon.
And he prays that the gray whale will be ``a kind brother or sister''.
McCarty is preparing himself for the Makah tribe's first whale hunt in more than seven decades.
He hopes it will renew the Olympic Peninsula tribe's spirit and traditions.
Opponents call the hunt butchery, saying it has no place in a modern world where whales are protected by international law.
McCarty wants to be the ``chosen one''.
The harpooner will stand in a dugout canoe, steady himself against 10-foot Pacific swells, heft the barbed lance, take aim and plunge it into the back of a 38-foot leviathan.
The kill will be a sacred moment for the Makah, honoring the great whale.
But the eight men in the canoe _ keepers of a ritual dating back at least 100 generations _ will be encircled by an armada of outraged animal rights activists, a swarm of international media and a thin phalanx of security.
The hunt's notoriety stems from a controversial decision by the International Whaling Commission that granted the Makah the right to kill up to 20 whales through 2002.
Animal rights activists fear the hunt will spark a wholesale return to commercial whaling, presently banned by the commission.
But as the 27-year-old McCarty runs barefoot along Hobuck Beach, he does not think about the global forces aligned against the 1,800 people living in his fishing village.
Instead, he meditates and prays to make his spirit pure to receive the whale, ``an honored guest of the village''.
He anchors his feet in the sand of the beach and heaves hunks of driftwood in hopes of being chosen the harpooner.
McCarty is one of 16 men selected by Makah families to compete for eight spots on the first tribal whaling crew since the 1920s.
He feels the excitement building on this 44-square-mile reservation of heavily logged rain forest and spectacular wilderness beach located at the extreme northwest tip of the contiguous United States.
The return to whaling will be a sort of homecoming for the Makah, whose real name _ which cannot be written in English _ means ``people who live by the rocks and the seagulls''.
McCarty comes from a long line of whalers.
His grandfather and great-grandfather participated in the last hunts before whaling was suspended, because gray whales had been stalked almost to extinction by non-Indian whalers.
McCarty's father, John, until recently was executive director of the tribe's whaling commission.
After graduating from high school in Olympia, Micah McCarty came home to Neah Bay and immersed himself in the maritime life, working with his father as a commercial fisherman.
``It became a passionate connection with the waters my ancestors plied,'' McCarty said.
Like the Makah whalers before him, McCarty prepares by purifying himself in frigid streams such as the Waatch River.
``We look upon the water as its own being,'' he said.
While bathing, McCarty said he ``thinks about the whale moving gracefully through the water, and I swim as gracefully as I can.
... And I pray that our whale crew will be one mind, one body, one spirit''.
Historically, secrecy guarded every aspect of Makah whaling from the hunt to the communal butchering and feasting, according to anthropological texts.
Tribal members today remain guarded about saying too much about the hunt to outsiders.
``It is usually taboo to even talk about,'' McCarty said.
``Usually, you just prepare yourself and go whaling''.
McCarty, like his father and the rest of the tribe, is acutely aware of the international controversy surrounding this fall's hunt.
``In this day and age, it's important to say something about it,'' McCarty said.
To illustrate that whaling still defines the fabric of Makah life, McCarty shares a few words from sacred whaling songs that have been passed down from generation to generation and are still sung today.
One song says ``my canoe travels with killer whales as an escort,'' and another says ``my canoe travels with lightning''.
``I might get in trouble for telling you that, but it's not a direct translation,'' he said.
McCarty said he has wanted to hunt whales for a long time, long before they became news to the outside world.
An accomplished carver whose art is sold at a shop called Tribes in Fremont, McCarty frequently creates masks that call upon spirits related to whaling and the sea.
``As I learned about our oral history, some of the songs and dances we do, my artwork took on more meaning about who we are and where we come from''.
The other whalers said McCarty and crew member Darrell Markishtum frequently lead them in ancient paddle songs as they practice stealth and speed in the red and black dugout canoe called the Hummingbird.
``The songs keep your mind off the pain'' of paddling for hours, said Don Swan, a powerfully built man who, like McCarty, would like to be the ``chosen one'' to heft the harpoon.
Neah Bay, like many other Native American communities, is struggling with unemployment rates often exceeding 50 percent, deep poverty and the problems of crime, drug and alcohol abuse and domestic violence.
McCarty hopes the return to whaling will provide inspiration and a new focus for the community.
``It is a sacred way of life that sets an honorable example,'' he said.
Whaling ``involves so much concentration, so much preparation, that anyone who was involved in that lifestyle (substance abuse or violence) would have to drop it''.
On a rare sunny spring day, McCarty and seven other members of the crew boarded the 34-foot Hummingbird for paddle practice.
A motorized chase boat skippered by whale commissioner Arnie Hunter trailed the canoe.
Nine-year-old Eric Johnson Jr.
sat near Hunter and stared at his dad paddling in the stern.
In the background, a fog horn on Waadah Island played a haunting, two-note tune.
Eric would like to be a whaler someday.
``Yeah, I'm thinking about getting some barbells with 10-pound weights,'' he said, becoming very serious.
``I think I would want to be the harpooner.
If you're the harpooner, you have to have a lot of strength so you can stick it in the whale''.
``I really want to take after my ancestors,'' said Eric, one small example of how whaling may infuse a new generation of Makah with the old values that existed before anyone had heard of unemployment or Jim Beam.
Arnie Hunter let up on the throttle and the canoe came alongside.
The men passed little Eric between boats.
As he scrambled into the bow of the dugout canoe, a luminous smile transformed his serious face.
Sitting a couple of feet from Eric was Wayne Johnson cradling a.50-caliber military rifle designed to penetrate armor.
It will deliver the coupe de grace once the whale is harpooned, explained Johnson, hefting the weapon.
The rifle is one of the concessions to the 20th century made by the Makah.
The International Whaling Commission insists on a quick kill.
Says McCarty: ``They want us to do a humane kill.
That necessitates a quick and efficient method of ushering the whale to the next world.
I believe it to be an honorable alteration to a sacred way of life''.
But Makah elder Alberta Thompson disapproves not only of the gun, but also of the hunt itself.
``What are we building our culture on by going after something we don't want to eat''? she asked.
That a few elders in the Neah Bay community have publicly opposed the tribe's return to whaling has been used by opponents of the hunt in an attempt to discredit the tribal leadership as not representing the will of the people.
But people in Neah Bay point out that Native American communities do not have a single, monolithic viewpoint any more than other communities.
John McCarty also notes that in December's tribal council election, two men who support resurrecting whaling _ Ben Johnson Jr.
and Keith Johnson _ were voted into office.
But resurrecting whaling skills that have been dormant for more than 70 years is a daunting challenge.
So the Makah are turning for advice to other indigenous whalers.
Several members of the Makah Whaling Commission and whaling crew traveled this winter to Barrow, Alaska, for the native whaling captains convention.
They attended seminars on topics such as effective kill techniques used by the few indigenous tribes still allowed to hunt by the International Whaling Commission.
The tribe is also considering sending a couple of Makah women to Alaska to learn recipes for preparing whale meat and blubber, said Keith Johnson, president of the tribal whaling commission.
The whaling crew members are also training together.
They run together on the beach and take communal sweats in a lodge they built behind Arnie Hunter's trailer.
The young men are learning to function as a team, said rifleman Wayne Johnson.
The crew training includes paddling into the Pacific to practice ``sneaking up and backing off'' whales, said McCarty.
But many training methods will not be shared with the outside world.
For example, beginning with the first day of a new moon, the nascent whalers will do a ``special type of training,'' said McCarty.
``Four new moons prior to the hunt will be the countdown,'' said McCarty without offering further explanation.
A big part of what whaling is about for these tribal people is the bridge it creates between generations.
For example, John McCarty heard whaling stories from his father and told them to son Micah.
``In Makah Bay, they harpooned this whale, a big bull,'' said John McCarty, recounting the tale he heard from his father.
``He was big enough and strong enough that they couldn't get close enough to give him another harpoon.
He went straight out to sea (dragging the canoe by the harpoon tether).
``It was one fierce ride.
The whale was relentless; the toughest whale they had ever seen.
They looked back and Cheeka Peak was just a tiny bump.
They gave up, cut him loose, lost their harpoon and floats.
Fortunately, there was a west wind, so they set sail and headed home.
The guys were so exhausted they were laying on the bottom of the canoe''.
It is the telling of such stories across the generations that defines the Makah.
When he learned how little Eric Johnson beamed when the men passed him into the whaling canoe, Keith Johnson said: ``These are the magical moments that are happening to our youth.
How can we describe that to the world?''
LAS VEGAS _ As legalized gambling spreads, industry lines are starting to blur.
Marriages of tribal and corporate casinos, slot machines and racetracks, the Internet and everybody come at a time when the nation's gambling laws have never been murkier or more misunderstood.
State and federal lawmakers' plates are heaped with hot-potato gambling issues, and none is hotter for Congress than deciding whether to ignore, regulate or outlaw the explosion of Internet gambling.
Federal lawmakers also soon must sort out the muddled state of American Indian gambling, which has pitted tribes desperate for casino revenue against state governments resistant to gambling.
Both topics were discussed last week at the World Gaming Congress convention, along with the National Gambling Impact Study Commission report, which was issued in June.
The commission, after spending $5 million and two years researching the state of gambling in America, cooked up a casserole of 76 recommendations that ranged from criminalization of Internet gambling to the need for more research and public education.
But it did not answer the big question of whether America's infatuation with wagering had become a malignant obsession.
Instead it called for a nationwide ``pause'' in gambling expansion while states and gambling-host communities conduct their own economic- and social-impact studies and then reach their own hard decisions on whether to expand, contract or even abolish regional gambling activity.
That was hardly what the gambling industry _ or its opponents _ wanted to hear.
``People are taking whatever they want out of it to advance their own position,'' said Rick Hill, chairman of the National Indian Gaming Association, which represents 168 of the 195 U.S. tribes that offer legal casino or bingo gambling.
Even one of the commission's own members acknowledges a lack of interest by the American public and the news media.
``I think the report will disappear,'' J.
Terrence Lanni, chairman and chief executive of MGM Grand Inc.
, said last week in remarks to delegates at the international gambling industry's largest annual trade show.
But at its heart, Lanni added, the commission's work did reflect the mood of the American public _ compassion for addicted gamblers but a demand for legalized gambling.
Even if the report fades away, those paramount issues will not.
As wagering becomes ever more widespread, Congress must resolve the profound issue of Internet gambling and the politically touchy matter of tribal gambling.
More than 30 nations, mostly in the Third World, license and tax online gambling enterprises that operate through 700 sites on the World Wide Web.
The number grows almost daily.
At the moment, however, the most watched developments are in Australia, which recently permitted its states and territories to individually license and regulate sports and racetrack betting on the Internet.
U.S. gamblers are beginning to discover these legal bookies Down Under who gladly accept wagers from anywhere in the world _ seemingly daring legal retaliation from Uncle Sam.
In fact, sports book American Wagering Inc.
of Nevada holds one of the Australian licenses.
American is the only online Australian operator not accepting U.S. bets, but only because that action could jeopardize its U.S. licenses.
That doesn't bother American's CEO, Vic Salerno, who said he was convinced that his company had taken the Internet plunge in the right nation and at the right time.
And if the United States never joins the global cyber party, Salerno said, so what?
``There's enough money left out there outside of the United States,'' he said.
Robust international betting on events such as World Cup soccer, Formula I auto racing, cricket and rugby ``makes the NFL (sports books) look like child's play,'' he said.
Brian Gordon, an Australian territorial government gambling regulator, predicted at one World Gaming Congress seminar last week that Australian regulatory and consumer protection statutes would become the model as other rich nations, one by one, accept the inevitability of worldwide cyber gambling.
Meanwhile, the First World's foremost society debates whether to ban Internet gambling and almost certainly usher in a new Prohibition era _ this time featuring bootleg e-commerce sports bookies and slot machines.
Current U.S. law on gambling by ``wire'' communications was written in the 1960s, tying the hands of federal prosecutors with statutes that never imagined the legal complexities of offshore cyber casinos and bookies with toll-free phone lines, and bank accounts that can afford huge U.S. advertising budgets and platoons of silk-tie lawyers.
Sen. Jon Kyl, a Republican from Arizona, for two years has been pushing for outright prohibition of such high-tech gambling, and his Senate Bill 692 is heading toward a floor vote this fall.
House action is not expected until 2000.
Republican Sen.
Kit Bond of Missouri is a co-sponsor of the Kyl bill.
In a recent interview, Bond spokesman Dan Hubbard acknowledged the technological challenge of enforcing a nationwide ban.
``But that's no reason to throw up your hands,'' he said.
Bond has concerns about the spread of gambling that defies international boundaries.
``Most of these are based offshore,'' Hubbard said.
``You can't regulate it''.
Earlier failed versions of the Kyl bill would have made criminals of Internet casino executives and their customers.
In the latest version the public is let off the hook, as are fantasy-sports players and some pari-mutuel wagering operations.
The national commission bolstered Kyl with its own call for a ban, criminal prosecution and even diplomatic pressure from the United States on nations that ``harbor Internet gambling organizations that prey on U.S. citizens''.
The problem is enforcement.
``I have serious doubts the Internet can be controlled by the federal government,'' Lanni said.
One idea out there would make cyber-gambling police of the U.S. banking industry, whose plastic accounts are the currency of choice for many in the online betting industry.
Barring the use of U.S. credit cards for Internet wagering would certainly put a damper on casual gamblers, but such legislation could be difficult to pass and would be a nightmare for the banking industry to implement.
And for serious gamblers, there still would be many ways around a credit block _ money orders and Australian or European bank-issued credit cards, for instance.
Domestically, commercial casino companies such as Station Casinos Inc.
are aggressively positioning themselves for the cyber-gambling era by teaming up with online operators.
Indian tribes are in court fighting for the right to establish multistate bingo, lottery and casino games that offer big jackpots.
One such tribal Internet lottery case is scheduled to be argued Thursday in a Kansas City federal courtroom.
``It's so un-American to back away from a challenge,'' said Jacob L.
Coin, executive director of the tribal gaming association.
``They (in Congress) fear the Internet because they don't understand it.
So they are just going to ban it...
run and hide.
``Let's look to what Australia is doing.
Let's learn from them.
Let's find a way to benefit from it''.
Bowing to a court ruling, Congress in 1988 laid out a statutory framework allowing American Indian tribes to offer high-stakes bingo games and casino-style gambling on their historic reservation lands.
In the decade since, almost no one is satisfied with how those laws have played out.
A congressional revision of the law seems inevitable in the next year or so.
The problems are tangled ones.
Few states receive taxes or significant revenue from what has blossomed into an $8 billion-a-year industry.
The states' regulatory role is often minimal.
Worse, governors _ Kansas' Bill Graves among them _ increasingly argue that states' rights have been trampled in a headlong rush to nurture needy tribes with this ``new buffalo'' of tribal sustenance.
The tribes, meanwhile, interpret assertion of states' rights as an assault on their sovereignty as legally independent nations.
That stance irritates the commercial casino industry, which competes with the tribes but must pay taxes and conform to tight state regulation.
By and large, each tribe regulates itself in conformance with broad federal rules that demand very little public accountability.
``Native American tribes need to be a little less geared to using sovereignty to protect themselves,'' said MGM's Lanni.
``They should have to disclose information like the rest of us.
Native Americans should come into the (gaming industry) mainstream''.
Such talk also rankles.
``Tribes feel under attack,'' Coin said.
``Instead of applauding the early successes of Indian gaming, there are those who are trying to undermine it''.
The bottom line, Coin said, ``is that the quality of life on tribal reservations is improving'' solely because of gambling dollars.
Tribal law expert and Minnesota lawyer Tom Foley told World Gaming Congress delegates that Indian gambling was entering a new era.
``This is a game of politics now,'' he said.
``Tremendous dollars are at stake''.
The commercial casino industry and state officials will push Congress to level the playing field with tribal gambling.
The tribes will resist.
Coin stated the tribes' case eloquently last week in Las Vegas in remarks that defiantly recalled centuries of injustice: ``When our children are as healthy as yours, when our futures are as bright as yours, then we can talk about a level playing field.''
SPARTA, Ga.
_ By 10 o'clock on a typical summer's morning, Hancock County is almost deserted.
A few children play in overgrown backyards full of junk cars and rotting timbers, and older people fan themselves on sagging porches.
But almost anyone who works has left the county hours before, because there are virtually no jobs in Hancock.
The term ``pocket of poverty'' cannot begin to describe the overwhelming stillness of a county with no economy: the deserted roads and store aisles, the fertile old cotton fields untilled and overgrown.
Every employer of any size has left, and new ones seeking cheap land look at the county's statistics _ more than half the adults did not finish high school, seven of ten births are to unwed mothers _ and say no thanks.
Unspoken in most of those decisions is the knowledge that Hancock's population is 82 percent black, the highest percentage in Georgia and the fourth highest in the nation.
Most of Georgia is prospering now, and the state's unemployment descended to a record low of 4.1 percent last month.
But only 80 miles from Atlanta's economic turbine, the jobless rate was 10.7 percent in Hancock County, and its per capita income of $15,390 is a third less than the rest of the state.
The county's leaders have begged for projects no one else wanted: poultry processing plants, a landfill, a waste incinerator.
Everything has fallen through except for the prison the state agreed to build a few years ago outside of this crumbling county seat, cut off from the county's 9,134 residents by empty miles and a haze of razor wire.
So it was probably inevitable, given how money is spent in the South these days, that Hancock County would place its hopes for an economic future on the ultimate last resort _ an Indian gambling casino.
For the last six weeks, ever since the tiny Kialegee Indian tribe in Oklahoma expressed an interest in coming, county residents have talked of nothing else.
``It's the last chance for our county,'' said Lesley James Roberts, Hancock's special projects director, who is spending almost all his time on the casino project.
``Think about what all those tourists could do for us.
We'd have the money to restore all those antebellum homes on the old plantations, and the storefronts in town and maybe do historical re-enactments.
It would give our people a chance to become independent''.
The casino is a long way from becoming a reality.
Among other hurdles, the state and the tribe would have to negotiate a compact for a reservation, and Gov.
Roy E.
Barnes has said he was opposed to casino gambling, although the state runs a lottery.
(The federal government could approve the project if the state refuses).
But in the meantime, an instant bond has been formed between two groups of impoverished people, each of whom is relying on the other to achieve a dream of prosperity.
The Kialegees, numbering about 450, are a landless tribe, sharing space in Wetumka, Okla.
, with the much larger Creek Nation, to whom they are related.
Along with several other Creek tribes, they trace their origin to northern and central Georgia, from which they were forcibly resettled 160 years ago along the Trail of Tears.
The tribe has tried several times to build casinos elsewhere but has been rebuffed, most recently in Carroll County, Ga.
, on the Alabama border west of Atlanta.
Carroll County residents, close enough to Atlanta to benefit from its boom, said they feared crime and disruption from the casino, but the reception has been very different in Hancock.
Most residents here are descendants of slaves who once worked the plantations in the area, and Hancock is one of a string of largely black counties stretching from Virginia to East Texas known as the Black Belt.
Most of those counties are significantly more impoverished than their neighbors, even in a time of national bounty.
In May, after R.
Allen Haywood, the editor and publisher of the weekly Sparta Ishmaelite, noticed an article about Carroll County's rejection, he suggested to Hancock County officials that they contact the tribe.
Kialegee leaders were immediately interested, and received a warm reception at an overflowing town meeting here last week.
They were even more intrigued when they learned that there are several large Indian mounds in Hancock County, of unknown origin and dating back hundreds of years.
``There was an almost instant camaraderie between the tribal members and the citizens of the county,'' said Kenneth R.
Baldwin, who runs an investment group in McAlester, Okla.
, that is representing the Kialegees.
``They both have an understanding of what it means to have to struggle, to not have the opportunities you'd like to have.
The tribe felt more welcome there than anywhere else they have been''.
Residents of the county have heard all of society's warnings about gambling, and are aware that it is not always a pathway out of distress.
But they have also seen marketing studies showing that there is no other full-fledged casino in Georgia, Florida or the Carolinas, and are convinced gamblers will make their way to this nearly abandoned county once the lights flash on the proposed casino, hotel and golf course.
Considering Hancock's current situation _ in which the largest employer is its public school system _ the county's leaders say they could hardly do worse.
``This is a place where people are struggling to keep a roof over their heads and clothes on their backs,'' Roberts said.
``Our history hasn't put us in a position to be very selective about what we want.''
TOPPENISH, Wash.
(AP) -- At Tiny's Tavern, bartender Nena Garcia wonders how much longer she'll be employed.
The Yakama Nation, which already bans liquor sales on tribal land, has imposed a new tax on alcohol sold on private land within the reservation and a $5,000 license fee on liquor distributors.
The move has been criticized by the governor and it raises legal questions about the authority of tribes to tax non-Indians.
Indian tribes across the country have taken various steps to curb alcohol-related problems.
Last July, the Blackfeet Tribal Council banned liquor sales on its Montana reservation for five days and suggested it could be the forerunner of year-round prohibition.
Activist Russell Means in October suggested opening a liquor store near South Dakota's Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, which is officially dry, and using the profits to treat alcoholism.
Stores in Whiteclay, Neb.
-- just two miles from the reservation -- sell millions of dollars worth of beer each year, most of it to Oglala Sioux.
The Yakama tribe's moves affect some 50 businesses.
At least two major distributors already have refused to deliver to the central Washington reservation, and that means Tiny's, in nearby Wapato, hasn't been able to get any beer.
"We're stocked for a little bit, maybe a month or so.
After that I don't know," Ms.
Garcia said.
"I'm afraid I might lose my job".
Gov. Gary Locke, who opposes the Yakama tax, did announce this week that the state is closing the two privately operated state liquor store franchises in Wapato and Toppenish "out of respect for the Yakama Nation's desire to reduce consumption of alcohol on the reservation".
Richard Paddock owns the Wapato franchise.
He hopes to move his business to Union Gap, a few miles north and off the reservation.
Paddock said several people stand to lose their livelihoods because of the new wholesale tax, which raises the price of a six-pack of beer by about $2.40.
Restaurants and lounges could be hurt, too.
When the Yakama Tribal Council adopted the tax ordinance in November, leaders said the money would be used for alcoholism treatment and education and for drunken-driving enforcement.
"We share their concerns about alcoholism and the illegal overuse of alcohol," Locke said after meeting with tribal leaders and area mayors.
However, he said the tax is "the wrong way to go" in trying to fight problems such as chronic alcohol abuse, teen-age drinking and fetal alcohol syndrome.
State Attorney General Christine Gregoire has said the tax may be illegal because it is imposed on non-tribal members.
Tribal Council Chairman Lonnie Selam, however, said he believed the tax would withstand legal challenge.
The governor said negotiations over the issue will continue and urged businesses to hang on.
At least one of three private clubs is considering allowing members to bring in their own liquor, and then charging them a fee for glasses and mixers.
At the Double D Saloon and several other businesses, petitions are being circulated urging Locke to fight the tax.
David Meyers, owner of The 88-Cent Store across the street from the Double D, doesn't sell alcohol but he's opposed to the tax.
"I believe it's too radical, and that Toppenish residents will end up going out of town to buy their alcohol, thus causing major problems with drinking and driving," he said.
Esther Serna, who owns the El Paso Cafe, said she was neutral on the tax.
"I don't sell a lot of beer," she said.
"But I do feel sorry for the people (it) will make go out of business."
CHICAGO _ A tiny Indian tribe in a sparse slice of northeastern Nebraska found itself Friday at the forefront of an increasingly heated national debate over the matter of where tribal sovereignty ends and state control begins.
The issue was the tribe's operation of a shoe-box casino on its reservation.
Friday that little casino nearly led a U.S.
District Court judge in Omaha, Neb.
, to take an unprecedented step: the jailing of tribal leaders in a clash over reservation gambling.
Although the judge, William Cambridge, ultimately decided against jailing the leaders now, the tribe hardly won a conclusive victory.
Cambridge suggested that federal prosecutors might want to pursue a criminal rather than civil case against them, and declared once more, as he had repeatedly, that the casino was illegal because it had lacked state approval ever since opening 3 1/2 years ago.
The lack of such approval violates a federal law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, which requires an Indian tribe to strike an accord, or compact, with the state in which its reservation lies if it wants to open a casino.
There are now about 145 such compacts between states and various tribes.
But Nebraska, opposing any casinos within its borders, has refused to negotiate one with the Santee Sioux, the tribe with a stake in the proceeding Friday.
That proceeding was the latest in a series of recent skirmishes over the rights of tribes to operate casinos in states from Florida to California and, more broadly, over the ability of tribes to be exempt from state regulation and taxation.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Only Monday, the California Supreme Court overturned a ballot measure that would have allowed expansion of legalized gambling on Indian reservations.
The decision dealt a severe blow to tribes' ambitions to build a gambling mecca to compete with Las Vegas.
The tribes' position was supported by Gov.
Gray Davis, but the court ruled that it conflicted with the state constitution's ban on casino-style games like blackjack and 21.
In addition, Florida, Kansas and Alabama, trying to block the opening of Indian casinos within their borders, have sued the U.S.
Interior Department with the aim of overturning new rules that allow the federal government to license tribal casinos in cases where states are reluctant to negotiate compacts.
And Wisconsin Gov.
Tommy Thompson refused to renew one-year gambling agreements with that state's 11 tribes until they agreed to pay $22 million in lieu of taxes, up from $350,000 under the old one-year agreements.
``Before, when we didn't have any pie, nobody bothered with us,'' said Sheila Morago, a spokeswoman for the National Indian Gaming Association.
``Now that we have a small piece of the pie, they want our filling.
It's just a constant intrusion on the treaties that were signed long ago, on the tribes' sovereign rights.
Every time you get a little farther, you take one step forward and two steps back''.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) David Rocchio, deputy legal counsel to Vermont Gov.
Howard Dean, who has been involved in discussions on Indian gambling through the National Governors' Association, said that ``the concern that governors have is not with the benefit casinos bring to tribes''.
Rather, Rocchio said, ``the concern is with the carve-out from state regulation, such as land use, police power and other ancillary concerns that arise when tribes have casinos _ and the impact on the residents not only on the tribal lands but also on other lands in the state''.
Like gambling venues everywhere, casinos attract crime, and can prey on compulsive gamblers.
The reservation of the Santee Sioux, the tribe involved in the court showdown in Nebraska on Friday, lies on the Missouri River just across the border with South Dakota, and is home to about 1,000 tribal members.
In February 1996, the Santee Sioux opened the Ohiya Casino on reservation land, in a metal building not much bigger than a 7-Eleven store.
It has 71 video gambling and slot machines, and attracts mostly elderly people from nearby farming communities.
It takes in just $900,000 or so a year and employs only 23 people, but tribal leaders say it is an economic godsend for a reservation with 74 percent unemployment.
Tribe chairman Arthur Denny said the casino actually supports about four relatives of each employee and has brought a decline in alcohol abuse and domestic violence.
But Nebraska, which does not allow casino gambling anywhere in the state, has refused to negotiate a compact with the Santee Sioux.
Almost from the beginning, the U.S. attorney's office in Omaha has tried to get the casino shut down.
A federal appeals court found the casino illegal in 1998, and the Supreme Court, without comment, let that ruling stand.
This February, Cambridge began fining the tribe $3,000 a day, and in June he doubled the fine, to $6,000 a day.
None of the debt, now totaling $726,000, has been paid by the Santee Sioux, and the purpose of the hearing Friday was for Cambridge to consider whether to put the 11 members of the tribal council in jail for contempt.
In the end, he decided against doing so, saying that because the tribe voted in a referendum this month to keep the casino open, the leaders no longer had the authority to close it.
He told the federal prosecutors that to get the casino closed, they would have to pursue the case as a criminal matter, not a civil one.
Why that would make any difference in a practical sense was not entirely clear.
In any event, the judge was hardly sympathetic to the Santee Sioux, saying the fines would continue.
It was not certain where the case would proceed from here.
U.S. Attorney Thomas Monaghan said his office had several options, but he would not elaborate.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) After the hearing, tribal members who had made the 160-mile trip to Omaha erupted in cheers and sang tribal songs, celebrating the judge's decision not to jail the leaders.
The tribe is hoping that the new Interior Department rules will allow it to work out a legitimate means of running the casino, but that process, even if successful, could take years.
``We're not trying to break anybody's laws,'' said Thelma Thomas, the casino's manager.
``We're just trying to make life better for our people.''
American Indians are the victims of violent crimes at more than twice the national average and, unlike the situation among whites and blacks where the large majority of crime victims are of the same race as the perpetrators, 70 percent of those committing crimes against Indians are of a different race, according to the first comprehensive study of crimes involving Indians, which was released Sunday by the Justice Department.
The study found that the nation's 2.3 million Indians were far more likely to be victims of violent crimes than members of any other racial group, and that the rate of violent crime experienced by Indian women is nearly 50 percent higher than that by black males.
A full 60 percent of the perpetrators of violent crimes against Indians were whites, according to the victims, while 29 percent of the offenders were other Indians and 10 percent were described as black, the report said.
By contrast, other studies have shown that 69 percent of the perpetrators of violent crimes against whites are also white, and 81 percent of those committing violent crimes against blacks are themselves black.
``This highlights what has been going on out there for 130 years, since the beginning of the reservation system,'' said Sidney Harring, a professor of law at the City University of New York School of Law and an expert on Indian crime and criminal law.
Harring said much of the violence against Indians by other racial groups was attributable to racism and alcohol, ``with Indians being victimized by poor, drunken whites, people on the margins hurting each other''.
There are still high levels of prejudice against Indians in the West, where most Indians live, he said, and a culture that lives on the edges of Indian reservations ``that tolerates this violence,'' even among law enforcement officials.
Suzan Shown Harjo, president of the Morning Star Institute, an Indians' rights advocacy group in Washington, took an even more sweeping position, saying, ``This may actually represent a downturn in violence over the centuries since we first encountered Europeans.
``At least it's not genocidal,'' said Ms.
Harjo, who is part Cheyenee and part Muscogee.
``Now they are taking Indians out one by one''.
The study was published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the statistical branch of the Justice Department, using data gathered from 1992 to 1996 by the National Crime Victimization Survey, which asks a sample of American households each year about crimes they have experienced.
The survey measures the violent crimes of rape, robbery, aggravated assault and simple assault.
To supplement the survey, the justice department added data on homicides gathered by the FBI from local police reports.
The victimization survey is considered a reliable measure of crime by criminologists.
According to the survey, the average annual rate at which Indians were victims of crimes _ 124 per 1,000 people, ages 12 or older _ is about two and a half times the national average of 50 crimes per 1,000 people who are above the age of 12.
The average for whites was 49 per 1,000 people; for blacks, 61 per 1,000; and for Asians, 29 per 1,000.
Alcohol played a major part in violent crimes against Indians, both those committed by Indians against each other and those committed by people of other racial groups, the report found.
Indian victims reported that the perpetrator had been drinking in 46 percent of violent crimes against them, the highest of any racial group, while 70 percent of Indians convicted of violence who were in jail said they had been drinking at the time of their offense.
In addition, the survey found that the arrest rate for alcohol-related offenses among Indians (including drunken driving, liquor law violations and public drunkenness) was more than double that for the total population during 1996, though the arrest rate for drug offenses was lower than for other races.
The four states with the most Indian residents were; Oklahoma, with 252,000, followed by California, Arizona and New Mexico.
Peter Iverson, a professor of history at Arizona State University, said that there had been a significant shift in Indian population over the past 20 years, with a majority of Indians now living in urban areas.
But those Indians in cities form a small part of the metropolitan area and do not live in segregated areas, so they are much more likely to come in contact with people of other groups.
Residential segregation is often part of the explanation for the tendency of whites to commit violence against whites, and blacks against other blacks.
Iverson said that in rural areas bordering Indian reservations, ``you still have significant prejudice against Indian people providing traditional justification for violence''.
Historically, he said, Indians entered these communities to shop, or to buy alcohol or for entertainment, and though whites in these towns made money off the Indians, ``there has long been an uneasy relationship, even resentment''.
In this situation, arguments, fueled by alcohol, could quickly become violent, he said.
Separately, the report said that the murder rate by Indians in 1996 was 4 per 100,000, below the national average of 7.9 per 100,000, and less than the white rate of 4.9 per 100,000.
From 1991 to 1996, the murder rate by Indians fell 20 percent, faster than the overall national decline of 15 percent.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- They come into Elaine Newton's court by the dozens, charged with underage drinking, using marijuana, fighting.
Some are as young as 11.
They are children without a childhood, being sucked into the vortex of drinking and despair that destroys too many people on Colorado's remote Southern Ute Indian reservation.
Newton, the tribe's chief judge, sees more of them every year.
Many, Newton said, are victims themselves, either of abuse or what she calls ''emotional incest''.
''That's where children basically are left to feel responsible for their parents' own emotional needs,'' Newton said.
''They feel it's their fault that mom is drinking or dad leaves, when it's really not their fault.
''I think we forget they are children''.
As crime rates fall nationwide, they are rising in American Indian communities, especially among the 43 percent of Indians under age 20.
Indian youth are far more likely to be arrested for alcohol-related crimes than their non-Indian counterparts, according to a report released Thursday by a government advisory panel.
The Coalition for Juvenile Justice report said 3 percent of juveniles arrested for liquor law violations are Indian, though Indians make up just 1 percent of all juveniles.
The coalition, a nonprofit group of state advisory boards created under a federal juvenile justice law, recommends expanding programs to fight Indian alcoholism, depression and gangs.
''In states with significant American Indian communities, American Indian youth are found far too frequently in the back of squad cars, rather than in the front of classrooms,'' the report said.
Juvenile crime is one strand in the web of social problems facing urban and reservation Indian communities, the report said.
High reservation unemployment is one factor.
''There are limited opportunities on the reservation, especially those in rural areas,'' said Kevin Shendoe, a member of New Mexico's Jemez Pueblo who started a group to help youths develop leadership skills.
''Given that and the history of alcoholism and poverty, I think it all plays into students getting depressed and frustrated -- and in certain serious cases, violent''.
Another factor is abuse passed down from generation to generation, often starting with Indian children forced into government or religious boarding schools where tribal culture was suppressed and abuse and neglect were commonplace.
''Cultural oppression has taken a heavy toll on Native Americans for years,'' Newton said.
''There's been a lack of parenting because of boarding schools.
Parents don't know how to be parents.
... In society today, you're in between two cultures.
They lost their Indian culture and they're struggling with trying to figure out where they fit''.
Indians have some of the worst health care and highest death rates from alcoholism, diabetes, accidents and suicide in the nation.
That means many young Indians are repeatedly traumatized by deaths of friends and relatives, said Sandi Ernst, a psychologist who ran the White Mountain Apache Tribe's child mental health programs from 1993 to 1999.
A large number of children affected by alcohol in their mothers' wombs also contributes to the crime problem, said Ernst, who now practices in Phoenix.
People exposed to alcohol in the womb are more impulsive and often cannot understand consequences of their behavior, she said.
''That increases the likelihood they're going to do stupid things,'' Ernst said.
Tribal programs, which must rely on federal funding, are too often shortchanged, the report said.
Newton said getting enough money to help the children she sentences is a constant problem.
Children who have enough Indian heritage to qualify for some federal programs but are not enrolled members of the tribe often fall through the cracks, she said.
''It often seems like there's no funding available to help us,'' Newton said.
''If we need treatment for sexual abuse or domestic violence or alcohol treatment, there's no one to help us.
It's kind of like these problems never get resolved''.
Newton also thinks that Indian communities must take responsibility for ending the cycle of abuse and alcohol.
''A lot of us are in denial about what has happened,'' Newton said.
''We cover up things or say nothing's wrong in our families.
We don't make our families accountable for the wrongs we may have done.
''My sense is we need to validate what has happened, grieve and then move on.
Until you can do that, you just don't resolve anything''.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.
(AP) -- At Mesa Elementary School in far northwest New Mexico, Navajo children line up to use the few computers connected to the Internet.
Their time online must be short for everyone to get a chance.
''The Internet's not really available to me,'' said sixth-grader Altie Altieyazzie.
President Clinton was scheduled to visit the youngster's community of Shiprock on Monday as part of his New Markets Initiative to encourage economic development in depressed areas, a tour that focuses on the so-called ''digital divide'' that is leaving minority communities like Altie's behind.
Many in Shiprock hope Clinton's presence will spotlight conditions on the Navajo reservation that have kept most of its 8,000 residents from participating in the Internet information age.
Poverty and the extremely rural nature of the sprawling reservation mean many homes don't have telephone connections, let alone computers.
''We have a lot of needs, on any Native American reservation, and the Navajo Reservation is the same,'' said sixth-grade teacher Fannie L.
Atcitty. ''We're still behind, which is affecting our schools, our students''.
Officials at Mesa Elementary estimate that fewer than half of the families with children who attend the school have phone lines to their homes, a problem for emergencies as well as Internet access.
Altie, 12, said his family has a phone but no computer.
''For some people it's probably too expensive,'' he said.
The students have access to the school's computers on some days after classes, but many have long bus rides home and can't stay, said Principal Glojean Todacheene.
The limited time they get in school on the computers doesn't allow them to get comfortable enough to be considered computer literate, Atcitty said.
''Every child should be computer literate,'' she said, ''but it's not really happening here''.
There has been some progress over the past few months.
Tachyon Inc.
, a California-based company that provides wireless Internet service, gave the Lake Valley Navajo School a $30,000 satellite system last week to connect the school's computers to the Internet.
School officials tried accessing the Internet by telephone line, but the connection was so poor it took as long as 40 minutes to find a Web site.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs hopes to eventually get satellite systems to all remote schools in the Navajo Nation.
A donation earlier this year from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, started by the founder of Microsoft, created a program to provide grants for computers and software for American Indian tribes in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah.
A computer that is expected to be delivered to the Navajo Nation's Hogback chapter in August will be used by everyone from elementary school students to business people, said Anita Hayes, community services coordinator for the chapter, about four miles east of Shiprock.
Hayes said the Internet connection will provide information on jobs, education and other opportunities to members, and she hopes Clinton's visit will make it easier to get grants for more equipment.
''There are a lot of reasons to have this access,'' she said, though not everyone is racing toward the Internet age.
''Among the elderly, it's foreign to them,'' Hayes said.
''They're not saying too much about it.
They're just observing, watching the children''.
Clinton's plans Monday including speaking at Shiprock Boys/Girls Club, then joining an evening Webcast at Dine Tribal College in Shiprock that will involve high school student online at Lake Valley Navajo School, about 55 miles away.

MACY, Neb.
_ There was no Christmas vacation this year at the Omaha Nation Public School, and no spring break either.
Instead, the superintendent, Todd Chessmore, decided to front load the school calendar so classes would end a few weeks early, the first week of May.
This was his attempt to stem a chronically high truancy rate that gets worse in the spring, when warmer weather and the end of the high school basketball season dampen students' interest in school.
It was not entirely successful.
In the math class taught by Chessmore, for example, only five of the 36 registered students were showing up by mid-April.
Even in a country used to stories about struggling public schools, many of those in Indian country stand out.
Last year, the average student at the Omaha Nation Public School scored in the 15th percentile on national standardized tests, and almost half scored below the 10th percentile.
Fewer than half the students in grades three through 12 came to take the test, Chessmore said.
And while this year's graduating class of nine is bigger than those of a few years ago, it represents only a third of the 27 students enrolled in that class in ninth grade.
The obstacles the Omaha Nation school wrestles with are echoed in Indian schools around the country.
On average, 36 percent to 51 percent of Indian students drop out of high school, according to the American Indian College Fund, the largest dropout rate of any ethnic group.
Only about 17 percent of high school graduates go to college, and most do not finish.
``We got the worst of everything, the lowest test scores, lowest rate of reading books, the highest dropout rate, the lowest rate of entering college,'' said Dean Chavers, director of the Native American Scholarship Fund.
``Whatever test you're looking at, Indian kids in high school typically score at the 15th or 20th percentile.
The reading of those kids is absolutely nonexistent.
Our Indian kids are leaving high school now with Algebra 1 _ no geometry, no trig _ and people wonder why they're failing out of college''.
Frustrated by years of distressing results, schools and groups like the National Indian Education Association have begun pressing states and the federal government for more money for academics and crumbling buildings, programs to train Indian teachers, and support for parents whose poverty, substance abuse or unemployment leave them unmotivated or unable to help their children stay in school and achieve.
The effort reflects the Indians' increasing ability to assert itself, as Indian leaders have gained political and legal savvy and a degree of economic empowerment through reservation casinos.
But it also reflects the critical state of Indian education.
Some reservation schools have done well and others, including the Omaha Nation school, have improved from a few years ago.
But many are dealing with a cycle of low expectations from non-Indian teachers, a generation of poorly educated parents, broken and overwhelmed families, a society historically suspicious of government-run schools and a culture that may not always see the relationship between being academically rigorous and being successful on the reservation.
These difficulties only compound the isolation and poverty of reservation life.
``I worry about the future of the tribe,'' said Denine Parker, an Omaha tribe member who teaches art at the school in Macy, where 60 percent of the 3,400 tribe members are unemployed.
``I see too many kids not getting an education.
What happens to them?
All you have to do is walk Main Street and then you know''.
To some degree, state and federal officials are responding.
President Clinton's budget request this year includes the largest increase ever for Indian education, economic and social programs _ $1.2 billion _ which would put it at $9.4 billion in 2001.
The Education Department just created an Indian Teacher Corps to train 1,000 Indian teachers.
Currently, most teachers in reservation schools are non-Indian, the turnover rates are extremely high, and many believe the teachers do not understand Indian culture and learning styles.
And in August, a task force Clinton created will present plans to improve education of the nation's 600,000 Indian students, 90 percent of whom are in public schools, many on reservations.
``What's important is that what the government is doing says it's OK to be an Indian,'' said David Cournoyer, director of external affairs for the American Indian College Fund.
``Before the philosophy was to take the Indian out of the Indian and basically educate him to be a white person.
Now there's a recognition that the Indian's background and identity and self-esteem is important to them being good students''.
Dr. David Beaulieu, the Education Department's director of Indian education, called the effort unprecedented.
``We have schools that are literally falling down around the heads of Indian children,'' Beaulieu said.
``In the 1990s we had the same high levels of dropout rates and low achievement levels as existed 20 years before''.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) In Nebraska, the efforts of Chessmore and others got the state to hold an Indian education summit meeting and appoint a task force to improve state policy.
The Legislature passed a bill this session changing the state aid formula so tribes, which have very little taxable property, would no longer lose state financing because they cannot raise the required amount from property taxes.
The bill was vetoed by Nebraska's governor, and the Omaha Nation and Winnebago school districts plan to sue the state.
Chris Peterson, a spokesman for Gov.
Mike Johanns, said that while the governor objected to the cost and form of the bill, he also believed ``it is time for the state and federal government to step up and do more, specifically in the area of funding''.
And Nebraska's education commissioner, Doug Christensen, is hiring two staff members solely for Indian students: an education expert and a drug and alcohol counselor.
``We're really courting disaster, I think, on those reservation communities,'' said Christensen.
``In two of our reservation schools there are 44 kindergartners but only two seniors, and in one case those two kids should not be graduating.
They are two 18-year-old girls who couldn't pass the Algebra 1 test to save their soul''.
Bob Geist, principal of the Winnebago reservation school, north of Macy, said ``some parents see formal education as important, others see just being with the family as education.
We have parents who will take kids out of school just to go shopping, or schedule a haircut in the middle of the day''.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) nn &UR; &QL; &LR; Parker, the Omaha Nation teacher who regularly sees only 15 out of 26 students in her largest class, sent her daughter to sixth grade at a non-Indian school in Iowa.
Recently, her daughter returned to Omaha Nation school to find she was ``way ahead of the sixth graders here,'' Parker said.
``If I never would have sent her away, she never would have realized how hard she has to work''.
Still, at Omaha Nation, Chessmore has made many improvements, from replacing 300 burned-out light bulbs when he started as superintendent three years ago to opening a day care center to help girls who have babies stay in school.
He started a training program for Indian teachers that will increase their numbers from 4 to 20, made the curriculum more culturally relevant, and has applied for money for a social services center with probation officers and a mental health counselor.
He received a grant for a reading program for elementary students, which has produced ``fourth graders who are reading better than half our high school''.
And he is lobbying the telephone company to give phones to the 30 percent of students' families without them.
To build trust, Chessmore, unlike most superintendents and teachers in reservation schools, enrolled his seven children at Omaha Nation, the only non-Indians among the 470 students.
He and his wife also raise four Indian students from troubled families.
He hired three truant officers, and the truancy rate fell from 31 percent to about 15 percent.
One afternoon, Waylon Oldman, a truant officer and tribe member, scoured Macy for two kindergartners who had left school.
In a Buick with its windshield cracked by rock-throwing truants, Oldman visited one boy's father and the trailer where the other boy lived with his grandmother.
He scaled a chalky ridge called Million Dollar Hill, poked in an abandoned cellar shrouded by trees, scrambled down a deep ravine under a bridge, and combed an algae-choked creek strewn with old tires..
The truants were nowhere to be seen.
``The kids are smart _ they arrange tree branches so they can scoot underneath but we have to work to get through,'' Oldman said.
He said tribal court has begun fining parents whose children were chronically truant, and the school sometimes tried to get their welfare benefits cut.
``Some parents are really concerned, but some of the parents don't really understand why they need to send the kids to school''.
One chronic truant was Janice &UR; &LR; Baxter's 16-year-old son.
She would take him to school in the morning, but said that ``in the afternoon, I would see him walking around with friends''.
Baxter said he kept ``coming home drunk'' and she sent him to a treatment center.
Some students show promise but don't follow through.
This year, it looked like Jason Miller, a senior on the basketball team, would graduate, but he stopped doing schoolwork when basketball season ended.
``I didn't really want to come to school no more,'' said Jason, 18.
But there have been successes.
One senior, Liz Parker, had slacked off too badly to graduate.
But a few weeks ago, Chessmore refused to let his daughter double date with her to the prom unless Liz did enough work to graduate.
She did.
And Adrienne Miller, 19, who was left back in ninth grade and was drinking so much last year she dropped out for two weeks, turned things around under pressure from her mother, who told her she would have to help pay the bills if she wasn't in school.
Now she'll graduate and plans to attend college.
``I finally realized what I should be doing,'' Adrienne wrote in a class essay, ``getting my education.''
SEATTLE _ The national dairy industry is using Mark McGwire to promote the health benefits of drinking milk.
Meanwhile, a rebel sneaker company called And1 has signed Latrell Sprewell to promote the misguided notion that it is OK to do whatever you want, including choke your coach, and you'll still be glorified.
The sports images in advertising are certainly eye-opening these days, even with Dennis Rodman out of the picture.
Let's start with McGwire.
The other day while driving on Aurora Avenue through Seattle, I was twice stopped at a red light long enough to realize how crazy it was to have McGwire towering over the road, his image plastered on a billboard _ bat in hand, sleeveless shirt revealing his sapling-sized biceps _ a veritable poster-boy for the health benefits of drinking milk.
Milk mustache in full view, McGwire's pitch (which you can find on the Web at www.whymilk.com) is simple: ``Going, going, gone.
Time for milk.
It's got stuff leading sports drinks don't _ like protein, potassium and calcium.
That's why I always have an ice cold glass...
as soon as I get home''.
Which prompts any rational sports fan to pose the next logical question: Does McGwire drink the milk before or after he pops the steroid-producing substance androstenedione?
He may have clobbered Maris and Ruth and ignited an entire summer, but McGwire stands for something else, too.
Ever since McGwire's andro use became public knowledge during last season's great home-run chase, McGwire has been generally unabashed in admitting his andro use.
He says it ensures better workouts in order for him to pump up his massive body, which in turn probably allowed McGwire to have one of his most injury-free seasons in the dramatic 1998.
Despite all the incredibly generous things McGwire has done for abused kids and for the game of baseball, his blind spot and failing on this issue is significant.
In Washington, D.C., earlier this month, President Bill Clinton's drug policy advisor, Gen.
Barry R.
McCaffrey, called for the federal government to study the health effects of androstenedione.
The over-the-counter supplement's popularity soared last year, even among school-aged children, soon after McGwire acknowledged using the substance for at least one year as part of his training regimen.
In an article he wrote for The New York Times last Sunday, former Olympic hurdler Edwin Moses said he supports McCaffrey's leadership on this issue.
And Moses was not afraid to point the finger at McGwire.
``Androstenedione, better known as andro, is a steroid.
Despite all the misinformation to the contrary, it is neither merely a food supplement nor is it innocuous,'' Moses said.
A long-standing anti-doping crusader, Moses is alarmed at the influence athletes like McGwire have over the behavior of children.
``The National Institute of Drug Abuse estimates that 175,000 teenage girls and 325,000 teen-age boys _ that's 500,000 children _ have reported using steroids during the past year,'' Moses said.
``The alarming numbers are not the only story.
Drug use in sport is also a fraud on the public, which is promised a product _ clean competition _ that is not ultimately delivered ...
``The problem of drug use by elite athletes must continue to be addressed on the federal level by General McCaffrey and others who are responsible for children and public welfare,'' Moses said.
Milk mustaches are one thing, but the taint of andro use still lingers with McGwire, whose bat speed and ability made him a natural anyway to set a new standard for home runs.
What might have been unnatural were McGwire's workouts, aided by the quick-recovery time andro allowed his muscles.
That is what makes you look up at McGwire's billboard and his innocent milk mustache and wish like heck the guy had simply depended on the natural goodness of milk, not the controversial substance now under serious scrutiny.
On a different front, a similar sort of head-scratching took place this NBA playoff season.
It happened when I looked into Latrell Sprewell's eyes during his ill-advised sneaker ad _ the one that is set to air 200 times before the NBA Finals.
Sprewell, who was suspended by the NBA for most of the 1997-98 season and who later sued everyone from the league to his agent to Converse sneakers because of his physical assault of Golden State coach P.J.
Carlesimo, was certainly aware that his new ad was made to shock.
``People say I'm what's wrong with sports.
I say I'm a three-time NBA All-Star.
People say I'm America's worst nightmare.
I say I'm the American dream,'' the sneering Spree says into the camera close-up.
The new ad was predicted by the national trade magazine Brandweek to be the most controversial sneaker endorsement since Nike made Charles Barkley say he was no role model.
Well, turns out Spree's ad isn't controversial.
It's just pathetic, which is what happens when you don't know any better than to go ahead and send the wrong message.

NEW YORK _ In 1970, two years into the open-tennis era and two years before Title IX, a pair of relatively obscure female players walked around the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills with a questionnaire.
Their objective: to determine tennis trends and, in particular, whether spectators attending the U.S.
Open would pay to watch a tournament with only female players.
The remarkably positive response of that informal survey by Ceci Martinez and Esme Emanuel was a declaration of independence for women's sports.
And if Title IX became the bill of rights for female athletes, this summer has emerged as the exclamation point for any equal-rights amendment.
From Women's World Cup soccer to U.S.
Open tennis, from the world track and field championships to the Pan-Pacific swimming meet, the message has been unmistakably clear: Women can hold their own on any stage, with or without men.
Teresa Weatherspoon's game-winning shot in the Women's National Basketball Association finals last week was as mind-boggling and riveting as was Jerry West's dramatic heave decades earlier.
And the Houston Comets' three-peat earned them a legacy alongside other basketball dynasties.
But the women have also stolen the show.
Even minus Steffi Graf's majestic presence and Anna Kournikova's photogenic tease, Martina Hingis, Monica Seles, Venus and Serena Williams, Lindsay Davenport, Jennifer Capriati and others have created enough competitive subplots to justify an equal-pay mantra.
Davenport's bold backhand winner against Mary Pierce from match point down in their compelling quarterfinal three-setter was the gutsy shot of the tournament.
The notion that the women must play best-of-five sets to earn singles parity at Grand Slam events (not so at the U.S.
Open, which is the only equal-opportunity employer) is as outmoded as trying to equate the price of a Broadway show ticket to the length of a performance.
Substance always prevails over style (as Andre Agassi has learned), even if you need personalities for box-office bait.
Thirty years ago, only Billie Jean King, Arthur Ashe and a handful of others understood what really mattered.
Now the Williams sisters have rewritten the rules of the road for junior tennis, and Jong Song Ok's victory for North Korea in the women's marathon at the world track championships may have opened yet another door into a closed society just as Tegla Loroupe brought African women out of obscurity with her New York City Marathon victories.
Even Brandi Chastain's celebrated stripdown at the Women's World Cup final will be analyzed by the Associated Press Sports Editors in a newsletter.
Ceci Martinez says she is fascinated by the current crop of female athletes.
``We players were unhappy with the status quo,'' she said the other day by phone from her home in San Mateo, Calif.
, where she works in real estate.
``And like all reformers, we were considered radical in our time, chided for our feminist views simply because we wanted equal opportunity in all its ramifications''.
The positive results of that study, coupled with an early sponsorship commitment from Philip Morris, gave women's tennis its first financial cushion.
Now sponsors are using today's pros and even a former great, Althea Gibson, to sell themselves and this year's Open.
But the bright lights have also brought murkier, less romantic overtones to women's sports.
At the world track championships in Spain, Merlene Ottey of Jamaica, a 39-year-old sprinter who had won 14 medals during a venerable career, was forced to withdraw from the meet after traces of the banned steroid nandrolone were found in one of her urine samples.
And lost amid the flurry of world swim records set by South African Penny Heyns at the Pan-Pacifics in Sydney's Olympic pool was her disclosure that creatine was an integral part of her training regimen.
Although legal as a nutritional supplement, creatine has been associated with bulking up male bodies for football, baseball and the beach more than female swimmers.
``I'd be swimming pretty well whether I was on it or not,'' said Heyns, who set an astonishing seven world records in her last 10 races.
``But I have the attitude that I don't want to get on the blocks during my career and know that I`ve trained and swum as hard as I could but that there was a nutritional side that I didn't do the best I could in.
I want to cover all the bases''.
These words are a far cry from the days when pasta, carbo-loading and electrolyte solutions were considered new-age nutritional training tools.
But Heyns' times will almost certainly resonate around the world on the road to Sydney next September just as many coaches have finally moved beyond East Germany's systematic steroid scandal of the '70s.
Free from current doping control procedures, nutritional supplements and doping may replace equality as the next battle ground for women.
``Title IX has certainly helped,'' Martinez said, of what awaits women, ``but looking beyond the sports arena, women are still struggling to break through the glass ceiling in all facets of life, especially in business, politics and the mass media.''
SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian 400-meter runner Svetlana Pospelova tested positive for banned drugs in an out-of- competition test, International Olympic Committee officials said Saturday.
Pospelova was found to have steroid stanozolol in her system, according to Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC's medical commission.
Pospelova, who won the European Cup at Gateshead, England, on July 15, was not a medalist in Sydney.
The IOC Executive Board meets on Sunday.
However since she has left the country and is not expected to compete again, the matter is expected to be turned over to the international federation to consider the case and possible sanctions.
Pospelova would be the seventh athlete to test positive at the Games, which have been enveloped in doping cases since well before the start two weeks ago.
She had already returned to Russia when the medical commission received the drug test result, de Merode said.
Full details will be available after the IOC executive board meeting.
BOSTON _ Since the day she sailed her way into this city's heart by finishing a sparkling second in the 1990 Boston Marathon, her US debut after leaving East Germany, marathoning brought Uta Pippig little but joy and success.
Even the setbacks _ the worst being forced to drop out of the 1996 Olympics with a leg injury _ seemed temporary, a brief chop on life's ocean that soon would calm again as Pippig resumed her voyage toward immortality in the sport.
After all, how could anything swamp an athlete who earned her third straight Boston Marathon victory, as she did at the 100th running in 1996, by coming from nowhere in the last miles while suffering from stomach cramps and relentless diarrhea?
Then, last October, the 33-year-old Pippig was suspended by the German athletic federation for failing a routine out-of-competition drug test.
Unable to compete during the suspension and facing a two-year ban if found guilty, Pippig suddenly finds herself looking for a lifeline to save her career.
``I don't wish any person on earth this,'' said Pippig last fall, shortly after the suspension.
``I know I didn't do anything.
It's hard.
It's just not fair''.
But Pippig's forced exile from the roads hasn't kept the longtime Boston favorite out of town this weekend.
On Saturday, looking fit and relaxed, she smiled for photos at the Boston Athletic Association's annual breakfast for past champions.
Monday, as she did last year while taking what she thought would be a short break from marathoning, she will be doing television commentary for Channel 4.
Despite her uncertain situation, Pippig said recently that she was looking forward to race day.
``I can't miss it, you know,'' she said.
``It's too special''.
The same goes for the city: ``You should go where you feel supported''.
Still, she sighed, ``I wish I could run''.
Meanwhile, Pippig's contract with Nike expired in December and has not been renewed.
(``Given that she's not racing and not able to actually compete, there is no reason to sit down and discuss a contract at this point,'' said Dave Mingey, a company spokesman, who nonetheless added, ``We of course stand by Uta until her appeal process has been exhausted'').
She is paying her own legal fees, and already has lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in appearance fees and likely prize money.
And, there is no immediate end in sight.
Six months after the suspension was handed down, the commission in Germany that is investigating her case still has not set a hearing date.
If found guilty, the three-time Boston champion and two-time Olympian could be banned from competition for up to two years.
``I am very often asking my people what is going on,'' said Helmut Digel, president of the German federation, the Deutscher Leichtathletik Verband, ``because this situation is for both parties not a good one.
It is very important the period of suspension shouldn't last too long''.
The delays may be due to questions about both science and procedure.
As in the nearly three-year-old Mary Slaney case, it is unclear whether the test is even valid in women.
(Slaney was cleared by a USA Track &AMP; Field panel of a similar doping violation, and filed a lawsuit last Tuesday against the United States Olympic Committee and the International Amateur Athletic Federation, charging negligence in handling the case).
In Pippig's case, matters have been complicated by an unexplained switch in her two urine samples.
For years, rumors have swirled inside the running community about Pippig's high training mileage and rapid recovery after races; a training routine some fellow runners in Boulder, where she now lives, viewed as excessively private; and her East German background.
But until last fall, Pippig never had failed any of the dozens of drug tests in her career.
(She does acknowledge that, while still living in East Germany in 1984, she briefly took ``some kind of drug'' that her trainer told her was vitamins, but stopped within a few weeks after her parents, both physicians, investigated and told her to stop).
``I think it's kind of a sad thing,'' Pippig said of the accusations.
``But I feel sorry for them.
People who say this can be jealous''.
The test Pippig did fail, which showed an abnormal ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone in her urine, is by no means universally trusted.
The accepted ratio of testosterone, the male sex hormone, to epitestosterone, an inactive metabolite that is used as a marker, is 6 to 1; anything above that is considered to indicate the possible use of testosterone as a performance-enhancing anabolic steroid.
But because the test cannot distinguish naturally produced testosterone from ingested testosterone, even a high ratio is no guarantee an athlete has taken testosterone or androstenedione, the latter used by Mark McGwire and legal in baseball but banned by the IAAF.
At the same time, a ratio up to 10 to 1 still is considered to be in a gray area.
According to Pippig, not only was her ratio 9.2 to 1, but the abnormality was not due to high testosterone but rather to low epitestosterone, perhaps resulting from a number of conditions specific to gender and health issues that she has been battling since her epic run in 1996.
``I'm skeptical about the validity of the test, especially in women,'' said Dr.
Robert Barbieri, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who has sent a letter to the German federation on Pippig's behalf.
``This test has been most widely used in male athletes, and then it's been applied to females kind of by analogy.
In my mind, when we finally work out the details we will abandon it as a test for women''.
Especially in question, Barbieri believes, are the effects on the t/e ratio of oral contraceptives _ which Pippig was taking at the time _ and medical conditions involving the bowel, through which the hormones are cycled.
Pippig was hospitalized for tests after the episode during the 1996 Marathon, and said that intestinal problems, including diarrhea, and a severe hormone imbalance persisted even up to the time of the drug test last April.
``It's obvious I had a lot of problems with my intestinal tract during the last years,'' she said.
In Pippig's case, questions of procedure also have arisen.
When urine is collected for testing, samples are placed in two bottles, marked ``A'' and ``B,'' and then placed into containers also marked ``A'' and ``B''.
After her test last April 23, said Pippig, she placed the correct bottles into the matching containers herself, and then she, her coach and companion Dieter Hogen, and the test controller all signed to confirm the protocol was done correctly.
But when the ``A'' container was opened April 29 in a German laboratory, said Pippig, the ``B'' sample was found inside, leaking.
``The federation said, `It must have been you,' '' said Pippig.
``But. . . when a controller comes you do everything very clear and slow.
Six eyes who look to the same bottle, the same container, the same paper . . . '' ``There was no mistake in our home,'' insisted Hogen.
And none by the federation, insisted Digel.
``We got the information that the test was positive, and that is why we made our decision to suspend,'' he said.
``We are not responsible for the collection of the sample, not responsible for the containers, not responsible for the transportation''.
If mistakes were made in the lab, Digel said, it is the lab's responsibility, not the federation's.
Where does this leave Pippig?
``If this (the reversal of the samples and the subsequent testing of them in the wrong order, according to international rules) is fact, it would be very hard to prosecute this case,'' said Dr.
Gary I.
Wadler, an associate professor of medicine at New York University School of Medicine and lead author of the textbook ``Drugs and the Athlete''.
``If all these things can be proved, case closed''.
Yet the case is not yet closed, and so at noon Monday Pippig will be on TV rather than the starting line.
Still, she remains optimistic.
``The evidence shows I'm not guilty,'' she said.
``I will run again.
Nothing will change for me.''
WINNIPEG, Canada, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The human aspect should be taken into account when dealing with the doping incident, Jose Joaquin Puello, president of the 14th Pan Am Games Organization Committee said Saturday.
At a press conference which was meant to showcase Santo Domingo of the Dominican Republic, the city to host the next Pan American Games in four years, Puello went out of his way to comment on the doping incident invovling a Dominican athlete who had won the women's high jump gold medal before testing positive at the Winnipeg Pan Am Games.
The 20-year-old high jumper Juana Rosario Arrendel was stripped of the Pan Am gold medal four days ago after she tested positive for steroid.
"Athletes are not machines.
They are human beings, and every human makes mistake, " Puello said.
"The importance is not to avoid making mistakes, but to acknowledge that you made mistakes".
Puello went on emotionally appealing the world athletics governing body, International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF), to be merciful when considering sanctioning Arrendel, who was called by him as "an athlete who yet to reach her summit".
"Juana should be allowed to continue her athletic life, " he said".
She is a great athlete, a great woman, completely clean in every aspect of her life".
The media also has an important role to play, he said, they should protect her instead of crucifying her.
Arrendel took what was called "Ben substance" to post a personal best jump of 1.93 meters to grab the country's sole gold medal since the beginning of the Games.
"It is painful to see such a young athlete make such a big mistake," Dr.
Eduardo de Rose, chairman of the PASO Medican Commission said.
"This is the substance Ben Johnson has taken.
It's exetremely important for us to know where she got it".
Stonozolol, which was found in Arrendel's urine sample, is an anabolic steroid to increase power in speed, especially in the competitions of high jump and 100-meter race.
Gottschalt recalled that in 1981, when she was 15, she left the swimming school and returned home to hear friends and family remark about how the little girl had developed into a muscle-bound woman with a deep voice.
Other problems ensued: liver ailments, a hardening of back muscles.
In 1984 she gave birth to a son with a clubfoot.
Gottschalt believes her baby's deformity was a result of her being given drugs.
As years passed and her anger grew, she wondered exactly what the little blue pills had contained.
``I didn't think anyone cared enough about what happened to me to take any interest,'' she said.
``I gave up thinking anything might happen''.
Hope was restored last year when Gottschalt received a call from Michael Lehner, a German lawyer who specializes in doping-related lawsuits.
Lehner brought the criminal case against Kipke, and with the public prosecutor helped try it.
Lehner represented Gottschalt in this trial, along with eight other female swimmers who, he said, also had children with birth defects.
Having read files kept by the swimming federation, Lehner learned that Gottschalt was a member of the B group of swimmers, young hopefuls who, according to the Stasi files, were to receive ``supporting means'' to improve their performance.
``Supporting means'' was code for the drug Oral-Turinabol, an anabolic steroid manufactured in East Germany.
Lehner embarked on a search for other former swimmers who had also been administered the little blue pills and who would be willing to testify.
Court cases involving doping to that point had involved only swimmers from programs in the former East Berlin.
Lehner widened the scope and found former members of teams in Magdeburg, Erfurt, Potsdam, Chemnitz, Halle, Rostock, Leipzig and Dresden who had been similarly doped.
Lehner spoke to Ute Krause, also a product of the Magdeburg program, and found that her experiences were nearly identical to Gottschalt's.
After Krause left the swimming school in 1981, her voice was deeper, she had liver problems and she battled depression.
Years later, as the administrator of a nursing home in Magdeburg, Krause learned more about Oral-Turinabol.
Certain patients were being prescribed the drug to help regain muscle loss because of illness.
In a medical textbook, she read of the link between anabolic steroids and chronic depression.
She made no additional efforts to find out more about what had happened to her until Lehner called.
``I suppressed what happened to me for so long,'' Krause said recently in Magdeburg.
``I am still searching for my biography''.
In early January, Gottschalt, 34, Krause, 37, and three other former East German swimmers were present in a Berlin courtroom for the trial of Lothar Kipke.
During his testimony, Kipke admitted that he had distributed anabolic steroids to the swimmers but contended that he was unaware that the drugs carried any adverse side effects other than a deepening of the voice.
According to Kipke, as research increased in the 1980s, he began administering the steroids in lower dosages and only in pill form.
Ten feet from Kipke, Gottschalt listened to the doctor rationalize his actions.
When she heard his lawyer explain that Kipke had only been following orders, Gottschalt exclaimed, ``Say that to my son's face''!
Daniel, her 14-year-old disabled son, sat beside her.
Krause seized the chance to address Kipke directly near the end of the trial.
``He avoided making a direct apology,'' Krause said.
Lehner called Kipke a ``monster''.
``What gives a doctor that right to treat young girls like guinea pigs''?
Lehner said.
At the end of the one-day trial, Judge Peter Faust ruled that Kipke had acted with ``willful malevolence'' in overseeing doping of the swimmers during his tenure as head doctor.
Faust gave Kipke a 15-month suspended jail sentence, the most severe doping-related punishment meted out to a former East German official.
The verdict provided little solace for Gottschalt, who had hoped that the link between doping and birth defects would be addressed at the trial.
Faust declined Lehner's motion that the women whose children had birth defects receive financial compensation.
``We are going to pursue this further,'' Lehner said.
``I am representing nine clients who gave birth to children with birth defects''.
A member of the Berlin program, Barbara Krause, who won a gold medal on the East German freestyle relay team in the 1980 Olympics, has given birth to two children with clubfeet, according to Lehner.
She has been unwilling to testify at the doping trials, however, because of her marriage to Lutz Wanja, a former swimming coach in Potsdam.
Since the Kipke trial, Lehner has learned that a former swimmer in Leipzig has a 19-year-old daughter with a clubfoot.
In the next trial, for which no date has been set, Lehner plans to refer again to evidence yielded by the Stasi files, which show that East German doctors ordered female athletes to take birth control or have abortions because they feared Oral-Turinabol could damage fetuses.
Kipke, 72, is the 26th East German sports official to be convicted on charges of doping.
They were involved in swimming as well as other sports.
In May, several months before the statute of limitations runs out on the prosecution of middle-level East German criminals, Manfred Ewald and Manfred Hoeppner will have their day in court.
Hoeppner, head doctor of the East German sports medicine service, oversaw an unofficial group that the prosecution contends was the committee for all doping programs.
Ewald, former president of the East German Athletics Association, wrote a book chronicling his control over East German sports.
Gottschalt said she would be in the courtroom once again.
And to current swimmers caught up in the latest controversy over the use of dietary supplements like creatine to improve performance, Gottschalt offers her own sobering advice.
``Just leave it,'' she said.
``It's not worth it.
Let your body perform on its own.''
BERLIN (AP) _ Two medical experts testifying Wednesday in the doping trial of a former East German sports doctor said the female swimmers they examined showed health damage linked to performance-enhancing drugs, including liver damage and excessive facial hair.
The two professors said they examined 11 swimmers, all of whom were witnesses in the trial.
Five of the women had changes in their voices, they said.
One had heavy facial hair that was either caused or worsened by taking anabolic steroids, they said.
Two women were diagnosed with liver damage, they said, and another had a liver tumor that could be traced back to taking a combination of contraceptive pills and steroids for eight years.
Such side-effects of anabolic steroids have been generally known since 1977, they said.
Horst Luebbert, a professor of clinical gynecology, cautioned, however that while the health damage was ``with all probability'' linked to doping, ``we can't offer (absolute) security''.
Luebbert and pharmacology professor Norbert Rietbrock testified in the trial against Dr.
Dieter Binus.
His case was severed from five other defendants _ four coaches and another doctor _ after he made a partial confession last month.
The six were charged with causing bodily harm by administering performance-enhancing drugs to young swimmers without informing the athletes or their parents.
Binus, 59, admitted administering anabolic steroids, but insisted in court testimony that the doses were too small to cause physical harm and that none of his athletes showed ill effects.
The next court date for his case was set for Aug.
24, when a verdict could be handed down.
The five other defendants have not made any statements.
Their trial resumes Monday.

SYDNEY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Two positive doping tests were announced on Wednesday, just two days before the opening of the Sydney Olympic Games.
The cheaters were strongman Chen Po-pu of Chinese Taipei, and woman triple jumper Iva Prandzheva of Bulgaria.
Chen became the first athlete to be expelled from the Olympics for a positive test of methandienone, and Prandzheva tested positive for the steroid nandrolone.
Prandzheva, a silver medallist at the 1995 world championships, was caught for taking drugs at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
She was banned for two years for taking methandienone.
Chen, who took silver and bronze medals at world junior competitions in 1997 and 1998, had been due to compete in the 62 kg category.
BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's second doping trial against former East German sports functionaries opened Tuesday with coaches and doctors confessing they systematically administered performance-enhancing drugs to female swimmers.
All five defendants denied, however, that they knowingly damaged the health of the athletes, some of whom were as young as 12 when they started taking the pink and blue anabolic steroid pills.
Dr. Ulrich Suender, the first to take the stand, said he knew only a little about possible side-effects of steroids, and had thought they were were reversible.
``I believed that,'' he said in testimony echoed by his co-defendants.
Suender, a second doctor and three coaches are charged with causing bodily harm to as many as 17 young female swimmers on East Germany's TSC Berlin team from 1978 to 1989.
One is now sterile because her hormonal balance was disrupted by the steroids, which she started taking at 13.
Others suffered such side-effects as deeper voices, serious acne and excessive hair growth.
Prosecutors say the defendants administered the drugs _ without telling the minors or their parents what they were taking _ as part of communist East Germany's state-sponsored push to create Olympic champions.
Despite widespread suspicions raised by the unusually broad shoulders, big muscles and deep voices of some East German athletes over the years, few were ever caught in drug tests.
But since German unification, evidence of the systematic use of steroids to enhance performance has been found in once-secret East German government files.
On Tuesday, Suender, 58, testified that he had no reservations about providing anabolic steroids in pill form to the team doctors, which was part of his responsibility.
He denied ever giving steroid injections, as prosecutors have charged.
Former team doctor Dorit Roesler, 50, said she passed them on to the coaches, who admitted giving them to the swimmers.
Coaches Peter Mattonet, 48; Berndt Christochowitz, 40 and Klaus Klemenz, 55, said they assumed the pills were to improve athletic endurance.
However, Christochowitz, who now works for an insurance firm, insisted he didn't know the pills were anabolic steroids.
Former East German swimmer Karen Koenig, who is a co-plaintiff in the case, at one point asked Roesler why she never checked for ill effects from the steroids.
Roesler insisted the athletes had regular medical exams and nothing worrying was found.
Suender said only once in his 15-year career did he suspect the steroids of causing a health problem, when a girl came to him with acute liver problems.
He and the others also insisted they were sworn to secrecy about the doping, even when it came to the athletes themselves or their parents.
Because all five made statements before the court, no other witnesses were likely to be called.
A verdict could come as early as Thursday.
Although they could get up to three years in prison, the defendants were expected to receive suspended sentences or fines.
The first trial, which began March 18, involves coaches and doctors from the former communist nation's showcase Dynamo Berlin swim team.
Only one, Dr.
Dinus Bieter, has made a partial confession.
He admitted in court last month that he administered anabolic steroids to athletes, but insisted the doses were too small to cause physical harm and that no one showed ill effects.
His case was severed last week from other five _ four coaches and another doctor _ and resumes Monday, when a verdict could be handed down.
The trial for the others resumes Wednesday, but no verdict was expected.
BERLIN (AP) -- East Germany's former sports chief and his medical director were convicted Tuesday for their roles in a top secret doping program in the former communist country that turned promising young female athletes into souped-up Olympic champions.
Manfred Ewald, 74, and Manfred Hoeppner, 65, were each convicted of 20 counts of being accessories to causing bodily harm for secretly administering steroids to the athletes.
The men allegedly told the athletes they were giving them vitamins.
Ewald was sentenced to 22 months probation; Hoeppner was given 18 months.
The court found them innocent of more serious charges that could have brought jail time.
Prosecutors say the 20 female athletes involved in the case suffered serious side-effects from the drugs, and that Ewald and Hoeppner knew of the potential danger.
''Those responsible have been called to account,'' said Michael Lehner, the attorney for the women.
Defense lawyers said they were considering an appeal.
A member of the communist party's central committee, Ewald was president of East Germany's sports federation from 1961-88 and of its National Olympics Committee from 1973 until the country ceased to exist in 1990.
In its verdict, the court said Ewald was the ''driving force'' behind the doping program and kept it going with ''merciless hardness''.
Hoeppner, as the country's top sports doctor, worked out the details of the doping program -- including the secrecy rules -- and distributed the steroids to the sports doctors and coaches, the court found.
Both shared responsibility for the ''systematic and overall doping in (East German) competitive sports,'' from 1974 until the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the court found.
The court said it handed down a lesser sentence to Hoeppner because he had apologized to the athletes and cooperated with prosecutors in other doping cases.
Ewald never made a direct apology.
Former track star Brigitte Michel, who was in court Tuesday, said she ''can live with'' the verdict even though the men most likely won't have to serve any time behind bars.
They faced a maximum of two years.
''There's no verdict anyway that can make up for the damage suffered,'' she said.
The athletes were seeking a conviction on a more serious charge.
They say the drugs caused them to develop excessive body hair and deep voices and also caused gynecological problems.
The baby of one former athlete was born with deformities allegedly linked to the drugs.
But the court said a direct connection could not be established between the steroids and each individual's specific illness.
The results of the steroid program were dramatic: East Germany, with fewer than 17 million people, went from 20 gold medals in 1972 to 40 in 1976.
East Germans won 11 of 13 events in women's swimming in 1976 and again in 1980.
About 20 former East German coaches, doctors and others have been convicted and given fines, suspended sentences or both.
PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) has pressed for the national federations of Cuba and Jamaica to impose ban on high jumper Javier Sotomayor and sprinter Merlene Ottey for doping failures.
"It is a normal procedure and we do that in every doping case as soon as the B samples prove positive too, regardless of the athlete's fame or celebrity," IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said.
The urge came as Cuban authorities repeatedly said they would stand by Sotomayor, the world record holder, who failed a dope test for cocaine at the Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Canada.
The athletics' world ruling body also prompted the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association (JAAA) to take action against Ottey, whose second urine sample had just been tested positive.
The JAAA will conduct a hearing by November to determine whether it will suspend Ottey from competitions for two years.
Ottey tested positive for the steroid nandrolone at a meet in Lucerne, Switzerland in July and the IAAF disclosed Thursday that the 39-year-old sprinter's "B" sample on September 2, the second urine test, also has tested positive for the drug.
"There are international rules regarding athletes who have had positive dope tests and they should be applied by all national federations.
"But it is up to the national federation to make a decision".
said Reineri.
SYDNEY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Following is the list of competitors suspended from the Sydney Olympics for drugs offences: Olympians dropped before arrival in Sydney: Female weightlifters Chen Jui-lien and Wu Mei-yi of Chinese Taipei dropped by their team for positive tests (September 7) Canadian hammer thrower Robin Lyons dropped from team after testing positive for steroids (September 7) Czech weightlifter Zbynek Vacura dropped from team for testing positive for steroids (September 7) Bulgarian triple and long jumper Iva Prandzheva barred for positive test (September 13) German distance runner Dieter Baumann banned for two years after appeal against positive test is rejected (September 19) Olympians suspended after arrival in Games village for failing pre-Games tests: Weightlifter Chen Po-pu of Chinese Taipei expelled after testing positive for steroids (September 13) Kazakhstan swimmer Yevgeniya Yermakova barred for testing positive for drug masking agent Furosemide in May (September 13) Romania weightlifters Traian Ciharean and Adrian Mateas suspended for testing positive for steroids (September 15) Norwegian weightlifter Stian Grimseth expelled for testing positive for steroids (September 18) Iranian boxer Anosheravan Nourian expelled from Olympics after confirmation he had tested positive for banned drugs Kenyan 4x400m relay star Simon Kemboi banned for testing positive for anabolic steroids (September 19) Olympians caught doping during Sydney Games: Bulgarian 52kg weightlifting silver medallist Ivan Ivanov stripped of medal for positive for banned diuretic (September 20) Belarus hammer thrower Vadim Devyatovsky banned for tested positive for steroid nandrolone (September 20)
SYDNEY, Australia _ As yet another drug scandal struck the Olympic track and field competition on Wednesday, Marion Jones sprinted for the first time since the public announcement that her husband had tested positive for steroids, easily winning her opening heat in the 200 meters.
Minutes before Jones's heat, the gold medal favorite in the women's hammer throw was told while on the track that she was ineligible to compete because she had failed a drug test for the steroid nandrolone.
Mihaela Melinte of Romania, a two-time world champion in the hammer throw, became the seventh person suspended at the Sydney Games for failed drug tests.
She tested positive June 7 at a meet in Milan, track and field's world governing body said.
This was the third drug scandal involving Romanians in Sydney.
Tuesday, the 16-year-old gymnastics all-around champion, Adreea Raducan, was stripped of her gold medal after testing positive for the stimulant ephedrine.
Earlier, the entire Romanian weight-lifting team was expelled after two athletes had tested positive for nandrolone before the Games.
The lifters who had not tested positive were allowed back in after Romanian Olympic officials paid a $50,000 fine.
More than 50 athletes have either withdrawn before the Games or been caught during the Sydney Olympics in drug-related offenses, confirming the belief by many that the use of performance-enhancing drugs is widespread.
This morning Melinte was preparing to warm up for the hammer throw qualifying round when ``she was informed of the reason why she could not compete,'' said Giorgio Reineri, a spokesman for track and field's world governing body, known as the IAAF ``She said she didn't know''.
Nandrolone is the steroid for which the shot-putter C.
&UR; &LR; J.
Hunter, Jones's husband, tested positive for four times this summer, the IAAF said.
Hunter has said that he believed he ingested the substance from taking improperly labeled and contaminated nutritional supplements.
Jones did not refer to her husband's troubles after she won her heat of the women's 200 meters in 22.75 seconds.
She spoke only of her race, saying she was simply trying to conserve energy in the first heat because she had another round of the 200 scheduled for Wednesday night, as well as qualifying for the long jump.
Her awkward form in that event figures to be her biggest impediment to becoming the first female track and field athlete to win five gold medals in one Olympics.
``I stated all along that this day was going to be the most difficult for me because I had two heats of the 200 and the long jump,'' Jones said.
Withdrawing from the 200 was Inger Miller, the 1999 world champion and the only real threat to Jones in the event.
Miller earlier withdrew from the 100 meters, which Jones won last Saturday, after suffering a strained hamstring in training before the Sydney Games.
Miller is still hoping she can run on the American 4x100-meter relay, which is scheduled for Saturday, her agent, Emanuel Hudson, said this morning.
Craig Masback, the chief executive officer of the U.S. track and field federation, said specifically that Miller did not fail a drug test and was eligible to compete in Sydney.
Suzy Favor Hamilton had the fastest time in the preliminary heats of the women's 1,500 meters in 4 minutes 8.08 seconds and is an inviting position now to win the gold medal.
The American champion, Regina Jacobs, withdrew before the Games with a respiratory viral infection.
And on Wednesday, the defending Olympic champion at 800 and 1,500 meters, Svetlana Masterkova of Russia, did not complete her heat of the 1,500.
Masterkova has had surgery on both Achilles' tendons in the past year, and her return to form has been uncertain.
She had dropped any intention of defending her 800-meter title and she had avoided the European racing circuit as she tried to regain her fitness.
She pulled up during on Wednesday's heat and burst into tears as she hobbled off the track.
The other American entrant in the women's 1,500, Marla Runyan, struggled through the first round but qualified for the semifinals in 4:10.83.
Runyan is the first legally blind athlete to make the American team in any sport. &QL;
MADRID, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Spanish pole vaulter Dana Cervantes was tested positive in August for the banned steroid nandrolone, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) said on Wednesday.
The Spaniard tested positive at the European Championships in Budapest on August 16, an IAAF spokesman said, adding "but all the business is currently in the hands of the Spanish federation".
A source close to the Spanish federation said that there were a number of discrepancies surrounding Cervantes' positive sample.
Cervantes took the test at her own request after she was not randomly selected in the qualifying rounds of the championship where she set a Spanish national record and eventually finished 11 th in the finals.
"They (the Spanish federation) asked us to respect the athlete' s confidentiality in this case, which would have been broken if we published her name, although we have been assured by the Spanish federation that she will not compete until the case is clarified," the IAAF spokesman added.
If Cervantes' positive test is confirmed, she could be banned from the sport for two years.
SYDNEY, Australia _ Forty of China's 300 Olympic athletes have withdrawn from the Summer Games, seven of them rowers who failed blood tests at home indicating that they were using performance-enhancing drugs, Olympic officials said Wednesday.
Favored to become the host city for the 2008 Summer Games, Beijing is apparently being extremely careful to avoid another doping scandal like those that tarnished the accomplishments of its swimmers in recent years.
There has also been skepticism about the stunning achievements of China's distance runners in the early 1990s.
It was not known whether the other 33 withdrawals were related to drugs, Sydney Olympic officials stressed.
Milton Cockburn, a spokesman for the Sydney Olympic Organizing Committee, said the withdrawals came after a request that countries pare down their teams or find other housing because the 10,400 available beds could not accommodate every athlete in the Olympic village.
The withdrawal of the seven rowers appears to indicate that the implementation of blood-testing procedures for the first time at these Sydney Games is having some deterrent effect on athletes in endurance sports who may look to cheat by illicitly trying to increase their oxygen-carrying capacity.
The International Olympic Committee last week approved testing for erythropoietin, or EPO, a synthetic version of a naturally-occurring hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells and is believed to be widely used in such endurance sports as distance running, cycling, swimming and rowing.
``People are now convinced there is a test, that the IOC is prepared to apply it and nobody wants to send athletes to the Games that are going to get caught and disgraced,'' said Dick Pound, an IOC vice president from Montreal who is head of the World Anti-Doping Agency, created by the IOC in the wake of the EPO scandal at the 1998 Tour de France.
Extensive drug use will certainly occur at the Sydney Games, IOC officials concede, considering there will be no tests for such performance-enhancers as human growth hormone, insulin growth hormone and artificial blood products.
Steroid use is also so sophisticated that topical gels can be flushed from the system in a matter of hours.
However, the EPO test may deter cheaters and encourage athletes who do not cheat that the playing field is being made more level, Pound said.
``I don't want to be too superlative, but this is a terrific sign,'' Pound said in an interview Wednesday morning.
``You end up with a double benefit''.
The IOC is conducting 2,100 out-of-competition tests in Sydney, including 300 tests for EPO.
Unannounced, out-of-competition tests are considered the only reliable way to catch cheaters.
The EPO test is a combination of a French urine test that can detect direct use of the drug for 2 or 3 days and an Australian blood test that detects indirect use.
Privately, IOC scientists say they are concerned about whether the tests will withstand legal scrutiny.
But the test can be just as valuable if it discourages athletes from using EPO for fear they might be caught, Pound said.
The Chinese rowers, who included Zhang Xiuyun, a gold medalist in the women's single scull at a World Cup race in Zurich, Switzerland, last June, were presumably subjected in China to a hematocrit test that showed high red-blood cell counts, an indirect measure of the use of EPO, Pound said.
Liu Jianyong, secretary general of the Chinese rowing federation, said the rowers had withdrawn to ``protect their health'' _ a euphemism used in drug cases _ and to ``uphold the fairness of the Olympics''.
China has publicly stated its determination to conduct more vigilant drug-testing procedures after being embarrassed repeatedly in recent years.
Unlike the former East Germany, which operated a state-sponsored system of doping, China's doping appears to be conducted largely by individual coaches, according to American coaches and drug experts.
Its female swimmers and distance runners have been far less dominant since the mid-1990s.
More than 30 Chinese swimmers were caught using drugs in the last decade, including seven at the 1994 Asian Games.
One swimmer, Yuan Yuan, was caught with 13 vials of human growth hormone, a steroid, in her luggage at the 1998 world swimming championships in Perth, Australia and four other Chinese women tested positive.
Two months ago, another female swimmer, Wu Yanyan, the world champion in the 200-meter individual medley, failed a drug test at the Chinese national championships and was banned for four years.
ATLANTA _ It's no longer a secret.
Many male athletes are supplementing their fitness techniques of chugging milk and lifting weights with performance-enhancing drugs.
The temptation also is becoming too great for some female athletes to resist.
Substances such as anabolic steroids have a more dramatic effect on them than on men, because the testosterone in their bodies gets a bigger boost.
_ According to the most recent Youth Risk Behavior Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2.4 percent of female high-school students acknowledged using the illegal steroids, compared with 4.9 percent of males.
_ A survey of youngsters at four Massachusetts middle schools, published this spring in the journal Pediatrics, found that 2.6 percent of girls were users, barely behind the 2.8 percent rate for boys.
_ In his book, ``The Steroids Game,'' Penn State professor Charles Yesalis estimates the use of steroids among female college athletes at 5 percent in swimming, 6 percent in basketball and 10 percent in track and field.
``When there is increased competition and more at stake,'' Yesalis said, ``potential pro outlets and potential scholarships because of Title IX, you're going to see more people willing to cheat to gain an advantage over their opponent.
``You're seeing an increased number of parents, similar with teenage boys, that get carried away.
They don't provide their kids with a moral and ethical foundation, where they know there are certain boundaries you shall not cross in pursuit of victory''.
There is no mistaking the dangers of steroids for women, with documentation provided by recent trials involving trainers and coaches from the former East German sports empire.
Heidi Krieger, 1986 European shot put champion, was given mysterious blue pills that she thought were vitamins.
She developed facial hair and a dramatically enlarged Adam's apple.
Krieger recently announced plans to sue the coaches and trainers for allegedly force-feeding her steroids without her knowledge.
Krieger had a sex-change operation and changed her first name to Andreas.
``I trusted them, but they took advantage of me,'' Krieger testified at a trial of East German officials, some of whom admitted to supplying drugs to athletes.
Some sports leaders in the former Soviet Union and, more recently, China also have incorporated steroids into building strong women's programs.
The carrot dangling in front of them is the relative newness of women's sports, which allows countries to make inroads more quickly than in men's athletics.
``We think it is easier for the women to shoot into international fame,'' said professor Tian Maijiu, vice president of the Beijing Institute of Physical Education.
Chinese officials adamantly deny existence of a state-run doping program, claiming instead that individual coaches push too hard.
The fact is that at least 23 Chinese athletes, mostly women, have tested positive for steroids since 1990.
When the Chinese women's swim team arrived in Australia for the world championships in January, customs officials uncovered 13 vials labeled ``growth hormone'' in an athlete's luggage.
Four of those swimmers were banned this summer for two years.
A case study on the striking influence of steroids on women is the East German runner Marita Koch, whose 47.60 seconds for the 400 meters in 1985 is a world mark that still stands.
It turns out that Koch had been doping with Oral-Turinabol, a testosterone-based steroid, for at least four years leading up to her record run.
``Women have relatively little (testosterone) and now, with testosterone-based anabolic steroids, you can double, triple, even increase by 10 times the amount (in their bodies),'' said Jaci Van Heest, director of exercise physiology for U.S.
Swimming. ``The bang for the buck is much greater than doing it to a guy because they already have the natural amount.
``Then, you have the huge growth in women's sports, and there are a lot of issues that make it fertile ground for any kind of cheating''.

LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ When the International Olympic Committee gathers today, the debate will shift from bribery and graft to the spreading scourge of performance-enhancing drugs.
The three-day world summit on doping, a bid to squash yet another scandal that threatens to turn off corporate sponsors, follows a string of headlines since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
The most damaging came from the Berlin trials of former East German doctors and coaches who harrowingly detailed administering male hormones to young female athletes _ none of whom tested positive in subsequent Olympic competitions _ and from French authorities raiding two cycling teams participating in the Tour de France race last summer and confiscating hundreds of doses of drugs.
The IOC's ethical standards have been questioned because of mounting evidence that some members might have accepted gifts in exchange for votes on Olympic bid cities.
And there is some doubt whether the doping conference is a legitimate avenue for reform or a desperate public relations stunt to cover past failings.
``You would have to be pretty rah-rah about the IOC to believe drug-testing is working,'' said Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor and author of ``Anabolic Steroids in Sport and Exercise''.
``All of this is interwined.
The drug scandals are not separate from the bribes.
This is the modus operandi of this organization.
``It's a business, and drug use is bad for business.
So you cover it up.
You put in place a system that would hoodwink the public, hoodwink the journalists and not really catch anybody, but you can say you have a system.
The problem is, people have become wise to the PR scam''.
As Yesalis and others see it, the Olympic business is that of producing heroes and selling dreams, not exposing drug users and cheats.
Unwittingly, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch hammered home the point last summer with words to a Spanish newspaper he later had to retract.
Samaranch said he wanted to drop some drugs from the banned list and punish only those who took substances harmful to athletes.
He had to be reminded by Prince Alexandre de Merode, head of the IOC Medical Commission, that all of the drugs listed had harmful side effects.
Just before the 1998 Winter Olympics, Samaranch pledged $50 million for an IOC anti-doping campaign that never got off the ground.
This week, he is expected to produce plans to establish an international doping agency and to commit $25 million to anti-doping research, while attempting to bring the various sports federations together on a uniform penalty system for doping offenders.
Former IOC member Robert Helmick said if Samaranch wanted to get rid of the drug problem he would commit at least $200 million to research.
``(The conference) is basically to cover up, to divert attention,'' Helmick said.
Samaranch suggested that de Merode, who oversees the IOC's flawed system, head the new effort, raising doubts about the independence of the agency.
On Monday, such powerful sports federations as soccer (FIFA) and swimming (FINA) opposed an IOC proposal that athletes face life bans and fines of as much as up to $1 million in serious cases of ``intentional doping,'' along with selective bans for some first-time offenders.
The suspicion has lingered for years that the IOC more inclined toward a passive tolerance of doping, with a scant few athletes testing positive, rather than a drug-free Olympics.
Under the Samaranch regime, one-tenth of 1 percent of the athletes tested positive at an Olympiad.
Only two athletes flunked tests for steroids at the Atlanta Games, while the IOC ignored five other samples that were detected by their high-tech equipment and found to contain banned strength-builders.
An arbitration panel threw out the disqualifications of five other athletes who tested positive for using a stimulant.
The disputed steroid samples were tested by a device known as a high-resolution mass spectrometer, which the IOC asked Atlanta Olympic organizers to purchase just months before the Games, at $500,000 each.
De Merode said the tests were declared invalid because the newness of the equipment resulted in ``technical difficulties,'' but the decision still rankles some members of the IOC medical commission.
``The medical commitee never heard any of this,'' Arne Ljungqvist said.
``Of course, it concerns me''.
Questionable drug-testing dates back to the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.
Don Catlin, who assisted in the Atlanta lab and oversaw drug testing in LA, said that nine positive tests turned up ``missing'' after the Los Angeles Games.
Those athletes' initial ``A'' samples proved positive, but there were no tests performed on their ``B'' samples as required to ultimately confirm a positive.
The athletes were never identified.
De Merode has acknowledged that paperwork on the ``A'' tests mysteriously was removed from his room in Los Angeles at the close of the Games.
History reads that the Los Angeles Games produced 10 positive tests, not 19.
``We expected we would be doing 'B' confirmations in the ensuing months, which was the way it had been in Montreal (at the 1976 Olympics),'' Catlin said.
``That never came to pass.
Then, it came out that the codes (numbers assigned in order to conceal the athlete's identity) were somehow shredded or lost.
I don't know where they went.
All I know is there were some cases that did not go to 'B' confirmation''.
Former U.S.
Olympic track coach Pat Connolly has told a Senate judiciary committee she believes ``at least 40 percent of the (U.S).
women's team in Seoul had probably used steroids at sometime in their preparation for the Games''.
None of the Americans tested positive, but the most famous drug case did break in Seoul in 1988 _ Canadian gold-medal sprinter Ben Johnson flunking a test for steroids.
In retrospect, he often is cast not just as a cheater but someone careless enough in his drug use to get caught.
In Seoul, IOC drug testers were aware of Russian sports officials operating a drug lab in a docked ship to monitor their athletes and make sure they would not be shamed by a positive test.
Catlin, who worked in the Seoul lab, said he heard about the Russian ship near the close of the Games.
He later confirmed the story in speaking with two Russian scientists who operated the lab.
``If there is shame in it, it's why the Soviets found it necessary to have a boat to check their athletes at the last minute,'' Catlin said.
``But that is not unlike the situation being revealed during the East German trials.
They did the exact same thing, and the Soviet bloc was very sensitive to these things.
.. . ``Every country, including our own, tests athletes before leaving for the Games.
But there is a difference between the practice and what is done with the results.
If you don't do anything with the positives, and the athletes go to the Games, that is wrong''.
Even in the U.S., testing is embroiled in controversy.
The U.S.
Olympic Commitee administers its own drug-testing program rather than contracting with an independent agency.
Its own advisory panel concluded that the current arrangement is a conflict because the USOC supports the same athletes financially.
Only about half of the 150-200 athletes targeted each month for random tests wind up being checked, a USOC drug-testing official acknowledged.

An over-the-counter supplement called ``andro,'' made popular when baseball slugger Mark McGwire admitted using it in 1998, raises testosterone and estrogen above normal levels and could be dangerous, according to a Harvard study financed by Major League Baseball and its players union.
However, hormone levels receded after its use was stopped.
The study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first to conclude that high doses of the steroid hormone can elevate testosterone levels.
However, the trial lasted just one week, and did not measure whether the dietary supplement can do what its producers say it can: increase muscle size and mass.
Nor did the study conclude whether the supplement has long-term side effects.
Androstenedione is naturally produced in both men and women, and converts to either testosterone or to an estrogen.
Testosterone is the body's major muscle builder.
The pill, legal and sold over-the-counter, is banned by the International Olympic Committee, the National Football League and the National Collegiate Athletic Association.
Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League has no restriction regarding its use.
Little is known about andro, which became available in the United States several years ago even though it was developed in the 1970s by the East Germans to enhance their athletes' Olympic performance.
Dr. Benjamin Z.
Leder, an endocrinologist at the Harvard-affliated Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who led the study, said men showed increased testosterone levels when andro was taken for seven days in a single daily 300 milligram dose.
On the Internet, pills available are in doses of 50 to 300 milligrams.
The 42 subjects, ages 20 to 40, were divided into three groups and received either no androstenedione, 100 mg daily or 300 mg daily.
In the 300 mg group, testosterone levels in the blood increased by an average of 34 percent by the seventh day, though levels had returned to normal by the following day.
Although the study only looked at if the supplement increased hormone levels, Leder noted that long-term increases in testosterone or estrogen can have serious side effects.
Side effects include stunted growth for young people, increased aggressiveness, and lower levels of ``good'' cholesterol, which could increase risk of heart disease.
Men with elevated estrogen levels sometimes grow breasts and suffer shrunken testicles, while women with elevated testosterone can develop masculine traits, such as deepening of voice and extra hair.
In a eight-week study by Douglas King at Iowa State University published in JAMA last June, King found that andro caused none of the expected increases in blood levels of testosterone and no enhanced strength.
However, the 300 mg dosages were given in 100 mg increments three times a day.
Leder said that their study also found that 100 milligrams is too small a dose to increase testosterone levels.
``I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone to take it,'' said King, associate professor of health and human performance at Iowa State.
And King warned that because the testosterone levels do not stay elevated for very long, people may take it several times a day to keep levels elevated, which could be dangerous.
For now, Major League Baseball does not plan to change its policy.
``That androstenedione, when taken in higher than suggested doses, elevates testosterone levels, appears to be a significant contribution to the science surrounding its use,'' said Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig.
But he and Don Fehr, director of the players union, said that more research is needed.
Mark McGwire of the St.
Louis Cardinals has said that he has since stopped using the supplement.
While some of the professional sports leagues are still waiting for more data, their team doctors have come out against the supplement.
The Association of Professional Team Physicians, an organization comprised of team physicians of the NBA, NHL, MLB, and NFL said in 1998 that it recommended androstenedione be taken off the consumer market, reclassified as a controlled substance available only by prescription, and it urged the drug be banned from competitive sports.
``The study fortifies our position,'' said Dr.
William Straw, who is the team physician for the San Jose Sharks, a National Hockey League team, and was the team physician for baseball's San Francisco Giants for 13 years.
``From a medical point of view, the study justifies physicians' concern that andro is potentially harmful, like any other anabolic steroid,'' said Straw.
``By its chemical composition, it is an anabolic steroid''.
Straw criticized drug deregulation laws in 1994 for allowing such easy access to supplements like andro.
``These things are out of control,'' said Straw.
John Brennan, spokesman of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, said the federal government is studying if androstenedione ``fits all the elements of a steroid, which is a banned substance''.
If andro does, then it would probably be reclassified so that it could not be taken without a doctor's prescription, said Brennan.
When Samantha Reeves, a well-regarded amateur finding her way through her freshman season on the women's professional tennis circuit, wanted to hustle herself back into shape after sustaining an ankle injury late in 1997, she said she decided to experiment with a newfangled ``all-natural'' dietary supplement, apparently on the recommendation of a friend.
The product promised to help her burn fat and build muscle, and it was readily available over the counter at health-food stores.
It sounded like the answer to her prayers: a training and diet aid that would help her get fit fast and get back to the business of cracking the top 100 in women's tennis.
Instead, Reeves' decision to use the product backfired badly.
Required to submit a urine sample at an event last December as part of tennis' effort to detect improper drug use, Reeves failed the test.
The dietary product, it turned out, had contained Nor-Andro 19, a variation on the classic steroid nandrolone and one of the substances banned by the sport.
And so Reeves, despite her argument that she had no intention of taking anything aimed at improperly aiding her performance, became the first female tennis player ever to have tested positive for steroids.
``I have never knowingly done anything that would be harmful to my tennis career,'' Reeves said in a statement that her family released after her test result was made public this summer.
The International Tennis Federation, which governs the sport, ultimately did not suspend or otherwise discipline Reeves, who was ranked No.
1 in the U.S.
Girls 18's in 1996, is currently ranked 106th in the world, and is undecided about whether to accept a college scholarship or turn pro.
Citing her age _ she turned 19 earlier this year _ and inexperience, and apparently accepting her claim that she was unaware of the presence of steroids in the product, the ITF instead called the long and embarrassing ordeal of testing, investigation and public disclosure ``a sanction in itself''.
ITF spokesman Alun James said the investigation ``proved Reeves guilty of taking the banned substance and, although the decision against any further punishment is arguably lenient, if caught again, she could face a life ban as a second offender''.
Reeves' case highlights a little discussed but troubling question for tennis: With the easy availability of illicit steroids, and the simultaneous explosion of fitness and muscle-building products that are sold legally but often with little warning about what they contain, how many players are trying to gain an inappropriate edge?
Only one other player, Ignacio Truyol of Spain, has ever been formally detected of having used steroids.
Can tennis fairly and effectively police such use and the cheating _ either brazen or accidental _ that results?
``Tennis is a sport I would not have thought would be steroid-involved, but there's tons of steroids out there these days, and they're not all coming from the black market,'' said Dr.
Alan Jones, a pharmaceutics professor at the University of Mississippi who acts as the toxicology consultant for the company that administers drug testing for the men's ATP and women's WTA tours and for the ITF.
Jones said numerous high-tech or nouveau steroids are being marketed as simple food supplements and training aids and sold everywhere from the Internet to health-food stores.
``It's conceivable that a player could be oblivious to the fact that they're using something that contains an anabolic substance,'' Jones said.
``They think: It's natural, it's pure, it's good for me.
And that is an absolute fallacy''.
Considering the plethora of legal products, such as creatine, available to athletes looking to boost their endurance, maximize their workouts and stave off flab, athletes subject to drug testing evidently cannot be too careful about what they ingest.
Whether in the guise of vitamins, hormone supplements or food additives, there is apparently a synthetically engineered anabolic look-alike out there for everyone, whether the athletes are looking to raise a barbell or their tennis ranking.
While less invasive than the EPO-type injectables that recently tarnished cycling's Tour de France, or the substances currently muddying the reputation of Irish swimmer Michelle Smith de Bruin, anabolics such as norandrolone, which is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, are far from benign.
And once these legal additives break down in the system, a steroid by any other name tends to turn into a steroid.
The Nor-Andro 19 in the supplement Reeves chose is a product that, according to Jones, ``is the new kid on the block, the popular one right now.
It's not a testosterone type of steroid, and the labs originally weren't testing for it.
It's offered as a food supplement and marketed as a performance and training enhancer that increases muscle strength, mass and endurance''.
Jones did say he was unaware of the product's ever having been marketed as a weight-loss product.
Tennis has stepped up its testing and the detection efforts of its anti-doping program, which is modeled on the one used by the International Olympic Committee.
The ITF, in conjunction with the WTA and ATP tours, conducts roughly 1,000 tests each year, all of them random and 10 percent of them in locations other than the site of tournaments.
The cost to the three tennis organizations is approximately $500,000 per year, and so far, the only other player found guilty of using steroids is the 23-year-old Truyol, who said he took them on the advice of his physician when recovering from an injury.
``No sport is immune anymore,'' said Dr.
Donna Smith of Substance Abuse Management, the company that administers tennis' anti-doping program.
``Wherever you have issues of injury recovery and athletes intent on maximizing their training, you're going to see this stuff.
``Our window of detection is small, because most of these products clear the system within five days, and although we'd like to do more off-site testing, it's prohibitively expensive.
You always feel like you're one step behind''.
nn According to the Reeves family, Samantha's use of the steroid was purely accidental.
The only people more surprised than the player herself were her parents, Jack and Jill Reeves.
Their teen-age daughter was fixated on losing weight, Jack Reeves said, and, unbeknownst to him and his wife, bought the supplement.
When the family was notified, by fax, of the positive test and was asked to provide a record of every medication Samantha had ingested, steroids were not initially revealed as the culprit behind the positive reading, Jack Reeves said.
Then came a phone call that informed them of the source of the positive result: The illegal nandrolone metabolites in her system were traced to Nor-Andro 19.
Just after the conclusion of Wimbledon last month, the ITF announced that Reeves had tested positive for anabolic steroids.
``We thought it was good news that they'd figured out how the stuff got into her system; we thought that was the end of it,'' said Jack Reeves, who would not permit his daughter to be interviewed.
``Then we were told the review board had decided to pursue the case and test a second sample.
It's a kind of guilty-until-proven-innocent process where you're dealing with a lot of nameless, faceless parties.
They do hold a player responsible for whatever is in their system, and they're not particularly interested in how it got there.
You'd have to be a molecular biologist to know this would occur.
``It's been a very troublesome, frustrating experience; tennis is such a mental game, and this has put a lot of extra pressure on her,'' he said.
``These days, Samantha won't drink a glass of water without having it analyzed''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) The Reeves had allowed their daughter to leave high school in Wisconsin for Dennis Van Der Meer's Tennis Academy in Hilton Head, S.C., after she was selected for the U.S.
Tennis Association National Junior Team in 1995 and '96.
Then, her parents let her take a year off between high school graduation in 1997 and college to test the waters on the circuit while retaining her college eligibility.
They had expected to spend the first half of 1998 monitoring their daughter's progress on the WTA Tour; instead, they spent it helping her weather the six-month investigation by the ITF's anti-doping panel.
In addition to being the first female tennis player ever to fail a drug test of any sort, Reeves is also the first player to fail a test but escape the mandatory one-year suspension for players found guilty of using a Class One banned substance.
On the men's side, Truyol was suspended for a year in January 1997, and Mats Wilander and Karel Novacek were previously fined and suspended after testing positive for cocaine.
If only two players have tested positive after thousands of tests, does it mean that tennis can rest assured it has no steroid problem?
Some players say no.
Jim Courier, who trained his way to the No.
1 ranking and four Grand Slam singles championships without steroid shortcuts, said: ``If being big and strong were the main criteria for being a good player, then weight lifters would be the best.
But I can see where this stuff might help out some of the more slight guys, because it can make you train like an animal.
``No one worked harder on their training than I did, and it disgusts me to think I may have lost matches to guys who've been juicing and cycling it out of their systems in time for competition,'' he said.
``Boris Becker once said that if he knew for sure everybody else was using steroids, then he would too; well, not me.
I don't want kidney problems at 45''.
Courier recalled a poll of Olympians that asked whether the athletes would take a drug that guaranteed them a medal even if it also guaranteed terminal health trouble by mid-life: ``I guess it's the James Dean thing, live fast, die young, leave a beautiful corpse _ and a gold medal''.
Debbie Graham, a WTA Tour veteran, said: ``I think there's a lot of it going on because of the pressures in women's sports, and not just to win.
There's a lot of pressure for a woman to look fit in front of a crowd''.
As far as Samantha Reeves is concerned, she continued to play sporadically this year and Tuesday received a wild-card berth for the U.S.
Open later this month.
``I'm anxious to put the entire experience behind me,'' she said in a statement she gave to the U.S.
Tennis Association.
Truyol, whose suspension ended in January, has not returned to the ATP Tour and no longer holds a ranking.
Experts who study the effects of synthetic anabolic steroids are encouraged, for two distinctly different reasons, that two new trials of their use show a benefit for two groups of very sick people.
One reason is the possible long-term benefits for the patients.
But the other is that the trials may serve as a reminder of whom the drugs were not intended for: healthy people who use them in ways that can destroy their health.
The trials, reported last week, found that taking anabolic steroids helped kidney dialysis patients and people with HIV regain some of the weight they had been losing uncontrollably as a result of their illnesses.
Dr. Gary Wadler, an anabolic-steroid authority at New York University Medical Center, points out that the first widespread use of the drug came after World War II for people who were wasting away from illnesses or injuries suffered in the war or in concentration camps.
It was for these people, the very sick, that steroids were developed, he said, not for healthy athletes seeking to build bigger muscles to improve their athletic performance.
The latter include baseball's new home-run king, Mark McGwire, who says he regularly takes androstenedione, a precursor steroid that quickly becomes anabolic once taken into the body.
Professional baseball, unlike other sports, has not banned this substance.
Medical experts say athletes frequently take anabolic steroids in doses high enough to have dangerous consequences, with some users known to have taken 10 to 100 times the recommended dosage.
These steroids are synthesized from human testosterone, the hormone responsible for male characteristics like increased muscle tissue, facial hair and a deep voice.
Testosterone's effect as a muscle builder was discovered more than 100 years ago by the French physician Charles-Edouard Brown-Sequard, who in 1889 injected animal extracts into a dog and then into himself.
At the time, he hypothesized that added testosterone would be good for human health.
``Brown-Sequard overinterpreted what was happening, but he turned out to be onto something, as history has shown,'' Wadler said.
The synthetic forms of testosterone were designed to replace the body's normal supply of the hormone, which can be depleted by disease, and to help the patient regain strength, Wadler said in ``Drugs and the Athlete'' (Oxford Press), regarded as the definitive textbook on the subject.
Dr. Peter Goldberg, a consulting physician for the U.S.
Olympic Committee, expressed similar concern about the expanding use of steroids, especially among teen-agers.
Adolescent females are now the fastest growing group of users.
With a colleague, Dr.
Diane Elliot, Goldberg recently completed a program for 3,200 athletes in 31 high schools in Oregon and Washington among whom steroid use was reduced by a reported 50 percent.
In the clinical trials of anabolic steroids for kidney-dialysis and HIV patients, low doses were used to reverse previously uncontrollable weight loss, which has been associated with sharply reduced life spans among these groups.
The patients, in the two separate studies reported last week in The Journal of the American Medical Association, were given the steroids in conjunction with exercise programs.
Both groups of patients increased muscle mass significantly more than a group given a placebo, and increased their abilities to do more exercise faster while becoming less fatigued.
More studies are needed to determine how much and for how long steroids can be safely used, the doctors who directed the studies said.
But they pointed out that the doses used by the athletes were much higher.
Weighing medical uses against the uses to enhance athletic performance, those who take steroids must ask: What is a safe dose and when does a dose become dangerous?
The second question is being urgently studied at a number of major institutions.
In the meantime, Wadler said, all science really knows on the subject is this: It has been found safe to increase the amount of testosterone or testosterone substitute to the normal level among sick people whose supply has become depleted.
But at some level above this, the substitutes can have disastrous results.
The list of problems doctors cite is very long: liver tumors, uncontrollably violent behavior, elevated cholesterol, enlarged veins in the liver that cause fatal bleeding, permanent stunting of growth in adolescents, and blood clotting that leads to premature stroke and heart attacks.
The list of less serious but nevertheless undesirable effects is also long and includes large breasts in men and beards in women.
SEATTLE _ Mark McGwire's record-setting home run race made 1998 a banner year for baseball and sports in general.
But it also made it a banner year for an issue far more serious and potentially devastating: athletes using performance-enhancing substances to build bigger and stronger bodies.
McGwire's admission that he used two supplements, creatine and androstenedione or ``andro,'' suddenly put new light on a decades-old battle to stem the use of anabolic steroids and other so-called ergogenic aids in athletic competition.
With McGwire's admission has come a new set of concerns: (BBOX)That more young athletes will attempt to use supplements as a way of improving performance, fitness and recovery from injuries, instead of building body strength naturally.
(BBOX)That the supplements will be lumped together and considered to be medically sound simply because they are available over the counter or via mail order.
(BBOX)That policies such as the University of Washington's to administer creatine to athletes might some day create great liability if medical complications are found in the future.
(BBOX)That while creatine is considered medically safe, andro is considered to be an anabolic steroid that can lead to several potentially life-threatening diseases.
Linking the two and using both without proper medical supervision could prove dangerous.
While McGwire will go down in the history books as the unqualified home run champion for a single season, other athletes who used similar substances last year faced far different repercussions.
Most recently, Petr Korda was forced to forfeit his rankings points and $94,529 in prize money from Wimbledon after the International Tennis Federation found he tested positive for an anabolic steroid.
His attempt to defend his 1998 Australian Open title ended over the weekend, but his appearance stirred controversy among his fellow players, who question how Korda could have been allowed to compete.
Despite warnings from the medical community and ethical questions about unfair competition, athletes like McGwire and Korda are big-name indicators that supplements have become ingrained at all levels in the world of athletics.
``We can easily blame ourselves and society for putting professional and high-level collegiate athletes on such a pedestal that it's going to influence our high school athletes,'' said Dr.
Mark S.
Juhn of the University of Washington's Primary Care Center Sports Medicine Clinic.
``I think that's a shame, but it's reality''.
According to the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, up to 13 percent of all high school athletes use anabolic steroids and 40 percent of those athletes believe the illegal drug is not harmful.
Supplement use appears to be starting at younger ages.
A study published in May by the journal Pediatrics found that nearly 3 percent of boys and girls at four Massachusetts middle schools were using anabolic steroids to build bigger bodies for sports.
``It's ubiquitous, there's no doubt about that,'' said Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor of health and human development who has written a book on the subject, ``The Steroids Game''.
McGwire's admitted use makes him ``a very poor role model for kids, and he can argue that it's legal to buy in society, but that's merely a loophole in the laws.
He can say anything he wants, but it's a drug''.
Patrick Olsen, president of the Washington Vocational Sports Medicine Association and the head athletic trainer at South Kitsap High School, has seen the problem first-hand and believes McGwire's admission has only clouded the issue.
``Anyone who wants to be good at whatever they do has some sort of a hero.
And if their hero is using (a performance supplement), then they will be more susceptible to it,'' Olsen said.
``They think, `This can't hurt me because I don't have to have a prescription for it'.
They fail to realize that you can buy arsenic too, but you wouldn't want to use it''.
The issue becomes all the more confusing to the average young athlete because creatine and andro are two entirely different supplements.
Creatine is an amino acid powder found naturally in skeletal muscle, heart, brain, testes and other tissues.
It is classified as a dietary supplement that enhances muscle growth and weight gain, and not a drug.
``Creatine is acceptable, and it does enhance performance,'' Yesalis said.
``Although, if you could get the proper dose of creatine in the food supply, why would anybody pay for it?
It will cost you $40 to $50 a month''.
Andro, on the other hand, is considered an anabolic steroid because taken as a pill it raises the level of the male hormone testosterone, and users claim it builds muscle mass and helps speed recovery from sports-related injuries.
Because it is still available at many vitamin stores, mail-order businesses and Internet suppliers, andro is not considered an illegal substance by major league baseball or the NBA, which ban only illegal drugs.
Because of the controversy surrounding McGwire's use of andro, baseball commissioner Bud Selig and players union head Donald Fehr have appointed a committee to study whether it should be banned, but the committee has yet to reach a conclusion.
Andro, however, already has been banned by the International Olympic Committee, the NCAA and the ATP tennis tour, and the NFL has banned its use since 1996, primarily because it can be classified with other steroids.
While the method of taking the steroid is far different from the injections athletes once used, many experts believe the basic health repercussions are the same: excessive acne, shrinkage of the testicles or uterus, and potentially life-threatening ailments such as liver damage, premature heart disease and cancer.
While McGwire can set the home run record using andro, other athletes haven't been so lucky.
Gold medal shot-putter Randy Barnes, the world-record holder, drew a lifetime ban last year for testing positive for andro.
And in September, Pittsburgh Steelers offensive tackle Paul Wiggins was suspended for four games after admitting he used the substance.
Use of creatine, however, hasn't yet been banned by any sports organization, although there is plenty of debate about its effects and potential long-term health risks.
``Some of our athletes have been using creatine for three years or so,'' South Kitsap's Olsen said.
``It's not something we supply, it's not something we tell our kids they have to be on.
They go out to their own people and do their own thing on it''.
Creatine currently is the supplement of choice for body building, primarily because it is not an anabolic steroid and because so many athletes endorse its use.
At the University of Washington, strength and conditioning coach Rick Huegli said creatine has been dispensed to many athletes under his direct supervision, with little or no apparent ill effects.
``It enhances the short-term burst energy system,'' Huegli said, adding that most of the benefit comes during weightlifting training, rather than in on-field performance.
Huegli advises athletes to begin a program of better nutrition and training without the use of supplements before trying anything like creatine.
But he says athletes will always be tempted to use supplements because it ``helps them recover better and train longer and harder''.
In the past, Huegli said the UW would dispense a one-month supply of creatine to any athlete who wanted to use it, but the school has recently discontinued the practice for fear of liability should an athlete develop a medical problem in the future.
Athletes now must buy their own supply.
It's not hard to find young athletes who have used creatine.
One high school football player, Brian, of Mountlake Terrace, said he began using the supplement last year in an attempt to build more muscle mass and help him during offseason weight training.
He learned about creatine from other players who were using it on a regular basis.
But after experiencing some weight gain, he soon decided that the expense wasn't worth the results he was seeing.
``I just felt that it was better to do it naturally,'' he said.
Another high school football player, a 17-year-old from Edmonds, still uses creatine and says he grew from 167 pounds to 190 pounds in about six months after using the supplement and increasing his workouts.
``It doesn't work unless you also work harder, but it helps you work harder,'' he said.
The medical jury still is out on creatine, but it appears to be far safer than an anabolic steroid or a product such as andro.
However, there are few studies on its effects on adolescents, and none on long-term effects.
``It's very difficult to separate fact from hype when it comes to creatine,'' said Juhn of UW's sports medicine clinic.
``Creatine has some potential, but people have this underlying assumption that it works for everything, but it doesn't''.
For example, it doesn't help sprinters or distance people in track or swimming, said Juhn, who recently published a study on potential side effects of creatine in the Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine.
Juhn says the weight gain associated with creatine is largely due to water storage.
``The big issue is, in the long-term, does creatine improve strength?
That's up for debate right now,'' he said.
With concern being voiced by doctors such as Juhn, trainers like Olsen are all the more wary of its potential for abuse.
``There's no long-term study done on creatine, so you have no information from 10 years out,'' Olsen said.
From the information he has seen, Olsen believes there are several reasons to beware of the supplement: dehydration, possible kidney problems and cost.
He reports some young athletes spend hundreds of dollars on the product with minimal results.
Compared to andro or other steroids, creatine ``is probably the least harmful, but in 10 years you might have some kid who took three or four times the normal dose and find it was overworking the kidneys or something like that,'' Olsen said.
``If you get a symptom such as kidney failure 15 years down the road, how do you relate that back to their creatine use''?
There have been some benefits, Olsen said, noting some athletes have gained 10 to 15 pounds in weight and muscle mass.
``But once they get off of it, they lose maybe half that weight,'' he said.
``It takes so much water to digest that protein''.
Juhn notes that creatine is found not only in muscles, but in the brain, the heart, the liver and testicles.
``We haven't really studied what taking oral levels of creatine does to creatine levels elsewhere,'' he said.
``I'm saying we don't know.
... For all we know, creatine might be the safest thing in the world, but we haven't proven that''.
Olsen says he doesn't know of any of his athletes who are currently taking andro, but he's convinced that many kids are trying it.
``I bet if you talk to kids, most would say they're not scared by it,'' he said.
``It's the idea, would you trade a gold medal if you could only live five years?
Yeah, give me the gold medal''.
Yesalis believes there will always be some new product on the market that will attract athletes.
One is human growth hormone, which is used as an ergogenic supplement by body builders and has such a short half-life it is nearly impossible to detect by standard drug-testing methods.
Yesalis contends that many athletes who use creatine or andro do so to mask their hidden use of human growth hormone to build even bigger bodies.
``Some athletes have been using creatine and andro as a smokescreen for their use of other more potent supplements,'' he said.
With so many athletes using such products, there might be no way to turn back the tide short of drug testing at every level of athletics.
``I'm disturbed by the emphasis put on supplements when we should be thinking about the most proven method of enhancing athletic performance, which is dedication, perseverance, hard work and practice,'' Juhn said.
``It's really discouraging, what's happening now.''
HOUSTON _ During a U.S.
Gymnastics meet last March in Baytown, Texas, a teen-age contestant approached one of the visiting members of the Olympic team and asked what he could do to gain strength.
``Lift weights,'' he was told.
``And eat your Wheaties''.
``Wheaties''? ``Special Wheaties,'' the older gymnast said, with a grin and a wink.
The teen-ager asked no more questions.
He understood the coded message: steroids.
Anabolic steroids, which made their first impact on athletic competition with the world-record weightlifting performances by the 1956 Russian Olympic team, are still in prominent use despite the health hazards they pose.
Last month, Olympic shot-put champion Randy Barnes tested positive _ for the second time in his career _ for performance-enhancing banned substances.
Also failing his steroid test, at about the same time, was Olympic sprinter Dennis Mitchell, a bronze medalist in 1992.
Anabolic (which means ``building'') steroids were made illegal in the United States in 1990, except with medical prescription.
They are designed to imitate testosterone or to stimulate its production.
Testosterone, a male sex hormone (also found in small amounts in women), induces growth of skeletal muscles.
But at the dosage levels needed to build muscle, the steroids put so much strain on the liver, kidneys and heart that the athlete risks death before the age of 50.
Pro football star Lyle Alzado and many weightlifting competitors of the 1970s died young, ravaged by tumors and cardiac disease.
Dr. Bill Bryan of the Baylor Sports Medicine Institute in Houston believes steroid use has declined in the past decade.
But he said, ``Once you get into the elite levels of athletics, the least bit of performance enhancement becomes important, and those people will try all the tricks''.
This summer, the sport of bicycle racing has been scandalized by EPO, which stands for erythropoietin (eri-throw-poy-i-tin).
This is a steroid that stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the muscles.
EPO is a significant performance enhancer for endurance athletes, such as five Tour de France bicyclists who recently disqualified themselves by admitting use of the banned substance.
Dr. Gerald Gremion, after resigning his position of consultant for Swiss bicycle teams, said ``almost all'' the Tour de France cyclists use performance-enhancing drugs.
He told reporters in Europe: ``Each racer had his little suitcase with dopes and syringes''.
&QL; FOILING TESTS &QL; &QL; Like other steroids, EPO has legitimate medical purposes, when used in moderate amounts.
A protein-carbohydrate compound, EPO is helpful in treating kidney disease, AIDS and cancer.
But it is dangerous when taken in dosages large enough to affect performance in a marathon run or a bicycle race.
``The problem,'' said Dr.
Kenneth Renney of Sports Medicine Associates in Houston, ``is that you don't know exactly how much to use and what the effects are.
If you get too many blood cells, you can get sluggish, and the blood thickens''.
That leaves athletes at risk of blood-clotting, stroke and heart attacks.
In the past 20 years, EPO has been implicated in more than two dozen deaths in cycling.
EPO usually goes undetected because tests cannot distinguish between the hormone produced by the kidneys from the laboratory version.
But when blood tests reveal an excessive percentage of red blood cells, the athlete is presumed to be using EPO illegally and is suspended for two weeks.
EPO is one of at least 20 anabolic steroids prohibited by the International Olympics Committee.
New ones are constantly being invented.
No sooner is one blacklisted than another emerges to confound drug testers.
Many Olympic athletes try to foil the tests by using masking agents or a new batch of difficult-to-trace water-based steroids.
Renney, a crew chief of the U.S.
Olympic drug-testing committee, said, ``There's no masking agent that will keep steroids from being detected.
That's why some athletes fail the test.
But they can use diuretics that will get the steroids out of their system quickly, and they can use some new steroids that are water-based, that clear the body a lot faster that the oil-based ones''.
Bryan said tests will be developed that will make it more difficult for athletes to cheat with steroids.
``A Japanese company is developing biological markers that will detect the steroids people are taking,'' he said.
``The technology may be at that level to test the athletes at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
We'll be able to shut down the use of anabolic steroids significantly''.
Until then, many athletes engage in a delicate balancing act, trying to take as many hormone supplements as they can _ legal and illegal _ without exceeding the limits of red blood count or the 6-to-1 ratio between testosterone and its metabolic breakdown product of epitestosterone.
&QL; THE ADDICTION &QL; &QL; Dr.
Greg Hoover, a sports medicine specialist in Houston, said new products allow athletes to fine-tune the testosterone level.
``Some athletes are using testosterone patches that release the testosterone into the body at a gradual, lower dose,'' he said, ``like a Nicorette patch''.
Renney explained that the testosterone limit was set to take into account that ``everyone is going to have some type of level of anabolic steroids, since they are found naturally in the body''.
Although men generally have a testosterone/epi ratio of 3 to 1 or 4 to 1, some are naturally as high as 6 to 1.
``Most people could take anabolic steroids and still be within that approved level,'' Renney said.
``You can look at the tests, and you may know the athlete is on steroids, but there's nothing you can do about it''.
Mitchell, ironically a vocal opponent of steroids, tested over the limit.
Barnes, who formerly competed for Texas A&AMP;M University in College Station, Texas, was cited for using androstenedione, which is found in wild yams and is legal in the United States and most other countries but has been banned from Olympic competition because of its steroidlike qualities.
While Olympic athletes, such as Barnes and Mitchell, occasionally slip up and get caught, Renney said, ``If they want to do it, they're going to find a way to beat the system''.
It would be naive to think anabolic steroids have been eradicated from the National Football League, which has a limited drug-testing program, or from Major League Baseball, which has no drug-testing program at all.
Since possession of anabolic steroids is illegal, no big-leaguers admit, on the record, to using them.
But some say, anonymously, that about 30 percent of the hitters include them in their muscle-building program.
Phil Garner, manager of the Milwaukee Brewers, said, ``There was one kid, 27, who was cycling steroids, and I asked him, `Do you realize you could need an artificial heart when you're 40 years old'?
``He said, `I don't care what happens at 40.
All I want to do is be the biggest, baddest guy I can be right now'''.
That was the thinking of Mike Spinelli, a 1995 fourth-round draft choice of the Boston Red Sox, who began ingesting steroids at 18.
In two years, Spinelli's 6-2 frame filled out from 180 to 245 pounds.
But he did not pitch well: 4-10 with a 5.57 ERA in two minor-league seasons.
Aware that he was addicted to steroids, Spinelli checked himself into the Hazelden Foundation in Minnesota last February.
``I just thank God I was able to get out of this,'' he said, ``before it killed me''.
&QL; &QL; THE TEMPTATION &QL; &QL; Athletes _ and even nonathletes _ much younger than Spinelli have been turning to steroids.
A report by the National Clearinghouse on Alcohol and Drug Abuse estimates that half a million Americans under the age of 18 are using illegal steroids.
A recent survey of 965 pupils in Massachusetts middle schools found that 2.7 percent admitted to using anabolic steroids, with the percentages almost the same for girls as for boys.
Some were as young as 10 years old.
Apparently, parents are buying these substances on the black market and passing them on to their athlete children.
But studies also have shown that about 40 percent of the high school students using steroids are doing so not to compete in sports but to improve their appearance.
Charles Yesalis, a Ph.D. at Penn State University, recently reported that about 1 percent of girls in grades eight through 12 have used anabolic hormones _ a 100 percent increase by this group since 1996.
Among teen-age males, steroid use had remained stable at about 4 percent.
Such figures dismay Garner, who has seen the alarming effects of steroids on men in their 20s.
``You'd see guys suddenly add a lot of muscle,'' Garner said.
``They'd say, `I'm just lifting weights'.
But then you'd see them tear up phone booths at night and lift cars at odd hours, and you'd say, `You're doing something else'''.
Garner understands the temptation.
``You realize you can't compete against somebody doing steroids,'' he said.
``They're faster, quicker, stronger''.
In 1988, he looked to steroids as a means of delaying the end of his playing career.
He thought they might help him regain the 10 pounds of muscle mass he had lost after back surgery.
``I only knew one player who had done steroids at that time, and I talked with him about using them to put muscle back on,'' Garner said.
``But I had some friends who were doctors, and they told me, `You might have heart disease in 10 years'''.
He decided he didn't want to sacrifice years of life for a few extra glory days.
``But the kids today''? he said.
``I don't know if they're thinking about the future''.
&QL; XXXX END OF STORY &QL;
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Two Moroccan female athletes have been stripped of gold and bronze medals for using a muscle-building steroid in the first reported cases of doping at the Arab Games, an official said Friday.
Siham Hanifi will lose her gold in the women's 200 meters and Morocco will also have to give up another gold it won in the 400-meter relay because Hanifi was part of the team, said Reda Kazem, the head of the Arab Games Doping Committee.
A second Moroccan, Karima Shaheen, will also lose the bronze medal for the women's discus throw, Kazem said.
Both athletes tested positive for Nandrolone, a muscle-building steroid that has been the cause of a rash of recent positive tests -- including several at the Pan American Games and even others announced this week in advance of the World Championships.
Kazem said only Shaheen's and Hanifi's samples tested positive among the 84 sent to an International Olympic Committee-accredited laboratory in the German city of Kreischa, near Leipzig.
``Compared to international figures, this is reasonable,'' Kazem said.
``We only tested athletes competing in the track and field events.
No other tests have been conducted yet,'' he said.
He said most gold medal winners were tested.
Suspicions about Hanifi were raised after she boosted her performance dramatically in the 200 meters, a day after losing badly in the 100 meters.
The track and field events were held Aug.
11-14 while the games formally opened on Aug.
15 for other events.
On Wednesday, 39-year-old Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey withdrew from the World Championships after testing positive for Nandrolone.
In the last month, Cuba's Javier Sotomayor, Britain's Linford Christie and American Dennis Mitchell have also seen their careers tarnished by positive tests.
Kazem said Hanifi and Shaheen have the right to appeal.
The Arab Games' Steriods Committee does not have the jurisdiction to ban athletes.
Bans imposed by international organizations range between two months and life.
The head of the games' executive committee, Sari Hamdan, rejected accusations that the organizers were victimizing Moroccan athletes.
``We don't accuse athletes falsely and we don't accuse the country of working with steroids.
We have 100 percent confidence in the tests and everything has been conducted according to the international rules and regulations,'' Hamdan said.
Drug testing was introduced in the Arab Games for the first time in 1997 when the championships were held in Beirut, Lebanon.
Twelve athletes tested positive for banned substances during those games.
Whether trying to reach stardom in high school sports, working to achieve a fashionable lean-but-muscular look or suffering from a deep psychological disorder, teen-age girls are using illegal anabolic steroids in sharply increasing numbers, health authorities say.
The increased usage among girls, which some researchers attribute in part to a kind of reverse anorexia, has caught up to levels that began to be established by boys in the 1980s.
And steroid use, researchers say, exposes girls to the same severe health risks, but with the added potential of destroying their ability to bear children.
The National Institutes of Drug Abuse says about 175,000 teen-age girls in the United States have reported taking anabolic steroids at least once within a year of the time surveyed _ a rise of 100 percent since 1991.
The surveys, by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, the National Household Survey of Drug Abuse and the Youth Risk and Behavior Survey System, were done in schools or the home through anonymous self-reported questionnaires.
Dr. Lloyd D.
Johnston, director of the Michigan project, which has been conducting annual youth surveys since 1975, said the actual number of users may actually be higher than the most recent surveys show, since people tend to underreport drug use.
The rate among teen-age boys has also continued to rise, to the current estimated level of 325,000.
Other indications, including the results of a small study in Oregon, are that steroid use among both girls and boys is increasing unabated.
The three national surveys were conducted before Mark McGwire set baseball's single-season home run record last year, acknowledging that he used androstenedione, a precursor of testosterone, to help him build muscle.
Whether androstenedione, which is allowed in professional baseball but banned in other sports, does in fact build muscles remains a matter of medical dispute, though the perception of many athletes, both adult and adolescent, is that it does.
In any case, sports medicine doctors generally agree that its potential for inducing serious side effects is similar to that of anabolic steroids.
``I get calls every day from the coaches and parents of girls as well as boys,'' said Dr.
Linn Goldberg, a physician at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland and a United States Olympic Committee drug testing official.
``Some are concerned and some want to know whether their children should use androstenedione''.
His answer is an unequivocal no, either to use of steroids or androstenedione.
Anabolic steroids are synthetic substitutes for testosterone, the hormone that directs the body to produce or add male characteristics like increased muscle mass, facial hair and a deep voice.
The hormone exists in females as well, though in much smaller amounts.
Liver cancer, heart disease and uncontrollable aggressiveness are among other serious side effects that can occur in both males and females of all ages.
The health damages might not appear for years or decades after the steroids are taken, said Dr.
Gary I.
Wadler, a professor of clinical medicine at New York University School of Medicine.
Dr. Charles E.
Yesalis, a steroid authority at Pennsylvania State University, was among the first to analyze the 1997 female-adolescent data in December of that year in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine and to sound the alarm.
Most prevention programs, he said recently, have not been effective.
``I am asked to speak in schools and other institutions,'' Yesalis said, ``but you don't get anywhere with speeches or charts or film clips or posters.
We know one-shot messages don't work''.
Goldberg said teen-age boys and girls generally obtain illegal steroids from people who congregate at commercial gyms.
``That's where most people say they obtain them,'' Goldberg said.
``Someone, in this part of the country, will go down to Mexico, where it is easy to get the stuff, and bring it back, either in pill form or injectables''.
And then one young person will buy some and distribute them to his or her schoolmates, he said.
The new interest among teen-age girls, these and other health experts say, reflect a gradual change in attitude, and fashion, or teen-age peer pressure, away from a preoccupation with thinness.
Some teen-age girls now desire to look more healthy and somewhat more muscular, but this has led some girls toward an unhealthy compulsion to be ever fitter with larger muscles.
``We've gone from the overweight beauty of the Rubens women, to the thin rail of the Twiggy types and now back to something in between, the lean but muscular type,'' Wadler said.
``These are people who are virtually addicted to the mirror.
But they will never be satisfied with what they see, and this is now happening to teen-age girls who want bigger muscles no matter how much bigger their muscles have become''.
Dr. Harrison G.
Pope Jr.
, chief of the Biological Psychiatry Laboratory of Harvard Medical School's McLean Hospital, and colleagues referred to a similar disorder in male weight lifters as ``reverse anorexia'' after it was observed in 1993.
The researchers recently updated the work with a study of 32 women bodybuilders, 17 of whom showed signs of an emotional disorder called body dysmorphism, which is the excessive preoccupation with a trait or traits of the body viewed as ugly or defective whether they are or not.
Several women in the study were so addicted to working out that they cut off job opportunities and close personal relationships.
But Pope said too little research had been done on this emerging obsession among teen-age girls to draw specific conclusions about its complex causes.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn The case of one of the worst known adverse reactions to steroid use, reported by Goldberg, is that of a 19-year-old West Coast woman who was preparing to enter her first bodybuilding contest, lifting weights and eating a high-protein diet.
She then switched to a drastically reduced intake of food and water.
Obsessed with her goal, she began taking anabolic steroids and a diuretic.
The steroid would add muscle and the diuretic would drain the body of fluid and make the muscle stand out more.
She won the contest, but it will probably be her last.
After she collected her trophy, she resumed drinking water and eating normally, and her weight shot up by 25 pounds in three days.
It turned out that the diuretic had masked the actual amount of muscle she had built up, said Goldberg, who was one of a group of health experts who reviewed the case.
When she drank more fluids, he said, her muscles pushed out to the full over-developed size and crushed blood vessels in her legs.
Called compartment syndrome, the condition put her limbs, if not her life, in danger, and surgeons had to cut open both legs to protect her vascular system and remove significant amounts of the new muscle tissue.
Goldberg and Dr.
Diane L.
Elliot hope to educate girls about the dangers of steroid use as they have done with boys.
They recently completed a program, called Atlas, that is supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and is aimed at reducing steroid use among young male athletes.
A main element of the program, involving 3,200 male athletes at 31 high schools in Oregon and Washington, was to teach the students to educate one another on the problems.
The number of male students that reported having used steroids within a year was cut by 50 percent.
Under another National Institute of Drug Abuse grant, they are developing a similar program for girls.
Yesalis said the Goldberg-Elliot program was the only one he knew of that worked.
``Unless young people are taught to know where and how to draw the line, to know that it's not right to try to win at all costs, they're not going to listen when you tell them steroids put their lives at risk for the glory of winning,'' he said.
SAN FRANCISCO _ The threatened red-legged frog, which is believed to be the inspiration for Mark Twain's short story ``The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,'' is about to get extra protection from the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service.
Bowing to an order from U.S.
District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco, the agency on Friday proposed that 5.4 million acres in 31 California counties be designated as a critical habitat for the frog.
``It's the biggest area that we've ever designated in California,'' said Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Patricia Foulk.
The red-legged frog reaches 5 inches in length and is the largest native frog in the West.
It breeds in wetlands, streams, ponds and stock ponds, but its historic range has diminished by 70 percent.
Just four areas in the state harbor more than 350 adult red-legged frogs.
The entire San Mateo County coast and most of West Marin, where some of the largest populations of red-legged frogs live, are designated as a critical habitat in the Fish and Wildlife Service proposal.
Critical habitat designation affects developers who need federal permits _ usually from the Army Corps of Engineers _ for their projects.
The Fish and Wildlife Service has to sign off on those permits, attesting that the development will not have an adverse effect on the threatened species, as defined by the Endangered Species Act.
Jeff Miller, a spokesman for the Center for Biological Diversity in Berkeley, said that a major pressure point where development and the red-legged frog may collide is in Contra Costa County where several big subdivisions along Danville and Tassajara creeks are in the works.
Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman Foulk said that designating a critical habitat for a threatened or endangered species isn't the same as establishing a preserve for it.
The agency can fine developers who knowingly trash a critical habitat, but as a practical matter, she said, mitigation measures such as altering the footprint of a development, or the land on which a building will be constructed, usually satisfy the agency's concerns.
Even though it is less of a protective measure than environmentalists would like, ``it's a positive step and might bring about the recovery of a listed species,'' Miller said.
The red-legged frog was listed as threatened in 1996 under the Endangered Species Act.
At that time, the Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that designating a critical habitat was ``not prudent,'' because it would not benefit the species and might make it more vulnerable to habitat vandalism and unauthorized collection.
Alsup disagreed.
Joining the Center for Biological Diversity as a plaintiff in the complaint against the Fish and Wildlife Service were the Jumping Frog Research Institute of Calaveras County and the Center for Sierra Nevada Conservation.
KUNMING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Local sources report that effective protection has been introduced to the Beihai Wetlands, Tengchong County, the only natural reserve of its kind in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
Wetlands, which are natural ecosystems with various species of flora and fauna, are noted for their great capacity to purge sewage and conserve water, according to experts.
Wetlands are thus ideal natural reserves and habitats for many rare species of wild plants and waterfowl.
The Beihai Wetlands Reserve covers about 2,000 hectares and is divided into two major sections -- Beihai Marshland and Qinghai Lake, a freshwater lake used for irrigation.
The reserve is home to a wide variety of precious plants and bird species, and is the winter home for well over 1,000 migratory birds.
The Beihai Wetlands were placed under state protection in 1992, and Tengchong County has established a special agency and issued wide-ranging regulations to protect the area.
Planned afforestation has been carried out in the reserve and surrounding areas in recent years, with strict regulations in place to prohibit poaching.
The local governments at all levels have also extended great efforts to teach people to cherish the natural environment and protect wild animals and plants.
DENVER (AP) -- The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency on Friday ordered Vail Resorts to immediately begin efforts to restore a half-acre of wetlands illegally filled during construction of a dirt logging road.
It was just the latest episode in Vail Resorts' decades-long effort to complete a $14 million expansion project.
Environmental activists have set fires at the resort and recently lost a legal challenge over the expansion project's affect on wildlife, specifically the habitat of the lynx.
The logging road, built last fall to move heavy equipment and remove trees from the ski resort's new 885-acre area, was discovered earlier this year by U.S.
Forest Service employees.
Forest Service officials said it was causing excess sediment to flow into a water source below, and they ordered it closed in July.
The Army Corps of Engineers determined the road had violated the federal Clean Water Act.
If the EPA agrees, it could fine Vail up to $27,500 a day.
In 1996, Telluride ski area was fined $1.1 million for destroying 17 acres of wetlands.
The EPA on Friday ordered Vail Resorts to ``take action now'' to stabilize and winterize the road to protect the wetlands from further damage.
The order requires the road remained closed and sets an August 31 deadline to complete restoration.
Vail Resorts spokesman Porter Wharton III said recently that construction of the road over the wetlands was an honest mistake.
The road was realigned to miss one wetlands parcel and inadvertently affected another, he said.
CHANGSHA, December 11 (Xinhua) -- Finland has agreed to help central China's Hunan Province improve biodiversity protection, environmental education, subtropical forestry and wetlands protection, according to provincial officials.
The province and Finland have established a cooperative committee and work plan focusing on environmental protection.
Finland and Hunan have cooperated in nature protection projects for over a decade.
Finland has funded a number of environmental protection projects in the province, and has exhibited special interest in flora and fauna protection programs.
HEFEI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province is working to seek international cooperation for protecting local wetland resources, which are shrinking in size and deteriorating, a threat posed by varied human factors.
The Huaihe River and the Yangtze, the longest in China, flow through Anhui province, helping form 3.8 million ha of wetlands locally, which accounts 27.8 percent of the national total.
This means that Anhui boasts the largest area of wetlands in the country.
Wetlands have comprehensive strong points, such as nurturing water sources, storing floodwater, regulating climate, as well as disposing of sewage, along with provision of a haven for wildlife, especially endangered water fowls.
The increasing population living in valleys of the Yangtze and Huaihe rivers in recent years, has accelerated the decrease and worsening of the wetlands, where a renowned home for rare and precious wildlife and plants like Chinese alligator, white dolphin, red-crowned crane, diatom and hornwort.
Though Anhui has begun to set up nature reserves for wetlands since 1982, it currently has only brought 4.6 percent of local wetlands under protection, because of technology and fund shortages.
The province intends to introduce overseas technology, facilities and money to do such research works on wetlands environment, waterfowl resources, and migratory birds.
BEIDAIHE (Hebei), March 5 (Xinhua) -- China will enhance its international cooperation in protecting and reasonably utilizing the country's wetlands, said a Chinese official, who is attending an international symposium on wetlands and water birds protection.
China will cooperate with the International Wetlands Organization to evaluate, monitor, and manage the country's wetlands and make relevant policies, the official said.
He said that the symposium, which followed the establishment of China's office of the International Wetlands Organization, shows that the Chinese government is making further progress in protecting wetlands.
The office, set up in Beijing, will help China to make contact with other countries and organizations, work out the plan for wetlands protection and apply for international aid, said Chen Kelin, who heads the office.
Wetlands are a kind of ecosystem, including lakes and marshlands, with ecological and economic functions such as storing floodwater for use against drought.
China now has 63 million hectares of various kinds of wetlands, or 6.6 percent of the national total area and ranking first in Asia, among which some have been listed as "Wetlands of International Importance".
The symposium, which is held in Beidaihe, a sea-side resort in north China's Hebei Province, is jointly sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Forestry, the Japan's Environmental Agency and the Asia-Pacific Branch of the Wetlands International.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, March 7: Two successive presidents, George Bush and Bill Clinton, have promised to stop the steady erosion of the nation's wetlands _ the 100 million or so acres of swamps, marshes and fens that help prevent floods, filter harmful pollutants, provide habitat for endangered species and nourish tiny organisms essential to the food chain.
They have succeeded in beating back the big threats, including efforts by former Vice President Dan Quayle and, later, the Contract With America Republicans to transfer millions of these valuable acres to private interests almost overnight.
But they have been less successful in persuading the Army Corps of Engineers, which actually regulates wetlands, to take a harder line on developers and others who covet wetlands for commercial purposes.
Monday, however, the Corps announced new and stricter regulations that will make it much harder for developers to keep chewing up the country's wetlands in small bites.
The rules would require developers to secure a permit from the Corps for all projects affecting a half-acre of wetlands or more, down from the current minimum of three acres.
This change could make a big difference.
Though precise figures are elusive, wetlands are disappearing at a rate of about 70,000 to 100,000 acres a year, many of them lost to development on small parcels.
Regionally, the rules should benefit New York City's watershed, where thousands of acres essential to the purity of the city's water supply are threatened by small-scale development.
The new rules reflect steady pressure from the Clinton administration and from the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that took the Corps to court.
The rules also represent the Corps' second effort to soften the impact of an arcane but ecologically destructive rule known as Nationwide Permit 26.
Until three years ago, in the interests of administrative efficiency, Permit 26 had allowed the Corps to grant automatic permits to construction projects that affected less than 10 acres of wetlands.
In December 1996 the Corps dropped that limit to three acres.
But even these stricter standards have allowed the disappearance of 20,000 or more acres a year.
Several important steps remain.
Developers and contractors have denounced the new rules, and the administration must be ready to resist legislative attempts to overturn them.
Second, the Corps itself is under a heavy obligation to enforce the new rules in a fair-minded but hard-nosed way.
This will require careful scrutiny of thousands of individual development proposals that the Corps could ignore under the old rules.
The administration should make sure the Corps gets the money it needs for these additional enforcement responsibilities.
But for now, anyone who worries about wetlands has reason to cheer.
The Corps of Engineers, which is not known for environmental stewardship, has acted responsibly.
Despite President Clinton's promise to stop the destruction of the nation's wetlands, the US Army Corps of Engineers is rapidly retreating from enforcing the main law that protects streams, swamps, and marshes from filling and development, a review of the Corps' records indicates.
The Corps, one of two main federal agencies charged with protecting wetlands, has slashed inspections for possible violations by 40 percent since 1992, and in 1998 rejected only 3.2 percent of permit applications for major wetland projects.
In 1992, the Corps turned down 8.8 percent of such applications, according to the documents.
Beset by Congressional budget freezes as well as a headquarters goal of greater fairness to developers, Corps employees say they feel pressured to process applications quickly and, in at least one field office, they received a memo urging them to avoid time-consuming, costly enforcement actions.
Even in New England, regarded as one of the more vigilant Corps offices, the Corps regulatory budget has been frozen at $4.7 million since 1995, forcing staff reductions from 67 to 55.
During that period, wetland-filling applications increased by 8 percent as the region's economy prospered.
Senior Corps officials acknowledge that inspections and enforcement actions have dropped, but they say that partly reflects a society becoming sensitive to the need to protect wetlands, so there are fewer attempts to damage them.
In addition, they say the cutbacks reflect five years of budget freezes that have reduced the Corps regulatory staff from 1,150 to 1,050, forcing the agency to be more efficient, avoiding minor issues and allowing state regulators to do more.
``We believe we've substantially increased environmental protection over the past 10 years,'' said John Studet, chief of the headquarters regulatory branch of the Corps.
&QL; &QL; Employees critical &QL; &QL; But Corps employees say the agency has become so averse to enforcing regulations _ and so quick to issue permits _ that it has become a paper tiger easy to take advantage of.
``The Corps is withdrawing its presence in enforcement,'' said Magi Shapiro of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, who quit the Corps' Richmond office in 1996 rather than approve developments she felt should have been turned down.
``A program without enforcement is an invitation to break the law without consequences''.
The whistleblower organization, a seven-year-old advocacy group for government employees concerned about environmental issues, provided the Globe with summaries of enforcement records and other documents obtained from the Corps' 37 field offices under the Freedom of Information Act after employees complained of a precipitous drop in wetland protection at the Corps.
Grady McCallie, wetland ecologist for the National Wildlife Federation, said the Corps' enforcement decline could spell doom for thousands of acres of wetlands, especially in states that do not have strong enforcement programs.
He said New England states generally have good state enforcement, but, even there, a tough Corps can help stand up to powerful industries.
``If we could start a program from scratch, I certainly wouldn't organize it the way it is.
But given where we are, we would be in real bad shape'' if the Corps stops enforcing the law, McCallie said.
The controversy over the Corps occurs as the federal government tries to reverse centuries of destruction of wetlands, which are nursery and kitchen for countless plants and animals.
Americans destroyed nearly 30 percent of all wetlands before realizing that these swamps and marshes protect humans, too, by absorbing floodwaters and trapping pollutants that might otherwise reach tap water.
&QL; &QL; Clinton steps in &QL; &QL; The United States still loses more than 100,000 acres a year of wetlands, but Clinton hopes to reverse the trend by 2005, creating 100,000 acres more than are destroyed.
The main tool would be the restoration of wetlands that were damaged in the past, such as the Florida Everglades.
The administration, however, puts modest resources into the two agencies charged with protecting wetlands that exist: the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, which together share responsibility for enforcing the federal Clean Water Act that governs wetland development.
The EPA has only 26 people nationwide in its technical wetland enforcement division, including one full-time employee based in Boston.
At the Corps, Clinton has repeatedly asked for $11 million more for regulation of wetlands than the $106 million approved by Congress this year, a reflection of conservatives' belief that the Corps is often an obstacle to development.
However, even if the White House received more money, Clinton does not plan to beef up enforcement significantly.
Almost half of the extra money would fund a new appeal system to allow businesses and individuals to challenge Corps decisions.
Compounding the Corps' budget problems, the agency is far less comfortable in the enforcer role than the EPA.
The Corps, best known as the builder of public works and flood control projects, objected to regulating wetlands when the Clean Water Act passed in 1972 and, in recent years, the agency seldom goes to court because of a violation.
Now, in addition to few fines and lawsuits, the Corps has also cut back on other kinds of enforcement, according to the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility review.
Orders to restore illegally damaged wetlands have fallen from 283 to 109 since 1992, while field inspections have dropped from 8,149 to 5,141 in the same period.
``It's only a matter of time before people find out,'' one Corps employee said.
``What's the use of getting a permit if people can do it without a permit''?
A memo for Corps employees in Salt Lake City, obtained by the whistleblowers, even issued guidelines for what enforcement cases to avoid.
According to the memo, Corps officials ``will normally do nothing further'' if they cannot determine from the office that a reported violation is substantial.
Even with some major violations, the memo urges the Corps to ``end its involvement with the case'' if another agency will not take over.
&QL; &QL; Work overload &QL; &QL; New England Corps officials received no such memo, but the office has eliminated its separate enforcement division and begun transferring more cases to the EPA Boston office, which is overwhelmed with more than 200 tips a year to be investigated by one full-time and one part-time staff member.
But Studet of the Corps said the workload shift to the EPA makes sense because the EPA has broader enforcement powers, a bigger legal team, and a formal agreement with the Corps to handle prosecution of flagrant cases.
More generally, Studet says critics' fixation on enforcement overlooks big improvements at the Corps.
For instance, he said the Corps has toughened regulations since 1996, requiring that wetland damage as small as one-third of an acre receive a Corps permit, three times smaller than the previous minimum size.
He also said the Corps has greatly increased the requirement that developers offset damage to wetlands by creating new ones.
Last year, the Corps ordered 47,000 acres of new wetlands, which is more than the 31,000 acres they allowed to be damaged.
``The (Clinton) goal is 100,000 acres gain by 2005.
Our part of that is that we believe we should continue to administer the program so we have no net loss'' of wetlands, Studet said.
However, researchers have cast doubt on the value of wetlands created by developers: A University of Massachusetts study shows half of them fail.
Moreover, critics note, the wetland damage Studet cites does not include illegal activity.
&QL; &QL; Criticism of Corps &QL; &QL; Officials at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility said the underlying problem is that the Corps is so afraid of controversy it bends over backward for powerful industries.
Even in the Concord office of the Corps, which the whistleblowers agree is more vigilant than others, they found evidence of yielding to political pressure.
Whistleblowers point to an internal Corps memo in which one Corps official boasted that the agency has done little to slow the rapid growth of the powerful cranberry industry in Maine, which has lobbied Congress for easier rules to allow flooding wetlands for the crop.
The memo notes that all 29 permits had been promptly granted and that only one grower had to create new wetlands to offset the damage.
New England regulatory chief William Lawless counters that each project received proper review before it was approved, saying critics ``are rushing to judgment.
We certainly were knowledgeable that the state was interested in cranberries, but that doesn't mean we are going to roll over.
We are very careful not to give special treatment''.
In truth, Lawless said, his office has done its best to keep up wetland protection even as budget freezes forced him to eliminate 12 positions during the last four years.
``We're doing more with less,'' he said.
BEIJING, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Xu Youfang, the Minister of Forestry, delivered a written statement today to mark the first "International Wetlands' Day" designated by the international wetlands organization.
He vowed in the statement that China will make further efforts in the protection of wetland resources.
Wetlands, a kind of important natural ecological system and known as the earth's "kidney", play an unreplaceable role in climate adjusting, water conserving, soil-erosion preventing and pollutant resolving in addition to serving as habitats for a variety of the world's rare water fowls.
China has a total area of more than 25 million hectares of natural and artificial wetlands of different types scattered across the country, with many being waterfowl habitats of international importance.
"History has told us that the protection of wetlands represents the protection of ourselves, for the destruction of wetlands means the destruction of man's living environment," the minister said.
Xu said his Ministry will launch a drive to enhance the awareness of wetland protection among the public, establish a dynamic monitoring network and information system for China's wetlands, conduct scientific research in wetland protection as well as proper utilization and management of wetlands resources.
Thus far, China has set up more than 130 wetland nature reserves, six of which have been listed as of "international importance", according to the minister.
VAIL, Colo.
(AP) -- A temporary dirt logging road carved across a half-acre of wetlands has landed Vail Resorts, the nation's largest ski area, in trouble with the government.
Last fall, Tom Allender, resort planning director, and his crews built the road to access an 885-acre expansion into undeveloped backcountry.
Until the Army Corps of Engineers realized what the resort had done in July, no one noticed the temporary road had been built in the wrong spot and was spilling sediment into protected habitat.
The Environmental Protection Agency launched an investigation last month.
The resort could be looking at civil fines of up to $27,500 a day if the EPA determines the road is a violation of the Clean Water Act, which requires permits for construction through wetlands to protect migratory birds and other fauna.
Vail Resorts has said it was an honest mistake.
But the EPA's Steve Ireland rejected that defense.
``If fill material is discharged into the waters of the United States without a permit, it is a violation,'' he said.
``It's worse if they knew they were breaking the law, but whether it was unintentional doesn't change anything''.
In the meantime, the Corps of Engineers has closed the road, leaving the resort with more than a million board-feet of cut timber and no way to remove it.
It may have to be burned on site.
The U.S.
Forest Service had ordered Vail to build the road so logging trucks could remove the timber without rumbling through the tourist-clogged village.
Allender said he became confused when building it because surveyors had left three proposed routes marked with ribbons through the wilderness.
The road is another chapter in the decades-long, controversial effort by Vail Resorts to complete a $14 million expansion project.
Environmentalists recently lost a legal challenge to the project, arguing unsuccessfully that the Forest Service didn't adequately assess the effect on wildlife, specifically the lynx.
Last fall, a group calling itself Earth Liberation Front claimed responsibility for an outbreak of fires at the resort that caused $12 million in damage.
In addition to any fine, Vail Resorts will have to pay to fix the damage to the wetlands.
KAMPALA, February 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has made progress in protecting its wetlands since an international convention on wetlands was ratified by the country in 1988.
The convention, an inter-governmental treaty launched at Ramsar, Iran, on February 2, 1971, partly aims to the conservation of wetlands as habitats for migratory water birds and enhance international cooperation in the field.
The day, adopted by a conference on wetlands held in Brisbane, Austria in March 1996 as World Wetlands Day, was marked with a theme "Wetlands and Community" in Masaka District, 120 kilometers southwest of capital Kampala today.
In compliance with the convention, Uganda has made efforts to raise awareness of the public about uses of wetlands and the need of conservation.
The country has also developed a national wetlands policy, including the designation of Lake George's wetland, southwestern Uganda as a convention site, the research and evaluation of wetlands for facilitating their wise use.
The authorities, in February, 1996, set up a hot line for the public to report environment abuse and announced that new draining of swamps for economic development is no longer allowed in the country.
Meanwhile, the Netherlands offered Uganda funds for restoring some swamps in the country.
Uganda's wetlands cover an area of about 29,600 square kilometers and make for 12 percent of the country's territory.
The wetlands play a role as filters of waste before it drains into lakes and rivers in the eastern African country.
However, Uganda's wetlands has decreased in acreage, mainly due to human activities including grazing, brick-making, reduced vegetation, rice planting and hunting especially of antelopes and water birds.
Large tracts of wetlands in the country currently have been drained into paddy fields.
In Kampala and Kabale District bordering on Rwanda, many swampy areas have been drained for farming and house construction.

CANBERRA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The formation of a new International conservation body announced today was vital to the wise use of wetlands around the world, conservationists were told at the Ramsar meeting today.
The Wetlands International was launched at the Ramsar Convention conference held in Brisbane, a port city in Northeastern Australia, with the participation of some 1000 delegates from about 120 countries, The Australian Associated Press reported.
The new organization links the Asian Wetland Bureau, Wetlands for the Americas and the International Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Bureau.
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill, while addressing the conference, said that it represented a unique partnership between government and non-government interests to work for the goal of wetlands conservation.
Hill told the conference that relations between Wetlands International and Australia have been strengthened to the point that a formal agreement would be signed tomorrow.
Asian delegates to the international Ramsar conference called on the governing bureau to cut costs and move its headquarters out of Switzerland to the developing world.
Swami Singh Boparai, the Asian regional representative, said that as the infrastructure is available less costly in the developing world, the bureau secretariat can consider moving to a developing country so that it can have within the same budget more manpower and more activity.
Boparai also said that wetlands in many developing countries were vital to the sustenance of human beings, not just flora and fauna.
Malaysia has estimated that its wetlands contributed 10 percent of its GDP although this percentage may have declined slightly as industrialization increased, he said.
The Ramsar Convention, signed in 1971 in Ramsar, Iran, has more than 90 signatory countries which make contributions to the administrative bureau based in Switzerland.
Previous Ramsar conferences have been held in Italy, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland and Japan.
The vital importance of wetlands to Asia has led India to bid to host the next Ramsar meeting in New Delhi in 1999.
BEIDAIHE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Conserving China's wetlands is a national priority, said Zhen Rende, director of the wildlife and forestry department of the Ministry of Forestry.
Headed by the ministry, 17 ministries and commissions are formulating the systematic action program to guide the country's conservation and use of wetlands, Zhen said.
Speaking at the International Workshop on Wetlands which opened today in this sea-side resort in north China's Hebei Province, he announced that the program includes the establishment of wetlands nature reserves, protection of species, spreading of scientific findings and training of personnel.
Wetlands, an important natural ecological system known as the earth's "kidney" include marshland, lakes, rivers and other shallow water land.
The wetlands are necessary for water conservation, flood prevention, adjusting weather and maintaining the varieties of organisms.
In 1992 China joined the Convention on Wetlands that was established in Ramsar, Iran in 1971.
To collect the comprehensive information on China's wetlands resources, China has organized several large-scale investigations in the past few years and ran several training classes in Jiangxi, Shandong provinces and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions for the administration of wetlands.
According to official statistics, China has more than 63 million hectares of wetlands, accounting for 11.9 percent of the world's total.
Zhen said, for quite a long time, many people believed that the wetlands were useless mud.
Now more and more people have recognized wetlands' great ecological and economic potential and the conservation and utilization of wetlands has become an urgent task.
The four-day International Workshop on Wetland, sponsored by China's Ministry of Forestry, Japan's Environment Agency and Wetlands International will also arrange investigation of wetlands and water birds in Beidaihe.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- After years of deliberations, the Clinton administration next week will impose tougher requirements on developers to stem the loss of ecologically sensitive wetlands, according to sources familiar with the new regulations.
Homebuilders said Friday the new rules are unneeded and will stall economic development, but environmentalists welcomed the tighter restrictions, saying construction under old rules led to the loss of thousands of acres of wetlands.
The U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers scheduled a news conference for Monday to announce the new rules, which have been debated internally for more than four years and were spurred by an environmental group's lawsuit.
The new requirements will take effect in June, according to the Army Corps' final draft.
The 172-page regulatory overall will require developers to seek special, individual permits to build if they want to fill in a wetland of one-half acre or more.
Prior to a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council in 1996, the cutoff was 10 acres, a standard the Army Corps later reduced to three acres.
The new regulations also will end developers' use of a streamlined ''nationwide permit'' process for most construction, meaning that specific permits will have to be approved for each project.
Homebuilders have complained that this new process will delay construction and require unnecessarily stringent review.
They argue that more wetlands are being created through their efforts to form new ones than are lost to the bulldozers.
Robert Mitchell, a Maryland builder who is president of the National Association of Home Builders, predicted ''a dramatic negative effect on the homebuilding industry'' because of delays and more stringent wetlands protection requirements.
A study commissioned by a group of landowners and developers and the National Association of Counties estimated the cost to the economy of the new permitting process at $300 million a year.
However, the Army Corps has estimated the additional cost at closer to $26 million.
Since the Bush administration, the government has had a goal of having no net loss of wetlands, trying to reverse decades of disappearing wetland acres.
Although specific numbers are in dispute, environmentalists say the country, nevertheless, is losing as much as 100,000 acres of wetlands annually.
They maintain a fifth of those losses have been due to the Army Corps building permit policies.
Environmentalists have sought for years to abolish the so-called nationwide Permit 26, which applies to development, including home construction and road building, and replace it with individual permits as the Army Corps now is going to do.
David Rosenberg, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the nationwide permitting system amounted to giving ''rubber-stamp'' approval to construction projects.
''It has been the single largest source of permitted wetlands destruction in the country,'' Rosenberg said in an interview.
But the National Association of Home Builders argues that wetland mitigation by developers actually restored more wetlands than were lost under the nationwide permit system.
At the same time, the group argues, the nationwide permitting system has allowed for fast track approval of thousands of projects without environmental damage.
The average time to get an individual permit approved was more than a year, compared with about a month for the streamlined nationwide permit for construction projects, the group estimated.
The new reliance on individual permits, with a one-half-acre wetlands threshold, ''means more regulations, delays and costs, less flexibility'' for developers, said Mitchell.
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.
(AP) - The Army Corps of Engineers tightened its regulations Thursday on development in the New York City watershed, requiring a full public review of almost any large project.
Under the Clean Water Act, the corps has jurisdiction over any project that involves the discharge of fill or dredged material into waterways, which include rivers, streams, ponds and wetlands.
Thursday's action by its New York district suspends some of the permit procedures that are in effect elsewhere in the country.
''I don't want to say there was a full consensus, but there was a general feeling in New York, even in some towns that are more pro-development, that people wanted more protection in the New York City watershed,'' said Joe Seebode, chief of the district's regulatory branch.
The watershed affects the drinking water for New York City as well as parts of the northern suburbs.
The new rules also apply to the Great Swamp in Putnam and Dutchess counties, some Hudson River wetlands and other New York waters, he said.
''This will affect projects that are having anything more than an extremely minimal impact on wetlands and watercourses,'' he said.
The new rules require: -Public notice and public comment before a permit is granted.
-An analysis of whether there are less environmentally damaging alternatives.
-Mitigation of any impact on wetlands by creating or enhancing other wetlands.
''It does not mean people will not be able to develop, but it does mean that folks will have to come in, get an individual permit, give the corps the opportunity to coordinate with the city, the state, federal agencies and the general public on whether there is a reason not to authorize that project,'' Seebode said.
''We are interested in using our regulatory responsibility and authority to minimize the impact on wetlands in the watershed because they are so important in filtering out pollutants and purifying water and trapping sediments.''
IMPERIAL, Calif.
(AP) -- It is known as one of the nation's dirtiest waterways, an 80-mile drain that catches raw sewage and industrial waste from the Mexican border city of Mexicali and mixes it with agricultural runoff from the irrigated fields of the Imperial Valley.
But after years of hand-wringing and bad publicity, the New River is getting the kind of attention that could end its notoriety.
A federally financed project to create artificial wetlands that would cleanse millions of gallons of river water is nearing completion, and the U.S. and Mexican governments last month announced $50 million in financing for badly needed upgrades to the Mexicali sewage treatment system.
The combination could go a long way to removing much of the pesticides, fertilizers, raw sewage carried by the river into the Salton Sea, the largest lake in California.
''Eventually, with what we're doing and what they're doing we'll clean up a lot of the problems with this river,'' said Leon Lesicka, a lifelong Imperial Valley resident and chairman of a task force coordinating river cleanup projects.
Signs of significant improvement in the river could be less than four years away, said Eugenia McNaughton, an environmental scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency.
''This is a workable problem and we are working on it,'' McNaughton said.
So far, the progress is visible only along the river's banks at two sites near Imperial and Brawley, about 100 miles east of San Diego, where workers are carving berms and ponds for the artificial wetlands.
After pumping Colorado River water into the area, workers will plant bull rushes and other wetland plants.
They won't use New River water out of concern for the workers' health, Lesicka said.
For now, the river remains a fetid mess, especially near the border at Calexico, where clumps of foam and debris bob on the surface and the river gives off an acrid smell and burns the eyes and throat after a few minutes of exposure.
Illegal immigrants float down the river to avoid the Border Patrol, knowing agents are reluctant to follow them in.
Polio, tetanus and tuberculosis have all been found in the river, according to the Imperial Irrigation District, the valley's main water agency.
The river was formed from Colorado River flooding between 1904 and 1906.
Waters breached a canal and turned a usually dry creek bed into a river that flows from about 20 miles south of Mexicali to the Salton Sea, a lake with no natural outlets that is choking on its high salinity.
Congress approved $3.75 million for the artificial wetlands to filter the contaminated water through a process known as bioremediation.
An additional $25 million of federal funding through the North American Development Bank is the U.S. contribution to the sewer upgrade in Mexicali, a city that has grown to an estimated 1 million.
The Imperial Irrigation District, which also is part of the task force and is building part of the wetlands, will consider adding more wetlands sites to help filter the water, possibly expanding to the nearby Alamo River, another Salton Sea tributary, said agency spokeswoman Sue Giller.
In the artificial wetlands being built, water will flow into collection ponds, where silt and minerals will settle to the bottom, then pass through a series of reed-covered berms before returning to the river again.
Biologists will monitor the collection ponds over three years to see how they affect wildlife.
There's no easy way to explain why the cleanup has taken so long, said Marie Barrett, a biologist involved with the project and a lifelong valley resident.
''Once we realized we had a problem, it took us a long time to get going,'' she said.
''But now we're actually doing something and it's so exciting''.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- New regulations that will make it harder to build roads or homes near wetlands are set to be issued by the Army Corps of Engineers to curtail destruction of the ecologically sensitive areas.
The Corps completed a 172-page overhaul of its wetlands regulations this week and is ready to issue the new requirements, according to government and private sources.
The Corps scheduled a news conference on the regulations for Monday.
But sources familiar with the regulations, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said today final release may be delayed because of some technical changes.
The new regulations have been in the works for more than four years, but were given new impetus 18 months ago when President Clinton said he wanted to tighten the requirements on developers ''to ensure that we think twice before building in our most sensitive wetlands''.
According to sources who have seen the new regulations, the Corps will require developers to obtain specific permits for projects affecting at least a half-acre of wetlands, compared to three acres under current regulations.
The restriction was reduced from 10 acres in December 1996.
The new regulations will replace a ''nationwide permit'' system for developers that environmentalists argue provided too many loopholes to builders and led to widespread wetlands destruction.
Statistics on wetlands loss vary widely.
Environmentalists say more than 100,000 acres of wetlands continue to be lost each year, about a fifth of that associated with the less stringent national permit system.
Those figures are disputed by the National Home Builders Association, which argues that wetland mitigation by developers actually restored more wetlands than were lost by construction under the nationwide permit system.
The new regulations would cover about one-fourth of all wetlands.
Daniel Rosenberg, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which filed a lawsuit that spurred the new regulations, said the tighter standards are long overdue in strengthening wetlands protection.
The Corps first began reviewing the wetlands rules in 1995 and 1996.
'The nationwide permit has been used to destroy thousands of acres of wetlands,'' said Rosenberg, calling it the most significant reason for mass wetlands loss over the years.
Meanwhile, homebuilders and the National Association of Counties have accused the Corps of overreaction.
There is ''little evidence to justify'' the abandonment of the nationwide permit system, and the tighter half-acre restriction is not needed, said the National Association of Home Builders.
''In 1998 alone, Corps statistics show that under the (nationwide) permit program landowners provided 6,304 acres in mitigation in exchange for permission to fill or otherwise impact 2,974 acres''.
said Neil Gaffney, NAHB spokesman.
The Corps' completion of the new rules was first reported in today's Washington Post.
HANOI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and the World Bank (WB) signed here on Thursday two development credit agreements for Vietnam's coastal wetlands protection and development project and the rural transport project in amounts of 31.8 million U.S. dollars and 103.9 million U.S. dollars respectively.
Signatures were Governor of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) Le Duc Thuy and President of WB James Wolfensohn.
The Coastal Wetlands Protection and Development Project will assist Vietnam to reestablish and improve the coastal mangrove wetlands ecosystems in order to protect sustainable aquatic nurturing and coastal protection functions.
The project also aims at improving the agricultural productivity, aquatic nurturing and other related industries of the country.
The Rural Transport Project will assist Vietnam to improve and upgrade the rural transport access network at 40 provinces and improve the access of the rural communities to the urban communities, develop the central and provincial capacity to improve and sustain the level of service of the rural transport road network.
The two credit agreements raised the total amount of the loans that WB has approved to 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in the form of 25 projects and programs.
The World Bank resumed lending to Vietnam in November 1993.
A WB delegation led by its president, Wolfensohn is scheduled to conclude its three-day visit to Vietnam on Thursday.
This is Wolfensohn's second visit to Vietnam after the first one in May 1996, soon after he became the president of the World Bank.
The WB delegation's Asia-tour includes Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, aiming to prepare for an operation strategy for the World Bank in the 21st century.
NEW YORK _ The federal government announced Thursday tougher restrictions for building on wetlands within the New York City watershed.
The stricter rules, involving wetlands as small as one-tenth of an acre, will mainly affect Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess counties, said Joseph Seebode, an official with the Army Corps of Engineers.
The new rules require developers to obtain federal permits for any construction projects, including individual homes, on wetlands.
Slivers of wetlands, added together, can contribute to a region's water quality, said Jeffrey Odefey of Riverkeeper, a Hudson River environmental organization.
``These are critical little pieces,'' he said.
``There are lots of them, and together they provide filtration and flood control.
They may seem like a puddle in somebody's backyard, but if it's near stream headwaters, it can affect the quality of the drinking water system''.
Environmental organizations and the New York City Council have been lobbying for stronger federal protection of wetlands around the 1,969 square miles of watershed for months.
In the vast watershed region west of the Hudson River, federal regulations, adopted last spring _ and tougher than previous ones _ will continue to apply.
TRENTON, N.J.
(AP) - A Burlington County Republican leader who used 22 acres of protected wetland in the Pinelands to expand harvesting operations may soon be off the hook.
Garfield DeMarco, former Burlington County GOP chairman and a generous contributor to state Republican causes, has applied for a newly created state permit that would give the expansion after-the-fact state approval.
DeMarco undertook a 33-acre bog expansion in 1998, but 22 of the acres were protected under the New Jersey Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act.
By law, DeMarco should have sought a state permit before undertaking the expansion.
The state Department of Environmental Protection sent a letter in October 1998 to DeMarco, alerting him of the violation.
Fines for the illegal destruction of wetlands can be as high as $10,000 per day.
At that rate, the potential penalty now exceeds $8 million.
DeMarco's attorney, Anthony Drollas, said DEP officials have given no indication that they plan to impose anywhere near the maximum potential penalty against the cranberry grower.
DEP spokesman Peter Page said the department is negotiating with DeMarco over how much to assess in penalties, but he said DeMarco could have been eligible for a state permit had he sought one.
Not everyone is happy with DeMarco's possible settlement.
Critics say DeMarco is a well-connected political figure in the state.
DEP Commissioner Robert C.
Shinn is a Burlington County native and a political protege of DeMarco's.
Page said Shinn has excused himself from the case, citing appearance of a potential conflict.
Glenn Paulsen, chairman of the Burlington County GOP, is manager of the Trenton office of Capehart &AMP; Scatchard, the law firm representing DeMarco's application.
State records show DeMarco and the legal and engineering firms involved in his permit application gave GOP campaigns more than $200,000 last year.
Since 1995, the firms have given New Jersey Republicans $517,000 - including $196,000 from DeMarco between 1995 and 1999.
''Frankly, I think this is special-interest money and special-interest regulatory privilege,'' Bill Neil, director of the conservation for the New Jersey Audubon Society, told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Saturday's editions.
''This is a sorry chapter in New Jersey policy history''.
Drollas said DeMarco's political ties have nothing to do with the application.
Under the permit created in April, the 47 cranberry growers in the Pinelands would be entitled to expand bogs to a collective maximum of 300 acres of wetlands over the next five years.
Wetlands in the Pinelands and throughout the state are supposed to be off limits to development because of their value as a wildlife habitat and a water cleansing system.
Each grower is limited to a maximum wetlands expansion of 10 acres in any year.
That means DeMarco's 22-acre expansion will have to be phased in under permits issued over the next three years.
NEW YORK _ After repeated efforts to persuade the federal government to strictly limit building on marshes around New York City's upstate reservoirs, the Giuliani administration reversed itself this week, saying the wetlands needed no special protections.
The city's new position echoes the views of Republican officials from rural communities around the reservoirs and pits city officials against private environmental groups and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which say that special restrictions are needed because wetlands help to purify the city's water.
The change was outlined in a March 15 letter from Environmental Protection Commissioner Joel Miele to the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, which is updating federal rules for wetlands.
Some environmental groups and Democratic city officials assailed the move and accused Giuliani of putting his possible race for the Senate, and his need for Republican support outside the city, ahead of his responsibility to protect the water supply.
Joseph Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, denied there was any political motive behind the change.
One of Miele's deputies made the original recommendations, and Miele never approved them, Lhota said.
Lhota defended the city's new stance, saying the city's water supply was already sufficiently protected from pollution.
``Anyone who makes the argument that these new rules would protect the watershed any further, that's just false and cheap politics,'' he said.
The city reversed its stance on the new restrictions after the original recommendations angered Republican state legislators and county officials, who called Giuliani and Miele to complain that tighter rules would stifle development.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Without a strong recommendation by the city for special rules around the reservoirs, several environmental lawyers said, the stricter standard are less likely to be adopted by the Army Corps of Engineers, particularly because upstate communities have sent the agency extensive comments of their own, opposing such a move.
The agency is responsible for issuing permits for filling in small tracts of wetlands and thus can limit development.
``It's an extreme and radical action to withdraw recommendations like this,'' said Robert F.
Kennedy Jr.
, a lawyer for Riverkeeper, an environmental group that strongly supported the Giuliani administration two years ago when it committed to an ambitious plan to protect the water supply.
``We're worried that water quality is being traded for political advantage,'' he said.
Since last summer, the corps has been updating its nationwide system for issuing permits to fill wetlands, seeking to identify areas where wetlands are particularly vulnerable or important and need protection.
The city's original written comments, by Dr.
William Stasiuk, a deputy commissioner of the city Department of Environmental Protection in charge of the water supply, recommended that the strictest procedures be applied to proposals for developing the 2,000 square miles that drain into the reservoirs, with individual applications required for any filling or construction affecting more than one-third of an acre of wetlands.
The general standard used by the Federal agency requires an application and review only for any project filling more than three acres of wetlands.
Stasiuk said extra protection was needed because ``further loss or degradation of the remaining wetlands in the watersheds may jeopardize regional water quality''.
But when his comments were circulated in upstate communities last month, local officials called them a ``sneak attack'' on the rights of residents around the reservoirs to develop their property.
Stasiuk declined to comment Thursday.
In recent days, several city officials sent Giuliani letters criticizing the retraction of Stasiuk's original wetlands recommendations.
In their letters, they said the city's reversal increased the chances that the water supply would slowly be degraded, eventually forcing the city to build a $6 billion filtration plant to remove pollution that could have been prevented.
The EPA has no say in the final decision on wetlands rules by the corps, but has indicated that the wetlands around the reservoirs deserve special protection.
In an interview Thursday, Miele defended the change in the city's position, saying there was no need to saddle communities in the watershed with extra federal restrictions because his staff already had the right to stop any action that might pollute the water.
Even so, Miele acknowledged that the city's options were somewhat limited.
Two years ago, it signed an agreement with communities around the reservoirs that ended their longstanding legal challenges to the city's pollution regulations around the watersheds.
In return, the city began spending hundreds of millions of dollars to help the communities keep the water clean, and it acknowledged their right to continue to grow economically.
PHOENIX _ There's a place in the far southwest Phoenix area where you can see a great blue heron &UR; picking its way along the waterline, or an egret gliding overhead.
Beavers cross one trail.
Turtles and a melodious marsh wren find homes near another.
``We came here at sunset and it was like a scene from `National Geographic,' '' one visitor, Lynn Timmons, said after a look.
``It's the desert.
You don't expect to see this kind of scenery''.
Especially when it's next to a sewage treatment plant and drawing its water from the plant's discharge.
The site is Tres Rios, a 12-acre wetlands project downstream from the Phoenix area's 91st Avenue Wastewater Treatment Plant.
But it is more than a sanctuary for nearly 100 species of birds and wildlife from javelinas to bobcats.
It's an extension of the plant itself, using nature as a filter to provide the final cleaning stage for sewer water.
The concept could end up saving cities in the Phoenix area hundreds of millions of dollars.
The reason: Increased federal standards are expected for water being released back into the environment.
Phoenix officials say the cost to upgrade a treatment plant such as the one at 91st Avenue to meet those new standards could top $375 million.
``With a wetlands, we can do a full 800 acres for about $85 million,'' said Bing Brown, spokesman for Phoenix's Water Services Department.
``It does the same thing, and does it better in some cases.
``Do you want to put up another building, or do you want a place you can take your family to watch birds and watch lizards?
If both do about the same thing but one costs less and looks better, it seems it's a shoo-in''.
Before a city creates 800 acres of wetlands, though, it needs to know whether the concept works.
That led to Tres Rios, a demonstration project near 91st Avenue and Broadway Road.
Wastewater is processed through the nearby treatment plant and pumped into the wetlands.
As the water flows through plants and vegetation, ``nature takes its course,'' cleansing the water of nitrogen, metals, pesticides and the like.
The water is collected on the other end.
Water that comes out of the plant is not used for drinking but for irrigation and to cool towers at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station.
&UR; Jack Landy, an environmental engineer with the Environmental Protection Agency in San Francisco, said the EPA supports Tres Rios and is impressed with the planning going into the project.
There are other wetlands projects, including one in Show Low and a couple in Tucson, but he said there's nothing on such a large scale in this region, including Arizona, California, Nevada or Hawaii.
``We have enough experience with wetlands, though, that we're confident it can work,'' he said.
A concern already expressed in meetings is the possibility of mosquito breeding, but Landy said he hopes that can be prevented.
``We're going to be supportive but attentive as to the environmental impacts,'' he said.
The EPA has not identified any significant pollution from the discharge at this point, he added.
Construction of the 12-acre site began in 1995.
About $8.5 million has been spent or committed so far from the federal government and cities involved.
Tres Rios is owned by a coalition of Phoenix, Scottsdale, Glendale, Mesa and Tempe.
It is operated in partnership with the Bureau of Reclamation.
Officials of the cities say the project is more successful than they anticipated, and they are pushing to build the 800 acres of wetlands.
The Army Corps of Engineers is studying the feasibility of the larger project; the study is expected to be completed by May 2000.
The project would span an area near the Salt, Gila and Agua Fria rivers, which is how it got the name Tres Rios, Spanish for ``three rivers''.
The 800-acre wetlands could have four different types of areas, including ponds, marshes, streams and an area where the water would flow underground.
The lessons learned from the smaller demonstration project would help the cities operate the full-scale wetlands, says Roland Wass, research project manager at Tres Rios.
Lessons like, watch out for the beavers.
Up to a dozen now call Tres Rios home, including Brutus, who weighs an estimated 70 pounds but still is slippery enough to avoid getting caught.
He's been busy building dams and dropping a 35-foot tree in the middle of one of the ponds.
``When we started, we never anticipated beavers,'' Wass said.
``Now it's a problem, but we're learning how to deal with it''.
The most important result of Tres Rios could be improved wastewater at a fraction of the cost of what it would take to build upgraded treatment plants.
And there's the benefit that isn't financial.
``Twenty-five years down the road,'' Wass said, ``you have usable real estate, not rusting chemical tanks''.

NEWARK, N.J.
_ Cranberry farmers have been quietly expanding into more and more unregulated acreage, even as they have sought federal approval to use sensitive wetlands, environmental groups assert.
The accusation came as one of the state's largest growers, A.R.
DeMarco Enterprises, was charged this month with illegally expanding into 22 acres of regulated wetlands in Burlington County.
That charge by the state Department of Environmental Protection _ which could mean heavy fines for the owner, Garfield DeMarco, a former Burlington County Republican leader _ cast further suspicion on the industry in the eyes of some environmental groups.
The $25-million-a-year cranberry industry has thrived for over 200 years in the state's pinelands on the fringes of natural wetlands, where swampy conditions and a web of streams, dams and ditches allow farmers to flood growing areas easily and cheaply with the water that is essential to the crop.
As a result, New Jersey, the most urban and densely populated state in the country, has become the third-largest cranberry producer, behind Massachusetts and Wisconsin.
And many people see the farming of cranberries, as well as blueberries, both of which depend on clean water, as compatible with, and indeed an aid to, wetlands preservation.
The growers say they need to expand into regulated wetlands to remain competitive.
But William Neil, director of conservation for the New Jersey Audubon Society, asserts that cranberry growers have already been working far more than the 3,500 acres that they have cited in their expansion applications.
He said that reports on pesticide use suggested that as much as 4,481 acres of cranberries were being grown in the state, and that other statistics from the state Department of Agriculture put the figure at put the figure at 3,900 acres.
Steven Lee, one of the state's 48 cranberry growers and a spokesman for the group, denied any deception.
He said that he and other growers had always indicated that they were modestly expanding into unregulated, upland areas and into blueberry bogs on their land.
Those expansions had added as much as 400 acres to the state's cranberry inventory in recent years, he conceded, which would put the total at about 3,900 acres.
``But we have done it on our farm to the maximum extent possible without touching regulated wetlands,'' Lee said.
``This is true of most of the other farmers.
We are all tapped out''.
He said the growers, most of whom are part of the large Ocean Spray cooperative, had not hidden expansions from the public, as Neil asserted.
He said they had always told regulators that they were converting blueberry bogs to more lucrative cranberry production wherever possible, and extending growing areas upland, away from the wetlands, when it did not require extensive redirection of water.
The accusations by Neil came about three weeks after the state and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency said that they were close to approving conditions under which growers could expand into 300 acres of wetlands over the next five years without seeking specific permission for each expansion as they had in the past.
The draft agreement on what is called the ``general permit'' could be approved later this month.
But it is being opposed by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service as ``the most environmentally damaging proposal'' considered by regulators over the last five years.
Echoing this sentiment, environmental groups like the Audubon Society have asked federal environmental regulators to reconsider their support.
WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Thursday proposed new rules to protect environmentally sensitive wetlands from development, a response to what administration officials called a recent rash of destruction.
The officials said that in the last two years, some 20,000 acres of wetlands and an additional 150 miles of streams had been destroyed because of what they portrayed as a loophole opened by a court decision three years ago.
The new rules, to take effect after a 60-day period of public comment, would close that loophole by adding greater detail to regulations that specify what kinds of wetlands development require an environmental impact review by the government.
The rules, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers, are part of the administration's effort to fight the court decision, issued in January 1997 by a federal district judge in Washington and upheld in June 1998 by the District of Columbia U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
Interpreting unspecific language in the Clean Water Act, both courts held that developers did not need to obtain a federal permit to excavate, drain or ditch a wetland as long as they did not dump soil on the property in question.
The EPA had sought as early 1993 to subject all development on wetlands to strict environmental review, but that approach was rejected by the courts, which ruled in favor of arguments made by developers and by the National Mining Association.
Among the winners in that case was the National Association of Homebuilders, which Thursday expressed strong disagreement with the new rules.
``This is a bad decision,'' said a spokeswoman, Susan Asmus, ``and it is not consistent with the previous court rulings or with the Clean Water Act''.
In her own announcement, Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said: ``Today's proposal will allow us to go as far as we can through administrative reforms to close this loophole and protect wetlands.
The action we take today strengthens the protection of vital resources for future generations''.
Similarly the Sierra Club hailed the decision as an important strengthening of environmental safeguards.
``Limiting this loophole should protect the streams and wetlands that are home to thousands of birds, fish and other wildlife,'' said Robin Mann of the club's National Wetlands Committee.
``Streams and marshes protect our communities by acting as a natural sponge, soaking up water that would otherwise flood our neighborhoods''.
Administration officials warned that the action would not in itself be sufficient to guard against destruction of wetlands, and called on Congress to strengthen the Clean Water Act further.
The term ``wetlands'' is generally used to describe marshes, swamps, bogs and similar areas typically situated between dry land and bodies of water.
These areas play important roles in filtering and cleansing water, in serving as a reservoir for flood water, and in harboring fish and shellfish populations.
The EPA's announcement Thursday vividly described the areas' significance.
``Destruction of wetlands,'' the statement said, ``can increase flooding and runoff potential, harm neighboring property, cause stream and river pollution and result in the loss of valuable habitat''.
Since the late 1700s, the agency said, over half the nation's wetlands have been lost to development and other activities.
Seven states, it said, have lost more than 80 percent of their original wetlands.
China will no longer consider the interests of tree-cutters when building hydroelectric power station on the upper reaches of the Yangtze and will not leave log channels for them.
The State Environmental Protection Administration says that all water conservation projects, and agriculture and forestry development along China's major rivers must be assessed in accordance with environmental protection standards, and that no projects will be allowed if they pose a threat to the environment.
Ecological damage has been a source of this year's floods.
Water levels on some sections of the Yangtze and at Dongting Lake have reached record highs, even though the flow was below record levels.
The State Environmental Protection Administration said in a report that serious damage to lakes, pools, and wetlands, a decline in vegetation's ecological function, and the resulting soil erosion have all contributed to the floods.
The administration is doing a more detailed study of ecological problems along China's major rivers and is trying to suggest ways of easing the problem.
SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Star Wars'' fan Khari Crowder set up camp Saturday on the sidewalk near the Coronet Theater.
Next to him was a big banner that declared: ``I'M FIRST''.
``If I could be here a month, I would,'' said Crowder, who works for a San Francisco radio station under the name Krazy K.
He was among the handful of fans who began lining up at the movie house, hoping to snag tickets to the long-awaited ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace''.
The line _ a scene repeated in many other cities _ is expected to balloon as the film's May 19 opening approaches.
Advance ticket sales begin a week earlier.
It's a long wait and a lot of work for a movie that isn't even officially set to play at the Coronet.
But it looks like The Force is with the fans: United Artists Theaters executive vice president Mike Pade believes the deal is ``99.9 percent done'' with film distributor Twentieth Century Fox to book ``Episode I'' at the Coronet.
Crowder said he first showed up Friday night but the police told him to move.
So he slept in his van, which was parked nearby.
He was back in the same spot Saturday, lounging on a lawn chair.
He said he was prepared to wait until opening day.
``They don't call him `Krazy' for nothing,'' said a co-worker who dropped by to see him.
For other fans camped out, the wait is a minor inconvenience to see the first ``Star Wars'' installment since 1983.
``I've been waiting for this moment for 15 years,'' said A.J.
Nappa, a 20-year-old San Francisco resident who staked out a piece of pavement a few feet from the theater's box office.
For him, it's not just a movie.
``This is a defining moment for our generation''.
He and friend Joe Buckley began their camp-out Saturday at 9 a.m.
Their spirits were up as they munched on pizza and played Monopoly _ the ``Star Wars'' edition, no less.
The wind threatened to blow away their Monopoly money.
But even then they seemed prepared to weather the nearly three-week wait.
Stashed away in their cars were tents, sleeping bags and other necessities.
More friends will join them as the days pass, they said.
Round Table Pizza, a few doors from the Coronet, welcomes any extra business the ``Star Wars'' hype brings.
Assistant manager Peter Kwan said he's used to blockbuster films sparking big crowds, but he's not used to seeing a line form so early.
``I think ``Star Wars' is going to be the biggest,'' Kwan said.
Nappa, Buckley and his friends plan to watch the classic ``Star Wars'' trilogy on the eve of the film's opening _ right where they're camped, using a TV, VCR and gas generator.
The moviegoers at the Coronet aren't alone in their enthusiasm.
Over the weekend, there were signs of ``Phantom'' fever spreading: _ More than 15,000 fans overwhelmed the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum in Denver for the three-day ``Star Wars Celebration,'' a Lucasfilm- sanctioned event featuring cast, crew, props and merchandise _ enough to make the most rabid Jedi junkie drool.
_ FAO Schwarz, Toys R Us and other chains prepared to open Monday at 12:01 a.m. to hawk long-awaited ``Episode I'' goods, such as plastic light sabers, talking action figures and toy spaceships.
Merchandise sales from the classic trilogy have raked in more than $4 billion and the new film is expected to match that.
``The Phantom Menace,'' which opens in 2,500 theaters on opening day, is expected to surpass the $1.78 billion grossed worldwide by ``Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back'' and ``Return of the Jedi''.
Some even think it may sink ``Titanic's'' record-setting $1.84 billion worldwide receipts.
The $115 million film is a ``prequel'' set about 30 years before the first ``Star Wars'' film.
One part of the storyline tells of a 9-year-old slave boy named Anakin Skywalker, who eventually becomes the infamous Darth Vader of the trilogy.
The plot also centers around a brewing galactic war involving the Trade Federation and the Republic of pre-Imperial days.
Buckley, 19, tried to explain the appeal of the ``Star Wars'' series that has kept it a cult favorite since the first film appeared in 1977.
``I've watched a lot of movies and that's just the one that grabs you,'' he said.
``The movie's magic is still there.''
The ``Star Wars'' series has a lot to answer for.
In the specious book ``Easy Riders and Raging Bulls,'' it's targeted as the catalyst for the end of personal filmmaking.
Its success, along with that of ``Jaws,'' is said to have finished off a certain kind of movie forever.
In fact, the movie that probably started off everything that ``Star Wars'' is accused of was actually ``Gone With the Wind''.
It got the kind of blockbuster send-off in the press that is still imitated today, 60 years later.
``GWTW'' producer David O.
Selznick made sure that every step of the film's conception was covered by the all-too-willing news media: from the purchase of the rights to Margaret Mitchell's novel to the highly publicized worldwide search for a Scarlett O'Hara.
If the cable outlet E!, which serves up fresh news releases still warm from the Xerox machines, had been around in 1939, it would've been eagerly fogging up Selznick's office window for a glimpse of the Great Man's shrewd manipulations.
Actually, unlike ``GWTW,'' for which Selznick bent over backward to squeeze every inky drop of publicity, ``Star Wars'' was a personal project that flew below media radar for a long time before its release _ as hard as that is to believe _ and that Lucas had to shop around to get made.
Universal Studios, where he'd made the hit ``American Graffiti,'' refused to make ``Star Wars''.
And one of the few pre-release pieces on the film in The New York Times was stuck inside in the Sunday Arts &AMP; Leisure section, and detailed a Lucas working so hard to get out a picture that he was happy with that he seemed to be blowing on the prints to get them dry and into theaters on time.
Lucas' appropriation of simple mythology made ``Star Wars'' the first post-Vietnam War-era movie.
That is, the first big movie of its time by a film-school student who was totally uninfected by '70s cynicism or fear of the draft.
(Lucas was set to direct what became ``Apocalypse Now,'' with Francis Coppola producing, so it's not that he was unfamiliar with those elements).
The characters _ more archetype than character, really _ lent themselves to the sheer unsophisticated enjoyment of kids, and Lucas' canny pilfering of philosophy, psychology and camp gave those interested in searching out deeper meaning a chance to do so.
Luke Skywalker's quest has been compared with the New and Old Testaments, Homer and Superman's feats.
It seems that it took nostalgia to get ``Star Wars'' back into hyperspace.
If the trilogy, in which Luke goes nose to nose with Darth Vader and discovers that Vader is his father and that Princess Leia is his sister, had been re-released 10 years ago, it might have got the obsessives out of the house.
But bringing the trilogy out a couple of years ago piqued the interest of those who were kids when they saw it the first time.
And the rerelease also served as the most successful trailer in history, whetting appetites for the May 19 opening of ``Phantom Menace''.
``Phantom'' is in the unique _ and intimidating _ position of being hyped everywhere for its May 19 opening.
The reason that ``Star Wars'' is being blamed for leading to the enshrinement of infantilization in popular culture is that it changed the stakes in a way no one dreamed of before.
Before ``Star Wars,'' pictures aching for blockbuster status were based on well-publicized books, or spent a lot of money on movie stars and spectacle, in a sweaty-palmed attempt to get audiences away from their TVs.
Most major studios had nearly bankrupted themselves trying to produce expensive event films roughly 10 years before ``Star Wars'' was made.
(The biggest failure, ``Cleopatra,'' was made by 20th Century Fox _ ironically, the studio that became the home of ``Star Wars'' because no one else wanted it).
Even ``Jaws'' was an example of filmmakers chasing a hit; the movie was based on a bestselling trash novel that was yellowing on everyone's beach blanket a couple of summers before the picture came out.
But ``Jaws'' hit because it crossed over to the young audience that had been avoiding Julie Andrews singing to Rock Hudson (''Darling Lili''), or Clint Eastwood singing to anybody (''Paint Your Wagon'') _ and the youth audience was the first to go see a movie again and again.
``Star Wars'' had no big-name actors, and science fiction didn't make sense to the World War II generation that was running the film industry.
They didn't yet realize that science fiction was due to replace the western as the action metaphor that mattered.
The evidence, based on the middling ratings of ``Star Trek'' _ which would also go on to become a cottage industry (a cottage the size of Belgium) _ was that people wouldn't rouse themselves to watch spaceships roar across the screen.
Unless Stanley Kubrick put them up there.
``Star Wars'' also proved that, for the first time, a studio wouldn't have to wait a generation for a film to topple the No.
1 grossing movie of all time from the box office.
It took 35 years, and the arrival of ``Jaws,'' for ``GWTW'' to be removed as box-office champ.
But it took less than three years for ``Star Wars'' to unseat ``Jaws,'' and by the end of 1977, ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' was on its way to outdoing ``Star Wars'' in box-office receipts.
It seems unfair to fault ``Star Wars'' for the laziness of the film industry, for the fact that studios suddenly wanted to find a way to make a science of what was essentially a gamble: finding a manifest-destiny hit.
They'd forgotten that Lucas' film cost tens of millions less than the big-budget blunders featuring stars who had long since outlived their usefulness.
(Although Eastwood did go on to much larger success, he never made any money singing in his movies.
If you need any further proof, just check the layers of dust on top of that copy of ``Honkytonk Man'' at your local video store).
Maybe the most important thing to note about ``Star Wars,'' along with its inclusion of comic-book storytelling elements, Joseph Campbell invocations of mythology and businesslike handling of science fiction (Lucas didn't glorify otherworldly action adventure) is that it was the first big film-generation hit.
That is, it was the first movie to blow up by quoting other films, such as the procession at the end of ``Star Wars'' echoing Nazi documentarian Leni Riefenstahl's ``Triumph of the Will'' _ complete with the columns of soldiers moving in exactly the same pattern.
(At the time, it served as a fairly subtle indication that the Force had fascistic implications).
Or the x-wing shootout sequence lifted from scores of WWII dogfight scenes.
In the pre-video days, the world of old movies was mostly at the fingertips of film-school students.
People who could study them over and over, and carefully decide what to steal _ or, more politely, pay homage to.
By hitting so big so fast, ``Star Wars'' raised interest in entertainment, so that now every publication except ``The Watchtower'' sees the virtue of giving movie-related stories big play.
But the result is that the generation following every step of ``The Phantom Menace'' before it opens Wednesday is robbed of a sense of discovery.
They'll never know the thrill of going to a late show on a Monday night and finding it's sold out.
What ``Star Wars'' helped to create, and has now become a part of, is the need to have every element of a film spelled out before it's seen.
Lucas and company tried to sidestep spilling secrets, but the Internet is filled with reviews by fans who sneaked into exhibitor screenings.
Almost everyone has forgotten the joy of having a hit sneak up on you, of seeing a movie no studio wanted to make blast its way to the top.
That's why the world got sick of Quentin Tarantino so fast.

Who doesn't remember feeling an electrifying zing up the spine at that majestic blast of trumpets and the ``Star Wars'' title appearing on the big screen for the first time?
With innovative special effects and a classic good-vs.-evil theme, the ``Star Wars'' series became a part of pop culture.
For ``Star Wars'' enthusiasts, the hottest film shown last week had its sneak preview announced on the Internet and sent a small army of fans into theaters around the country to watch it over and over again.
The Zing strikes back.
That was the response to the two-minute trailer _ just the preview, mind you _ for ``The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas' latest installment in what is being billed as a prequel to the ``Star Wars'' trilogy.
The actual film is due in theaters on May 21, 1999.
The first ``Star Wars'' trailer also began showing months before the film's release in May 1977, but after reports of audiences booing and laughing, the film's distributor, 20th Century Fox, quailed and yanked it out of circulation.
It was a completely different scene Tuesday night at the sneak preview of the preview in a downtown Manhattan theater.
(Its official opening date was Friday, but the movie's Web site, www.starwars.com, announced advance screenings at selected theaters).
The lights went dark, and unlike the typical New York movie experience, the audience instantly shut up.
The crowd seemed to be holding its breath as scenes from ``The Phantom Menace'' thundered onto the screen in a flurry of spaceships, aliens, robots and humanoids, all new but vaguely familiar.
Set a generation before the original ``Star Wars'' movie, Episode I follows a youthful Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, the boy who is destined to become Darth Vader.
The cast includes Liam Neesom, Natalie Portman and Samuel L.
Jackson, among others.
To see the preview, fans still had to pay $9, the price of admission at most New York City theaters.
As soon as the trailer ended and the one for the remake of ``Psycho'' began, about 30 people ran to the theater next door to catch the ``Phantom Menace'' preview again as it began to play after the closing credits of ``Meet Joe Black''.
Ushers discreetly looked the other way as the trailer was being trailed.
``I've been here since 10 a.m.,'' said Chris Bergoch, a 26-year-old diehard ``Star Wars'' fan who took the day off from work and spent it ducking in and out of three screening rooms showing the trailer.
By 8 p.m., he'd seen it 20 times and was planning to spend the rest of the night there.
``I've waited 16 years for this,'' he said.
Another all-day viewer was Jude Lane, who was only 3 when ``Star Wars'' came out and says it was her first memory.
``No matter what the color, race, background or religion of the people watching the trailer, for two minutes and five seconds everyone feels the same,'' she said.
``You're friends with everybody in the theater''.
The renewed buzz about ``Star Wars'' has been building since last year's re-release of the trilogy, which incorporated new footage and state-of-the-art digital effects.
The movies offered nostalgia for viewers, and some of them brought their own children to experience the movies on the big screen, and not slice-and-dice versions on television.
Generation X, who once nagged Mom for those little $1.49 Luke Skywalker action figures, can today choose from vast array of toys including videos, games, books and a $29.95 CD-ROM titled ``Behind the Magic,'' which serves as a guide to the ``Star Wars'' universe and offers a glimpse of ``The Phantom Menace''.
But by May all the hype _ from merchandise to advertising _ might work to turn off an already cynical public.
``There are concerns, certainly in the wake of `Godzilla,''' said Andrew Hindes, a senior writer at Variety.
``Fox knows they don't have to overhype this.
You can't have more awareness.
If they're smart, they'll be subtle.
You could open it cold and it would still be huge''.
``Godzilla'' cost Sony Pictures Entertainment $200 million to make and market globally, but will result in little if any profit.
So far, the original ``Star Wars'' trilogy has made at least $1.7 billion.
``The Phantom Menace,'' the first in another Lucasfilm trilogy, cost $115 million to make.
No one knows if the hype will overshadow ``The Phantom Menace'' itself.
If Lucas has stuck with his original vision of the saga, which was of a simple, feel-good action series full of universal themes, it might not.
Deep down, past all the special effects and whiz-bang glitz, the director is conjuring with some fundamental elements of mankind.
`` `Star Wars' is not a simple morality play,'' the late Joseph Campbell, an authority on mythology, wrote.
``It has to do with the powers of life as they are either fulfilled or broken and suppressed through the action of man''.
Maybe with this newest episode, the marketing team will resist the temptation to paste hundreds of posters saying ``Yoda is THIS tall'' on the sides of street-corner newspaper boxes.
If there's a film that doesn't need too much hype, it would be ``The Phantom Menace,'' and face it, the Force is already with them. &QL;
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Arriving in a meteor shower of hype and dodging reviews from the Dark Side, the new ``Star Wars'' movie was set to open, appropriately, when the stars are out, at midnight screenings around the country early Wednesday.
``This is the best place to be right now in the whole world,'' said Chris Chaplin, 30, who had a ticket to the midnight show at Mann's Chinese Theater but was waiting in line hours before the doors swung open to get a good seat.
It's a foregone conclusion that ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' will be one of the biggest films of all time.
The only question is whether it will get enough repeat business to approach the $600 million ``Titanic'' collected in North America.
``It's going to kill in that opening week and do just huge, unprecedented business,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co.
``But beyond that you're in a very competitive release period''.
Best estimates are ``The Phantom Menace'' will reap more than $100 million in its five-day opening frame of Wednesday through Sunday, putting it on a pace to beat ``Lost World: Jurassic Park'' for the film-opener crown.
``Lost World'' made a record $90.2 million in a four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997.
``The Phantom Menace'' also will be competing against its ancestors.
The original ``Star Wars'' is the No.
2 movie of all time.
Counting its various re-issues, it has sold $461 million in tickets domestically.
``Return of the Jedi'' has grossed $309 million, for No.
7 on the all-time list, and ``The Empire Strikes Back'' has made $290 million, for ninth place.
Because of the intense adoration for the first three ``Star Wars'' movies, the new installment is considered critic-proof.
Which is a good thing for ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas.
The reviews mostly have been somewhere between negative and vicious.
The harshest had to be The New Yorker's Anthony Lane, who likened ``The Phantom Menace'' to excrement.
More typical was Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who called it a ``considerable letdown,'' a ``ponderous and plodding'' movie that is ``noticeably lacking in warmth and humor''.
Those who liked the movie focused on the visual spectacle.
Roger Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times that the movie was ``an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking''.
Produced, directed and written by Lucas, who also bankrolled the entire $115 million-plus budget, ``The Phantom Menace'' begins the back story of ``Star Wars''.
It is set a generation earlier, when Darth Vader was still a cute blond kid named Anakin Skywalker, who would grow up to become Luke's absentee father.
The merchandising campaign for ``The Phantom Menace'' is so far-reaching that it includes not just the usual action figures and video games but special Pepsi cans that you can collect for reasons beyond recycling.
Even a Colonel Sanders lookalike was brought back from the dead for a ``Star Wars'' chicken tie-in commercial.
The first of the hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans started lining up weeks ago, and when advanced tickets became available last week, there was a buying frenzy, with the midnight shows selling out almost immediately.
At Mann's Chinese, where the original ``Star Wars'' premiered 22 years ago, more than 100 people were lined up at midmorning Tuesday.
One was Analisa Siemsen, 21, an aspiring screenwriter.
``I never camped out for anything before,'' she said, ``but there's no Woodstock, so you have to come to the `Star Wars' line.''
DENVER _ There were a lot of storm troopers wandering around without their blaster guns at the ``Star Wars'' Celebration here, the first convention and exposition dedicated to the 22-year-old movie series to win the approval and support of the films' creator, George Lucas.
Through a strange twist of fate, the ``Star Wars'' Celebration landed in Denver on the same weekend as the National Rifle Association convention, which drew 7,000 protesters, and just 10 days after the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, a suburb 20 minutes away.
It was food for thought, not least because the ``Star Wars'' movies _ whose ``dark side'' leans heavily on the iconography of the Third Reich, an obsession of the Columbine killers _ are filled with the kind of shoot-'em-up entertainment fantasy that many citizens are blaming for society's ills.
Throughout the convention, which drew about 40,000 fans to the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum here Friday to Sunday, the specter of Columbine hung over the event like the Death Star.
A petition was circulated urging Decipher, the company that makes the ``Star Wars'' Customizable Card Game, to create a card depicting one of the slain students, a 14-year-old ``Star Wars'' fan named Steven Curnow, as a Jedi knight.
A Decipher spokesman said the company declined ``because other kids would start thinking it's fun to kill him with a blaster'' during game play.
Eric Harris, one of the two students who planned and died in the Littleton attack, included a rant on his Web site about things he hated, including ``Star Wars'' fans.
At the booth run by Star Wars Insider, the official fan club magazine, which organized the convention, action figures with guns were no longer for sale.
Dan Hogatt, a 30-year-old foreman at Ford Motor Co.
in Louisville, Ky.
, who dressed up as a very convincing Chewbacca complete with a fur head and suit, foam latex hands and drywall stilts that boosted his height to 8 feet, had to check his crossbow at the door.
(Light sabers were deemed permissible).
``They asked us not to bring our weapons in here,'' he said.
``And I was upset, but I totally understand''.
In the search for answers to the Littleton tragedy, convention goers turned to their favorite film.
One speaker told the audience to always remember the Columbine events and a quote from Yoda that appears in a trailer for the forthcoming ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menance''.
(The first movie in the new trilogy is set a generation before the first three ``Star Wars'' films).
``Fear is the path of the Dark Side,'' the green Zen master says.
``Fear leads to anger; anger leads to hate; hate leads to suffering''.
But in the end the anticipation that the first ``Star Wars'' prequel would be in theaters in less than three weeks _ on May 19, a date more anxiously awaited than the millennial New Year's Eve for most of these fans _ snapped fans out of tragic reality and into happy fantasy.
Some had overcome hardship to attend the celebration.
A dying father from the East Coast took his wife and young children, hoping that he could give them one last fond memory of being together as a family.
And Joshua Hamilton, a 26-year-old from Denver who works for a publisher of comic books, wandered through the exhibition center with his forehead lacerated with fresh cuts, a result of a car crash just hours earlier.
``Our car was totaled,'' said his wife, Kimberly.
``The ambulance came and put him in a neck brace and strapped him to a board.
They X-rayed both of us at the hospital and said we were OK.
It was worth it.
This is a once in a lifetime event''.
As films and personalities race through pop culture leaving a trail of momentary obsession behind them, ``Star Wars'' has passed the test of time and has spanned generations.
It has worked its epic tale of the relationships between good and evil, father and son, man and machine, youth and maturity, and thinking and feeling into a cultural landmark.
Joseph Campbell (whose book ``The Hero With a Thousand Faces'' seems to have inspired the galaxy-saving journey of Luke Skywalker) has been perhaps the films' greatest ally, examining it as a myth as universal as the Upanishads or the Bible.
``It's almost like a religion,'' said Won Park, a watercolor artist who flew in from Honolulu and dressed up as the Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson's character in ``Episode I'').
``If George Lucas turned this into a religion, it would blow L.
Ron Hubbard's Dianetics out of the window''.
Hubbard, of course, was a science-fiction writer before he led the Church of Scientology.
Nearby, Michael Cruz, a 24-year-old fan from New York City with seven ``Star Wars'' tattoos and a wife in her eighth month of pregnancy, said they were waiting to watch ``Episode I'' to select a name for their baby.
Some of the people feverishly wandering through the tents and airplane hangers housing ``Star Wars'' toy and video game previews, glass-encased movie props and collectible merchandise seemed to fit the stereotype of geeky males in their 20s and early 30s.
But the convention drew a racially, sexually, ethnically and generationally mixed crowd, many in costume although inexplicably there was nary a Luke Skywalker or C-3PO in sight.
It was hard to tell whether a parent or a child was the ``Star Wars'' fan, and often the answer was both.
nn (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Most of these conventioneers inhabit an alternate world in which George Lucas is God.
The universe of ``Star Wars'' is one of his making, the quality of its images and products rigorously maintained and controlled by his company over the years.
The tale itself _ a fantasy rendered with elaborate realism down to the last planet, droid and Gungan, each of which has its own background story _ was created with the kind of methodical obsession with detail that is the hallmark of an Outsider artist like Henry Darger.
In his Chicago apartment several decades ago, the reclusive Darger typed 15,000 single-spaced pages and drew 300 oversize water-colors carefully detailing of the plight of young slave girls in outer space and the battle between their captors, the Glandelinians, and their protectors, the Abbennians, along with all kinds of supplemental characters and species.
The battle myth could have attracted a ``Star Wars''-like cult complete with corresponding action figures.
But without the benefit of mass entertainment it attracted only one fan in the artist's lifetime: Darger himself.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) Lucas has the gift of being as focused on the commercial reach of his work as he is on its inner world.
Of the more than 30,000 ``Star Wars'' products _ a $4 billion business with rarities that fetch as much as $25,000 in the case of one Boba Fett action figure that shoots projectiles that may land in the throats of young children _ every one has been approved by Lucasfilm.
At the convention, merchants like Hallmark and Hasbro lucky enough to receive a Lucasfilm license showcased their official products _ from blow-up pool rafts shaped like Naboo Starfighters to toothbrushes emblazoned with the likeness of the new character Jar Jar Binks _ as if they were fragments of the lost ark.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) ``Don't videotape,'' a representative in a ``Star Wars'' costume shop told one fan.
``Next thing you know, it will be on the Internet''.
When asked why anyone would care to post images of costumes of familiar characters on the Internet, the representative replied, ``I don't know, they told me to say that,'' ``they'' referring to Lucasfilm officials.
``It's all been hush-hush''.
Merchants were under strict orders not to sell or even discuss merchandise from the forthcoming movie, some of which conveniently went on sale in stores on Monday, the day after the convention ended.
The convention may have been a way to repay diehard fans, as editors at Star Wars Insider said, but it was also a way to stick them with the bill by waving new collectibles under their noses.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) ``I placed my orders without knowing what the product was going to look like,'' said Kyle Puttkammer, owner of a store called Galactic Quest in Atlanta.
``But now that I've seen them, I'm going to increase my order''.
As he spoke, passers-by paused to take photos of Puttkammer, who was dressed as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi, and his 10-month-old daughter, dressed as Yoda, in her stroller.
In addition to being treated to never-before-screened scenes from the closely guarded film, audience members could attend question-and-answer sessions with many who worked on the film, including Jake Lloyd (who plays Anakin Skywalker, Luke's father and the future Darth Vader), Ray Park (the villain Darth Maul), Rick McCallum (the movie's producer), Anthony Daniels (the voice of C-3P0) and Pernilla August (Anakin's mother, Shmi Skywalker).
Ms. August was actually asked what it felt like to be the grandmother of Luke Skywalker.
``Star Wars'' buffs may be able to distinguish between fantasy and reality, but it was clear which side they preferred.
When an audience member asked Park whether his character, the devilish-looking, double-light-saber-wielding Darth Maul, would be returning in Episode II, the audience broke into confused murmurs.
``What do you want to hear''? asked the master of ceremonies, Daniels.
``The truth or a lie''?
Roaring through the tent came the overwhelming reply of over a thousand fans screaming in unison, ``A lie!''
SAN FRANCISCO _ The Force will soon be arriving at a toy store and Taco Bell near you.
In May, the merchandising and food promotion blitz for the long-awaited new ``Star Wars'' movie, ``Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' is scheduled to open.
A battalion of toy action figures and space crafts related to the movie will go on sale three weeks before ``Phantom'' opens nationwide.
Lucasfilm Ltd.
, which is producing the movie, has licensed Hasbro Inc.
, Galoob Toys Inc.
and Lego Group to make the toys.
Promotions with Pepsi, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken are expected to blast off in May as well.
But that's about all Lucasfilm is divulging.
The company, which has a history of shrouding in secrecy the plots and special effects of the ``Star Wars'' movies, has kept a tight lid on its merchandising and promotion campaigns for ``Phantom''.
Despite few details about product and food tie-ins to the movie, industry observers say ``Phantom,'' which kicks off the second ``Star Wars'' trilogy, could prove to be the mother of all film merchandising attempts.
``I think there's a very good chance this will be the single biggest movie ever,'' said Marty Brochstein, executive editor of The Licensing Letter, a New York trade publication.
Brochstein estimated that sales from products related to ``Phantom'' could exceed those of the industry's largest single-movie merchandising grosser, ``The Lion King''.
Brochstein estimated that the Disney film has sold about $1.5 billion worth of toys, mugs, T-shirts and videos since its 1994 release.
``Everybody would be mightily disappointed if (``Phantom'') didn't move over $1 billion in merchandise,'' he said.
Judging from the estimated $4.5 billion in product sales generated since 1977 from the first three ``Star Wars'' flicks, most industry watchers are confident the new take won't disappoint.
According to New York-based License magazine, ``Star Wars'' films have had the highest-grossing product sales of any movie series.
They are followed by merchandise sales from ``The Lion King''; the ``Batman,'' ``Jurassic Park''and ``Star Trek'' films.
The cult of the original ``Star Wars'' films is likely to guarantee a huge audience for ``Phantom'' products.
``With `Star Wars', you're talking about a pre-sold market,'' said Diane Cardinale, spokeswoman for the Toy Manufacturers of America, an industry trade association in New York.
``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas is credited with founding the film merchandising industry.
As a result, Lucasfilm knows this segment of the industry like no other film studio.
```Star Wars' represented the birth of modern movie licensing,'' Brochstein said.
Lucas retained the licensing rights to products that used the ``Star Wars'' name.
``Before that, licensing was considered ancillary income.
But now in major films, particularly those that are kid-oriented, it becomes a budget item''.
Lucas's company has kept most of the details of the ``Phantom'' merchandising and promotional campaigns a mystery to build public interest for the movie.
``The Lucas people have been very, very strict about what they're doing,'' Brochstein said.
``They've let things out in dribs and drabs.
They make it a game''.
Last fall, Lucasfilm Ltd.
allowed retailers to begin selling three of the new ``Phantom'' toys: a four-inch plastic figure of Jedi knight Mace Windu that resembles Samuel L.
Jackson, the actor who plays the character; a space vehicle called STAP with Battle Droid; and the Gian Speeder and Theed Palace play set.
Retailers will sell more ``Phantom'' toys starting May 3, but Lucasfilm has not allowed Hasbro and Galoob to discuss the full range of merchandise they'll be releasing.
Lego has been allowed to say it will be coming out with two product lines _ Lego Star Wars Classic and Lego Star Wars Episode I _ that allow kids to build spacecraft from the first three ``Star Wars'' movies and the new film using traditional Lego pieces.
In addition to the toys, Sony Classical will release a ``Phantom'' soundtrack in May.
Video games from Nintendo and Lucas Arts are expected to roll onto store shelves in May as well, and Sega is making a new arcade game based on ``Phantom''.
On the promotions side, Pepsi, Taco Bell, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut also have been sworn to secrecy about their tie-ins with the movie.
Pepsi is reportedly producing several billion soda cans plastered with pictures of Star Wars characters.
The cans featuring Yoda will have prizes.
Pepsi would not comment on its promotions.
Tricon Global Restaurants Inc.
, the Louisville, Ky.
, parent of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken, also wouldn't talk about its promotions.
TOKYO (AP) -- Star Wars mania has struck in Japan, where fans turned out in droves at theaters around the country Saturday for a sneak preview of the hit movie.
Some in costume and others toting light sabers, the movie-goers began lining up as early as Thursday to see ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'', which officially opens on July 10, more than five weeks after its U.S. debut.
``It's like a festival,'' said Yuki Nishijima, a 19-year old student who had been waiting seven hours for one of three late-night showings at the Nihon Gekijo theater in Tokyo.
Around him, hundreds of people sat in the theater's sweltering entryway, fanning themselves and passing the time with everything from backgammon to beer.
Japan, the world's second largest movie market, is home to legions of Star Wars fans, and the film has been heavily hyped by the media in the weeks leading up to its first showing.
Some say the space fantasy series holds a special appeal for the Japanese, who see it as an updated version of classic samurai films.
The first ``Star Wars'' movie was based loosely on ``The Hidden Fortress,'' a 1958 film about a warrior's journey by Akira Kurosawa, Japan's most renowned director.
``I realize this has sort of become a media event,'' said Chitose Koike, a 37-year old pianist who was waiting to see the sneak-preview.
``But I wanted to see it before everyone else''.
Nihon Gekijo officials said advance ticket sales had already surpassed previous records for the theater.
The new ``Star Wars'' prequel is good enough, but only just.
It's got the hardware, but neither the characters, the imagination, nor the resonance one had hoped for.
What fans will want to know, now that the hype can be replaced with actuality, is whether ``The Phantom Menace'' is sufficiently of a piece with the first three films to make it worth seeing.
The answer is yes, but not by much.
George Lucas, perhaps inevitably drawn back into the ``Star Wars'' gravitational field, has talked a lot about technological razzle-dazzle not being nearly as important as the characters and story.
But the truth is that it's the visuals and the new screenful of computer-generated whiz-bangs and other toys that drive ``The Phantom Menace''.
Character and personality take a back seat on this ride.
The kids toward whom the new film is frankly skewed will storm the malls and multiplexes to see Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi as a young hothead Jedi warrior, how Obi-Wan's wise mentor, Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn, teaches him control, and how they both discovered Jake Lloyd's prodigy, Anakin Skywalker, before he even knew there was such a thing as The Force, much less a Dark Side of it.
R2-D2 and C-3PO (before he got the skin job that made him gold and shiny) are on hand, too.
We're also introduced to Natalie Portman's young queen Amidala, who becomes the mother of Luke and Leia; to Samuel L.
Jackson's Mace Windu, whose role as a Jedi Council mainstay is so small you know he'll be back in later episodes; and to Ahmed Best's comic relief, Jar Jar Binks, a rubber-limbed amphibian Gumby figure who talks funny and walks clumsy and brightens the rather long and lightweight film a lot.
In short, there's a lot that's eye-filling in ``The Phantom Menace,'' but not much that's brain-filling, and nobody is going to think of it as soul food.
Its high point isn't even the space or land battles one has come to expect of ``Star Wars''.
It's a chariot race right out of ``Ben-Hur,'' except that it takes place on the desert planet of Tatooine, its chariots are jet-powered jalopy pods, and young Anakin looks like a World War I flying ace as he challenges the nasty champ in a contest whose ultimate winner will be Nintendo; pod race games will fly off the shelves as fast as laser swords.
Great pains were taken to make the gear in ``Phantom Menace'' look less sleek and evolved than in ``Star Wars,'' a reasonable enough decision since it takes place three decades earlier.
Jabba the Hutt, who figures briefly, even looks less blobby than the heavyweight we meet later.
Looking at Lloyd's smart, tough, empathetic Anakin has the effect of making us dread what we know will later be his downfall.
But the fact is that there isn't much emotional tug this time around.
``The Phantom Menace'' is bland, perhaps not surprisingly considering the difficulty of conjuring up the freshness and wonder with which the original burst upon the scene.
Although technically slicker, this installment isn't nearly as involving as ``Star Wars'' or ``The Empire Strikes Back''.
(By the time ``Return of the Jedi'' came out, there was a noticeable drop-off in energy and inspiration _ a trend that continues here).
There's no equivalent here of Alec Guinness's twinkling wisdom, Harrison Ford's unruliness, or the looming ominousness of the grown Darth Vader.
Lucas has written better stuff here for his Industrial Light &AMP; Magic computers than he has for the people.
``The Phantom Menace'' mutes McEwan's Obi-Wan and Neeson's Qui-Gon to the point where we grow detached enough to speculate on possible influences on aspects the new film.
When Qui-Jon and Obi-Wan visit Anakin's mother, learn about the remarkable circumstances surrounding the boy's birth, and ask her permission to take her son from slavery on Tatooine to a life as an apprentice Jedi knight, the moment seems to echo, intentionally or not, ``Citizen Kane''.
Visually, the idyllic capital of Naboo, the peaceful planet ruled by Amidala and coveted by the trouble-making Dark Lord of the Sith, suggests a cross between Marin County and the patina-domed campuses of Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley.
The elaborate sci-fi towers of the Federation's capital city of Coruscant suggest ``Metropolis'' passed through a computer.
Darth Maul, the bad guy in the climactic laser sword fight, suggests a hooded wannabe from the rock group KISS.
Lucas even has fun with ``Monday Night Football'' in the character of a two-headed announcer at the pod races.
The big victory celebration seems like a halftime show.
Just as Steven Spielberg's ``Jurassic Park'' dissolved the line between movies and theme parks, so ``The Phantom Menace'' dissolves the line between movies and merchandising.
It's its own giant exercise in product placement.
It's hard to believe that McGregor's Obi-Wan and Portman's Amidala won't be given juicier material in episodes two and three.
Even allowing for the inevitably overinflated expectations connected to this overinflated event, ``The Phantom Menace'' is more fizzle than sizzle.
Although it at least avoids disaster, it brings to mind an exchange at Lucas's recent press conference in New York.
When I asked the director what was at stake for him with this movie, personally and professionally, he replied, ``Nothing''.
Perhaps that's the trouble with it.
LONDON (AP) -- A failed bet on a "Star Wars" craze in Britain has left a publisher with 10 million unsold books and a vacancy for the post of chief executive.
British children's books publisher Dorling Kindersley announced Monday that its chief executive has resigned because of "a seriously misjudged" overinvestment in books tied to the launch of the latest movie in the saga, "Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace".
Expecting a Christmas rush, James Middlehurst arranged for the group to print 13 million of the books in the 18 months to Dec.
31 last year.
Sales totaled 3 million.
Company chairman Peter Kindersley blamed the "Star Wars" debacle for more than half of a pretax loss of $41 million which it expects to announce in the spring.
ATLANTA _ The phenomenon began a long time ago in a cineplex not so far away.
Now it's coming back _ in 83 days, to be precise.
And leading up to its May 21 release, George Lucas' fourth ``Star Wars'' film will be one hyped-up ``Menace'' to society.
Next month will bring a new 2.5-minute trailer for ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' purported to have more than 100 fresh sequences from the film, featuring battle droids, laser firepower and an eye-popping canyon race.
Later, Pepsi USA will launch an ad campaign for soft drink collectibles that will likely include a gold Pepsi can sporting Jedi instructor Yoda and the ``Star Wars: Episode I'' logo.
And starting April 30, Denver will host the Lucasfilm Ltd.-sanctioned ``Star Wars Celebration,'' a three-day fan festival at the Wings Over the Rockies Museum with ``Phantom Menace'' sneak peeks, appearances by many of the film's stars, including young Jake Lloyd who plays Anakin Skywalker (a.k.a.
Darth Vader), and a marketplace hawking merchandise from all the ``Star Wars'' films.
When the movie finally debuts in May, some think its box office take will be staggering, likely topping ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park's'' record $92.73 million opener in 1997.
For ``Phantom Menace,'' Hollywood is planning on stepping out of the way.
``You've got a clear path completely around that movie for weeks,'' says Ira Mayer, publisher of Entertainment Marketing Letter in New York.
``Nobody's putting anything major out against it''.
Moviegoers haven't seen hype this big since, well, last summer and ``Godzilla''.
``Hype can kill you, as `Godzilla' found out,'' says Dan Cox, film editor at the trade magazine Variety.
``I expect (`Phantom Menace') will make an enormous amount of money, but I don't know how it will hold up.
George Lucas is a little out of touch, frankly.
But he can tell a story well.
I just wonder if the technology is going to be up to what people are expecting''.
Certainly, people are expecting a lot.
Last November ``you had moviegoers paying $7.50 not to see a movie but to see the first trailer (when it was paired with films like `The Waterboy' and `Meet Joe Black'),'' says CNN's Jim Moret, anchor of ``Showbiz Today''.
``If that isn't pre-opening buzz, I don't know what is''.
One of those fans was Kristopher Graham, 24, of Dawsonville, who drove to Alpharetta's North Point theaters just to see the trailer.
He dubbed it ``awesome.
It sends chills down you''.
The whole ``Star Wars'' thing ``has come to occupy our culture in a unique way,'' says Matthew Bernstein, associate professor of the film studies program at Emory University.
``They talk about a film everybody has seen like `The Wizard of Oz'.
It's occurred to me I'm no longer sure every child in America growing up sees 'The Wizard of Oz'.
But you know every one of them sees 'Star Wars'''.
And it's not just in America.
Recently, Moritz Minzlaff, an 18-year-old German college student in Karlsruhe, south of Heidelberg, posted an Internet message begging fellow foreign ``Star Wars'' fans to join him in traveling to the United States to see ``Phantom Menace'' in May (opening dates outside North America start in June).
So far Minzlaff has gotten responses from dozens of fans in Germany, France, Slovakia, Great Britain, Sweden, Austria and Switzerland.
He plans to travel to Los Angeles with the group he assembles for the first showing of ``Phantom Menace''.
``I haven't done anything like this (before),'' Minzlaff says in an interview via e-mail.
``I think it's a crazy thing to do but that's part of the fun.
`Star Wars' is something special to me.
I've never been this excited about anything.
I started counting down the days when the release was more than 500 days away''.
Similar sentiments clog the Internet, which has been littered with ``Star Wars'' sites for years.
Activity has intensified in recent weeks with unofficial postings of purported sound clips pirated from the film's production, an alleged frame-by-frame accounting of what moviegoers will see in the coming new trailer and spy reports from London's Abbey Road where John Williams recently began recording the ``Phantom Menace'' soundtrack.
Much of the information is housed in sites commonly referred to among the webnoscenti as ``spoilers'' for the obvious reason that they readily reveal anything they can get their hands on.
The minutiae is often mind-boggling.
Ryan Johnson's www.astheygo.com, for instance, details one script excerpt he's ``99 percent sure that this might be authentic''!
Here it is: Jedi: ``Holy Moley!
What's that''?
Anakin: ``I've got a bad feeling about this ''...
Jedi: ``You always say that''.
Some Internet users such as Germany's Minzlaff avoid many of the spoiler sites.
``I'm very much concerned about knowing too much about the story,'' he says.
But he does hook into sites like www.countingdown.com at least three times a day for ``Phantom Menace'' updates.
Countingdown.com is an obsessive-compulsive nirvanaland.
The entrance to the ``Star Wars'' pages contains a digital clock counting down the days, hours, minutes and seconds until ``Phantom Menace'' opens in theaters.
(You, of course, can capture the clock to place on your own computer desktop).
Inside are news bits gleaned from media around the globe, posters from the film and spy reports, including the latest gossip on the burgeoning line of upcoming toys.
One item, for instance, estimates exactly how many new Lego ``Star Wars'' Mindstorm Droid Developer Kits (each selling for $100) will be available at every Toys R Us this fall.
The Internet's ``Phantom Menace'' mania, however, isn't as shocking to some as the mainstream media's handling of both of the film and marketing in general.
``Everybody's talking about the hype,'' Entertainment Marketing Letter's Mayer says.
``The sense in the press is that (the film) is the second coming.
The truth is there is no next Beatles, there's no next Elvis.
There is just what there is''.
In effect, he says, ``the media is pushing how marketing is done''.
The press has definitely picked up on the ``Phantom Menace'' buzz.
Many newspapers, including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, covered the debut of the first trailer.
USA Today has announced it will publish a package of ``Phantom Menace'' stories today.
The San Jose Mercury News began a weekly column on the coming film last Sunday.
And magazines like Vanity Fair have run extensive interviews.
Movieline even featured twentysomething movie and TV stars talking about their favorite ``Star Wars'' characters.
(``Felicity's'' Keri Russell, for example, admits she wore her hair in big, tight Princess Leia ear buns for two years after seeing the original film, which debuted in 1977).
To CNN's Moret, it's all pretty much justified.
``I don't look at our function as being a marketer of the film,'' he says.
``But if it's being embraced enough by moviegoers to obsess over seeing a trailer, if people are going to camp out to get the first tickets, that's a story''.
With this film, there's a ``clear indication for quality and blockbuster,'' Moret says.
``You don't often have both''.
Plus, he adds, all the hype and all the marketing and all the press and all the Web sites will only be too much ``when the fans say it is too much''.
Is it too much?
Certainly not for Keir Larock, 17, a student at the Maine School of Science and Mathematics in Limestone, Ma.
In a phone interview, he says he's seen the first three ``Star Wars'' films ``200 times each easily,'' has downloaded from the Internet at least seven copies of the first ``Phantom Menace'' trailer and is organizing via the Web his own group of fans to see the film on opening day.
``I was totally mystified'' while watching that trailer for the first time, he says.
``I saw my reason to live for the next six months''.

HOLLYWOOD _ The opening title reads: ``Every generation has a legend.
... Every journey has a first step.
... Every saga has a beginning''.
Then the John Williams music starts, the opening chords so unmistakable that movie audiences burst into applause.
``Star Wars'' is back.
Or more precisely, a 2-minute 10-second trailer for ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' the first ``Star Wars'' film since the release of ``Return of the Jedi'' 15 years ago.
The new film, written and directed by George Lucas, opens on May 21, but the anticipation for it is extraordinary, several distribution executives say.
The trailer was screened on Tuesday in 26 states on 75 screens selected by the movie's distributor, 20th Century Fox.
Fans heard about it four days earlier on the Lucasfilm Web site (www.starwars.com), and it quickly turned into a film event that had no precedent.
Theaters showing films like ``The Waterboy,'' ``The Siege'' and ``Meet Joe Black'' were crammed with people _ mostly young men _ who paid full admission just to see the trailer and left when the movie began.
The trailer was also shown after each movie ended, so a handful of theater owners allowed filmgoers to return with their torn ticket stub.
(Historically, trailers used to be shown after movies ended, hence the name).
``This is incredible,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co.
, which monitors the box office for theater owners.
``We've never heard of a trailer packing people into a theater.
It's a precedent-setting event''.
He said the reaction to the gimmick made it inevitable that the new ``Star Wars'' would have powerful audience appeal.
``It's going to reach fever pitch with this movie, which is unquestionably going to be one of the biggest of 1999,'' Dergarabedian said.
Tom Sherak, the chairman of Fox's Domestic Film Group, said the idea for the early-in-the-week trailer, which was released nationally over the weekend, came from Lucas' associates.
``They said since they have such a big fan base, why not set something up just for the fans first and make sure it's shown to the rest of the public very quickly''? he said.
``The idea was to figure out a way to have fun with this.
`Star Wars' is part of the culture, but it's still a movie.
Let's treat it like a movie''.
Underscoring the box office impact of the trailer _ and the trailer alone _ were the substantial gains made on Tuesday night over Monday at theaters showing it.
At the Mann Theater in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, near the University of California, ``The Siege'' took in $13,000 on Tuesday night; it had taken in only $1,000 on Monday night.
At the Union Square Theater 14 in Manhattan, ``Meet Joe Black'' grossed $6,300 on Monday night, but $10,800 on Tuesday night.
The new ``Star Wars'' is the first of three planned prequels that will go back in time a full generation and detail the story of Anakin Skywalker's transformation into the mysterious and sinister Darth Vader.
In the new film, Skywalker is a 9-year-old boy and Obi-Wan Kenobi is a brash young Jedi knight.
Lucas himself has virtually total control over the film.
Not only has he put his personal fortune into it, he is in charge of its promotion and distribution.
No decisions are made without his approval.
The trailer itself shows glimpses of some of the film's stars: Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi; Liam Neeson as his mentor, Qui-Gon Jinn; Natalie Portman as the young Queen and Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker.
Samuel L.
Jackson and Terence Stamp are also in the cast.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Whatever the mystique of ``Star Wars,'' the reaction to the trailer seemed to burn up the Internet.
It has been shown on the ``Star Wars'' Lucasfilm Web site, and was widely videotaped by fans when it was shown on ``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Access Hollywood''.
``The trailer felt like five seconds,'' said Harry Knowles, who founded the Ain't-It-Cool-News Web site (www.aint-it-cool-news.com), which is populated by movie fans obsessed with ``Star Wars''.
Over the Internet, Knowles seemed stricken with guilt about his early qualms about the new ``Star Wars''.
``I hate myself for every doubt I had,'' he said.
``What on earth was I ever thinking?
Analyzing every nugget, every whisper.
Worrying about reshoots and deadlines.
George seems to be 100 percent on his game''.
Other fans, on the Internet, talked about weeping and shaking while watching the trailer.
On Knowles' Web site, a fan named David Chung summed up his feelings: ``What can I say!
George Lucas must be a superior form of life!''
With about two weeks to go before the release of the new film ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,'' there are so many ``Star Wars'' sites on the Web that the creator of one site, Jedi Temple (www.spiderspace.net/jeditemple), felt compelled to list his favorite 100.
And that barely scratched the surface.
Hardly a shred of information or rumor about the $115 million ``Star Wars'' film has escaped legions of wired ``Star Wars'' enthusiasts.
``The information is pouring in like crazy from all over the world,'' said Steve Head, one of a dozen co-editors of The Force.net (www.theforce.net), a popular fan-created Web site that promises Web surfers ``your daily dose of `Star Wars'''.
``We used to have to fish for information,'' said Head, a 33-year-old real-estate marketing representative.
``Now the fish are flying out of the water''.
Many Web fans promptly package what they know (or think they know) and post it on sites that include clever design, often using stunning homemade artwork and computer graphics.
There are even homemade films that include take-offs on ``Star Wars'' characters, like ``Kung Fu Kenobi's Big Adventure'' (at The Force.net), one of several parodies made by Evan Mather, a 29-year-old landscape architect in Seattle.
``It's just taken on a life of its own,'' Lou Tambone said of his site at www.starwarz.com.
While he said that he is not a ``fanboy,'' mildly pejorative slang for an aggressively obsessive ``Star Wars'' fan, he did mention that the John Williams ``Star Wars'' theme was played at his wedding reception two years ago.
And on the wedding cake were figurines of Princess Leia and Han Solo.
Tambone, who is 29 and lives in Boston, said the Internet's relatively low cost, capacity for graphics and digital effects, and global reach made it a natural medium for the generation that grew up on ``Star Wars''.
Todd Boyd, a professor at the University of Southern California School of Cinema and Television, agreed.
``The core audience of the Internet is the core audience of `Star Wars,''' he said.
The strong affinity among ``Star Wars'' fans for the Web has not been lost on the film's producers, who have answered the flood of fan sites with a deluge of hype of their own.
``What we found out was that a great way to communicate with our fans was through our Web site,'' said Jim Ward, director of marketing for Lucas' company, Lucasfilm Ltd.
``Rather than simply being a marketing device, we discovered that it is really a medium for entertainment and beyond''.
The site (www.starwars.com) offers its millions of Web visitors something new: truly insider information, production photographs and the occasional scoop.
It was on the site that Lucasfilm first released the name of the film, ``The Phantom Menace''.
It also used the site to announce the company's decision _ since rescinded _ to offer no advance ticket sales for ``The Phantom Menace'' for fear of ticket scalping.
When the film's first two-minute trailers went on the Internet last November, Web servers offering the teaser were swamped.
When the second trailer went on line in March, more than a million people downloaded it in a single day.
But long before Lucasfilm's publicity machine was thrown into hyperdrive, sites like www.jedinet.com, Starwarz and the Holocron (www.holocron.simplenet.com) were lush oases for those thirsting for speculation and gossip about the first ``Star Wars'' film in 16 years.
Newsdroid (www.newsdroid.com), subtitled Headline News for Star Wars Fans, recently explored the persistent rumor that Jake Lloyd, the child actor who portrays Darth Vader as a boy in the new film, has had his speaking parts redone by another child actor.
On Holocron, articles delve into such weighty topics as similarities between ``Star Wars'' and ``Gone With the Wind''.
One writer notes, for example, that in ``Star Wars'' the ``empire enslaves entire planets; the South enslaved an entire race''.
On several sites there is a petition drive to have a special card in a ``Star Wars'' board game be made to honor the memory of Steven Curnow, a 14-year-old ``Star Wars'' fan who was shot and killed at Columbine High School in April in Littleton, Colo.
Practically every other mouse click on these sites leads to downloadable ``Star Wars'' photographs, screen savers, sounds, animated graphics, fan-made movie shorts and cartoons.
There are also links to collectibles for sale and trade, backgrounds on characters, vehicles and weapons, and well-marked ``spoilers'' _ glimpses, with words and sometimes pictures, of the new film's much-guarded plotline.
Some Webmasters of ``Star Wars'' sites claim to have pirated versions of the film's shooting script, a kind of bible they use to weed out wild rumors about how the action unfolds in the film.
And many claim to have vast networks of contacts and spies working on the film and many of its toy and promotional campaigns who feed the sites with provocative tidbits.
&QL; nn News Service &QC; When ``Star Wars'' blasted into movie theaters in 1977, the Internet was hardly a household word; it would be almost 20 years before the World Wide Web would begin appearing in American homes.
And nowhere among the futuristic light sabers and X-wing fighters was there a glimpse of anything that even slightly resembled the Net, which is a shame.
If Princess Leia could have just sent the rebels the stolen plans for the Death Star in an e-mail attachment (cc: Obi-Wan Kenobi), she could have saved everyone a lot of trouble.
But the Internet and PC-inspired technology appear to be exerting some influence on the look of the new ``Star Wars'' film, ``The Phantom Menace''.
For example, while there is still no explicit mention of anything like the Web on exotic planets like Naboo and Coruscant, there are a series of spiffy view screens that look like Palm Pilots you might find in a galaxy far, far away.
In tune with the esthetic sensibilities George Lucas has insisted upon for his ``Star Wars'' films, these view screens have the decidedly worn, retrofuturistic look of handheld computers that have seen better days.
``That's George's whole design philosophy, to make things very believable,'' said Doug Chiang, director of concept design for ``Phantom''.
The view screens, which Chiang said were not really supposed to be stand-ins for laptops and such, appear to be fashioned from alien metals and have organic details, like handles made from animal bones.
One even looks like a cross between a hand mirror and an old microphone from the golden age of radio.
``They're small versions of a TV set,'' Chiang said, adding that there was no real equivalent of the Internet in the new movie.
Lucas' idea is that technological evolution in the ``Star Wars'' universe occurred quite differently than it did on Earth, Chiang said.
The view screens, inspired by drawings made by Chiang, are mostly used in the film to permit characters to see things difficult to see otherwise, like a child who is far away.
The view screens are somewhat like computer screens linked to Webcams.
``Well, you see it, but it is never explained in the movie,'' Chiang conceded.
``George doesn't like to focus on the technology.''
Does any adventure series have a greater _ and more supremely deserved _ reservoir of good will going for it than ``Star Wars''?
At a preview screening last week in San Francisco, the keyed-up audience for ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' cheered the dimming of the lights before the film even began.
They cheered the Lucasfilm logo.
They even cheered Rupert (talk about an evil empire)!
Murdoch's 20th Century Fox logo.
They cheered the slogan ``A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away''.
Truth to tell, there were more cheers at the beginning than there were, almost 2 1/4 hours later, at the end.
Right off the bat, Ewan McGregor, as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, echoes Han Solo's ``I have a bad feeling about this''.
It would be merely clever and terribly unfair to say ``Star Wars'' fans might share that sentiment.
Is ``The Phantom Menace'' worth seeing?
What a question!
Of course it is.
It is a stunning spectacle, maybe even Industrial Light &AMP; Magic's greatest special-effects achievement.
But creator George Lucas has left a lot of room for improvement, particularly for character development and emotional juice, in this beginning of the second trilogy.
We have every right to assume _ to demand _ that the next two episodes will accomplish exactly that.
For the moment, there are high hopes for a promise not yet fully satisfied.
The most distinctive thing about ``The Phantom Menace,'' which opens Wednesday, is the extraordinary degree to which it is animation _ far, far and away more so than any previous ``Star Wars''.
An accurate categorization of it would be sci-fi, live-action animated feature.
From richly imagined new computer-generated characters who interact uncannily with the human actors to a strategically paced bonanza of extended, huge-scale, self-contained sequences, the computer-generated animation is a marvel of solidity, density, color subtlety and 3-D depth.
It is truly out there.
The action introduces us to Anakin Skywalker, the 9-year-old we already know will become not only Darth Vader but also the father of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia.
Two Jedi knights, dispatched as ambassadors to broker peace between the intergalactic Trade Federation and the idealistic planet Naboo, believe that they have discovered along the way the Chosen One who will bring the galaxy into equilibrium with the Force.
Remember the Force?
It's not the seat-rattling sound that rumbles through the theater when spaceships accelerate, but it could've fooled me.
The new computer-generated creature Jar Jar Binks also brings off the illusion.
A buddy of Jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor), Jar Jar kind of fills the Chewbacca vacuum.
He has droopy ears, bulging eyes on stems and a humanoid torso.
He's got an anteater's wandering tongue and a hipster's walk, put to delightful use in a dance of celebration with New Orleans-style prancing droids.
Ironically in ``The Phantom Menace,'' the animated characters have more human juice to them than the live ones.
The humans, low-key and one-dimensional, are the stick figures.
This new trilogy needs a lovable rascal like Han Solo and a bitchy, bossy princess like Leia _ somebody to set off some sparks.
The stolid Neeson is warmer than anyone has a right to expect, and even his Buddhist platitudes (``Be mindful of the moment'') are never burdensome.
My favorite: ``The ability to speak does not make them intelligent''.
The prevailing message is: We must learn to help one another.
McGregor is more of a problem.
As the living prequel to the saint of the series, in a brush cut with a topknot that seems to have slipped down the back of his head, McGregor seldom shows his natural vivacity as an actor and, especially, his unpredictability.
An Alec Guinness imitation is interesting only up to a point.
Natalie Portman has grown up from the 11-year-old urchin in Luc Besson's ``The Professional'' and now is a regal, perhaps too regal, queen of Naboo and something of a clothes horse.
One of her costumes recalls the Elizabethan age, and another is very Japanese.
She has one stripe of lip gloss on her lower lip, and it's likely that teenage girls already are imitating it.
There are some shocks and surprises along the way, and Portman is involved in one of the best.
The big question about Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), to my mind, is what planted the seeds that led to his embracing the dark side of the Force as Darth Vader.
As yet, we don't know.
A slightly younger but still wispy-haired Yoda says that ``fear is the path to the dark side,'' but the Anakin we see is resourceful and brave.
He's already involved in the creation of a see-through C-3P0 droid, and the nearby prototype of R2-D2 is greeted by the audience like an old friend.
Fighter-pilot son Luke will be a chip off the old block, as we see in Anakin's entry in the pod race.
The cab of his aircraft, by the way, sometimes hangs behind the free-floating jets and, in the twists and turns through canyons, sometimes precedes them.
&UR; &QL; &LR; &UR; (MORE) &LR; &QL; The battles and other set pieces, such as the pod race, go off like a carefully timed string of firecrackers.
The computer-generated landscapes, cityscapes and seascapes are awesome.
An underwater city is surrounded by an increasingly ripping series of marine monsters that sequentially gobble each other up.
``There's always a bigger fish,'' Neeson observes drily.
The cityscapes range from pre-Mayan and Babylonian to Venetian canals and the precipitous, illuminated towers of skyscrapers.
One battle takes place on an enormous plain, and a climactic lightsaber fight is waged among ramps, platforms and infinitely deep crevasses.
Among the creatures are ants-on-their-hind-feet cannon fodder called battle droids.
Another new one is the greedy, winged slave master of Anakin.
His bet with Qui-Gon Jinn leads up to the pod race.
The ever-resourceful Jedi knight has a jujitsu-like knowledge of how to let an opponent defeat himself.
The celebratory scene, a hallmark of Lucas' films and, I think, of his philosophy, features some of John Williams' new music, which otherwise tends to fade from consciousness with overfamiliarity.
Jar Jar, by the way, sometimes seems to sound like the Central American houseboy in Robin Williams' ``The Birdcage''.
There are other intriguing dialect choices, such as the Federation reps who seem to speak English with a Mandarin accent.
Before Tuesday's show started, a representative of the publicity agency presenting the screening asked audience members to report any camcorders they spotted among them.
Piracy is a serious international problem, of course, but anybody who sees a shaky copy of ``The Phantom Menace'' on a small screen with tinny sound is missing the point.
The need for the ``special edition'' remake of Episodes IV, V and VI, adding landscapes and cityscapes to put the action in a more believable context, must have arisen during creation of the extraordinary environment for ``The Phantom Menace''.
People may have forgotten how low-rent and underpopulated the original ``Star Wars'' was in 1977, with its tacky sets and ragtag little kids disguised in hoods.
In special effects, Lucas has moved a galaxy beyond.
In energy, not yet.
&UR; STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE: &LR; Science fiction.
Written and directed by George Lucas.
Starring Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd.
(Rated PG.
133 minutes.
Opening Wednesday).
&QL; &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &QL; &LR;
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Now that a few people have actually seen the new ``Star Wars'' movie in special screenings, the hype has yielded to the buzz.
And the buzz is...
well, don't expect a masterpiece, just a really good movie with cool special effects.
In other words, a certain summer blockbuster.
``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' was screened Tuesday night in eight North American cities for movie theater executives, their families, and -- apparently -- a bundle of ``Star Wars'' fans who somehow finagled some of the prized tickets.
Almost immediately, early reviews hit cyberspace, followed by the reactions to the reviews, then the reactions to the reactions, along with all manner of claims, counterclaims, insults and soul-searching over the film, which opens nationwide May 19.
``Guys, it's a movie''! responded Tom Sherak, distribution head of 20th Century Fox, which is releasing the film for George Lucas.
``It isn't the Bible!
It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's escapism.
But it's a movie''.
Uh huh.
In what was titled, ``What I believe to be the FIRST review anywhere on the Internet,'' Ronald Epstein wrote on his Home Theater Forum Web site (www.hometheaterforum.com) that while he was impressed, the movie may not satisfy hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans.
``It looks like 'Star Wars,' it smells like 'Star Wars' and it feels like 'Star Wars'.
However, is it a 'Star Wars' that we are going to walk away satisfied with?
Well ...
perhaps, but not for everyone,'' Epstein wrote.
While the early amateur critics loved the action sequences and most of the effects, including what they found to be an incredible underwater sequence, some reviewers thought the 2-hour-plus movie dragged a bit in places, that it was a little too kid-oriented and that one of the computer-generated characters, Jar Jar Binks, was annoying.
Such views, however, were quickly countered by those who, like Jerry Rhoades on Home Theater Forum, found the movie to be ``PHENOMENAL''!!!!
``Don't watch it to analyze and match other people's reviews and thoughts to the film, just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride,'' he said.
``I did''.
On a leading ``Star Wars'' Web site, www.theforce.net, a writer using the nickname BetterJedi wrote, ``Wow!
What a film.
I'm going to have to see it about 10 or 15 times to take it all in''.
But another writer, going by Job21, wasn't as impressed.
``It was a dream come true at first but quickly turned into a nightmare,'' Job21 said.
That was countered by a fuselage of reaction from fans, many of whom raised doubts about whether Job even saw the movie, pointing out his review noticeably lacked the kinds of details that would suggest he was there.
As for the theater operators themselves, they gave their usual tempered thumbs-up -- they praised the movie just enough to avoid losing any customers but not so much that Lucas could extract higher fees for showing the film.
The bottom line, financially, is the early buzz -- or for that matter the reactions from the professional critics who see ``Phantom'' Friday night -- won't mean a thing initially, said Paul Dergarabedian, of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co.
Inc. ``This movie is critic-proof,'' he said.
``I think it doesn't matter what anybody says, good, bad or indifferent.
The film is going to play big in those first two weeks without question''.
After that ...
the Force only knows .
TOKYO (AP) -- Kabuki-style makeup.
Samurai-style swordplay.
A director who confesses a love for the work of Akira Kurosawa.
The ``Star Wars'' space fantasy series holds a special appeal for the Japanese, who see it as an updated version of classic samurai films.
The first ``Star Wars'' movie was inspired in part by ``The Hidden Fortress,'' a 1958 film about a warrior's journey by Kurosawa, Japan's most renowned director.
Fans in Japan were quick to find elements of Japan's feudal warlord culture in the 1977 movie, citing everything from the design of villainous Darth Vader's costume to the samurai-style swordplay, albeit with lightsabers.
Director George Lucas, in Tokyo on Wednesday to plug the new film, acknowledged his debt to Kurosawa.
``He's just a master that you work toward (hoping) that someday you can reach that level,'' Lucas said.
Even so, audiences here won't get a look at the film until opening day, July 10.
Although ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' opened in the United States and Canada on May 19, it won't be released in many Asian and European nations until mid- to late summer.
For many Japanese fans, that's just too much to ask.
Hiroshi Kobayashi, a 27-year-old graduate student whose business card reads ``Star Wars Evangelist,'' was one of 30 Japanese fans who flew to Los Angeles last month to see the new film.
The lack of Japanese subtitles made the dialogue hard to follow, but he still gave it a thumbs up.
``It had a great visual impact,'' he said.
After its release in the United States, ``The Phantom Menace'' earned more than $205 million in a record 13 days.
Industry experts here are optimistic.
Most expect it to go over well with the Japanese audience.
Toshio Furusawa, 20th Century Fox's marketing director in Japan, said pre-release ticket sales have been strong and that demand for 4,000 passes to a ``Star Wars'' fan event held last month exceeded availability by 30 times.
``The movie looks like it was made for audiences in Japan,'' said Japanese film critic Yuichi Tanuma, who attended a special showing for the media last month in Tokyo.
He said ``The Phantom Menace'' has touches of Japanese influence in the Kabuki-style facial makeup sported by the evil Darth Maul and Zen-like meditation practiced by the heroic Jedi knights.
SEATTLE _ The Force pulsates through the front door.
Turn the knob.
Walk in.
Slowly. Look out!
It's Darth Vader, 7 feet tall, leering in the foyer.
His red and green chest lights flash mean and fast.
Dash to the bedroom.
More trouble.
A blaster-toting Imperial Stormtrooper is crouched in a corner.
Gotta escape!
Where? Think.
The back patio.
Almost there....
A few more steps....
Oh no!
Boba Fett is blocking the way _ and his laser is about to get personal.
Doom looms.
Then, from out of the blue, a voice of salvation: ``How would you like some of my world-famous spaghetti sauce''?
Welcome to the universe _ actually the Kirkland, Wash.
, home _ of Lauren Bock, where a zeal for ``Star Wars'' and homemade Italian cooking makes for out-of-this-world fun.
Bock and his family are among the top collectors of ``Star Wars'' memorabilia in the Pacific Northwest.
He has almost every boxed action figure connected to George Lucas' popular movie trilogy.
All told, more than 4,000 4-inch and 12-inch ``Star Wars'' dolls, including vintage items, populate his home.
Now, with excitement building for next month's premiere of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' it's boom time for Bock and other collectors.
Last week, a video crew from cable TV's Sci-Fi Channel dropped by to tape a show due out in early May.
The topic?
``Star Wars'' uber-fans.
Bock says he has been spending $100-a-day on stuff related to the saga _ from bar soap with a tiny R2D2 inside to his latest find: Star Wars shampoo.
Since the series kicked off in the late 1970s, sales of ``Star Wars'' toys, games, soundtracks and books have topped $4 billion, according to Warman's Today's Collector Magazine, a leading trade publication.
And `Phantom's'' spinoff sales alone could break the $1 billion mark, analysts say.
In recent years, Bock has forked out tens of thousands of dollars for his still-growing stash.
The 57-year-old retired insurance adjuster got his purchasing power after taking a big gamble: He sold off two rental properties and put the profits, along with part of an inheritance, into Microsoft stock in the late '80s.
``My toy money,'' he jokes.
A 5-by-6-foot model of the spaceship Millennium Falcon, its gun turrets pumping red lasers, swoops from his living room ceiling.
A television, 65 inches wide, blares ``The Empire Strikes Back'' (Bock's favorite flick).
The walls of his hallways are blanketed with signed pictures from stars of the space trilogy.
Need to go to the bathroom?
Be forewarned... eyes from hundreds of creatures from a galaxy far, far away will be on you.
But these items are just the trailer before the main attraction.
Bock's best stuff is in an upstairs bedroom and in the basement.
Both rooms are brimming with ``Star Wars'' paraphernalia: Two pinball machines, two stand-alone arcade games and two wood-and-glass cases chock-full of dolls, ceramic cookie jars and Frisbee-size rubber molds used to make ``Star Wars'' commemorative coins.
``It's just so much fun,'' Bock gushes, his arms spread high and wide.
``God, it's great''!
It's the second Wednesday of April, and Bock's home is officially Sarlacc's Pit _ named after Lucas' omnivorous, multi-tentacled creature with sharp teeth.
Pit members have fashioned an appropriate acronym: Seattle ARea Lucasfilm Artifacts Collectors Club.
The monthly gathering brings together more than 40 people who watch ``Star Wars'' videos, dress up in movie costumes and weigh the latest flick gossip.
They also clear up misinformation _ the bane of the serious collector.
But in no way, they insist, do members ``geek out''.
``We are not like Trekkies,'' says one visitor.
This meeting, however, is particularly festive.
Maybe it's because the prequel is about a month away, or because the sun is out or because the Sci-Fi Channel crew is giddy to have the members circle a table and parody a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous.
(``Hi, my name is Bill.
I'm a Star War-holic'').
In any case, light sabers are swinging.

NEW YORK (AP) -- With ``Star Wars'' mania heating up across the nation, retailers are gearing up for what's expected to be one of the biggest rollouts of licensed merchandise in history.
Toys R Us is expected to announce on Wednesday that most of its 1,500 stores will open at 12:01 a.m. on May 3, the first day that merchants are permitted to sell goods based on ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace''.
The Paramus, N.J.-based retailer also plans to dedicate a large area of its stores entirely to the ``Star Wars'' line.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
, the nation's biggest retailer, told The Associated Press that it also plans to offer a vast selection of ``Star Wars'' items beginning on May 3.
``Star Wars''-related goods -- from snack foods to body lotion to skateboards -- will be found in 16 of the 36 different departments in Wal-Mart's stores.
``Wal-Mart is supporting this film with more movie-related merchandise than any other film in our history,'' said Les Copeland, spokesman for Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart.
Analysts expect sales of merchandise tied to the movie could top $2 billion this year alone, with an estimated $1 billion coming from toy sales.
The movie debuts May 19.
Merchants expect anxious ``Star Wars'' fans --both children and avid adult collectors -- to begin lining up well-before midnight on May 3, hoping to be one of the first to get a glimpse of the movie merchandise.
``Star Wars'' director George Lucas signed strict licensing deals with manufacturers that prevented them from releasing virtually all information on their products to the general public, including the media.
Lucas, who financed the $115 million movie himself, also chose the May 3 launch date for the merchandise to hit store shelves.
Given the huge demand for this merchandise, merchants will keep the ``Star Wars'' goods under lock-and-key until they can begin stocking store shelves late on May 2.
NEW YORK (AP) -- The Force is with ``Star Wars'' fans, and it's telling them to hit the toy stores early and spend, spend, spend.
The most-hyped line of movie-themed merchandise in history -- for the still unreleased ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' -- is finally going on sale on a studio-imposed schedule, and fans and retailers aren't wasting a minute.
In an unprecedented move, Toys R Us stores around the country decided to open their doors at 12:01 a.m.
Monday for an all-night selling marathon of toys based on the movie.
Some FAO Schwarz stores planned to open from midnight to 2 a.m.
Wal-Mart and Kmart called in extra staff for their 24-hour stores to handle the post-midnight crowds.
Many stores planned to limit the number of items a customer could buy to prevent immediate sell-outs.
By 6 p.m.
EDT, some fans were already lining up to get first dibs on the new merchandise.
``We've been getting lots of phone calls and there are already people out there,'' said Randy Perkins, a manager at the Wal-Mart store in Rome, N.Y.
``We expect this to be a busy night''.
Even the virtual stores were ready for middle-of-the-night surfers with an itch to buy.
Internet merchants Amazon.com and eToys planned to open their online ``Star Wars'' stores just after midnight.
Fans had been waiting for months to get a glimpse of the vast array of goods -- from action figures to wigs to body lotion to snack food -- tied to the movie, which opens May 19.
But LucasFilm Ltd.
had signed strict licensing deals that prevented manufacturers from releasing virtually any information about their products ahead of time.
As a result, people had been speculating for months, especially on the Internet, about what the toys and other merchandise would be.
``Right now, people are just frothing at the mouth,'' said Omaha resident Dean Phillips, a ``Star Wars'' merchandise collector.
Jeff Van Pelt had already figured out that he'd spend about $150 at Toys R Us on Monday morning.
``I have gone online, gotten a list of things that's expected to come out, so I have an idea of what I'm getting,'' said Van Pelt of Concord, N.H.
Die-hard fans who turned out for a Star Wars convention in Denver on Friday got a sneak-peek at some of the merchandise.
There were eight basic action figures, which are 3 3/4 inches tall, including the Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi as a young man; Anakin Skywalker, the father of Luke Skywalker and the man who later became Darth Vader; Jar Jar Binks, a new space creature; and Queen Amidala, the leader of the ``good'' side.
The action figures retail for $7 to $8, while related computer gear to make them talk costs an additional $20 to $25.
A collection of Queen Amidala fashion dolls also was introduced.
And there was a 3-D diorama that recreates memorable movie scenes.
Analysts estimate that sales of merchandise tied to the movie could top $2 billion this year alone, with an estimated $1 billion coming just from toys.
Many stores kept the ``Star Wars'' merchandise locked up until late Sunday, when they began stocking shelves.
At some stores, managers were not even permitted to see the merchandise until the last minute.
Some stores created a party atmosphere for the late-night crowds.
At a Toys R Us in southeast Oklahoma City, there was a costume contest as well as a tent set up where they could watch the first ``Star Wars'' movies.
In Omaha, the Toys R Us served cakes in the shape of ``Star Wars'' characters.
&LR; LOS ANGELES _ Just when you thought the hype had subsided, ``Star Wars'' fans are flooding the Internet with impassioned pleas to pack the theaters once again.
You'd think George Lucas himself was behind the international movement, but two Internet site creators operating out of Maryland are claiming credit for the idea.
June 19, they have proclaimed, will be Fan Day.
In celebration of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace's'' one-month anniversary, they want devotees to gather their friends, dress as their favorite characters and go see the movie over and over again, just like on opening day of the much-anticipated prequel.
Their plan: Dethrone ``Titanic,'' current king of the box-office gross chart.
It's a lofty goal, considering the movie had only climbed to 11th-highest grosser of all time as of close of business Thursday, reaping a total of $271.3 million by its 23rd day in theaters.
``Forrest Gump'' and ``Lion King'' were still ahead of the ``Phantom''.
But Simon Daoudi, 21, of Tarzana, Calif.
, is paying no mind to the movie pundits who have widely declared ``Phantom'' an attendance dud.
``We're just trying to get people to enjoy the movie and believe in `Star Wars' again _ and try to make it pass `Titanic,''' said Daoudi, the self-anointed man in charge of Los Angeles' Fan Day.
The Pierce College student is occupying much of his time trying to spread the word about Fan Day.
He's circulating Fan Day fliers.
He's making up Fan Day badges that participants can wear around their necks that day.
He's even tried recruiting toy stores and movie theaters to sponsor and host the event.
But talk about a phantom menace.
Many of his efforts have fallen flat.
Toy companies aren't interested in supplying free lightsabers to fans in line.
And a disappointed Daoudi discovered last week that Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood, site of all the craze on opening day, won't even be showing the film anymore by the time Fan Day arrives.
Sandy Baker, vice president of marketing for Mann Theaters, said taking ``Phantom'' off the schedules at Mann's Chinese and its Westwood Village locations after June 17 was decided long before the movie debuted.
``Regardless of what happened, that was just the deal that we made with Fox,'' said Baker.
The film, she said, met Mann's expectations for attendance, with long lines waiting to get in at both theaters during the first week.
But the crowds diminished after that, and on Friday, ``The General's Daughter'' will replace ``Phantom'' on the marquee.
``They go, `It's been there long enough.
We gotta show other movies,' '' Daoudi said.
``I go, in my head, `Stupid mooove'.
'' But he pressed on, redirecting local fans to celebrate at Burbank's AMC 14 theater, which is scheduled to begin showing the film in its new digital format starting Friday.
AMC officials, however, are distancing themselves from Fan Day.
``We've learned that anything, particularly connected to `Star Wars,' is a very sensitive issue,'' said Richard Fay, president of AMC.
Fay said this was the first he'd heard of any individual or group promoting the movie as an event a month after its opening.
And while the intentions are good, even he had doubts that the fan-driven campaign could help ``Phantom'' steal ``Titanic's'' top spot.
``It's an interesting idea, but they've got a long way to go to do that,'' Fay said.
``But anything is possible, especially, as I've learned, when it comes to movies''.

HONG KONG (AP) -- A week after the new Star Wars blockbuster opened in the United States, pirated copies have already hit store shelves in Hong Kong and Macau.
Pirated video CDs of ``Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' are widely available in shopping malls for Hong Kong for $3.20 to $3.80, the South China Morning Post reported Thursday.
In nearby Macau, the pirated VCDs are selling for about $1.50.
The ``Star Wars'' film, which began screening in the United States last Wednesday, is scheduled to be screened in Hong Kong in July.
It became the fastest movie to reach $100 million (five days, versus six for ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park.'').
Despite rampant crack downs by customs officials, pirated CDs, VCDs and software are still widely available in Hong Kong and Macau.
TOKYO (AP) -- Brandishing light sabers, Japanese ``Star Wars'' fans welcomed the opening Saturday of the hit film in the land credited with inspiring the saga.
Hundreds lined up as early as Friday morning at select theaters for a special countdown ceremony for the arrival of ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace''.
Some wore costumes of Darth Vader, Yoda and other ``Star Wars'' characters.
And the crowd broke out into a cheer when the film finally began.
``The special effects are so awesome,'' said Shingo Oyama, a 19-year-old college student, lining up with a friend outside a Tokyo theater.
Like many others, Oyama has seen all three previous ``Star Wars'' films and was dead set on seeing the latest on opening day.
The film's makers have made no secret that the work owes much to Asian influences: the kimono-like costuming, the sword-fighting scenes, the Kabukiesque makeup, and, of course, the epic fable of good vs.
evil. Director George Lucas, who came to Japan in person last month to plug the film, is an avid fan of the late Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa.
Some Asian-Americans have complained about stereotyping.
But the Japanese haven't minded a bit, seeming to see it all as an honor.
For months, TV shows here have featured hype on the film, sometimes showing off ``Star Wars'' products like action figures and T-shirts.
Die-hards, who couldn't wait to see the movie, went all the way to the United States, where it opened May 19.
With such anticipation, the arrival of the film at more than 400 theaters nationwide was a jubilant affair.
At the Miyukiza theater in Tokyo more than 1,000 people packed three showings.
``They were clapping from joy, shaking their light sabers,'' said theater employee Akinari Matsumoto.
But not all gave the film a thumbs-up.
``The visual effects were fantastic, but there wasn't much content to the story,'' said Shinichiro Oka, a 31-year-old computer engineer.
``Still, seeing `Star Wars' is an important thing to do.
It was worthwhile.''
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Summer blockbuster?
Without a doubt.
A sci-fi masterpiece that will please all its fans?
Probably not, but it's got some cool effects.
That's the buzz on the new ``Star Wars'' movie, now that it has been finally seen by a select few.
``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' was screened Tuesday night in eight North American cities for movie theater executives, their families and -- apparently -- a bundle of ``Star Wars'' fans who somehow finagled some tickets.
Almost immediately, early reviews hit cyberspace, followed by the reactions to the reviews, then the reactions to the reactions, along with all manner of counterclaims and insults over the movie, which opens nationwide May 19.
``Guys, it's a movie''! responded Tom Sherak, distribution head of 20th Century Fox, which is releasing the film for George Lucas.
``It isn't the Bible!
It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's escapism.
But it's a movie''.
Uh huh.
In what was titled ``What I believe to be the FIRST review anywhere on the Internet,'' Ronald Epstein wrote on his Home Theater Forum Web site (www.hometheaterforum.com) that while he was impressed, the movie may not satisfy hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans.
``It looks like `Star Wars,' it smells like `Star Wars' and it feels like `Star Wars'.
However, is it a `Star Wars' that we are going to walk away satisfied with?
Well...
perhaps, but not for everyone,'' Epstein wrote.
While the amateur critics loved the action sequences and most of the effects, including what they found to be an incredible underwater sequence, some reviewers thought the two-hour-plus movie dragged a bit in places, that it was a little too kid-oriented and that one of the computer-generated characters, Jar Jar Binks, was annoying.
Such views were quickly countered by those who, like Jerry Rhoades on Home Theater Forum, pronounced movie ``PHENOMENAL''!!!!
``Don't watch it to analyze and match other people's reviews and thoughts to the film, just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride,'' he said.
``I did''.
On a leading ``Star Wars'' Web site, www.theforce.net, a writer using the nickname BetterJedi wrote: ``Wow!
What a film.
I'm going to have to see it about 10 or 15 times to take it all in''.
But another writer, going by Job21, wasn't as impressed.
``It was a dream come true at first but quickly turned into a nightmare,'' Job21 said.
That was countered by a fusillade of reaction from fans, many of whom questioned whether Job had even seen the movie, pointing out his review lacked the details that would suggest he was there.
Financially, the early buzz -- or for that matter the reactions from the professional critics who see ``Phantom'' Friday night -- won't mean a thing initially, said Paul Dergarabedian of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co.
``This movie is critic-proof,'' he said.
``I think it doesn't matter what anybody says, good, bad or indifferent.
The film is going to play big in those first two weeks without question''.
After that ...
only the Force knows .
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The ``Star Wars'' prequel is setting box-office records, but it is not alone.
``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' was North America's top film over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, bringing in $64.8 million for a total gross of $205 million in a record 13 days.
``Independence Day'' set the previous record in 21 days in 1996.
But another kind of star power -- Julia Roberts -- helped ``Notting Hill'' pull in $27.8 million, the biggest opening ever for a romantic comedy.
``The Wedding Singer,'' with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, earned $21.9 million in three days last year.
The comparable three-day figure for ``Notting Hill'' was $22.2 million.
``Star Wars'' locked up the children's audience and the ``thrill ride'' fans, studio executives said, while the love story between Ms.
Roberts as a Hollywood star and Hugh Grant as a quirky British bookstore owner drew an older crowd for second place.
Still, the ``Star Wars'' film is flying.
It already holds records for opening day and five-day totals, and is the fastest to break the $100 million barrier (five days).
``The movie's like a thoroughbred.
We put it on the track every day and it doesn't disappoint you,'' said Tom Sherak, distribution head for 20th Century Fox.
He said families are the key to the repeat business if ``Phantom'' is to thrive in the summer blockbuster season.
Universal's strategy to open its films before and after ``Star Wars'' paid off.
``The Mummy,'' the studio's own thrill ride movie, was in third place last weekend with $12.7 million.
It has grossed $117.1 million in four weeks.
``The marketplace has got to support more than one movie.
There are different tastes,'' said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal.
The only other new film in wide release, ``The Thirteenth Floor,'' opened in fifth place.
The sci-fi film noir had a disappointing $4.3 million, industry estimates showed Monday.
``The Love Letter,'' also billed as a romantic alternative, tanked in its second week, dropping out of the top 10 list with a gross of $1.3 million.
Estimated grosses for Friday through Monday at North American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co.
Inc.: 1.
``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $64.8 million.
2. ``Notting Hill,'' $27.8 million.
3. ``The Mummy,'' $12.7 million.
4. ``Entrapment,'' $6.3 million.
5. ``The Thirteenth Floor,'' $4.3 million.
6. ``The Matrix,'' $3.1 million.
7. ``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' $2.004 million.
8. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $2 million.
9. ``Life,'' $1.4 million.
10. ``Election,'' $1.38 million.
If waiting for the new ``Star Wars'' flick has you feeling like a famished Jabba the Hutt before the big feed, then Scott McWhinnie has a timely snack to sate your appetite.
McWhinnie is ``PEZident'' of Pez Candy, Inc.
, the maker of the popular plastic dispensers featuring toy heads that tilt back and eject pellet-size sweets.
His company, known for its dispensers of Minnie Mouse, Bugs Bunny and other characters, is heading into a galaxy far, far away.
Pez this month began selling four new ``Star Wars'' dispensers in anticipation of the frenzy leading up to the May 19 release of ``Episode I: The Phantom Menace''.
The new dispensers show the heads of Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett and the furry-faced Ewoks.
The company already has other well-known ``Star Wars'' faces in its arsenal _ Darth Vader, C-3PO, Stormtroopers, Yoda and Chewbacca.
More are coming.
McWhinnie said that hooking up with one of the most eagerly anticipated movies of all time was a no-brainer.
``It's the synergy of all those lovers of ``Star Wars'' collectibles, and those people who want new things to add to their Pez collection,'' he said Tuesday from company headquarters in Orange, Conn.
``It's a big thing for us''.
It many ways it is deja vu, Pez-style.
In 1996, PEZ bigwigs trekked to Skywalker Ranch, the Northern California corporate office of ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas, to discuss merging his characters with the candy that gets its name from the German word for peppermint _ pfefferminz.
``They loved us, we loved them,'' McWhinnie explained.
But Pez officials had no idea that in the following year _ 1997 _ the three movies in the ``Star Wars'' series would be restored and returned to the big screen.
So they were pleasantly surprised when their first wave of ``Star Wars'' Pez characters coincided with the re-release, generating sales that were out of this world.
``Our sales shot up 36 percent,'' McWhinnie said, adding the Stars Wars' re-release was ``a large factor'' in those gains.
Fast forward to 1999.
Pez officials hope the release of ``The Phantom Menace'' will create a similar boost, not to mention add new characters _ on top of the 150 characters currently in production _ to the Pez family.
For now, though, those plastic heads are under wraps _ until the ``Phantom'' appears.
``I can't tell you (about those) characters,'' McWhinnie said with a chuckle.
``I was at a private showing.
I had to sign my name to get in.''
BALTIMORE _ In the year he has suffered from osteoarthritis, Harold Katcoff has followed his doctors' advice, to no avail: aspirin, steroids, the latest anti-inflammatory drugs.
The pills, he says, offer little relief from the stabbing pain in the back of his knees.
So Katcoff, an 80-year-old retired pharmacist, is trying Chinese medicine instead.
Or at least, he thinks he is.
Every Tuesday and Thursday since late November, Katcoff has come here, to Kernan Hospital, to see an acupuncturist who pokes him with 20 needles, nine in each leg and two in the belly, and then hooks the probes to a mild electrical current.
The patient is convinced that the therapy works.
``It's fantastic,'' Katcoff says.
But in the same breath, he admits that he cannot be certain if the effect is real or imagined.
That is because Katcoff may be receiving sham acupuncture _ needle sticks in places where, according to the theories of traditional Chinese medicine, they should not do any good.
He is a volunteer in a $2.5 million federally financed study, run by a rheumatology professor and a family-practice doctor at the University of Maryland.
The study represents a new wave in academic medicine: the application of rigorous, Western scientific methods _ including the gold standard of medical research, the placebo, or fake therapy, as a control _ to test alternative therapies, from ginkgo biloba to shark cartilage to a mystical Chinese healing art known as qi gong.
Just five years ago, many academics would not have gone near such studies, for fear they would become laughingstocks.
And while alternative therapies remain hugely controversial in the stodgy world of science _ ``quackupuncture'' is how one vocal critic, Dr.
Victor Herbert of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, summed up the University of Maryland's work _ large, multimillion-dollar clinical trials are getting under way this year at some of the nation's most prestigious university hospitals.
``The scientific games have begun,'' declared Dr.
David Eisenberg, director of the Center for Alternative Medicine Research and Education at Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston.
Or, as Dr.
Barrie Cassileth, chief of integrative medicine at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, said: ``The research is just coming into its maturity.
It's bar mitzvah time''.
The boom is being driven by the National Institutes of Health, which, under pressure from Congress, has sharply increased its budget for studies of alternative medicine.
Eight years ago, much to the chagrin of institute leaders, Congress required the institutes to establish an Office of Alternative Medicine, a tiny operation with a budget to match, just $2 million.
``It was,'' said Dr.
Daniel Moerman, a medical anthropologist at the University of Michigan, ``like setting up an office of deviltry within the Catholic Church''.
But after a rocky beginning, the office is gaining acceptance at the institutes and is setting the tone for scientists around the country.
Last year, Congress upgraded the office, making it the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, which means it now has grant-making authority.
Its yearly budget has grown to $68 million.
In October, a new director came on board, Dr.
Stephen E.
Straus, a virologist and longtime NIH insider whom Dr.
Harold Varmus, the former director of the institutes and once one of the program's biggest detractors, describes as ``a really distinguished scientist''.
At the same time, hospitals and medical schools are bowing to economic reality: alternative medicine is big business.
According to the Nutrition Business Journal, an industry trade publication, Americans spent $27.2 billion in 1998 on providers of alternative health care, including those in chiropractic, traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, naturopathy and massage therapy.
Sales of herbs are also growing, to $4.4 billion last year, from nearly $2.5 billion in 1995, the journal said.
A survey of more than 2,000 adults, conducted by Eisenberg and published in November 1998 in The Journal of the American Medical Association, estimated that 46 percent of the American population had visited a practitioner of alternative health care in 1997, up from 36 percent in 1990.
Patients like Katcoff, who had never before tried alternative therapies, are increasingly doing so.
``Consumers are saying, I want some type of care and I will pay for it out of pocket if I need to,'' said Dr.
Brian Berman, the principal investigator in the Maryland acupuncture study.
``I think that has been heard by the medical establishment''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) But applying Western methods to Eastern traditions may be easier said than done, as Berman well knows.
For one thing, how do you do placebo acupuncture?
Berman and a Chinese colleague, Dr.
Lixing Lao, ran several experiments just to figure out a technique that, they say, can reliably fool patients.
And medical concepts do not easily translate.
The diagnosis ``osteoarthritis of the knee'' does not exist in traditional Chinese medicine.
The closest translation, Lao said, was ``the knee area is energy blocked''.
Cultural clashes aside, the work proceeds.
At Duke University, 330 patients are being enrolled in a study of St.
John's wort, an herb that is thought to relieve mild depression.
One-third of the participants will receive the herb, one-third will receive a placebo and one-third will receive Zoloft, a commonly prescribed drug.
In Houston, the M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center has just begun testing shark cartilage as a treatment for lung cancer; the study, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and approved by the Food and Drug Administration, will involve as many as 700 patients who will receive either shark cartilage or a dummy pill in addition to conventional treatment.
And at the University of Michigan, Dr.
Steven F.
Bolling, a heart transplant surgeon who describes himself as ``the high priest of techno-medicine,'' is surprised to find himself examining whether practitioners of the Chinese art of qi gong can help his cardiac surgery patients recover faster.
One-third of the patients in the clinical trial will be visited by a qi gong master, who performs slow-motion exercises that are said to release a healing energy.
One-third will be visited by an impostor and one-third will not have visits.
``If it's proven, it works and it helps my patients,'' Bolling said, ``so be it''.
The trend is affecting the training of young doctors as well.
Two-thirds of the nation's medical schools now have courses on alternative medicine, many of them to teach doctors how to handle questions from patients.
Harvard Medical School is about to begin a fellowship program to train internists in how to conduct research on alternative therapies.
``We need a small army of clinician researchers who will do this work now,'' said Eisenberg, the co-director, ``and for the next generation''.
The story of how alternative medicine has worked its way into the mainstream of scientific research begins not with scientists, but politicians.
In the late 1980s, Sen.
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, became chairman of the subcommittee that holds the purse strings to NIH.
At about that time, Harkin said, a friend, Rep.
Berkley Bedell, D-Iowa, became ill with Lyme disease and prostate cancer, and resigned from Congress.
``A couple of years after that, Berkley came to see me and he looked like a new man,'' Harkin said.
``He told me about a strange cure he had taken, an alternative approach.
I was just amazed''.
Harkin has since become an aficionado of alternative medicine himself: He takes bee pollen for his allergies, a practice that critics find silly.
But Harkin may have had the last laugh.
In 1991, he inserted a provision into the NIH appropriations bill requiring the institutes to create an Office of Alternative Medicine, with a $2 million budget.
``They fought it and fought it and fought it,'' Harkin said in a recent interview.
``You'd think I was single-handedly destroying NIH by spending $2 million on alternative therapies''.
The amount was indeed a drop in the bucket for the institutes, an agency that now has a $15 billion annual budget.
The tiny office on alternative care was set up in a remote outpost, nowhere near the institutes' main campus in Bethesda, Md.
Its mission was complicated.
Alternative medicine is such a vast conglomeration of practices, ranging from the use of vitamins and herbs, to meditation, massage, movement therapy and acupuncture, that even its practitioners cannot agree on what to call it.
(The terms ``complementary,'' ``integrative'' and ``alternative'' are used interchangeably).
The office began by offering small grants of $30,000 each.
Soon, it was drawing fierce criticism for spending taxpayers' money on projects of dubious scientific merit.
``The quality was incredibly low,'' Varmus said.
``The investigators who were applying didn't really know much about science''.
In 1994, Congress took a step that would have a major effect on patients' access to alternative therapies.
It passed a law that permits manufacturers to make claims about health benefits for herbal medicines whose safety and effectiveness had not been proved by the usual standards applied to prescription drugs.
Now, said Cassileth, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, ``Everybody can play doctor and buy anything they want over the counter and treat themselves''.
Good research became even more necessary, she said.
But the battles at NIH continued.
The alternative medicine office ran through a string of directors.
The man who took the job in 1995, Dr.
Wayne B.
Jonas, drew criticism because he practiced homeopathy, a 200-year-old system of medicine in which illnesses are often treated with diluted solutions of plant extracts.
Most mainstream scientists, including Varmus, take a dim view of homeopathy.
As a result, said Jonas, who left the institutes at the end of 1998, he had a difficult time getting approval of proposals to finance research.
But as Congress continued to appropriate more money for the office and public interest grew, Varmus said, ``I came to feel that there was a real public health concern that NIH had a responsibility to address''.
By 1996, the alternative medicine office had moved onto the main institutes' campus, and Varmus had formed an advisory group of government scientists to set priorities.
The alternative medicine literature contains thousands of studies, but the majority are scientifically flawed.
Varmus wants scientists to test the most promising and most widely used therapies.
But the critics remain.
Herbert, the Mount Sinai professor, calls the institutes' center on alternative medicine ``a worthless waste of money'' that was ``set up to promote fraud''.
Dr. Marcia Angell, editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, said the center had so far failed to publish any significant articles in scientific journals.
``The proof is in the pudding,'' Dr.
Angell said.
``Just show me the papers''.
That may take some time.
It will be three to four years, Straus predicts, before the current crop of clinical trials is complete.
Still, in a recent interview, Straus came armed with two loose-leaf notebooks full of articles that had grown from NIH-financed research, some published in the respected Journal of the American Medical Association.
He acknowledged that the center ``still has to prove itself''.
But, he said, ``I predict it will''.
For the American health care system, the implications of the new research will be vast, medically and economically.
Health maintenance organizations are just beginning to cover some alternative therapies; Oxford Health Plans, for instance, offers coverage for acupuncture.
If therapies being tested prove effective, patients will undoubtedly begin demanding coverage.
The new research could be a boon to manufacturers of herbs.
Several manufacturers of dietary supplements are beginning studies of products like ginkgo and St.
John's wort that could lead to their approval by the Food and Drug Administration, in the same way the agency approves prescription drugs, said Michael McGuffin, president of the American Herbal Products Association, a trade group.
The University of Pittsburgh, meanwhile, is joining Chinese scientists to develop herbal medicines as drugs.
In addition, Dr.
Steven DeKosky, who directs the university's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, has also received a $3 million NIH grant to see if the ginkgo herb can prevent dementia.
Two thousand elderly patients will be enrolled.
If it works, he said, the next step will be to isolate the active ingredients and figure out how they work.
Some researchers, including Eisenberg of Harvard, say alternative therapies will not be truly accepted as mainstream until scientists can prove not just that they work, but how.
But already, medical practice is opening up, said Dr.
Marc C.
Hochberg, the rheumatology professor at the University of Maryland, who is an investigator in the acupuncture study.
This year, acupuncture was mentioned for the first time in the American College of Rheumatology's guidelines for medical management of osteoarthritis of the knee.
``Our work has opened people's eyes,'' he said.
``This used to be in the same ball park as copper bracelets.
I think we have taken acupuncture for osteoarthritis out of that realm''.
Still, Hochberg said, an important question remains: does the acupuncture really work, or is it just the placebo effect?
Hochberg hopes to have an answer by 2002.
As for Katcoff, he is sold.
He said he had been reading up on Chinese medicine, and had learned that even people who did not believe in it could benefit.
``I think I'm getting the real goods,'' he said recently, moments after a treatment.
``I've been going twice a week, and this is my fifth week, and I can honestly say that the pains in the back of my legs are gone.''
NEW YORK (AP) -- Monsanto's highly successful painkiller Celebrex has been linked to 10 deaths and 11 cases of gastrointestinal hemorrhages in its first three months on the market, The Wall Street Journal reported today.
Half of the 10 people who died suffered from gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers, according to ``adverse incident'' reports submitted to the Food and Drug Administration that were obtained by the Journal under the Freedom of Information Act.
Two other deaths were attributed to heart attacks, one to drug interaction and one to kidney disorder.
No cause of death was given for the 10th fatality.
A Monsanto spokeswoman said Tuesday that there is no evidence that Celebrex actually caused the deaths or other health problems in people taking the drug.
More than 2 million consumers have taken Celebrex.
``You can't draw any conclusions from the adverse incident reports,'' said spokeswoman Scarlett Lee Foster.
The Journal did not specify the sources of the adverse event reports, which could come from health professionals, consumers or the drug company itself.
Celebrex, manufactured by St.
Louis-based Monsanto Co.'s G.D.
Searle &AMP; Co.
subsidiary, went on the market in January to treat osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
Celebrex was touted by Monsanto as an effective pain reliever much like ibuprofen, but was much less likely to cause severe stomach problems such as bleeding ulcers.
So far it has been a gigantic success: 2.5 million prescriptions have been filled in its first 13 weeks on the market, compared with the record 2.7 million prescriptions of anti-impotency drug Viagra filled during its first three months.
Robert DeLap, director of an FDA office of drug evaluation, told the Journal that more research needs to be done before coming to a conclusion about Celebrex's safety.
``Do we think there's a signal that the product poses some special risk?
No, not at the moment''.
Searle officials told the Journal they remain excited about Celebrex's performance.
``We really feel the drug is performing as expected.
The safety profile is what we would expect,'' said Steve Geis, the company's vice president for arthritis clinical research.
Geis declined to go into details about any cases of death linked to the drug, but said that many patients taking Celebrex have other illnesses and are taking multiple medications.
CHICAGO (AP) -- Two popular nutritional supplements won't cure arthritis but might improve its symptoms with fewer side effects than traditional treatments, an analysis of 15 studies concludes.
But much of the research on glucosamine and chondroitin compounds is flawed and probably overstates their benefits so more study is needed to determine if they really help achy joints, according to the analysis in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
The supplements are marketed as treatments for osteoarthritis, the degenerative joint disease that afflicts about 21 million people nationwide.
They are sold over the counter in health food stores and became popular after being recommended in a 1997 book, ''The Arthritis Cure''.
''Overall, it seems probable that these compounds do have some efficacy in treating osteoarthritis symptoms and that they are safe,'' the authors wrote.
Dr. Timothy McAlindon, a Boston University rheumatologist and lead author of the analysis, said his conclusions are ''a little more positive'' than the ''profound skepticism which has existed''.
''I'm not actively recommending'' chondroitin and glucosamine, ''but I certainly don't discourage people from trying them provided they're cognizant of the available data,'' McAlindon said.
Both supplements are synthetic versions of body substances that help build cartilage, the tough tissue that lines the joints.
Laboratory studies have suggested they might promote cartilage growth, though whether they do in humans remains to be seen, McAlindon said.
The studies he analyzed compared the supplements with a placebo's effects on pain and mobility rather than measuring any changes in joints.
The authors evaluated six studies on glucosamine and nine on chondroitin published between 1966 and 1999.
All involved patients with arthritis in the hip or knee.
Overall, the studies showed moderate to large benefits from the supplements.
Chondroitin seemed to be the most effective.
But studies showing the biggest benefits were also the most flawed, McAlindon said.
Many failed to detail how the authors hid the identity of substances given to subjects -- a crucial element in placebo-controlled studies.
''We also found evidence of publication bias,'' McAlindon said, referring to selective publication of the most positive results.
Most, if not all, of the studies were sponsored in some way by the supplements' makers.
While some of the most common conventional arthritis treatments -- aspirin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen -- can cause gastrointestinal bleeding or liver damage, none of the studies showed significant side effects.
The analysis is ''an important contribution'' because the authors deciphered hard-to-interpret studies and provide a useful assessment of the latest research, said Dr.
John Klippel, medical director of the Arthritis Foundation.
The analysis was funded by the National Institutes of Health.

DAYTON, Ohio _ Even as new medications are relieving arthritis symptoms without upsetting stomachs, an Arthritis Foundation survey shows that misconceptions by both doctors and patients are holding people back from treatment that might help.
The American Physical Therapy Association hopes to educate at least the patients this weekend when it operates a toll-free hot line.
``There are tips that physical therapists can offer to help people with arthritis to avoid fatigue and flare-ups and to make their homes more arthritis-friendly,'' said APTA president Jan K.
Richardson. Many primary-care physicians are unaware of aggressive treatment strategies that go beyond medications, the Arthritis Foundation found, despite research showing the value of support groups, exercise classes and other complementary therapies.
The foundation's own Arthritis Self-Help Course has been shown to reduce pain by 20 percent and doctor visits by 40 percent.
Arthritis is the No.
1 cause of disability in this country, the foundation claims, costing the economy $65 billion a year and striking 40 million Americans, including 300,000 children.
But the foundation's report card still found considerable belief in the myths that arthritis only affects the elderly and that little can be done to relieve it.
Two out of five Americans with chronic joint symptoms haven't sought a doctor's diagnosis, according to research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
And even among those diagnosed with arthritis, nearly three out of five are not undergoing treatment for it.
One reason is many people's stomachs can't handle the longtime drug of choice for arthritis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen.
But two recently approved drugs called cox-2 inhibitors have shown success in relieving arthritis pain without upsetting the stomach.
Celecoxib, marketed as Celebrex, was the first on the market, with MK-0966 (Vioxx) receiving approval May 21.
Two new injectable drugs, hyaluronan (Hyalgan) and hylan G-F20 (Synvisk), also are effective for osteoarthritis of the knee.
By inhibiting only cox-2 enzymes, the new drugs relieve pain in the joints without leaving the stomach lining vulnerable to ulcers and bleeding, explains the Mayo Clinic's Mayo Health Oasis Web site (www.mayohealth.org).
The nutritional supplement glocusamine sulfate has been associated with reduced pain and increased mobility for arthritis patients, Mayo says, but it also warns that it hasn't been subjected to long-term safety studies and that dietary supplements aren't federally regulated to contain what they say they do.
Little controlled research has been done on chondroitin sulfate, another popular arthritis treatment.
Fraudulent arthritis products are at the top of the list of top health frauds published by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.
``Copper bracelets, Chinese herbal remedies, large doses of vitamins, snake or bee venom just don't work,'' the FDA explains.
``Because the symptoms of arthritis go into remission periodically, individuals who try these unproven remedies may associate the remedy with the remission''.

NEW YORK (AP)-- Merck &AMP; Co.
made a $5.2 billion profit last year on nearly $27 billion in sales.
But the future of the nation's largest drugmaker is uncertain as four of its blockbuster drugs lose patent protection in the next two years, which make them susceptible to competition from cheaper generics.
That's why analysts say Merck desperately needs strong sales from its new pain pill Vioxx, which was approved Friday by the Food and Drug Administration and is expected to reach pharmacies in mid-June.
Vioxx, though, will have to compete with another new painkiller, Celebrex, which has been the hottest selling drug of the year.
Doctors have written 4.4 million prescriptions for Celebrex, jointly marketed by Monsanto and Pfizer, since it was launched in early January.
Celebrex this spring became the second fastest selling new drug ever, after the anti-impotence pill Viagra.
Vioxx and Celebrex are in a new class of drugs known as COX-2 inhibitors.
They offer the same pain relief as traditional arthritis drugs but cause fewer side effects, especially ulcers and intestinal bleeding.
Although Merck and Monsanto have touted tests showing fewer side effects on their drugs, the FDA has ordered both to place standard warnings about the potential for stomach problems on their labels.
Merck won a slight marketing edge Friday as the FDA approved Vioxx for menstrual pain, acute pain in adults and osteoarthritis.
Celebrex is also approved for osteoarthritis, which is the wear and tear of joints usually linked with aging, as well as for rheumatoid arthritis, in which the body's immune system backfires to cause pain and inflammation.
Once the FDA approves a drug for one disease, doctors can prescribe it for other ailments.
As a result, analysts say it is likely doctors will use Vioxx and Celebrex interchangeably.
The battle between the drugs will take place in physician offices as thousands of pharmaceutical sales representatives prod doctors to give out free samples.
Heavy consumer advertising should also start later this year.
Both drugs also will battle to gain acceptance from managed care companies, which increasingly restrict pharmaceutical coverage.
Celebrex is covered by about half of all health maintenance organizations.
Analysts expect both drugs to each eventually surpass $2 billion in annual sales by 2002.
For Merck, $2 billion will merely replace sales lost from the hypertension drug Vasotec and ulcer drug Pepsid, both of which lose U.S. patent protection next year.
Merck's cholesterol drug Mevacor and hypertension drug Prinivil lose patent protection in 2001.
Another factor putting pressure on Merck is that sales growth has slowed for its top-selling drug, the cholesterol pill Zocor.
Merck officials play down their reliance on Vioxx.
``We have a lot of products,'' said Wendy Dixon, Merck's vice president of marketing.
``Vioxx is clearly important to us, but we are by no means dependent on the success of Vioxx''.
Many analysts see it differently.
Merck is ``extremely dependent'' on Vioxx's success, said Neil Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners.
Merck hopes to persuade doctors to prescribe Vioxx, by showing results of a yearlong study compared to just three months of data for Celebrex.
Additionally, Merck's label will highlight that just 4 out of 3,300 patients studied on Vioxx suffered serious gastrointestinal problems.
``We think Merck will be able to do some damage with those numbers,'' said Alex Zisson, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
The safety of the drugs will only become clear in the months ahead as the drugs are used by hundreds of thousands of patients compared to the few thousand patients which took part in the drugs' testing.
Merck officials also hope to convince doctors and patients that Vioxx is a true once a day pill.
They note that a significant number of Celebrex users must take the pill twice a day.
Monsanto said most osteoarthritis patients take Celebrex once a day.
The average wholesale price for Vioxx and Celebrex is $2.02 for the standard dosage.
Both drugs are expected to take market share away from cheaper arthritis medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, and ibuprofen.
Pain sufferers may be getting some new drug options that appear to bring relief with fewer side effects than most other treatments.
One drug, called gabapentin, is already on the market as a treatment for epileptic seizures.
Two new studies, appearing Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, show the drug is an effective painkiller in hard-to-treat cases of nerve damage from diabetes or shingles.
Separately, a panel of experts advising the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration endorsed the first in a potential new line of pain relievers, known as Cox 2 inhibitor drugs.
The new medications are designed to reduce inflammatory pain from arthritis, without the stomach distress and other gastrointestinal side effects of widely used painkillers.
The Cox 2 inhibitors are being widely touted as potential blockbusters, likely to generate at least $1 billion a year in sales during their first year on the market.
Estimates for worldwide sales of all analgesics run as high as $12 billion a year.
But many experts doubt the new drugs will live up to their early billing as ``superaspirins''.
The evidence does suggest they cause fewer side effects than ibuprofen and aspirin, even with daily use for many years.
But the Cox 2 inhibitors don't seem to control pain much better than current treatments.
The FDA-sponsored advisory panel voted to recommend approval of Celebrex, G.D.
Searle &AMP; Co.'s Cox 2 inhibitor, for both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
The vote paves the way for full FDA approval sometime next year.
Meanwhile, Merck &AMP; Co.
has its own Cox 2 inhibitor awaiting approval, and other drugmakers are said to be close behind.
Patients with pain from nerve damage will not need to wait to try gabapentin _ it's now sold as an anti-convulsant under the brand name Neurontin by Parke-Davis, a unit of Warner-Lambert Co.
Because the drug is already on the market, doctors are free to start prescribing it immediately for pain patients.
Many already have been using it as a pain remedy, in fact, although they have had little besides rumor and first-hand experience to suggest that it works.
The new studies were carried out by independent teams of clinical researchers across the country, including doctors at the University of California at San Francisco.
Results showed that the drug works at least as well and probably better than other treatments for neuropathic pain, but with far fewer side effects.
Although the tests were conducted only in diabetes and post-herpetic neuralgia, or shingles, experts said it might also help alleviate nerve pain suffered by people with cancer and AIDS.
``It's a very important advance in pain management,'' said Dr.
Edgar Ross, director of the pain management center at Brigham and Women's Medical Center in Boston, who participated in one of the two studies.
``This is the first time we have a drug reasonably well-tolerated by most people and effective for a problem that has been resistant to most treatments''.
A Warner-Lambert spokeswoman said the company is evaluating the new evidence, and may seek FDA permission to start promoting Neurontin as a pain remedy.
But no decision has been made, she said.
Veterinarians have prescribed it for years for high-priced polo ponies and creaky old dogs.
More recently, it's been hyped as a ``cure'' for human arthritis.
But a dietary supplement called glucosamine had been dismissed as quackery by many mainstream doctors.
Until now.
Earlier this month a respectable long-term European study on glucosamine won a prominent place on the program of the American College of Rheumatology meetings in Boston.
And on September 30, the National Institutes of Health announced it will launch a $6.6 million study of glucosamine and a similar supplement called chondroitin, one of the most expensive clinical trials ever conducted of any ``alternative'' therapy.
But glucosamine and chondroitin are not the only hot new areas in arthritis.
Researchers are paying respectful attention to acupuncture, tai chi, stinging nettle (it may cut down on the need for conventional painkillers), and other complementary therapies.
They're also excited about new science-based approaches such as cox-2 inhibitors (already on the market) and metalloprotease inhibitors (still experimental).
Arthritis researchers say they're finally beginning to understand how to attack the most common form of the disabling disease, called osteoarthritis _ the deterioration of the cartilage that cushions each joint, generally causing symptoms after age 45.
Currently, 23 million Americans suffer from osteoarthritis _ one in every eight adults.
(Another 2.1 million have rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that strikes younger adults, usually women).
As the baby boomers enter the osteoarthritis-prone years, the number of sufferers will swell.
Nothing except heart disease causes more disability, and no disease robs more people of their ability to walk, climb stairs, and even do something as simple as rise from a sitting position.
Fortunately, ``there's a lot of progress in osteoarthritis,'' says rheumatologist David T.
Felson of Boston University School of Medicine.
``The emerging paradigm is that this is a disease that needs to be treated with multiple approaches''.
That includes alternative treatments.
Even before the NIH study is off the drawing boards, leading US arthritis specialists are recommending glucosamine to their patients _ not as a cure, but as something that reduces pain in some people and may (or may not) retard the progress of the disease, depending on whether the European study results can be confirmed.
``Try it for 30 days,'' Boston University rheumatologist David T.
Felson told 62-year-old Maureen Palmer last week at Boston Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where she is participating in a BU study of osteoarthritis.
``I'm putting all my patients on this stuff.
It's completely safe, and it's worth trying''.
Palmer, a fifth-grade schoolteacher with a painful right knee, says her primary care doctor was skeptical of glucosamine when she asked about it.
``Now I think I'll give it a try,'' she said.
Specialists' open-mindedness about alternative therapies is underscored by a new 286-page ``Guide to Alternative Therapies'' published by the Arthritis Foundation, a nonprofit research and service organization.
The guide sorts through the scientific evidence (or lack thereof) on 80 arthritis nostrums and ``healing systems,'' from Ayurveda and qi gong to copper bracelets and Thunder God Vine.
The Arthritis Foundation undertook the project because it was getting 5,000 telephone queries a month about alternative therapies.
``We had no position except `we don't know,' '' says Dr.
William J.
Arnold, who chaired the foundation's task force on alternative medicine.
To be sure, not all arthritis specialists are receptive to alternative therapies.
``To some extent the Arthritis Foundation has given credibility to a lot of things that don't deserve it,'' complains Dr.
Donald M.
Marcus, a Houston rheumatologist.
Despite lingering skepticism among their colleagues, many arthritis specialists see their field as an emerging model for the marriage of scientific and complementary approaches.
On the scientific side, leading researchers paint an expansive picture of the future of osteoarthritis treatment.
``We're going to be able to treat the pain better with safer agents.
In the next decade, if not sooner, we'll be able to give you things that will slow the disease,'' says Dr.
Roland D.
Moskowitz of Case Western Reserve University of Cleveland.
``And we're going to able to resurface joints with biological materials, not only to treat the disease but to repair the damage''.
Some new approaches come from surprising directions.
For instance, there's some evidence that a common antibiotic may slow joint damage or even prevent osteoarthritis.
Dr. Kenneth D.
Brandt of the University of Indiana is overseeing a large federally sponsored trial of doxycycline, a synthetic version of the antibiotic tetracycline, in people with osteoarthritis or at high risk for the disease.
Tetracyclines inhibit enzymes that soften and break down cartilage.
Until recently, researchers thought that osteoarthritis was simply a matter of wear and tear, a grinding down of the slick, elastic cartilage that cushions and lubricates the ends of all bones.
Mechanical forces certainly play a role, especially in initiating the damage.
Earlier injury, whether from athletics or repetitive overuse in the workplace, increases the risk for later arthritis by three- to six-fold.
Maureen Palmer's knee arthritis is the price she's paying for a ski injury nearly 30 years ago.
With each step, weight-bearing joints must bear a force equivalent to up to six times total body weight.
Thus, it makes sense that there's a strong link between osteoarthritis and excess weight.
Overweight individuals have four to five times the risk of osteoarthritis.
But mechanical forces do not totally explain osteoarthritis.
Overweight individuals have a higher risk of arthritis in the hands too, suggesting that obesity exerts a systemic effect.
Inheritance plays a role too, especially in arthritis of the hand.
So do hormones, since women's risk of the disease rises sharply after menopause, when estrogen levels decrease sharply.
Diet also affects osteoarthritis, especially once the process has begun.
Researchers think this may be due in part to the effects on cartilage from oxidation _ a central mechanism of age-related tissue damage.
In a study of participants in the well-known Framingham Heart Study, Felson's group found those with the highest dietary intake of vitamin C, an antioxidant, had one-third the risk of developing knee pain from arthritis compared to individuals with the lowest vitamin C levels.
Vitamin C may also facilitate cartilage repair.
Vitamin E, another antioxidant, apparently has less effect on the progression of arthritis, but its anti-inflammatory effects may explain why some studies suggest vitamin E supplements may ease pain in some patients.
For now, the best advice specialists can offer to osteoarthritis sufferers is to attack the disease with a combination of lifestyle, medical, and dietary interventions _ and ultimately, joint replacement surgery when all else fails.
At the top of the list are weight loss and exercise.
``Even a little weight loss can make a difference,'' says Brandt, the Indiana arthritis specialist.
Framingham data show that a weight loss of 11 pounds in women of medium height reduced the risk of painful knee arthritis by half.
Exercise _ especially gentle and progressive resistance exercise that strengthens leg muscles _ is getting increased attention among arthritis researchers.
This doesn't mean going to a gym and working out like Schwarzenegger; cheap ankle weights or elastic bands, used faithfully at home to do leg-lifting exercises, will do the trick.
``It takes very little physical activity to improve fitness,'' says Brandt.
``Even the very elderly can do it''.
One reason is that stronger leg muscles brace the knee and hip joints, reducing the wobble that comes with age-related loosening of ligaments.
Increased joint stability in turn protects cartilage from the cycle of injury, enzymatic breakdown, and inflammation.
A Tufts University study presented at the Boston rheumatology meeting showed a home exercise regimen improved leg strength by 71 percent and reduced arthritic knee pain by 36 percent.
A larger exercise study from England showed similar improvements in knee pain and physical function.
When painkillers are necessary, doctors often advise the old standby acetaminophen (Tylenol or generic brands) if inflammation is not an issue, although users should be cautious about combining this drug with alcohol to avoid liver damage.
To relieve both pain and inflammation, the standard recommendation has been non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), but chronic use of NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and naproxen can erode the stomach lining and cause potentially dangerous bleeding.
The new cox-2 inhibitors celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofecoxib (Vioxx) appear to avoid this problem entirely while maintaining equal efficacy against osteoarthritis pain and inflammation, according to two studies published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
It's no accident that Celebrex has vaulted into first place among prescription painkillers.
But Celebrex and Vioxx cost from $90 to $120 a month, which can be prohibitive for many people, especially if they have little or no prescription drug coverage.
Eventually, Moskowitz thinks, ``more cox-2 inhibitors will come out and the price will come down''.
Whatever improvements emerge in medical therapy _ conventional or alternative _ many osteoarthritis patients will eventually run out of stop-gap options.
For them, the ultimate treatment is an artificial knee or hip.
``Total knee and hip replacement have totally revolutionized arthritis treatment, in terms of keeping people walking and off crutches,'' Moskowitz says.
``When patients say, `Doc, this is really interfering with my lifestyle and the medicines aren't helping anymore,' it's appropriate to take the risk''.
Thomas Ercoline, 64, is glad he did.
After conventional medicine and acupuncture no longer relieved the excruciating pain caused by his knee arthritis, the Peterborough, N.H. man had joint replacement surgery in July.
``Initially the pain was worse than the arthritis.
The first two weeks after the operation you wonder why you had it done,'' Ercoline said.
``But when I found I could walk up and down stairs again, and walk with a normal gait, it sure was worth it''.

NEW YORK (AP) _ The pharmaceutical industry is announcing big gains in the fight against arthritis this week, with several companies reporting they can now reduce pain and slow progression of the often debilitating illness.
The federal government has approved two new drugs to treat rheumatoid arthritis since September, drugs that aim to help those with moderate-to-severe forms of the disease.
But industry observers say the biggest advances will occur next year with the expected approval of arthritis drugs made by Searle Inc.
and Merck and Co.
These drugs will treat the pain and inflammation associated with arthritis without the stomach problems associated with today's over-the-counter and prescription drugs, the companies say.
These drugs, called Cox-2 inhibitors, are likely to be marketed to people with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis _ or nearly 40 million Americans.
The arthritis drugs, those in testing and those on the market, are being showcased this week at the American College of Rheumatology meeting in San Diego, where each company is trying to show arthritis doctors why its treatment works best.
``This is a tremendous time,'' said Dr.
Brian Butcher, an official with the Arthritis Foundation.
``We have gone from where we could not offer much hope to people to where we can diagnose, provide early treatment and stop the progression of the disease''.
Rheumatoid arthritis afflicts 2.1 million Americans.
It occurs when patients' immune systems go awry and attack their joints, causing inflammation and stiffness as rogue immune cells eat away cartilage.
Osteoarthritis affects more than 37 million Americans, and is usually associated with the aging process.
In the past year, doctors wrote 76.7 million prescriptions for anti-arthritis drugs, according to IMS Health, a research group.
With a number of new drugs coming on the market, analysts expect sales to increase from dlrs 1.9 billion to dlrs 3 billion by 2001.
Among its many players, the pain wars pit Merck, the largest drug company worldwide in terms of sale, against the fastest growing company, Pfizer.
Pfizer will market Celebra, the Cox-2 inhibitor made by Searle, a division of Monsanto.
The federal Food and Drug Administration's advisory committee has scheduled a hearing on Celebra for Dec.
1. Merck hopes to file for FDA approval for its Vioxx drug later this year.
Company officials say they are not concerned about lagging behind Celebra for federal approval.
One reason is because Vioxx is designed as a once-a-day pill, while Celebra will have to be taken several times daily.
Dr. Bennett Shapiro, an executive vice president with Merck, attributed the surge of interest in arthritis to scientific discoveries in 1991 that showed that two different enzymes cause the body to make hormones that bring pain and inflammation and also protect the stomach lining.
As a result, drugs could be developed that stopped the pain, but left the stomach alone.
Immunex Corp.
, which won federal approval last week for its Enbrel arthritis drug, is working with American Home Products Corp.
to market it.
Enbrel is given via injection twice a week and studies show it reduces pain and duration of morning stiffness and improves swollen and tender joints.
Enbrel used the meeting in San Diego to show that the drug is also effective in children.
Centocor Inc.
used the meeting to show its experimental drug Remicade also provides relief from rheumatoid arthritis.
Remicade is already approved to treat Crohn's disease, an intestinal disorder.
The company hopes to win approval to treat arthritis with the drug next year.
Enbrel and Remicade will compete with Arava, the arthritis drug approved by the FDA in September.
Arava, made by Hoechst Marion Roussell, bills itself as the only approved drug that helps stop the progression of rheumatoid arthritis.
This isn't the way medical science is supposed to work.
A remedy used to treat creaky bones in horses and dogs works so well that humans start taking it.
It gets hyped in a best-selling book on arthritis and the number of users skyrockets.
Doctors get glowing testimonials from patients, so they tell other patients to try it.
Finally, with about 5 million Americans taking the concoction of crab shells and cow cartilage, enough begin asking how it works _ and enough doctors wonder whether it really does _ that scientists finally begin studying its safety and effectiveness.
That's what happened with glucosamine and chondroitin, which taken together or separately are now America's top-selling joint supplements.
The early results of research, including one study just published and another due out soon, suggest the treatment actually does ease joint pain and may even forestall further cartilage damage.
The promising research is bound to make the hard-to-pronounce potions, which are available over the counter, even more wildly popular.
``This is a strange, inverted application of the traditional scientific model,'' said Dr.
Timothy McAlindon, an associate professor of medicine at Boston University who has analyzed the evidence on glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, here and abroad.
``The science isn't black or white.
We're building a case trying to figure out if this works or not, and at the moment the evidence is favoring these products''.
Dr. Roland Moskowitz, a professor at Case Western Reserve University who next week will help initiate the biggest study ever of glucosamine and chondroitin for the National Institutes of Health, also is bemused by the treatment's unconventional history.
But he said ``enough people are using it that if it works, we ought to know about it.
And if it doesn't, we should know it doesn't and stop people from spending money on it.
``If it works, we'll have lucked out''.
Luck has little to do with it if you ask the hordes of horsemen and pet owners across America who have been giving their animals the glucosamine-chondroitin pill since the early 1990s and swear that it quickens the animals' gait and eases their agony.
Ditto for millions of people in Europe who for even longer have been using the two compounds, which occur naturally in human cartilage and are synthesized in the treatment capsules.
The Europeans even have scientific studies, more than three dozen of them, saying the medicine works.
American researchers have been slower to show an interest, which is largely a function of the way things work here with herbal therapies, dietary supplements and other nonpharmaceutical products.
Given the medicine's natural derivation, drug companies find it difficult to take out patents on the products, so they have no incentive to sponsor the expensive research to ensure they are effective or safe.
The Food and Drug Administration also steers clear of such remedies.
In the last couple of years, however, American researchers have become curious.
It was partly because of the publication in 1997 of a popular book called ``The Arthritis Cure,'' and the way it triggered an avalanche of interest in glucosamine-chondroitin among America's 20 million sufferers of the degenerative joint disease called osteoarthritis.
Many were frustrated with the side effects of other medicines and were thrilled with results they got with the new treatment.
Doctors were not about to object since their patients were so convinced and the treatment seemed safe, although over time they started pressing for more concrete evidence.
McAlindon, the BU arthritis specialist, set out to see whether all the European studies held up.
His conclusion, outlined in an article earlier this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was that the overseas clinical trials do show that glucosamine and chondroitin reduce pain in osteoarthritis sufferers and are safe.
But nearly all the European trials were supported by manufacturers of the supplements who had the most to gain from positive publicity.
And ``in general they were not that well done,'' McAlindon said last week.
``They seem to exaggerate the treatments' efficacy''.
A series of US studies is trying to weed out those quality problems and come up with definitive answers.
The largest of its kind, published this month in the journal Osteoarthritis and Cartilage, looked at how glucosamine-chondroitin affected pain and movement in 93 patients with arthritic knees.
``The treatment was significantly more effective than a placebo for pain and function,'' said Dr.
Amal Das, a joint replacement surgeon in Hendersonville, N.C., and the lead author.
That finding is consistent with reports from private physicians nationwide and with the results of other, smaller studies, including one published last year involving 34 Navy personnel suffering from knee or lower back pain.
While the effects on back pain were unclear, that study found, the aching in knees clearly was relieved.
The next question everyone is asking is whether the treatment does more than mask the pain.
Does it actually cure the underlying disease of osteoarthritis?
And can it help the thousands of young athletes with cartilage damage?
Logic suggests it might.
Glucosamine in its natural form stimulates cells that make cartilage, while chondroitin sulfate blocks enzymes that break down old cartilage.
The question is whether the same effects are produced by the capsules people take, which generally get glucosamine from crab, lobster, or clam shells and chondroitin from the cartilage in a cow's trachea.
And, even trickier, can the glucosamine and chondroitin in the pill work their way from the stomach to the blood to the aching knee?
Animal tests in Arizona offer hope.
Cartilage was removed from rabbits to mimic an injury of the kind humans get, and they were fed glucosamine, chondroitin, and a combination of the two.
After several months, researchers examined the injured area.
``We found the severity of the arthritis process was less in those given the treatment,'' and the combination of compounds worked best, said Dr.
Robert R.
Karpman, one of the researchers who oversaw the study in Phoenix, which is due to be published next month.
``It seems to slow the arthritic process, but it doesn't repair the joint surface''.
However, the Arizona study raises questions.
For instance: could humans tolerate the megadoses given to rabbits?
Were the beneficial effects a result of stopping further erosion of the cartilage or making new proteins to replace what was gone?
And can glucosamine and chondroitin really find their way around the stomach and liver not just to a knee or other joint, but to the particular joint that is damaged?
The fact that cartilage does not have blood vessels, and gets its only nutrition by seepage through the surrounding membrane, probably makes it easier for substances like glucosamine and chondroitin to work their way there, said Dr.
Lou Lippiello, director of laboratory research at Nutramax Laboratories, one of the leading manufacturers of the treatment and a partial sponsor of the Hendersonville and Phoenix studies.
``Apparently it doesn't affect normal joints,'' he added.
``It seems to have an affinity for joints that are undergoing some kind of trauma or stress''.
Further studies clearly are needed, which is why the NIH next week is scheduled to begin a $10 million project involving 1,500 patients.
It will look at glucosamine, chondroitin and the two together to see whether they help control arthritis pain and whether they actually attack the underlying disease.
What should patients do in the meantime?
Most orthopedic surgeons advise their patients to try it, under a doctor's guidance.
But it is expensive _ $1 or so a day for the eight weeks it takes to begin working, at which point the dosage is lowered and the cost falls to about 60 cents a day.
Insurance generally does not cover the treatment, and physicians caution children and pregnant women not to use it.
Anyone who has diabetes or is taking the blood-thinning drug heparin also should be careful.
And researchers warn that many of the low-cost concoctions being marketed today do not contain quality products.
The roar of the crowd, the crack of the bat _ and that unpleasant little squirt of tobacco juice many batters like to let loose just before they step into the box.
It just wouldn't be baseball without them.
But, hard as it may be for baseball fans to believe, chewing tobacco, or consuming nicotine in any form, may make it harder for people to perform complex tasks involving hand-eye coordination.
Tobacco-chewers proved slower at learning and adjusting to changing visual patterns on a computer screen.
They also exhibited slower, jerkier movements and were less accurate over all than non-users, reports a study in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco this month.
It is intriguing, said Jose Contreras-Vidal, the lead author of the article, that so many tobacco-chewing batters can perform a feat far beyond the ability of most other people, tobacco-using or not.
Batters routinely hit balls streaking in at more than 90 mph on any one of a number of trajectories.
He suggested the explanation may lie in the overall consistency of what batters see when they step into the box, however varied the pitches.
But he also wondered whether refraining from tobacco could still make a difference.
``Maybe they could be even better,'' said Contreras-Vidal, of the University of Maryland.
Subjects were asked to draw the straightest path from a central point on a computer screen to changing targets.
No differences were seen in a first round of tests between tobacco-chewers who had abstained for at least eight hours and non-users.
But after the test was changed, and some participants were allowed to chew tobacco, they were found to perform significantly less accurately.
Their problems continued even when they repeated the first test.
&UR; REMEDIES: Taking Vitamin E, for Better or for Worse &LR; Vitamin E supplements are among the most popular over-the-counter remedies, taken in the belief that they may help with everything from dry skin to the effects of aging.
But not all vitamin E is created equal.
A new study raises questions about how useful the vitamin can be in helping people with crippling arthritis of the knee and also offers evidence that some forms of it may actually worsen osteoarthritis.
In a study presented last week to a meeting in Boston of the American College of Rheumatology, researchers focused on a component of vitamin E called gamma tocopherol, which is increasingly being found in preparations of vitamin E, along with alpha tocopherol, the most common ingredient.
Dr. Joanne Jordan, an arthritis specialist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who presented the findings, said much more study is needed.
But she added, ``Based on the results of our study, we would suggest that you take the alpha tocopherol and stay away from the gamma tocopherol''.
Earlier research had suggested that a higher amount of vitamin E in the diet might help slow the progression of arthritis in the knee.
But that study did not include blacks, Dr.
Jordan said, and it gauged vitamin E intake by asking people what they ate rather than by drawing blood samples.
The new study of 400 people was evenly divided between blacks and whites with arthritis.
Researchers studied X-rays of the subjects' knees and tried to correlate the degree of their disease with the components of vitamin E in the blood.
&UR; AT RISK: Stress of War Might Cause Heart Disease &LR; The war never seems to end for some combat veterans.
A growing body of evidence has indicated that veterans who suffer post-traumatic stress disorder are at risk for a variety of health problems, from infections to digestive disorders.
Now a new study adds weight to the theory that the veterans may be more likely candidates for coronary heart disease.
The research, in a report in the current Annals of Behavioral Medicine, suggests that the stress disorder and other kinds of severe psychological stress may actually cause heart disease.
The research was part of a series of studies done by Joseph Boscarino, a Vietnam veteran and epidemiologist.
Now in private industry, Boscarino did the studies at Catholic Health Initiatives, a health network in Louisville, Ky.
``If this is confirmed, then doctors need to consider this as a risk factor'' for heart disease, Boscarino said.
Researchers based their conclusions on data from a large-scale study done for the National Institutes of Health in 1986 and 1987.
More than 4,000 Vietnam combat veterans were examined to determine the health effects of their experiences an average of 17 years after they had fought.
Although earlier studies using information from those examinations also theorized a higher risk of heart disease for veterans with stress disorders, Boscarino said the new one was more definitive because it looked at electrocardiogram data from the veterans.
Those data showed abnormal results in 28 percent of the veterans with stress disorder, 24 percent of those with depression and 22 percent of those with anxiety.
&UR; NUTRITION: Newest Superfruit: The Pomegranate &LR; Make way for the latest entrant to the pantheon of fruits and vegetables that may fight disease: the pomegranate.
Scientists at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, a major research center in Haifa, have issued two new studies suggesting that components of the fruit could be effective in fighting disease and slowing aging.
The studies found evidence that pomegranates contain high levels of chemicals that may help combat cancer and hardening of the arteries, and slow the aging process at the cellular level.
(One study was reported in the July issue of The Journal of Ethnopharmacology; the other has been accepted for publication next month, according to officials affiliated with the institute).
The researchers chose the pomegranate for study because it has a long history of use as a folk medicine in the Middle East, Iran and India.
They found that flavonoids, antioxidants that are believed to have a beneficial effect, exist in higher concentration in pomegranate wine than in wine made from grapes.
They also found high concentrations in pomegranate oil and juice.
The scientists cautioned, however, that more study needed to be done to prove that there were health benefits, and that people would have to eat the fruit regularly and over a long period of time.
For people who have AIDS, or the infection that causes it, information can be the most important weapon of all.
Now it has become easier to get.
A new Web site offers doctors and patients a wealth of information, regularly updated, about various HIV therapies that are approved or are still in the experimental stages.
The Web site should improve access to what has long been a valuable resource for fighting the disease: the HIV/AIDS Treatment Directory, published since 1985 by the American Foundation for AIDS Research.
The Web site (www.amfar.org/td/) offers users the ability to search a database of clinical studies of experimental therapies, which may be especially useful for patients who are not responding to conventional treatments.
People using the Web site can anonymously enter information about where they live and the specifics of their conditions, like their blood counts.
They will then be told which programs may be the most appropriate.
The site also contains links to published studies.
Unlike the print version of the directory, which was updated twice a year, the Internet one will be changed continually.
But the print directory will still be published and be available free to patients.
The foundation is a nonprofit group that says it has spent more than $161 million to fight AIDS, mostly by helping to finance almost 1,800 research teams. &QL;
NEW YORK (AP) -- Monsanto will be first to sell a revolutionary type of arthritis medication, but its battle with Merck &AMP; Co.
in the high stakes painkiller drug wars is far from over.
Celebrex, made by Monsanto's Searle pharmaceutical unit, on Thursday became the first ``cox-2'' inhibitor to win Food and Drug Administration approval.
The drugs have been touted as possibly the next wonder pills because of their promise to be easier on patients' stomachs than existing medications.
But Monsanto was dealt a blow when the FDA declared there is no proof that Celebrex actually is safer for patients' stomachs than older painkillers.
As a result, when Celebrex hits retail outlets next month it must bear the same warning about side effects as many of its older competitors.
Merck, which is awaiting FDA approval for its Vioxx drug, another cox-2 pill, hopes to get a less stern warning label.
One reason Merck was behind Monsanto in seeking federal approval is because it was waiting for the results of some longer term studies.
The warning label could be a key driver of physician use, and whether either drug reaches the $1 billion in annual sales that some Wall Street analysts had forecast.
Merck also hopes to gain another advantage by getting approval for Vioxx to be taken only once a day for arthritis users.
The recommended dose of Celebrex is once or twice a day for osteoarthritis, and twice a day for rheumatoid arthritis.
``Merck may be able to use Monsanto's experience to get a better label,'' said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners in New York.
After the FDA ruling Thursday, shares of Monsanto rose $1.19 to $47.50.
Pfizer, which will be co-marketing Celebrex, fell $1.12 to $125.
Merck shares dropped $1.31 to $147.50.
Merck spokesman John Bloomfield refused to speculate whether the company has enough research results to get a better warning label than Monsanto.
Merck is working closely with the FDA to demonstrate that Vioxx has safety advantages over existing drugs, he said.
``We are pretty darn happy,'' said Scarlett Lee Foster, a Monsanto spokeswoman.
``I think we got a label we can use...to have the drug widely accepted''.
Monsanto is continuing to study Celebrex in hopes of providing FDA with enough evidence to advertise Celebrex as a safer painkiller.
Millions of people now depend on aspirin, ibuprofen, and a host of other pills called ``non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,'' or NSAIDs for arthritis and other pains.
NSAIDS can cause ulcers, stomach bleeding and other gastrointestinal side effects, and are blamed for causing 107,000 Americans to be hospitalized every year, and for killing 16,500.
Monsanto said it will price Celebrex comparably to other prescription strength painkillers that cost about $2.40 a day.
With the traditional safety warnings on Celebrex, Monsanto would have faced considerable difficulty convincing insurers to pay any more.
Despite the warning label issue, the government approval of Celebrex is a boost for Monsanto, which last summer had to drop plans to merge with American Home Products, maker of Robitussin cough syrup and Advil pain reliever.
The $33.6 billion marriage would have been the biggest merger ever in the pharmaceutical industry.
Monsanto, based in St.
Louis, makes the artificial sweetener Nutrasweet and is also heavily involved in genetic research for agriculture.
``This adds credibility to their pipeline,'' said Sano Shimda, president of BioScience Securities.
And the FDA approval is a boost for Pfizer, who some analysts feared would grow too dependent on its anti-impotence drug Viagra to spur sales growth.
Merck knows that being first to market with a new class of drugs is no guarantee of long-term success.
Merck held the lead in cholesterol lowering drugs with its Zocor drug, but Warner Lambert in the last two years has taken the market lead with its Lipitor pill.
BOSTON (AP) _ Suddenly hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions, of Americans with arthritis are taking a combination of obscure nutritional supplements.
Whatever made these pills the latest cure, it's certainly not the way their names roll off the tongue.
Glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate.
Hard to imagine marketing executives coming up with those tongue-twisters.
It's also not because a lot of arthritis specialists are pushing them on their patients.
Mention health store pills to most doctors, and the response is likely to fall somewhere between a blank look and a condescending smile.
The real reasons, it seems, are a cleverly titled book, a hard-to-treat disease that afflicts 16 million Americans and that most elusive and powerful of marketing forces, a good buzz on the street.
Or the golf course.
Or wherever else men and women of a certain age gather and talk about what's aching them.
Across the country, folks have seized on these over-the-counter pills as a new way to ease throbbing knees and hands, even though the opinion of the medical establishment is, to put it politely, skeptical.
Just how many of these people are truly finding relief is impossible to say, but clearly the experience has made believers of some.
Among them is Ralph Cushman, 49, a real estate lawyer in Anchorage, Alaska.
Cushman is the kind of guy who lives to hike and fish.
Those pleasures gradually grew difficult as old injuries stiffened his knees with arthritis, making walking painful.
On a hunting trip two years ago, he got 500 feet (150 meters) up a mountain and could go no farther.
``It was heartbreaking''.
he recalled.
``Suddenly, I couldn't deer hunt anymore.
All the things I lived for were slipping away''.
His doctor told him nothing could be done.
Take pain pills and live with it.
Cushman limped to a bookstore.
There he found something that, in his mind, changed his life.
``The Arthritis Cure,'' written by Dr.
Jason Theodosakis, lays out a program of exercise, diet and glucosamine and chondroitin.
The book has sold more than 1.4 million copies since it came out last year.
Cushman followed its directions.
``Within days, I realized it was making a tremendous difference,'' he said.
``Suddenly I could out-hike my boys rather than hollering for them to wait.
There was just no question this was working.
I assure you, you cannot make that kind of pain go away with a placebo''.
``Placebo'' is just one of the words that comes up when arthritis doctors get onto this subject.
They correctly point out that a belief something will work is often powerful medicine in itself.
Indeed, when researchers test possible arthritis drugs, about 30 percent feel better even when they are in the comparison group getting sugar pills.
Some doctors suspect this may at least partly explain why people find relief from glucosamine and chondroitin.
``Patients invest time and money in them and they want them to work, so they are more likely to see a positive effect than a negative one,'' said Dr.
Jonathan Kay of the Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass.
Osteoarthritis, by far the most common form of the disease, develops when the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones in the joints begins to break down.
Eventually, bone rubs against bone, causing pain and loss of movement.
Doctors' usual advice is exercise to strengthen the muscles around the joints and weight loss to reduce some of the stress.
Mainstream practitioners also usually recommend anti-inflammatory drugs.
Among these are aspirin, Motrin and other other-the-counter painkillers and a variety of prescription medicines.
But many patients suffer despite these pills, and steady use can have serious side effects, such as stomach ulcers and liver damage.
According to one estimate, anti-inflammatory drugs contribute to more than 7,000 deaths in the United States annually.
Furthermore, the medicines do nothing to slow the progression of arthritis.
Unlike these drugs, glucosamine (pronounced glue-COSE-uh-mean) and chondroitin (conn-DROY-tin) are already present in the body as building material of cartilage.
Proponents theorize that taking extra glucosamine stimulates new cartilage production, while chondroitin slows its destruction.
To hear them tell it, these supplements not only relieve or eliminate the pain, they can also stop and even reverse the disease.
And they do all this with no side effects.
To which many arthritis experts reply: Show us the proof.
Most studies of glucosamine and chondroitin were done several years ago in Europe.
In general, they suggest that the supplements work about as well as over-the-counter painkillers in easing the ache.
In the test tube, they appear to stimulate and preserve cartilage.
However, skeptics note these studies were small, not particularly well done and didn't combine glucosamine and chondroitin, which is the way most people now take them.
Dr. Doyt Conn, medical director of the Arthritis Foundation, said the supplements appear to be safe, and they may indeed do some good for some people, but his organization cannot recommend them until there are better scientific data.
``We have to be responsible to the public and give them what reliable information there is to make a judgment,'' Conn said.
``Right now, I don't think that information is out there''.
Several U.S. studies are under way, sponsored by companies that make the supplements.
The National Institutes of Health is also underwriting one, with results expected in about five years.

Dr. Bobby Wroten, the prestigious Fort Worth hand surgeon who fixed Juan Gonzalez's left thumb last year, was peering at my X-rays.
We can relieve the tingling and numbness, he said, keep your hands from falling asleep and restore some of the strength, but it's not going to get rid of all your pain.
I had arthritis.
That was five years ago, plenty of time to have recovered from successful carpal tunnel surgery on both wrists and to become much more aware of the lingering pain of arthritis.
Thumbs throbbing, fingers stiff, wrists aching, neck and shoulders burning like muscles pushed to the limits of exercise, arthritis can wake you up at night _ sometimes with tender spots that feel as if you must have been sleeping on pea gravel.
Others say arthritis feels like having shards of glass in your joints.
I take a lot of Tylenol and Aleve and have tried cortisone injections and capsaicin cream, the topical analgesic made from red pepper.
I've never hurt badly enough to deliberately submit to bee stings in the hope that the venom might relieve the pain, but some arthritis sufferers are willing to take that risk.
They spend more than $1 billion a year on unproven remedies for the pain and inflammation of more than 100 different types of arthritis, according to the Arthritis Foundation.
``We spend as much on unproven remedies for this disease as we do on research,'' says Dr.
Bernard Rubin, chief of rheumatology at the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth.
Arthritis is prone to unproven, fraudulent and even dangerous treatments because so many people suffer from it _ 40 million Americans today, expected to hit 59.4 million by 2020 _ and because there are no effective drugs that work long term for everybody.
``People grasp at straws.
Sometimes patients feel doctors don't give their arthritis enough attention.
There must be something better out there, so they go looking for it,'' Rubin says.
Something better _ in the form of a whole new class of anti-inflammatory drugs that fight pain and joint destruction without destroying the stomach and kidneys _ made headlines this month.
Cox-2 inhibitors, being developed under the names Celebra and Vioxx, are expected to outsell even Viagra, the impotency pill that became the fastest-selling drug in history.
Cox-2 drugs are not more effective, just safer.
They are easier on the stomach and can be taken in larger doses for a longer time without damage to the stomach or kidneys.
They could be on pharmacy shelves by early 1999.
``It's one of the most exciting developments in the treatment of arthritis in 25 years because we potentially will be able to treat people for their pain and inflammation without them suffering the side effects,'' says Rubin.
Cox-2 drugs are a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as Naproxen and Ibuprofen.
Anti-inflammatories are drugs that reduce both pain and swelling by neutralizing the enzymes that cause them.
Researchers have identified two types of this enzyme: cox-1, which releases chemicals that protect the stomach against peptic ulcers, and cox-2, which releases chemicals that cause inflammation.
The old class of drugs inhibited both enzymes.
The new class of drugs selectively works against cox-2 enzymes _ without inhibiting the cox-1 enzymes that protect the stomach.
It's a development that could be worth billions.
Arthritis sufferers spend millions to pay for unproven alternatives because it gives them a sense of mastery over their pain and because they mistakenly believe that traditional medicine has nothing to offer, says Dr.
Doyt Conn, senior vice president for medical affairs for the Arthritis Foundation.
``The problem is, the public's misconception that tends to lump all forms of arthritis into one package, and to assume that it's an inevitable part of aging and nothing can be done about it _ all misconceptions,'' Conn says.
The term ``arthritis'' includes more than 100 disorders that attack cartilage in the bone joints.
The disease causes pain, swelling and loss of movement when bone rubs against bone after the cartilage has deteriorated.
The best treatment depends on the specific diagnosis.
MORE Among the most common types of arthritis: OSTEOARTHRITIS, or degenerative joint disease.
Affects an estimated 15.8 million Americans, mostly over age 45.
It involves the breakdown of cartilage and bones through wear-and-tear injuries, and is most often found in the fingers and weight-bearing joints including the knees, feet, hips and back.
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.
One of the most serious and disabling types, affecting an estimated 2.1 million Americans.
It involves a genetic abnormality in the body's immune system that causes inflammation in the lining of the joints that can damage cartilage and bone.
It often leads to crippling deformities in the hands, wrists, feet, knees, ankles, shoulders, neck, jaw and elbows.
JUVENILE ARTHRITIS.
A general term for all types of arthritis that occur in children.
An estimated 300,000 children in this country have the disease; most have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
FIBROMYALGIA. Affects approximately 3.7 million Americans, causing pain and tenderness at points where muscles attach to bones.
People with fibromyalgia frequently experience fatigue, disturbed sleep, stiffness and sometimes psychological distress.
GOUT. A painful condition that most often attacks small joints, especially in the big toe.
It is caused by a defect in body chemistry and usually can be controlled with medication and changes in diet.
BURSITIS AND TENDINITIS.
Result from irritation caused by injuring or overusing a joint.
Bursitis affects a small sac that helps muscles move easily.
Tendinitis affects the tendons that attach muscles to bone.
It is critically important to first find out what kind of arthritis you have, according to the experts.
``Usually there are lifestyle measures that are very important,'' Conn says.
``If you have osteoarthritis of the knee and you are 20 pounds overweight, that weight is a big factor.
You need to know what exercising, what conditioning you should be doing''.
The earlier that diagnosis is made, the more hope there is for living well into old age with even the most crippling forms.
For example, only in the past few years have experts recommended very early, aggressive treatment for rheumatoid arthritis with disease-modifying drugs such as methotrexate (first developed for cancer treatment).
The National Institutes of Health reported last month that arthritis is now the leading cause of disability among Americans older than 15, as measured by federal disability payments.
The surge of aging baby boomers and the growing number of children who have the disease put arthritis ahead of heart disease, the leading cause of disability payments in a similar study in 1989.
More than $65 billion a year in Social Security disability payments goes to the 21 million arthritis sufferers who are unable to work because of their disease, according to the Arthritis Foundation.
In comparison, about $50 billion a year in disability payments goes to 17 million heart disease patients.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Vioxx, the highly anticipated new pain pill from Merck &AMP; Co.
Inc. that promises to be easier on the stomach than aspirin, works well in relieving menstrual and post-surgical pain, according to two company studies unveiled today at a medical meeting.
Vioxx is expected to reach pharmacies later this spring after obtaining approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration.
Vioxx was as effective as prescription-strength Aleve, an aspirin-type drug, in treating moderate to severe menstrual pain, according to a Merck study of 127 women being presented at the American Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics in San Antonio, Texas.
The study found pain relief was sustained for at least 12 hours.
In a second study of 151 patients who had oral surgery to remove their wisdom teeth, Vioxx proved as effective at postoperative pain relief as ibuprofen.
The dental study also showed one 50 milligram Vioxx pill could provide relief for a full 24 hours.
Ibuprofen must be taken at least three times a day.
Vioxx will likely become the second in a new class of pain medications which work as well as aspirin and other anti-inflammatory medicines but don't cause stomach irritation that can lead to ulcers and other dangerous ailments.
Merck, the world's largest drug company, will be playing catch-up to Monsanto Co.'s Celebrex drug, which won U.S. approval on Dec.
31. Celebrex, approved for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, has already sold more than 1.1 million prescriptions, making it the biggest new drug of 1999.
It has also has become the second-fastest-selling new drug in history after Pfizer Inc.'s impotence pill Viagra.
Like Celebrex, Merck is looking to get approval for Vioxx to treat osteoarthritis, which affects more than 16 million Americans.
But instead of also seeking indication for rheumatoid arthritis, which affects about 2 million Americans, it wants the FDA to approve Vioxx for acute pain treatment -- a market of more than 40 million Americans.
It's for this reason that Merck is giving the FDA data showing how the drug works against different types of pain.
Though the risk of stomach ailments is higher when taking aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs for prolonged use, a dilemma faced most arthritis sufferers, the gastrointestinal risks exist even with short duration use, experts say.
Neil Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners, said getting the acute pain indication is vital for Merck, though the market for the both Celebrex and Vioxx is bigger with arthritis because patients with that condition take pain relievers more often.
An FDA advisory committee meets April 20 to review Merck's application for Vioxx.
NEW YORK _ Doctors are accustomed to offices crowded with patients, but in the last several weeks, salespeople from Merck and Monsanto have also been vying to get their attention to promote new arthritis drugs.
Monsanto is off to a fast start with Celebrex, its arthritis tablet, which has had the strongest debut ever for a drug.
The company anticipates more than 2.5 million sales calls on doctors this year, the most ever in a drug's first year, says Monsanto.
But Merck is gaining fast with Vioxx in its first couple of months on the market.
And it will soon begin a big advertising push to compete with Monsanto's.
These efforts are destined to make the pills as ubiquitous on the airwaves at least as Tylenol and Excedrin.
Can celebrity endorsers be far behind?
There is plenty riding on this battle.
Analysts expect the market for prescription arthritis drugs to swell from $7.2 billion worldwide this year to $13 billion by 2005.
And for their own reasons, Merck and Monsanto want not just a success but a blockbuster.
The scrap is beginning to get interesting.
Even though Celebrex, which is being co-marketed by Monsanto and Pfizer, controls the market, Vioxx has made steady gains since its introduction in May.
Celebrex and Vioxx are both Cox-2 inhibitors, prescribed as replacements for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and generally regarded as easier on the stomach.
In the week ended June 11, Vioxx had 7 percent of the Cox-2 market, with Celebrex taking the rest, according to the industry consultant IMS Health.
But by July 23, Vioxx accounted for 22 percent of total prescriptions, while Celebrex had fallen to 78 percent.
``It's unlikely that Vioxx will ever catch up with Celebrex,'' said Jack Lamberton, a managing director at HSBC Securities.
``But this market is large enough for both drugs''.
The stakes are unusually large.
In an industry where earnings tend to rise 15 percent or more a quarter, Monsanto and Merck need a blockbuster drug to remain competitive with other pharmaceutical companies.
After its proposed merger with American Home Products fell apart last year, Monsanto announced a $625 million reorganization.
Even though drug makers are generally suffering and the Standard &AMP; Poor's drug index is down 14.7 percent this year, Monsanto has done worse.
Its stock has slid 17.1 percent this year, to close Monday at $39.375, up 12.5 cents.
Merck's situation does not appear as dire _ the company's stock is down only 8.6 percent this year _ but analysts say the company can ill afford a marketing disaster.
Several of Merck's drugs will lose their patent protection in the next few years, leaving the company vulnerable to eroding revenues as generic alternatives become available.
And Merck is no longer Wall Street's darling.
During the last 12 months, shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb have climbed 18.6 percent.
Meanwhile, Merck's shares have gained 10.7 percent.
They closed Monday at $67.375, down 25 cents.
Stock analysts have high expectations for both new arthritis drugs.
After Vioxx was introduced, analysts began ratcheting up their projected sales of it to an expected peak of about $2.3 billion a year sometime around 2004, up from a peak estimate of $1.5 billion just months earlier.
Celebrex's sales, meanwhile, are expected to be about $3 billion by 2004.
``Our marketing success with Vioxx will depend on the awareness of the brand,'' said Wendy Dixon, a Merck vice president.
``With a condition that involves pain, people talk to each other.
A lot of the sales from Vioxx should be generated by word of mouth''.
Willard Reese, a retired engineer from Palm Coast, Fla.
, suffered for years with arthritis pain before finding some relief three weeks ago after his doctor prescribed Vioxx.
``My doctor changed several of my medications,'' Reese said.
``But I have realized a marked improvement.
My right hand is almost normal, when it was about 60 percent functional before''.
Testimonials like his are sure to encourage arthritis sufferers to inquire about Vioxx and Celebrex.
Except in rare cases, the drug that first racks up the largest share of a new market seldom relinquishes it.
Celebrex, whose sales began in January, had the most successful debut by a drug ever in the United States, eclipsing such luminaries as Viagra, Pfizer's impotence pill, and Lipitor, Warner-Lambert's drug for reducing cholesterol, according to IMS Health.
``We're not looking over our shoulder at Vioxx,'' said Joseph Papa, president of U.S. operations for Searle, a division of Monsanto.
``We're outperforming them on every measure''.
Merck, though, has been fast off the starting block.
Known for its Marine-like marketing efficiency, Merck began shipping Vioxx to pharmacies two business days after it received approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
Merck has also distributed the most free samples in its history.
The biggest selling point for Vioxx and Celebrex is that they may be less likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding than other arthritis remedies.
(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) ``Vioxx and Celebrex are safer on the gastrointestinal tract,'' said Dr.
Steven Abramson, the chairman of Rheumatology at the Hospital of Joint Diseases and the chairman of the FDA Advisory Committee that reviewed both drugs.
In comparisons between Vioxx and Celebrex, Merck would like to focus on the two drugs' labels.
Vioxx has an indication for treatment of acute pain; Celebrex does not _ it has been approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
The Merck drug is also single-dose.
Celebrex can be administered in a single or double dose.
Merck executives contend that Vioxx's single dose gives it an advantage over Celebrex since patients usually want to take as few pills as possible.
Monsanto has countered that Celebrex gives patients more options.
``About 90 percent of the people who use Celebrex for osteoarthritis take the 200-milligram pill once a day,'' Papa said.
``If someone wants the flexibility, they can take the 100-milligram pill twice a day''.
Along with doctors and consumers, health-maintenance organizations may hold part of the key to the drugs' acceptance.
Several HMOs have restricted the use of one or both of the drugs.
Kaiser Permanente, which has 8.6 million members nationwide, has limited the use of the drugs to people who are at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
Even though Dr.
David Campen, who chairs Kaiser's drug formulary committee, notes that the plan will cover any drug a doctor prescribes, he does not believe the plan should cover Vioxx and Celebrex.
Campen has recently sent out questionnaires to some 50 doctors, and expects to render a decision in September.
The pills' prices might play a role.
Vioxx is priced comparably with Celebrex, which has an average wholesale price of $2.42 for its once-a-day pill.
But when patients use Celebrex twice a day, the cost swells to $2.86.
Both drugs cost considerably more than traditional generic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which run about $1.70 for a daily dose.
Some natural remedies can ease the pain of arthritis.
Others just ease the money out of your wallet.
Here's what you need to know to be a wise _ and safe _ consumer.
Shark cartilage.
Glucosamine. Chondroitin.
You've undoubtedly heard of them.
They're all touted to help _ if not ``cure'' _ arthritis.
But do they work?
Some do, some don't.
Americans spend an estimated $10 billion a year on unproven _ and ineffective _ arthritis remedies.
This guide will help you choose the right natural remedy to ease your pain _ and at the right price too.
Here is an overview of supplements, what they claim to do, any proof related thereto, suggested use and cost.
&UR; GLUCOSAMINE SULFATE &LR; &QL; Claim: Glucosamine, a natural substance, furnishes the building blocks that our bodies use to make and repair cartilage.
Proof: Some recent well-done research shows that glucosamine soothes knee pain as well as ibuprofen does, but without the side effects.
Suggested Dose: 1,500 milligrams (mg) a day in two or three doses.
Some Prices We Found: GNC: Thirty 600-mg capsules, $7.99.
Nature's Bounty: Thirty 500-mg capsules, $10.89 &UR; CHONDROITIN SULFATE &LR; &QL; Claim: Experts think that chondroitin, which exists naturally in cartilage, may make tissue more flexible and protect it from harmful chemicals.
Proof: Some studies show that chondroitin stops joint degeneration, improves joint function and eases pain.
But evidence is stronger for glucosamine.
Suggested Dose: 1,200 mg a day in two or three doses.
(May increase the effects of blood-thinning drugs and herbs).
Some Prices We Found: Twinlab: Thirty 750-mg capsules, $17.09.
Basic Nutrition: Thirty 400-mg capsules, $9.99.
GNC: Thirty 400-mg capsules, $18.49.
&UR; GLUCOSAMINE AND CHONDROITIN &LR; &QL; Claim: The combined effects of these supplements may help ease osteoarthritis (OA) symptoms.
Proof: A recent study showed that after eight weeks of taking both supplements (Cosamin), men with OA reported less knee pain.
Suggested Dose: 500 mg of glucosamine and 400 mg of chondroitin in three doses.
It may take up to eight weeks to see improvement.
Some Prices We Found: Cosamin DS: 180 capsules, $84.99 to $94.99.
&UR; SAM-e/ or S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE &LR; &QL; Claim: May improve joint mobility and relieve the pain of OA by boosting levels of the amino acid ATP and supporting cartilage production.
Proof: Some studies have shown that SAM-e relieves mild OA pain almost as well as NSAIDs, but without the digestive tract side effects.
Suggested Dose: 200 to 400 mg in three doses.
Some Prices We Found: GNC: Thirty 200-mg tablets, $39.99.
Nature Made: Twenty 200-mg tablets, $21.99.
&UR; FISH OIL &LR; &QL; Claim: The omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil _ eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) _ may ease rheumatoid arthritis (RA) symptoms by providing anti-inflammatory building blocks.
Proof: Many studies have shown that fish oil helps the inflammation and accompanying pain of RA.
It may reduce the need for NSAIDs such as ibuprofen.
Suggested Dose: 3 grams (g) or 3,000 mg a day total of EPA/DHA.
Good food sources are cold-water fish such as sardines, salmon, tuna and mackerel.
Try to eat them two or three times a week.
Some Prices We Found: Nature's Way: Max EPA, 100 capsules (120 mg DHA and 180 mg EPA each), $10.39.
Twinlab: Twin EPA Extra Strength, 60 capsules (240 mg DHA and 600 mg EPA each), $27.95.
&UR; GLA (GAMMA LINOLENIC ACID) &LR; &QL; Claim: The body converts these omega-6 fatty acids into anti-inflammatory compounds.
Proof: Studies show that GLA can reduce the tenderness, morning stiffness and inflammation of RA.
It may reduce the need for NSAIDs such as ibuprofen.
Suggested Dose: 1,800 mg a day.
GLA is available in evening primrose oil (may counteract the effects of anticonvulsant drugs), borage oil and black currant seed oil.
Some Prices We Found: Twinlab: Ultra GLA 300, Thirty 300-mg softgels, $11.89.
&UR; GREEN TEA &LR; &QL; Claim: Polyphenols in green tea have been shown to reduce inflammation, a symptom of RA.
Proof: Mice given green tea extract had much lower rates of arthritis than mice not given the extract.
Human studies are needed, but green tea is safe, so it may be worth a try.
Suggested Dose: 3 to 4 cups a day (equivalent of 600 to 800 mg of polyphenols).
It's also available in decaffeinated and flavored forms and capsules.
If you buy decaffeinated tea, it must be decaffeinated using water and carbon dioxide, a process called effervescence, in order to retain the polyphenols.
If the label doesn't tell you, contact the manufacturer.
Some Prices We Found: GNC: Star GLA Omega-3 Gamma-Linolenic Acid, Sixty 200-mg softgel capsules, $29.99.
Alvita: Green Tea bulk (note: milk may interfere with the polyphenol's action, so drink green tea plain), 4.5 ounces, $3.99.
GNC: Chinese Harvest of Nature Green Tea, 24 bags, $4.99.
Natrol: Sixty 500-mg capsules, $8.29 &UR; TYPE II COLLAGEN &LR; &QL; Claim: Suppresses the autoimmune response that causes the pain, swelling, and stiffness of RA.
Proof: Some studies show that taking type II collagen orally can reduce the pain and inflammation of RA.
Suggested Dose: 500 micrograms (mcg) or less.
NSAIDs may block the absorption of type II collagen; talk to your doctor before using.
Some Prices We Found: Twinlab: Maxilife chicken collagen, 60 pills, $25.95.
&UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: SAVE YOUR MONEY &LR; &QL; The pain and chronic nature of arthritis force some people to try almost anything for relief, even unproven _ or downright harmful _ remedies.
When in doubt, ask your doctor for guidance.
In the meantime, here are a few products that have not been proven to relieve arthritis _ though some have benefits for other conditions: _ Copper bracelets: There's no scientific evidence to back up copper's antiarthritis claims.
_ Shark cartilage: Although advertised to help ease osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, there is no scientifically accepted evidence that shark cartilage works for arthritis.
_ Alfalfa: Used for years as a folk remedy for arthritis, no studies show that it's effective.
_ DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide): A byproduct of wood processing, DMSO is said to ease pain and improve flexibility in people with arthritis.
But many versions on the market aren't suitable for humans.
They're chemically impure and potentially harmful.
_ Maybe MSM?
There is some anecdotal evidence that MSM (methyl sulfonyl methane) may help alleviate arthritis pain.
So far, no published studies have shown that it's effective for treating arthritis.
But if you haven't had success with any of the proven arthritis remedies, it's probably safe to try MSM to see if it helps you.
&UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: SHOP SMART &LR; &QL; With so many arthritis supplements on the market, it's hard to know what to buy and what to avoid.
Our 10-point checklist will help.
1. Make sure that the product label lists the amount of the active ingredient it contains.
2. Choose products from large companies _ they value their reputations.
3. Buy supplements at stores you trust.
4. Avoid products using words such as ``scientific breakthrough'' or ``miracle cure''.
5. Beware of products that claim to cure all types of arthritis.
6. Remember: If a product sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
7. Always talk to your doctor before taking any supplement for arthritis.
8. Continue taking your current medication until you've gotten your doctor's OK to try something new.
9. Bear in mind that ``natural'' doesn't necessarily mean safe.
10. If you already take an arthritis supplement, mention it to your doctor.
&UR; OPTIONAL SIDEBAR: ANTIOXIDANTS FOR ARTHRITIS &LR; &QL; Need another reason to get your five-a-day?
Some studies have shown that the antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables may protect joints _ especially the knee _ from the ravages of osteoarthritis (OA).
Here are a few of the studies' findings: _ People with high intakes of vitamin C and beta-carotene had a reduced risk of knee pain and disease progression.
_ Certain antioxidants (including lutein and lycopene, among others) were associated with lower risk of knee OA.
_ Vitamin E eased arthritis pain better than a placebo or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
To be sure that you're getting enough beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene and vitamin C, eat lots of carrots, sweet potatoes, broccoli, spinach, tomato sauce and tomato juice, oranges, kiwifruit and strawberries.

The ancient technique of acupuncture is now being used for cosmetic surgery.
`` Needles unblock pathways through which the vital energy called Qi flows,'' says acupuncturist Henry Woo, Ph.D., of Newport Beach, Calif.
``Traditional Chinese Medicine treats a wide variety of conditions this way''.
Best known for relieving pain, acupuncture's uses in the West keep expanding.
Inserting needles into pressure points throughout the body to increase well-being goes back more than 2,5000 years.
But using the hair-thin needles to accentuate beauty represents a whole new concept in cosmetics.
``The needles stimulate circulation and tone the muscles underneath the skin,'' says Woo.
``Stimulating energy centers restores the Yin/Yang, or balance of energy in the body''.
``I'm pleased,'' says Sandy Ridout of Huntington Beach, California.
``I can see that the fine lines under my eyes lessened, and my smile lines diminished a lot.
I'm most pleased about that''.
COSMETIC ACUPUNCTURE Practitioners assert that lines around the eyes, and wrinkles that form around the mouth respond quickly to acupuncture treatments.
But inviting as the treatment seems, not many acupuncturists offer it, says Woo, because of the time involved.
In addition to cosmetic therapy, Woo treats a host of disorders with acupuncture, including addictions, weight problems, pain, adult acne, bedwetting and even infertility.
``It opens the channels through which energy flows, and rejuvenates the body's cells.
The improvement shows in the face by relaxing and strengthening the muscles below the skin, which helps eliminate wrinkles''.
Since people often fear needles, Woo uses techniques to ease their anxiety.
``I help patients overcome their fear of needles by first showing them that I use very fine, disposable needles made of steel.
They don't hurt''.
Background music and dim lighting further the relaxed atmosphere.
The number of needles that Woo uses can vary from patient to patient.
Some require as few as nine, and others need 16 or so placed strategically around their face.
``The needles bring more circulation to the area where they are inserted,'' says Woo, ``which brings more rejuvenating oxygen to the cells.
The needles activate the fiber under the skin too, and give it more elasticity''.
NEEDLE PLACEMENT After Woo cleans the patient's face with alcohol, he uses tape to put pressure on the muscles.
Anesthesia cream is applied to the sensitive lip area to avoid discomfort.
Then he inserts the needles at angles of less than 15 degrees, mostly pointing toward the top of the head.
This takes about 15 minutes, and the needles remain in place for about a half hour.
Woo also inserts two needles into the hand to stimulate circulation to the face.
``It's the same pressure point used to stop a toothache or a headache,'' he explains.
Woo cleanses the face again with alcohol after removing the needles, and massages the patient's face for about five minutes.
A Chinese cream restores moisture and nourishes the skin.
Ten treatments usually do the job.
Then, maintenance visits once or twice a month renew the benefits.
EASY TO KEEP UP Much cheaper than a surgical facelift, patients pay about $45 for each acupuncture treatment.
Woo explains that restoring the essential energy, or Qi, (pronounced chee) improves mood and increases a sense of well being.
This shows in the face.
``Sometimes patients experience a momentary stinging or tingling sensation when needles are inserted,'' he says.
``That is then followed by a complete sense of relaxation and ease''.
Breaking up energy stagnation and restoring a balanced flow of Qi through the body represents a radically different approach to achieving beauty than a surgical facelift.
The focus on the whole person and improving energy flow appeals to many.
``From what I understand, surgical facelifts last 10 or 12 years even if you have good skin tone,'' says Sandy Ridout, ``which I do.
Eventually, I'll probably have a facelift like that.
But if I can put it off, that's a good idea, I think.
Acupuncture seems like a better way to get rid of wrinkles right now because it's easy to keep up.
And there's no pain involved, or recuperation time.
I enjoy the procedure''.
ACUPUNCTURE USED WIDELY A consensus statement from the National Institutes of Health states that acupuncture has been used by millions of Americans.
Thousands of physicians, dentists, and other practitioners have used acupuncture for the relief of pain, and many other conditions.
Since the field still remains relatively new to the public, issues such as training, licensure, and insurance coverage need further clarification.
The majority of states offer licensure or registration for acupuncturists, but not all states recognize the same credentialing exam.
A nationally recognized exam has been established, however, for physicians who become acupuncturists.
The Federal Food and Drug Administration recently removed acupuncture needles from the category of ``experimental medical devices,'' and now regulates them just like surgical scalpels and hypodermic syringes.
This ensures good manufacturing practices and high standards of sterility.
The FDA recommends that the needles be used only once.
The NIH consensus statement lists many health problems that acupuncture may help mitigate including addiction, rehabilitation after stoke, headaches, menstrual cramps, myofascial pain, back pain, asthma, osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome and fibromyalgia.
The consensus panel concluded that further research is likely to uncover additional areas where acupuncture interventions will be helpful.
Acupuncture's positive effects seem to radiate in an all encompassing way for some patients.
``I feel like I'm brighter,'' says Sandy Ridout.
``It gives me a better feeling just to know I don't have wrinkles.
``I'm a preventive type person, and my appearance and my mood are important to me.
I needed a perker-upper and this is it''.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- A third new drug for people suffering from the pain of arthritis has been approved by federal regulators.
The Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has approved meloxicam tablets for the treatment of osteoarthritis.
Meloxicam will be marketed under the name Mobic by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals and Abbott Laboratories and is expected to be available in early May.
The wholesale price is expected to be $1.98 per tablet and dosage is once a day.
Mobic is the third new arthritis drug approved in the last two years, joining Celebrex and Vioxx.
Millions of people depend on aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and other pills to relieve pain.
But these can cause ulcers, stomach bleeding and other side effects, especially in long-term users.
In clinical trials Mobic had a low instance of gastrointestinal side effects, the manufacturer said.

&LR; &LR; New insights into the biochemistry of pain are starting to pay off in safer, and perhaps even more effective, treatment options for chronic sufferers.
One new type of painkiller, known as COX-2 inhibitors, just hit pharmacy shelves.
The drugs appear to be no more effective at fighting pain than traditional anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen and aspirin, but offer the advantage of fewer side effects.
That is a major plus for people who must use pain relievers long-term and risk such problems as stomach bleeding and ulcers.
The first of the new drugs, Celebrex, developed by Monsanto's G.D.
Searle &AMP; Co.
pharmaceutical unit and co-marketed by Pfizer Inc.
, was launched commercially last month.
A different drug of the same type, Merck &AMP; Co.'s Vioxx, is awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration and could be on the market by summer.
Industry analysts view the drugs as potential blockbusters, likely to command at least 10 percent of the market for common pain relievers.
COX-2 drugs are designed primarily for those with rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts about 2.1 million people in the United States, and for painful flareups of osteoarthritis, the ``wear-and-tear'' form of the ailment, which affects an estimated 20.7 million people.
Until now, these patients and others in chronic pain have relied mostly on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, sold over-the-counter or at prescription strength under brand names such as Advil, Daypro, Lodine and Naprosyn.
The drugs are generally effective but can be harmful with constant use.
A 1997 study of arthritis patients showed at least 107,000 hospitalizations and 16,500 deaths a year from NSAID-related problems.
COX-2 drugs block production of an enzyme called cyclooxygenase-2, which produces painful inflammation.
Unlike NSAIDs, however, they do not interfere with the closely related COX-1 enzyme, which helps build a protective lining in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract.
Searle began selling Celebrex for $2.42 per 200 milligram pill, less than expected but still more than some HMOs might be willing to pay, especially for patients without a demonstrated problem with NSAIDs.
The COX-2 inhibitors, meanwhile, are not the only new possibilities for fighting pain: -- Ziconotide, awaiting FDA approval, has been touted as a potent alternative to morphine in cases of severe pain.
Derived from sea snail venom, it is designed to block calcium channels in nerve cells of the spine, interrupting the flow of pain signals to the brain.
-- Enbrel, first in a new class of rheumatoid arthritis medicines called biologic response modifiers, soaks up excess ``tumor necrosis factor,'' a chemical secreted by immune cells involved in joint inflammations.
The drug, made by Immunex Corp.
of Seattle, was approved by the FDA last year1998cq &LR; for use in adults.
New studies show that it may also be effective in childhood forms of arthritis.
-- Neurontin, known generically as gabapentin, is an established epilepsy drug that has been shown to work against hard-to-treat nerve pain from shingles or diabetes.
-- Tests are underway to establish whether memantine _ used in Germany to treat Parkinson's disease _ can ease the pain of diabetic neuropathy.
The drug blocks NMDA receptors, nerve cell sites that help relay pain signals.
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.
_ The Muhammad Ali who danced around a generation of heavyweight fighters and set the standard against which all boxers are judged leans deeply into the armrests of his chair and rises.
He walks gingerly to a door frame, lingers, leans for a moment into the wall with his right shoulder, and bidding his audience of three to pay attention to the soles of his black high-top sneakers, he levitates.
In the moment, the years fall away, as does the Parkinson's disease that has stolen his grace.
In the moment, Ali is again, the magician.
And the magician has risen.
He has come to suburban Boca Raton on a pilgrimage, he says, to return to the days when he floated above the ring and punished his opponents with a beauty so startling everyone looked.
``I'm going to make a comeback,'' Ali says, his gravelly voice barely above a whisper.
``That's my dream''.
He arrived last Tuesday from Canada to begin treatments with Jerry Jacobson, a retired dentist and oral surgeon who lives in Jupiter.
Inside an office at West Boca Medical Center, Jacobson is surrounded by acolytes.
They are the parents of children with cerebral palsy and brain damage, and they believe in his magic.
They sing his praises.
They believe that the Jacobson resonator will deliver their children.
Ali, too, has come to be saved.
Modern medicine, the establishment's best and brightest, have failed him.
``I've been to 15 different doctors,'' Ali says softly, his expression flat.
``None of them have been able to do anything''.
So The Greatest has sat, for five sessions now, on a cushion in a $15 lawn chair between two black, eight-foot high circles.
He has sat and prayed that the self-described genius with the white hair and white suit is telling the truth, and has figured out a way to rejigger the particles of his body and deliver him.
``They have no cure,'' he says, again his voice barely audible.
``Maybe next year.
In ten years.
Next month''.
His mind has never stopped working, his acuity has not been diminished.
He closes his eyes in mid-conversation as if he is asleep, and reopens them a moment later, wide-eyed, in mock surprise at the faces looking at him.
``I am the most recognized man on earth,'' he says.
``Of all the movies stars, of all the athletes ''...
He turns to a teenage girl sitting nearby.
``If you saw me on the street, would you recognize me''?
He asks.
The girls answer yes.
``Everybody knows who I am,'' he says.
A smile crosses his face.
It is the face of the most recognized man on earth, and it is waiting to be saved.
The legendary boxer is just one of many celebrities Jacobson says he's treated with his signature Jacobson resonance machine, which emits a weak magnetic field.
Jacobson is using the electromagnetic machine to treat everything from a bad knee to neurological disorders like Ali's.
He is still working on proving the machine will help patients overcome osteoarthritis in the knee so the Food &AMP; Drug Administration will give him approval to mass produce the gadgets.
The machines are built at NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.
NASA got involved with the help of U.S.
Senate Majority Leader Tent Lott, R-Miss.
, after Jacobson promised to mass produce the machines in Mississippi if he receives FDA approval.
Researchers must treat at least 135 patients in the study for the FDA.
About 70 of them are patients at two centers at West Boca Medical Center _ the Pioneer Services Medical Center and the National Medical and Research Institute.
The hospital says it has no affiliation with the research.
The companies say they rent space from the hospital.
About 120 people are being treated for illnesses that are not part of the FDA study.
Most of the patients are seen in suburban Boca Raton; the rest are being treated at clinics at West Gables Rehabilitation Hospital in Miami-Dade County and at Coastal Rehabilitation Medical Center in Gulf Port, Miss.
, Jacobson said.
The treatment is free to those in the FDA study.
It costs others about $100 a treatment.
And more research is being done at Cornell University in New York and University of Oklahoma.
In 1995, Jacobson promised 11-year-old Angelie Diya that he could cure her AIDS with his machine.
The young girl had won over many hearts when she told her classmates at Jupiter Farms Elementary School that she had the disease.
Diya has been to the clinic for pain-relief treatments, said Fank Caviano, chief operating officer of Pioneer.
In the case of Parkinson's, Jacobson theorizes that his machine's magnetic waves will awaken Ali's homeotic genes.
He says those are the genes responsible for making all your body parts what they are.
Making a liver, a liver; an eye, an eye; a brain, a brain.
They shut down after their initial work in young children.
Once the homeotic genes are stimulated, Jacobson hopes they will regenerate cells in Ali's brain and produce dopamine, which helps us move.
It is the lack of dopamine that results in Parkinson's.
``It's a tough case,'' Jacobson said.
``He is a monumental figure.
An icon.
We are doing everything in our power to help him''.
Although homeotic genes are described in some medical literature and universities' Web sites, they aren't listed in a widely-used medical dictionary or a term familiar to Dr.
Robert Brodner, a West Palm Beach neurosurgeon.
And Brodner, who has done brain surgery on about 60 people with Parkinson's, said that regeneration within the brain is ``minimal to nonexistent''.
``So personally, I don't know what this fellow is talking about.
I only hope that he does,'' Brodner said Friday.
``I don't quite believe this, but on the other hand it will be interesting to see the affect and see if this is successful.
Any treatment that doesn't have the potential to harm a patient can be considered''.
Without a miracle cure, the prognosis for people with Parkinson's is unknown.
Some can last years without any noticeable affects.
Some live for more than 40 years with the disease.
Others are almost immediately bedridden and incoherent.
These conditions make patients susceptible to other problems like choking, pneumonia and falls _ which can result in death.
One strike against Ali, a four-time heavyweight champ, is the relatively young age when the Parkinson's set in.
Now 56, he was in his early 40s.
Ali is not the only sports star to get Jacobson's treatment.
Professional Bowlers Association Hall of Famer Dave Davies// of Boynton Beach was in constant pain for more than three years after his right kneecap was broken.
His pain disappeared after a partial knee replacement last fall and after treatment at Pioneer.
Pro Golfer Doug Tewell, who works for the Golf Channel, also is amazed by the pain relief he's received.
He thought he was headed for surgery on his right elbow.
But after several treatments with Jacobson in the last month, he is holding off on the operation.
``I had trouble picking up glass with my right arm without severe pain,'' he said.
``I went from severe pain and possible surgery to winning $115,000 in two weeks''.

NEW YORK (AP) _ Drug makers, eyeing Viagra's runaway success with profit envy, expect the drive for arthritis relief will yield the next wonder drug.
Some industry experts believe Celebra, a painkiller that cuts inflammation but avoids the stomach-damaging effects of aspirin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, could outsell the impotency drug by millions of dollars a year.
Drug makers' ceaseless efforts to stock America's medicine chest have long plowed research money into trying to ease such ills as cancer, obesity and chronic pain.
But the road to a cancer cure is littered with promising treatments that fizzled.
And last year's recall of two diet pills left many dieters wary of weight-loss drugs.
Now comes a new class of super painkillers with a singular advantage: They could be on pharmacy shelves within months.
And industry watchers believe millions of Americans will gladly toss their bottles of common painkillers for an alternative that saves their stomachs.
Kathryn Howe already has.
Rheumatoid arthritis left the 51-year-old executive secretary's joints so swollen she couldn't type or take long walks.
Rolling over in bed hurt.
She kept the swelling under control with prescription-strength versions of drugs such as Tylenol and Advil.
But 15 years of them left her with an inflamed stomach and rectal bleeding.
Last year, her doctor asked her to test an unapproved drug called Celebra.
Now she walks, swims, does low-impact aerobics and even lifts weights comfortably with no apparent side effects.
``A person can shake my hand and I'm not in pain,'' the Eastlake, Ohio, resident said.
``I can hold a pencil''.
Some analysts predict Celebra will outsell Viagra, the lucrative Pfizer Inc.
impotency treatment that became the fastest-selling drug in history its first month.
``That's what I would put my finger on as the next blockbuster drug, not only in terms of medicinal value but in terms of cult following,'' said Stephen Tang, a drug industry specialist with A.T.
Kearney, a management consulting firm in New York.
Typical estimates call for annual Viagra sales to reach dlrs 3 billion by 2002.
Celebra sales could eventually top dlrs 4 billion, said Salomon Smith Barney analyst Christina Heuer.
With the global market for prescription painkillers, not including over-the-counter sales, at dlrs 5 billion, Ms.
Heuer predicts Celebra could be ``the most significant new drug introduction of 1999''.
Celebra is expected to be the first out of the blocks from a new class of drugs called cox-2 inhibitors, so named because they block the inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase.
Aspirin and similar anti-inflammatory drugs do that too, but they go too far, also blocking the cox-1 enzyme that protects the stomach lining.
Doctors believe the new class of painkillers may also provide a significant side benefit.
Patients are more likely to get better faster, or improve more profoundly, if they're willing to take their medicine and stay on it.
When Mrs.
Howe was prescribed standard anti-inflammatory drugs that hurt her stomach, she conceded, ``I wasn't a very compliant patient''.
Celebra's manufacturer, Monsanto Corp.'s Searle unit, is expected to ask the Food and Drug Administration for an expedited six-month review by September.
If that happens, the drug could be on the market by early next year in the United States and late 1999 abroad.
Having tested Celebra's effects on rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and dental pain, scientists are now researching signs that Celebra might help prevent colon cancer and Alzheimer's disease, in which cox-2 is believed to play a role.
If it is approved for rheumatoid arthritis, the most severe joint disease, doctors would be free to prescribe it for a number of painful conditions.
Searle will have to move quickly.
Merck and Co.
is about six months behind in developing a rival painkiller named Vioxx.
Glaxo Wellcome PLC, Johnson and Johnson and Roche Laboratories also have cox-2 drugs on the way.
Already Merck and Searle are entangled in a legal battle over patents.
Monsanto, Searle's parent, has agreed to be acquired by American Home Products Corp.
, but the new owner won't be marketing Celebra.
Searle signed up Pfizer for that agreeable task long before the acquisition.
Whoever handles it, Wall Street appears to be betting on Celebra.
``Cox-2, that's potentially the next big blockbuster, and I think Monsanto and Pfizer have the upper hand,'' said Hemant K.
Shah, an independent drug industry analyst in Warren, New Jersey.
``The first product always has the advantage''.
Prozac's dlrs 2.6 billion in worldwide sales, for instance, makes it the best-selling antidepressant years after similar rivals _ Pfizer's Zoloft, Glaxo's Wellbutrin, SmithKline Beecham's Paxil _ came on the market.
In addition to the cox-2 class, Wall Street analysts recognize several candidates as wild-card contenders in the race for the next wonder drug: _ Pfizer's antibiotic Trovan.
Ms. Heuer estimates the drug could bring in dlrs 1.5 billion in 2002, matching 1997 sales of SmithKline's top-selling antibiotic Augmentin.
_ Avandia, an oral diabetes drug by SmithKline.
Analysts say it could become a blockbuster if it lacks the side effects of Warner-Lambert's Rezulin, which was pulled from the market in the United Kingdom after a few patients suffered liver failure.
_Leptin, Amgen Inc.'s weight-loss hormone.
Some patients lost 35 pounds in six months, but doctors remain wary of obesity drugs since last August's recall of the diet pills Redux and fen-phen, a combination of fenfluramine and phentermine.
Knoll Pharmaceuticals' new diet pill, Meridia, drew a lackluster 11,185 prescriptions last month, according to researcher IMS Health.
Leptin is also being tested on diabetes patients.
But even blockbusters will have a hard time topping Viagra, with an unprecedented 1.7 million prescriptions in three months.
``There's never been a drug like this so far in the history of the business,'' said Joseph P.
Riccardo, a drug industry analyst at Bear Stearns and Co.
in New York.
HOUSTON _ Orthopedic surgeon Bruce Moseley, a clinical associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine, was skeptical about a commonplace operation performed on the painful knees of older patients.
The patients suffered from osteoarthritis, a crippling, irreversible condition in which the cartilage covering the bones has worn away with age.
It is the major cause of mobility loss among the elderly.
Arthroscopic surgery, in which doctors work through tiny incisions using a ``scope'' to see, is effective in repairing torn cartilage from injuries.
It cannot replace the missing cartilage in arthritic patients; doctors can only wash out the joint and scrape, or debride, the rough spots.
Yet nearly everyone said their arthritic knee pain decreased after surgery.
The question was, why?
In an unusual, groundbreaking study, Moseley and other Houston researchers are comparing actual surgery to phony, or placebo, surgery to see whether the operation really helps _ or if people simply believe it relieves their pain.
``Are they better because of the procedure or the placebo effect''? said Dr.
Nelda Wray, an internist who runs a research unit financed by Baylor College of Medicine and Veterans Affairs.
``(Moseley's) argument was, `we don't know why they hurt in the first place, and whether this works'''.
The placebo effect is a well-documented phenomenon in which people experience an improvement in their condition in response to a phony therapy, such as a sugar pill.
Scientists have recently begun looking at placebos in the context of surgery.
Initially, Moseley, who is best known as the team physician for the National Basketball Association's Houston Rockets, was interested in comparing the benefits of rinsing and scraping the knee joint vs.
rinsing alone.
He suspected that washing away debris was what actually gave people relief.
When Wray suggested that they also take a look at the placebo effect, Moseley was taken aback.
``We said, `What do you mean placebo?
This is surgery'''!
Moseley said.
``The more we learned about it, the more we realized surgery may have the strongest placebo effect of any intervention''.
A pilot study of 10 patients yielded intriguing results.
Five of the patients received placebo surgery, just three shallow nicks on their skin so their knees would look like the other patients'.
Two years after sham surgery, patients reported the same amount of relief from pain and swelling as those who had the real operation.
Four of the five placebo patients said the surgery was so worthwhile that they would recommend it to a friend.
One patient even requested the operation be repeated on the other knee.
``We know from the (medical) literature on the placebo effect that it is a significant effect, and the amount of the effect is greater with the magnitude of the placebo,'' Wray said.
``If the pill is bigger, you'll measure a bigger effect''.
Wray suspects that people get better just from an encounter with a surgeon.
The white lab coat, the dramatic setting, the declaration of ``I'm going to make you better'' have a powerful effect.
In the current study, the doctors are comparing 180 patients at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center divided into three groups.
The experiment gives patients a shot at a $2,000 to $5,000 procedure that the VA does not usually offer for arthritis because of its questionable benefit.
Sixty are getting their knee joints scraped and rinsed, 60 are getting the rinse only, and 60 are getting no surgery at all.
All of the patients are given a mild sedative and all awake 30 minutes later, but only the ones getting a surgical procedure receive full anesthesia.
Patients will be tracked for two years.
Initially, the doctors met resistance from hospital administrators when they proposed the study.
To answer concerns about informed consent, participants were required to state, in their own handwriting, that they understood there was a one-third chance they would get placebo surgery.
A more difficult question was how doctors could justify giving placebo patients a sedative, even if the risk of adverse reaction was tiny.
The answer came simply by looking at the question from another angle.
``The bigger issue to our mind is the 400,000 people a year getting the surgery without even knowing if it works,'' said Baruch Brody, director of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Baylor, who helped design the study.
Brody reasoned that the risks posed by an unproven surgical procedure were far greater than those from a sedative.
The study will be finished next year, with results scheduled to be published in October 2000.
If researchers find out the surgery is clearly beneficial, ``we should probably be doing it more than we're doing now,'' Moseley said.
But if sham surgery works as well as or better than real surgery, will doctors recommend that everyone get the placebo operation?
``That's not what we're going to propose,'' Moseley said.
``We'll have to say that as expensive as arthroscopy surgery (for arthritis) is, we probably can redirect those resources in a better way for treatment of arthritis''.
Marvin Gilbert, a VA patient who lives near Cleveland, Texas, signed up for the current study two years ago.
The 67-year-old water-well drill contractor recently completed his follow-up visits and learned he had actual surgery _ and he's convinced it worked.
A hand grenade in the Korean War paralyzed his left knee, and osteoarthritis in his right knee worsened over the years until he could only walk a few steps.
A few days after surgery, Gilbert was walking.
Soon, he could jump and run _ and he didn't care whether it was because of sham surgery or the real thing.
``It didn't matter.
It stopped the pain,'' he said.
``I didn't wonder what it was''.

LOS ANGELES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Two universities in the United States said Thursday that they have received a five-year grant to establish a center for the joint study of mind-body interactions and health.
The focus of the center is to understand how the mind influences the development of and recovery from diverse diseases, including infectious diseases, osteoarthritis, early cardiovascular disease and breast cancer, said the University of Pittsburgh and Camegie Mellon University in a statement.
The grant of 10 million U.S. dollars the two universities in Pittsburgh have received was from the National Institute of Health (NIH), which funded four other centers for this initiative.
Prior to the establishment of the new center, researchers at both universities have undertaken individual studies of mind-body interactions and health.
They found that women with increased anger or hostility have a greater risk for coronary artery disease, and people who have a larger support network of friends and relatives get sick less often than those who lead solitary lives.
One study shows that osteoarthritis has the potential to compromise the health of family members as a result of the patient's negative responses to symptoms and the burden of providing emotional support and task assistance to the patient.
At the new center, researchers will study the risk for respiratory illnesses such as the flu which may be affected by the health of an individual's material and non-material relationships.
Focusing on older adults with osteoarthritis, researchers will determine if the patients and their spousal caregivers experience greater health benefits from an educational intervention targeted at both rather than just at the patient.
Doctors will also examine women's perception of stress, their attitude and coping responses as well as physiological reactions to the stress in their lives as potential markers of risk for cardiovascular disease.
Finally researchers hope to learn whether psychosocial interventions can be designed to enhance adjustment and lower recurrence and mortality among women with early breast cancer and to find out the psychological, behavioral and biological mechanisms through which the interventions operate.
IN the treatment of rheumatic disorders the mainstay drugs are initially for pain relief.
This is followed by drugs that stop the underlying disease process and reduce inflammation.
Pain is the main symptom of most rheumatic disorders and pain-relieving medicines are used to control them.
They include paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and locally applied linaments and ointments.
In the last five years, a better understanding of various rheumatic disorders has been created through immunology studies.
That has resulted in various drugs normally used in transplant treatment being applied in rheumatic disorders, for example, cyclosporin.
In the last two years, Cox-2 selective NSAIDs (meloxicam) have been introduced around the world for pain relief in rheumatic disorders.
They are said to be safer than existing NSAIDs in causing less gastrointestinal complications.
Up to now, all existing NSAIDs are known to cause gastric irritation.
A certain herbal product has been tried in rheumatic disorders in Denmark.
It is based on the patented ginger extract HMP-33 which is extracted from a special variety of ginger found only in one particular region in China.
Developed over six years by a Danish team led by biochemist Dr Morten Weidner, it comes in a soft gelatin capsule.
It was recently introduced here and is available over the counter.
Apparently, one capsule has properties equivalent to 6,600mg of dried ginger.
The largest and most recent trial to test the efficacy and safety of HMP-33 was conducted two years ago by a team of doctors from Copenhagen Municipal Hospital, headed by chief rheumatologist Dr Henning Bliddal and principal clinical investigator Dr Allan Rosetzsky.
Dr Bliddal and his team had carried out a random double-blind placebo-controlled study on 56 hospital patients suffering from osteoarthritis.
The findings revealed that the product can provide relief from bodily aches and seemingly without causing negative side effects.
Similar clinical studies are currently being carried out in Australia and the United States.
Generally, says a local doctor who requested anonymity, herbal products are not as well tested in clinical trials as medications which have to be registered for use in hospital pharmacies.
He adds trials with ginger extracts in rheumatic disorders have not been actively carried out in Malaysia and local doctors are awaiting confirmatory tests before recommending such products to patients.
Besides drugs to relieve pain, medication to stop the underlying disease process and reduce inflammation is also prescribed for rheumatic patients.
Some patients may need disease modifying drugs to prevent fibrosis of the tissues and joints and possibly internal organ damage.
Examples of such drugs include sulphasalazine, chloroquine, penicillamine, gold and methotrexate.
Steroids in the correct amount and for the proper duration of treatment are given to patients to reduce inflammation which may damage the body.
However, these are also the most commonly abused drugs because they are mixed illegally into herbal remedies.
Rheumatic disorders cover all medical diseases of the motoric system - bones, joints, muscles and tendons - as well as those related to the connective tissue.
The different diseases vary from acute backstrain and tennis elbow to osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
That means the treatment of each rheumatic disorder is individualised and aimed at the cause and source of the pain as well as underlying inflammation.
Based on Government hospital attendance records one in four Malaysians above 40 visits outpatient clinics for a rheumatic complaint.
This is probably the same in private clinics.
GENEVA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Insurance companies warned here on Tuesday of enormous economic costs if global actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions come too slowly.
The warning was made by about 60 insurance companies in a position paper they presented Tuesday to an international negotiating conference on climate change resumed in Geneva on Monday.
The insurers expressed their concern that while the effect of climate change on the frequency or severity of extreme weather events remains unknown, it is clear that even small shifts in regional climate zones or storm patterns could lead to increased property damage.
They also pointed out that climate change could potentially have large implications for investment activities as society anticipates and adapts to new climate regime.
The insurers called on countries to take precautionary actions to reduce the risks of climate change.
According to them, the most efficient precautionary measure is an early and substantial reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions.
They also urged governments to promote scientific research that will establish what threshold level of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases should be considered dangerous.
According to industry sources, the insurance industry is currently under stress from a series of "Billion Dollar" storms since 1987.
This has led to dramatic increases in claims, reduced availability of insurance, and higher premiums.
"When a major industry such as the insurance sector starts to worry, so should we," commented Elizabeth Dowdeswell, Exective Director of the UN Environment Programme.
"While some industries think more about the costs of taking action against climate change, insurers know from experience how expensive it can be when people fail to protect themselves adequately from risks," she added.
How fast to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the focus of the latest negotiating conference, known officially as the second session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
In the treaty, which was adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, industrialized countries agreed to take measures to return their greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
But some environmental reports said almost none of them will meet that target.
While the UN and a number of non-governmental organizations are calling for drastic global action to reduce climate change, major industries in some countries are urging their governments to take a go-slow approach, arguing against steps they say could cost jobs and growth before the problem is better understood.
CANBERRA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists warn that a deteriorating marine ecosystem in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions foreshadows further natural disasters caused by global warming.
Scientists at Macquarie Island near the Antarctic note that elephant seals and penguins were starving off because of feed shortage caused by shifting ocean currents and climate changes in the region, today's Age newspaper reported.
Meteorological records show that the average annual ocean temperature near the island has increased to 5.4 degrees from 4.5 degrees in 1912.
Jeremy Smith, leader of Australian scientific teams on the island, said that the annual temperature on Macquarie Island was rising at twice the rate of the rest of the world.
"Macquarie Island is a barometer, it's a measuring device for large-scale global changes," he said.
"Global change is now a certainty," he said.
Higher ocean surface temperatures caused by the greenhouse effect of the global atmosphere will alter the direction of ocean currents.
As a result, the number of plankton and fish will change as the marine ecosystem is disrupted.
Elephant seals and penguins population are collapsing as their prey stocks are moving away from the Antarctic waters.
Scientists on Macquarie Island found that the number of elephant seals and rock hopper penguins has dropped by half in the past few years.
Similar things have happened on Heard Island, 5,400 km west of Macquarie Island.
Worst still, the rock hopper penguin population on Campbell Island near New Zealand has crashed by 94 percent.
Cindy Hull, a zoologist at the University of Tasmania in Australia, also found the unprecedented fact this week that 16 percent of eggs of rock hopper penguins on Macquarie Island were infertile.
She said that this was an indication that female penguins were not getting enough food during their foraging in the ocean.
If food continued to disappear from the ocean, bigger penguins might also be affected, she said.
She said the decline in rock hoppers might be an indicator of the ecological impact of global warming.
Scientists on Macquarie Island fear that a one-degree change of global temperature would completely change one of the biggest ecosystem in the world.
In 1995, the sunniest December ever recorded on the island halted all major streams on it.
Scientists believe that the slightest hint of change at Macquarie is a clear signal that something significant is happening in the Southern Ocean.
The Southern Ocean stretches like a belt around the globe.
It is wedged between the Antarctic in the south, and the Australian, South American and African continents to the north.
"It saddens me to see, in a pristine environment like this, the deterioration of the natural ecosystem," Smith said.
WELLINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Huge tracts of Earth's surface could disappear under rising oceans, creating millions of" environmental refugees," British climate scientist John Houghton told a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The panel, which was set up by the United Nations in 1988 to investigate the pace of climate change and advise governments on potential risks, is meeting in Auckland, the biggest city of New Zealand, with 120 experts participating.
Houghton said at the panel Tuesday that one estimate suggests up to 150 million people may be made homeless as oceans swell with warmer temperature caused by the greenhouse effect.
A rise in sea levels of up to one meter could happen by next century, affecting areas of Egypt, southern China and Bangladesh, he said, adding that a rise of one meter would wipe out the homes of up to 6 million people in Bangladesh alone.
New Zealand Environment Minister Marian Hobbs gave an opening speech at the meeting, pledging that her country would honor its international greenhouse gas control targets and take steps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions linked to global warming.
She said New Zealand will introduce public education programs on climate change, greater investment in public transport and stronger energy efficiency measures.
At the top of the agenda of the three-day conference, which will end Thursday, is its next report on climate change, due to be presented to the United Nations in 2001, according to the New Zealand Press Association (NZPA).
The report will contain an assessment of the pace of climate change and strategies for governments to deal with it.
Two such reports were already submitted by the panel in 1990 and 1995.
NZPA reported that scientists estimate that greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by about 30 percent since pre-industrial times.
If the present rate of emission continues,the amount of carbon dioxide will be double its pre-industrial level by the end of this century.
Evidence is mounting that emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, agriculture and deforestation are affecting climate, it added.
There are 160 signatories to the U.N.
Climate Convention, an agreement designed to stabilize greenhouse gases at levels that would avoid catastrophic climate change.
WASHINGTON _ Global warming is not making some people in the nation's coldest state happy.
As higher temperatures melt some of the ice in Alaska, natives who live in or near the Arctic Circle said here Wednesday they are worried that their way of life will disappear.
Sterling Golongergen, 43, a community development worker in Savoonga, an island town in the Bering Sea, said at a news conference that as the ice melts, hunting gets more difficult.
``I have two sons who are being taught, hands on, by their father, uncles (and other elders) to hunt walrus, seal, whale, birds and fish,'' she said.
``But this year the ice packs left sooner.
There was very little game for them to hunt, (which) cut short our food supply'' and the time that her sons had to learn ``how to continue this way of life''.
She added: ``We do not really understand the science or the politics of environmental change, but it affects our lives''.
John Kulowiyi, 76, a whaling captain also from Savoonga, said ice around the village is slowly getting thinner year-round.
``We never go out (to hunt) this year by walking on the ice,'' he said.
``It's too dangerous for us''.
So in order to hunt, the men must travel 50 to 80 miles from the village, which makes the trips expensive for them, he said.
Amy ``Kalee'' Kreider, director of the U.S. global warming campaign for Greenpeace, an environmental organization which sponsored the news conference, said, ``In most of the lower 48 states, ice is seen as bad.
That's not the way things are seen in Alaska''.
A new report on global climate change released by Greenpeace said that as the seas warm up and glaciers melt, animals such as walruses seals, and caribous move north to colder temperatures.
These animals are a staple food for villagers in the Bering and Chukchi Seas region near Siberia.
The report said some plants are dying as tundra dries out because permafrost, ground that is frozen all year, is thawing and water is draining off.
Kreider also said the pesky sprucebark beetle has moved further north as temperatures climb.
She said it has already ``devastated a huge swathe of forest in southern Alaska (and)...
as far north as Fairbanks''.
The report cited interviews with natives in eight villages in the Bering and Chukchi Seas.
Kreider said Greenpeace expects Congress to hold hearings in January on the Alaskan climate change and that some of the people quoted in the report will testify.
She urged U.S. approval of the so-called Kyoto Protocol, an accord reached by negotiators around the world last December that would require industrial nations to make significant cuts in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions by 2012.
The Greenpeace report noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,600 climate scientists from around the world, said Arctic sea ice has decreased 2.8 percent each decade since the late 1970s.
The panel also said that upper Arctic ice, which had been 2 meters (6 1/2 feet) to 3 meters (just under 9 feet) thick, now averages about 1.5 meters (under 5 feet) or less .
JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- South African Environment Minister Valli Moosa said on Friday that global warming resulted in the rise in incidence of malaria.
Addressing a meeting in Cape Town of ministers and officials from the countries of Southern African Development Community (SADC), he said that in the past year South Africa had recorded the highest average temperatures.
He said global warming and climate change was not simply a matter which could be left to researchers and experts.
"It is more and more a matter which is impacting on all people".
One of the results of this had been a rise in the incidence of malaria, he said, adding that "this is a matter which is of grave concern to us".
The SADC meeting aims to formulate regional policies on matters such as desertification, climate change and biodiversity.
Countries attending the meeting, hosted by South Africa, include Angola, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
WASHINGTON (AP -- Rising ocean temperatures, perhaps caused by global climate change, are threatening to push salmon out of their Pacific Ocean habitat, two marine biologist said today, citing as early evidence the decline in Alaska salmon.
``Whether the changes are related to global warming is not statistically clear, but it's what appears to be happening,'' said Jim Barry, a marine biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California.
The scientists said at a news conference that warmer ocean waters in the Pacific has caused a much higher mortality rate among salmon.
It also has produced a dramatic shift in plankton species that has interfered in food supplies for marine life and seabirds, they said.
``We don't fully realize what's happening...
but these are the sort of events we expect from global warming,'' said David Welch, head of the salmon research project for the Canadian National Department of Fisheries.
Welch, who is based in British Columbia, said he is convinced that ocean warming reflects broader climate change and raises the possibility of ``large-scale potential changes in the marine ecosystem''.
While scientists agree the oceans have become warmer, the reasons remain in dispute.
Some scientists argue it reflects broader climate change as a result of heat trapping pollution, but others say it simply reflects cyclical temperature changes, including the El Nino phenomenon.
Whatever the reason, higher ocean temperatures already have had dramatic impact on Pacific salmon fisheries, the two biologists said at a news conference sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund and the Marine Conservation Biology Institute.
Welch cited as clear evidence of concern the dramatic decline in Alaska's Pacific salmon population in 1997 and again last year.
Salmon returning to swim up the Fraser River in British Columbia have been fewer in number and much smaller than in years past, he said.
And the in-river mortality rate among salmon returning to spawn soared to 76 percent in 1997, he said.
Welch attributed the smaller fish and high death rate to the warmer ocean waters that, he said, sapped the salmon of their energy and strength.
``We're starting to see a very troubling perspective on this,'' he said.
The biologists said the high sea temperatures in 1997 and 1998 produced a rate bloom of phytoplankton in the northern Pacific waters typical of waters closer to the equator, causing changes in the food chain.
The reduced size of returning salmon and the decrease in overall numbers ``suggests large-scale starvation,'' they said.
Welch said that if the warming continues as part of a broader global climate change, the salmon as a species may be forced northward into the Bering Sea, abandoning their traditional Pacific habitat.
While that may still be 40 or 50 years in the future, ``the early stages are already here,'' he argued.
As for those who argue that the sea temperature rise may only be cyclical, Welch said that the last El Nino was the strongest ever recorded and the frequency of El Nino events has increased, suggesting a broader climate change.
``What we're seeing now is unprecedented,'' agreed Barry .
WASHINGTON _ On the west coast of Canada's Hudson Bay, fewer and fewer polar bears are being born each year.
In the Maldive Islands, coral are bleaching and then dying.
And in the North Pacific, sockeye salmon seem to be losing weight.
These are a few of the signs that scientists say point to an increasingly inescapable conclusion: global warming is threatening marine life worldwide.
In a report scheduled for release Tuesday, the Redmond, Wash-based Marine Conservation Biology Institute and the World Wildlife Fund declare that ``global climate change is an additional stress on already stressed species, and may be the straw that breaks the camel's back for many types of marine life''.
The scientists did not do new research, but pulled together a variety of academic studies conducted in recent years in an effort to show a broad picture of the effects of global warming.
``The news is not good,'' said Elliott Norse, the biologist who heads the Marine Conservation Biology Institute.
``The thing that screams out here is that from the inter-tidal zone to the open ocean, from the Antarctic to the Arctic, we are seeing worrisome things everywhere that seem to be most closely correlated with climate change''.
Norse offered a variety of recent examples of the impacts of global warming, from the encroachment of subalpine firs into the alpine meadows on Mount Rainier, to the marlin caught off Longview, Wash.
, to the appearance of Pacific dolphins off the Aleutian islands.
Even the recent spate of emaciated gray whales beaching themselves along the West Coast may be attributable to global warming, he said.
In virtually every example, Norse said, species such as fish or bears or whales appear to be suffering from a lack of food that is connected to a warming of the ocean.
Polar bears, for example, seem to be suffering from a decline in the amount of sea ice, which is a source of algae that form the lowest rung on the bears' food chain.
' The report says the Alaskan salmon population declined drastically in 1997 and 1998, and that salmon that survive are unusually small, suggesting that they were starved.
The report says that sockeye are particularly susceptible to temperature variations.
``Researchers predict that anticipated increases in water temperature caused by a double of carbon dioxide will eliminate most, if not all, suitable habitat for Pacific sockeye salmon, and possibly for other salmon species as well,'' the report says.
The report was greeted skeptically by critics of global warming science.
``This doesn't surprise me, because they blame everything on global warming from tornadoes to droughts to heat waves,'' said John Carlisle, director of the environmental policy task force for The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank.
``But there is no firm evidence that man-made global warming is even occurring.
The fact is that the Earth's temperature is naturally fluctuating''.
Frank Maisano, a spokesman for an alliance of businesses called the Global Climate Coalition, said environmentalists are too quick to use unproven theories and circumstantial evidence to bolster claims of damage from global warning.
But Norse said the evidence that global warming is harming marine life is overwhelming.
``Whether the warming we have been seeing is caused by people is unclear, but that is by far the most logical explanation for the fact that the weather is the warmest it's been for thousands of years,'' Norse said.
``The evidence is so strong, it's almost like the evidence for gravity.
The people who deny it are denying it for reasons that are not scientific or substantive, but because it goes against their beliefs or economic interests''.
Global warming is the change in the climate thought to occur because human activities add to a buildup of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.
Those gases trap heat, and although there is ongoing dispute about how that in turn affects the climate, there is no doubt that global temperatures are rising.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, over the past century mean global temperatures have increased 0.6 to 1.2 degrees, the global sea level has risen 4 to 10 inches, and the snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere and floating ice in the Arctic Ocean have decreased.
The 10 warmest years of this century have occurred within the past 15 years.
What to do about global warming is controversial, both in Congress and in the international policy arena.
World diplomats meeting in Bonn have been bogged down in a dispute between the United States and Europe over how to address global warming.
And the Clinton administration has yet to ask Congress to approve the Kyoto Protocol it signed in 1997, saying that it is waiting for more developing countries to sign onto the pact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The report also comes at a time when residents of the Northwest and the country are already spending millions of dollars and facing potential restrictions in development in order to address other factors thought to be harming Pacific salmon, such as overfishing, dams and hatcheries.
Evidence continues to accumulate that the frozen world of the Arctic and sub-Arctic is thawing, and the findings are spotlighting two increasingly important questions: Can what is happening in the Great White North touch off sudden shifts in climate that will transform weather and disrupt life throughout the Northern Hemisphere?
Is the Arctic a key to the way in which global warming might be translated into region-by-region climatic changes?
The answer, many experts believe, may depend on how much fresh water flows into the North Atlantic Ocean as a result of melting Arctic ice and the runoff from an increase in Northern Hemisphere precipitation that some scientists say is already resulting from global warming.
The theory behind this view holds that the climate of the North Atlantic region, including Europe and eastern North America, is controlled by great ocean currents that transport heat northward from the tropics.
This oceanic conveyor belt is set in motion when saltier, and therefore heavier, surface water sinks to the deep ocean in the vicinity of southern Greenland.
It is replaced by warm water from the tropics that warms the North Atlantic region.
Without it, the relatively mild climate of England, for instance, might be as cold as that of northern Canada.
The worry is that a great influx of fresh water from the thawing Arctic might dilute the salty current and so either halt or weaken the heat-bearing conveyor belt.
This could result in a sudden, long-term drop in the North Atlantic region's temperature, a climatic disruption that would probably reverberate around the hemisphere by altering large-scale atmospheric circulation.
Last week, scientists reported that the current did indeed weaken or stop at least twice in the past, plunging the region, which each time had been warming, into cold comparable to that of an ice age.
Other researchers, focusing on the present, last week produced the latest in a lengthening string of studies documenting the thawing of the vast sheet of ice that covers the far northern seas, a potential source of fresh water that, once it melts, could help weaken the heat conveyor.
A third research group, using computerized simulations of the ocean-atmosphere system, concluded that the present-day thawing of Northern Hemisphere sea ice could not be explained by natural causes.
The most obvious possible cause, they said, is global warming produced by heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide, which result from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas.
And they said the rate of sea-ice melting was likely to increase in the decades ahead if emissions of the heat-trapping gases continued at today's rates.
Sudden influxes of fresh water from the Arctic appear to have shut down or weakened the oceanic heat conveyor twice in the relatively recent geological past, according to a study reported in the current issue of Nature by Dr.
Carsten Ruhlemann of the University of Bremen, Germany, and colleagues.
By examining chemical clues in ocean sediments, they determined that in each case, the western tropical North Atlantic was relatively warm while waters farther north were relatively cold _ as would be expected if the conveyor stopped or weakened.
The apparent shutdowns occurred as the world was coming out of the last ice age.
The North Atlantic region's rebound was twice interrupted by sudden reversions to glacial conditions, once around 15,000 years ago and again around 12,000 years ago, before settling into the relative warmth that has prevailed for the last 10,000 years.
The first reversion to glacial cold coincided with an invasion of the North Atlantic by vast quantities of fresh water in the form of icebergs, which were released from North America as temperatures warmed.
Another influx is believed to have touched off the second reversion to cold, called the Younger Dryas event.
That event set off far-flung reverberations.
The climate of the Middle East dried out so much that food became scarce, forcing the invention of agriculture, many scientists believe.
The New York region became so chilly that cold-weather trees like spruce took over the landscape from species like oak.
Could an influx of fresh water brought about by global warming make that happen again?
Recent studies lend the question new urgency.
In one, reported in the December issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters, scientists analyzed data collected by sonar aboard nuclear submarines and found that the floating ice cover of the Arctic Ocean has become about 40 percent thinner than it was two to four decades ago.
nn In another, reported in the current issue of the journal Science, researchers led by Dr.
Ola M.
Johannessen of the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center in Bergen, Norway, used satellite data to measure the area of the Arctic ice sheet.
They found that the perennial ice cover had shrunk by 14 percent over the last two decades.
The third study, by nine researchers headed by Dr.
Konstantin Y.
Vinnikov of the University of Maryland, analyzed data from five different sources and found that sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere as a whole had decreased by about 7 percent in the last 46 years.
Computer models of the ocean-atmosphere system reconstructed this trend accurately, said Dr.
Alan Robock of Rutgers University, a member of the research team.
The model simulations also determined that the trend was much larger than what would be expected to result from the climate system's natural variability.
This assumes that the models can reproduce natural variability with some accuracy, an assumption that many experts question.
Nevertheless, Robock said, the study provides ``strong support for the theory that humans are causing the climate to change''.
If the climate is indeed warming because of human activity, many scientists say, the influx of fresh water to the North Atlantic could increase.
Melting ice in the Arctic is not the only potential contributor.
Water from melting glaciers in Greenland and other Arctic and sub-arctic islands could also contribute.
Last year, scientists reported that the southern half of the Greenland ice cap was melting back by about two cubic miles a year, enough to cover Maryland with a sheet 1 foot thick.
(Runoff from melting glaciers contributes to a rising global sea level.
Melting sea ice does not; like an ice cube in a glass of water, its change in state does not raise the water level).
A third contributor to an influx of fresh water could be increased precipitation.
A warmer atmosphere causes more water to evaporate from the oceans, and some scientists believe that some of this increased atmospheric moisture would be transported to the far north, where it would produce a heavier runoff of fresh water into the North Atlantic.
This alone, some computer models indicate, would be enough to weaken the North Atlantic heat conveyor drastically in the 21st century.
How much fresh water might be necessary to halt, slow or weaken the conveyor is a crucial question that scientists cannot yet answer.
Nor do they know how close the world might be to an abrupt change in the conveyor's behavior.
``I don't think there's any accurate assessment out there that would tell us,'' said Dr.
Peter Schlosser, a geochemist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
If a warming atmosphere pumped enough fresh water into the ocean to shut down the conveyor, what would it mean?
Schlosser and others say the magnitude of the resulting climate change might be different from those observed in the last glacial cycle.
But, he said, ``It might put the system into a state that might be a precondition for further change''.
What might such a change entail?
Temperature and precipitation patterns could be drastically altered, much as El Nino alters them, and Schlosser says the alteration's effects would probably be felt throughout the Northern Hemisphere.
But exactly how the patterns would change and therefore what their down-to-earth effects would be, he said, is an open question.
NAIROBI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has undertaken various activities in Africa to address concerns of the continent in connection with climate variability and change, a UNEP official said Thursday.
At a press conference held here at the UNEP headquarters, Alex Alusa, program officer of UNEP atmosphere unit, said that UNEP had organized seminars to help African leaders in planning and preparing for droughts in Africa.
An ad hoc Working Group on the El Nino has been set up to review state of the science on El Nino and provide El Nino information to African countries as part of an Early Warning System, he added.
Alusa noted that UNEP is concerned with addressing two aspects of climate affecting Africa, namely the impact of climate variability on socio-economic systems and the potential impacts of climate change on eco-systems and the socio-economic system of countries.
He quoted the Second Assessment Report compiled by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change as saying that "as long as emissions (of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere) are allowed to continue in a business as usual manner, global warming will occur and occasion changes in the climate system".
The UNEP official noted that sustained increase in mean ambient temperatures beyond one centigrade degree would cause significant changes in forest and rangeland cover, species distribution, composition and migration patterns, and biome distribution.
Many organisms in the deserts are already near their tolerance limits, and some may not be able to adapt further under hotter conditions, he warned.
Alusa stressed that African continent is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because of widespread poverty, recurrent droughts, inequitable land distribution and over-dependence on rain-fed agriculture.
Although adaptation options theoretically are available, Alusa said, in practice the human, infrastructural and economic response capacity to effect timely response actions may well be beyond the economic means of some countries.
As farming depends entirely on the quality of the rainy season in most African countries, increased droughts could seriously impact the availability of food for the continent, he noted.
According to the UNEP official, a warmer environment could open up new areas for malaria and increase the incidence of yellow fever, dengue fever, onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis.
He warned that Africa was expected to be at risk primarily from increased incidences of vector-borne diseases and reduced nutritional status.
UNEP Executive Director Klaus Topfer also addressed the press conference, saying that he was committed to making UNEP an integral voice for the environmental policy.
He disclosed that the Global Environment Facility (FEF) had given UNEP a total of 750 million U.S.
Dollars to combat forest fires in Indonesia and Brazil.
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ As the hurricane hunter plane swooped low over the ocean on a late October day, white caps and green foam flicked across the tropical waters, giving rise to Mitch.
Clouds grew.
Rain squalls massed.
And Tropical Depression No.
13 would become a killing machine whose 180-mph (290-kph) winds made it one of the century's strongest Atlantic hurricanes.
Reaching colossal heights, Mitch would blot out more than 10,000 lives across Central America with torrential rains, sending mudslides tumbling over villages and floodwaters to the sea.
Powerful hurricanes like Mitch, devastating droughts and torrential floods have long plagued humankind.
But a number of governments, scientists and environmentalists meeting this week at a U.N. climate summit in the Argentine capital warned there could be more extreme weather if nations don't effectively cut greenhouse gas pollutants believed to cause Earth's undue warming.
The two-week summit was expected to conclude Friday with a framework for carrying out the 1997 Kyoto treaty, which calls for reductions in heat-trapping gases by industrialized nations by 2012.
Skeptics insist there's no way to predict the weather, next week, next decade or even a century from now.
Environmentalists, too, are wary of linking any specific weather event to overall global warming.
In 1995, the U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, where more than 2,000 scientists concluded in a landmark report that ``the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate''.
In other words, mankind has some hand in the Earth's warming.
Picking up their cue from the scientific evidence, climate negotiators in Buenos Aires say there is more cause for concern.
``Every month so far this year has set a record high for global temperatures, right on the heels of 1997, the warmest year on the books.
And a powerful El Nino gave us a taste of the extreme weather we can expect from global warming: droughts and floods in Texas, drought-driven fires in Indonesia, Florida and Mexico, and devastating floods in China,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, the top U.S. climate negotiator.
Others reject that the globe is warming, and challenge the consensus that unfettered burning of coal, gas and oil will harm the Earth.
As the debate continues, record amounts of gases spew from power plants and cars.
New research shows that temperature changes can change more rapidly than previously thought, says Jeff Severinghause of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego.
``We now have evidence that at the end of the last ice age, the climate warmed abruptly in less than 10 years,'' he said, reporting findings from 100-pound (45-kilo) samples extracted from Greenland's ice pack.
He said evidence suggests a rapid change 11,600 years ago, when temperatures rose about 14 degrees F (8 degrees C) in a mere decade or two.
He has documented at least one other sudden shift.
One U.S. atmospheric scientist, John R.
Christy at the University of Alabama, contends satellite and balloon data show significant global warming is not occuring now.
He has also argued that trying to discern patterns in ``extreme'' weather events is misleading.
And hurricane forecasters doubt extreme weather events such as Mitch show the influence of global warming.
``I think it's agreed that the globe is about 1 degree Fahrenheit warmer this century, but as far as its effect on tropical cyclones, we haven't been able to notice any difference,'' said forecaster Brian Jarvinen at the U.S.
National Hurricane Center in Miami.
He said intense hurricane periods have cycled on and off roughly every 25 years in this century.
``You had intense storms in the 1920s, 30s and 40s,'' he said, but then a milder hurricane cycle from the 60s to the 80s.
Some governments warn they can't wait for a definitive answer to why the oceans are rising.
Seas have risen 2 centimeters (nearly 1 inch) in the past year in parts of the Pacific, shrinking shorelines and displacing coastal dwellers _ all blamed on global warming.
The prime minister of Tuvalu said his nation of 9,600 people _ spread over nine small South Pacific atolls, has already suffered.
``We are the most vulnerable of the vulnerable countries,'' said Bikenibeau Paeniu.
``We are spending millions of dollars to rehabilitate the devastation caused by the adverse effects of climate change''.
As for global warming, he added his islands average just 2 meters (6 feet) above sea level, and global warming is ``not a matter of economics and politics, but of life and death.''
WASHINGTON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Long-term climate change such as global warming could have major impacts on human health, the environment, the economy and society, said Dr.
James Baker, Director of U.S.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Writing in the Washington Post Monday when the Fourth Session of the Conference of the Parties to U.N.
Framework Convention on Climate Change begins in Buenos Aires, the U.S. scientist said that global warming chould affect everything from energy use and transportation to water resource management and agriculture to international trade and development.
Baker said that over the past century, greenhouse gases have increased steadly: fossil fuel combustion now accounts for about 85 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
At the same time, agriculture, changing land-use patterns and deforestation are playing a significant role in altering the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.
Since 1860, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by 30 percent.
Overall emissions of greenhouse gases have been growing at about 1 percent each year, he said.
On the risks of a warmer world, Baker said that a relatively small change in mean global temperature can lead to a large change in extreme events.
This year's El Nino has increased rainfall, flooding and droughts.
Increased duration and frequency of heat waves would heighten mortality rates, and the potential for transmitting serious infectious diseases would be increased, Baker said.
According to a scientific assessment, the globally averaged temperature will increase about 2 to 6 degrees by the year 2100.
The related rise in sea level will be about 6 to 37 inches.
With 50 percent of the U.S. population and 50 to 70 percent of the global population currently living in coastal areas, future sea level rises, alterations in storm patterns and higher storm surges could have devastating effects.
Even with current global populations, a 20-inch rise in the sea level without adaptive measures would directly threaten 92 million people, wrote Director Baker.

Greenhouse gas emissions - blamed for global warming - may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century, a new scientific study predicted recently.
Using recent technological advances in climate modelling and new scientific research on ice and oceans, Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist at the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund, made three predictions on the impact of climate change on the Antarctic Ice Sheet.
In two of the three scenarios, complete melting would raise global sea level by an average four to six metres, causing major coastal flooding worldwide, Oppenheimer wrote in the latest issue of the scientific journal Nature'.
In the other scenario, the internal ice shifting within the ice sheet could cause the melting to slow down.
With its 3.8 million cubic kilometers of ice at the South Pole, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet posed the 'most immediate threat of a large sea-level rise, owing to its potential instability,'' Oppenheimer said.
Changes in ocean temperature and circulation expected to accompany global warming could disintegrate the large ice sheet, as early as next century, he said.
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet first attracted widespread attention 30 years ago when scientists suggested that global warming caused by greenhouse gases might cause its disintegration.
Greenhouse gas emissions - including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
In 1995 an international panel of scientists that advises the United Nations on the issue, predicted that the average global temperatures could heat up between one and 3.5 degrees Celsius during the next century.
Last year, scientists declared 1997 the warmest year on record, and the fact that nine of the past 11 years set new records for warm temperatures bolstered the view that greenhouse emissions were raising the average temperature.
Over time, these increases could cause changes in climate, including the increased frequency and intensity of storms, floods, heat waves, and droughts, the scientists said.
To deal with this threat 38 industrialised countries agreed at a conference last December in Kyoto, Japan to reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gases by about six percent overall between 2008 and 2012.
While countries work out the details of the Kyoto agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that the lack of scientific understanding of the effects of global warming on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet limits the ability to predict the risk of the collapse' or melting'.
But Oppenheimer warned that, as countries begin to formulate global warming policies, 'the potential hazards from the collapse of the ice sheet is too large and irreversible'' to be considered at a later date.
Conflicting scientific views on the effect global warming would have on ice caps had confused the issue, Oppenheimer said.
Until recently, scientific studies argued that the West Ice Sheet and Antarctica as a whole were growing not disintegrating or melting.
Similarly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that over the past century Antarctica did not cause sea-levels to rise at all.
Yet, recent studies had found high melting rates under the floating ice, he added.
In combination with other findings of shrinking icebergs, these new melting rates exceeded the estimated growth of the ice in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
Oppenheimer pointed to studies made of two ice shelves to the north of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that had been disintegrating for several decades, possibly because of local atmospheric warming.
While most scientists agreed that the ice sheet was shrinking, they disagreed on how fast it will melt and what the consequences would be.
In an effort to simplify the controversy, Oppenheimer produced what he believed would be the three most probable effects of global warming on this relatively unstable sheet of ice.
Each of the three most likely possibilities varied according to how fast the West Antarctic Ice Sheet responded to the melting and disintegration of various glaciers and ice shelves in the area.
Using the climate change predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel and the continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions, Oppenheimer predicted that in two of the possible scenarios sea levels would rise four to six metres.
While most of the sea-level increase would occur beyond the twenty-first century for several hundreds of years, the process could begin in as early as 50 years.
Some reports said the process already had begun.
In the other scenario, Oppenheimer believed that internal ice shifting within the ice sheet possibly could cause the melting to slow down.
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 world senior scientists at a summit here today called on world leaders to act immediately to prevent the potentially devastating consequences of human-induced global warming.
A consensus declaration "World Scientists' Call for Action at Kyoto," signed by more than 1,500 scientists, was presented to the U.S. government at the Summit on Climate Change in Washington, DC.
"Let there be no doubt about the conclusions of the scientific community: the threat of global warming is very real and action is needed immediately," said Nobel laureate Henry Kendall, chairman of the Union of Concerned Scientists.
"It is a grave error to believe that we can continue to procrastinate".
Leading scientists came to the Science Summit to urge world leaders at their Kyoto Climate Summit in Japan in December to negotiate final agreement on a treaty to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases that are altering the climate.
The scientists meeting today was held six days before a White House conference to propose global actions on the issue.
The scientists' declaration urged all government leaders to demonstrate a new commitment to protecting the global environment for future generations.
The declaration stated that global warming is underway and the overuse of fossil fuels is partly to blame.
It said that climate change is projected to raise sea levels; increase the likelihood of more intense rainfall, floods, and droughts; and endanger human health by greater exposure to heat waves and encroachment of tropical diseases to higher latitudes.
Further, the declaration said, climate change is likely to exacerbate food shortages and spread undernutrition by adversely affecting water supplies, soil conditions, temperature tolerances, and growing seasons.
Climate change will also accelerate the appalling pace at which species are now disappearing, especially in vulnerable ecosystems, it said, adding that possibly one-third of all species may be lost before the end of the next century.
According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by 30 percent since preindustrial times.
Over the same period, atmospheric methane has risen by 145 percent, mostly from agricultural activities like growing rice and raising cattle.
As a result, the earth's average surface temperature will increase by 1.0-3.5 degrees Celsius in the next 100 years, in addition to the increase of 0.3-0.6 degrees Celsius that has already occurred since 1860.
Scientists predict that even if people stopped emitting heat-trapping gases now, the climate wouldn't stabilize for many decades because of the gases have already been sent into the atmosphere.
They hold that a strong treaty will be the "first step to protect future generations from dire prospects that would result from failure to meet our responsibilities toward them".
This is a wake-up call for world leaders.
Never before has the senior scientific community spoken so boldly on the urgent need to prevent disruption to our climate," said Nobel laureate Dudley Herschbath, professor of chemistry at Harvard University.
BUENOS AIRES, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Wildlife Foundation of Argentina (WFA) on Friday called for the saving of forests and jungles, which are in danger because of the climate change.
The WWF and WFA experts told the press here that all the measures to increase the energy efficiency must be taken and less contaminating sources of energy should be used as a final solution to the problem.
All the countries, especially the industrialized ones, must commit themselves to take more stringent measures to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions, they added.
The press conference was attended by Nigel Dudley, WWF independent consultant, and WFA Director Javier Corcuera.
Dudley said that the climate change or global warming up threatens the wellbeing of all mankind, and that the climate change impacts are more evident every day in all the world.
He said there exist possibilities of the destroying of the forests, because they cannot follow the rhythm of the rapid climate change.
The WWF, the biggest organization in the world for the conservation of nature, has 4.7 million employees who work in 96 countries in the world.
The organization also has a status of official observer in the United Nations.
The Fourth World Conference on the Climate Change will be held here from November 2 to 13.
GENEVA (AP) -- Cities including New York and Tokyo may face flooding; large swathes of Latin America will suffer from drought and Australia's Great Barrier Reef may be destroyed unless more is done to stop global warming, the World Wildlife Fund for Nature warned Tuesday.
The environmental group urged governments meeting in Germany next week to honor earlier pledges to cut emissions of carbon dioxide -- one of the main greenhouse gases -- by implementing tough energy-saving policies.
``Evidence for the warming of our planet over the last 200 years is now overwhelming,'' said a WWF statement.
``With no action to curb emissions, the climate on earth over the next century could become warmer than any the human species has lived through''.
It said China's Giant Panda and the Arctic polar bear were among the species at risk of extinction from global warming.
WWF commissioned the Climatic Research Unit at Britain's University of East Anglia to conduct research into various climate change scenarios over the next few decades.
It projected that sea levels would rise between three-quarters of an inch to four inches per decade.
This would threaten low-lying U.S. coastal cities such as New York, Boston, Baltimore and Miami with flooding.
The Japanese cities of Tokyo and Osaka -- among others -- would also be at risk, it said.
Large areas of the Amazon would become more susceptible to forest fires.
Drought would also likely affect Argentina, southern Mexico and Central America.
Rising sea temperatures by 2010 threatened the very survival of the Australian Great Barrier Reef.
Scientists generally agree that temperatures are rising -- with 1998 being the warmest year on record.
But there is no consensus on how much man is to blame.
``Although the precise contribution of human activities to global warming cannot yet be stated with confidence, it is clear the planet would not be warming as rapidly if humans were not currently emitting about 6.8 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year,'' said the WWF report.
Under a 1997 agreement reached in the Japanese city of Kyoto, industrialized nations agreed to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by five percent between 2008 and 2012.
Representatives from 150 countries meet later this month in Bonn to work on ways of implementing the Kyoto deal prior to a November 2000 meeting in the Netherlands.
While President Clinton signed the Kyoto agreement, he has not sought its ratification because of widespread opposition in the Senate.
Critics say it will cost too much to implement while developing countries will be allowed to let greenhouse emissions grow.
As Earth grows warmer, the prognosis for human health is darkening.
Skeptics still dismiss the doomsday scenarios of the so-called greenhouse effect.
But momentum is building for those scientists who contend that the time has come to investigate how global warming may hurt, not whether it's real.
Heat stress deaths in the United States may double by 2075, one researcher estimates.
More Americans will wheeze from pollution, sneeze from pollen and grow ill from contaminated water, according to some projections.
Recent studies showed that abnormal rainfalls boosted mice populations and likely sparked the 1993 hantavirus outbreak near Albuquerque, N.M., suggesting that climate shifts pose infectious disease threats in the United States.
The forecast is worse for those living beyond U.S. borders, where diseases may hitchhike on bugs thriving in the heat and epidemics may wash ashore on ocean plants blooming in warm water.
``It's happening right now,'' said Paul Epstein, associate director of the Center for Health and Global Environment at Harvard University's Medical School, who is among the most pessimistic of researchers.
``Glaciers are retreating, plants are migrating.
We're seeing West Nile virus in New York, dengue and malaria in northern India''.
The warming phenomenon is widely blamed on the atmospheric build-up of ``greenhouse gases'' such as carbon dioxide, which are emitted during the burning of coal and other fossil fuels.
The gases trap heat, upsetting climate systems, many experts maintain.
The consequences to health are viewed through the lens of probability.
Rising temperatures, heavier rains and longer droughts would shake up ecological systems that influence human well-being.
Prolonged rains, for example, might cause new plant growth that would attract deer, which can carry ticks, which can carry Lyme disease.
Drought may slow rivers, creating stagnant pools for mosquito breeding.
The possibilities are riveting to specialists across the sciences, from experts in plant migration to researchers who peek inside polar ice cores for clues about prehistoric climate.
At least two groups of scientists are tracking possible health threats.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, assembled by the United Nations, has concluded that ``significant loss of life'' is possible.
Dengue, rift valley fever, cholera and other diseases may spread in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, the IPCC reports.
The portion of the world population vulnerable to malaria may rise to 60 percent from 45 percent by 2100, according to the IPCC.
A group of U.S. scientists, meanwhile, is updating a report to Congress that will outline domestic threats from hotter air and oceans.
The resulting climate shifts would drench some regions in more intense and frequent rain, while others areas would get baked by drought, these scientists say.
The group recently warned that warmer air will increase ground-level ozone pollution, aggravating asthma and other breathing problems, plus increase allergy woes in areas where plants flourish.
The report, the health segment of the U.S.
National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, also warns that more people could get sick from contaminated water.
Floods may cause overflows at sewage treatment plants.
The specific impact will depend on a person's age and overall health, scientists said.
``With heat waves, it's the elderly,'' said Jonathan Patz, director of Johns Hopkins University's Program on Health Effects of Global Environmental Change and a lead author of the U.S. assessment.
``With air pollution, if ozone increases, it's people with respiratory problems''.
Laurence Kalkstein, director of the Center for Climatic Research at the University of Delaware, predicted that heat stress fatalities will double in the next 75 years if warming trends and other conditions persist.
About 2,000 to 3,000 Americans die each year from heat stress, he said.
Fatalities will be most common in cities in the Northeast and Midwest, where residents are unaccustomed to extreme, enduring heat, and where many people live in brick houses with tar roofs.
But people living in established hot spots may suffer, too.
``Let's assume it gets up to 120 or 125 degrees relatively regularly'' in Phoenix, Kalkstein said.
``You may get to the point where the heat just becomes intolerable''.
All the projections come with caveats.
For instance, other factors may prove more important than global warming in the spread of disease.
Expansions in worldwide travel and trade will be responsible for some epidemics.
So will weak sanitation, water and medical systems.
``A major problem is population growth,'' said Dr.
Donald Henderson, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins.
``Urban areas are growing at very rapid rates.
People in tropical areas are living in crowded areas with poor sanitation.
All these factors could allow an organism to grow, but they have nothing to do with global warming''.
Forecasts also are clouded by the limits of science.
Researchers cannot say, for example, exactly when and where disease will strike, or how severely.
Nor is it known how vaccines, more air conditioning or other measures will insulate people from illnesses.
But the worldwide climate has changed significantly, most scientists concur.
Air temperatures have risen between 0.7 and 1.4 degrees in the past 100 years, and new data show ocean warming down to depths of nearly 10,000 feet.
Palpable symptoms are emerging.
Global icecaps are melting.
Insects are migrating to higher elevations, and shrubs are taking root on the Alaskan tundra.
The scientific understanding of what role climate plays in health, meanwhile, is growing.
In Uganda, torrential rains have been blamed for malaria deaths.
A new study of more than 400 gastrointestinal disease outbreaks across the U.S. estimates that runoffs from heavy rains carried the bacteria one-third of the time.
``It is indeed an emerging science,'' said Rita Colwell, director of the National Science Foundation.
``Will we have cholera in the U.S.?
I doubt it.
Will we have more severe events in Bangladesh?
Possibly''. But most scientists say it's too early to confirm links between current human sickness and global warming.
Predictions that reach beyond the proof of science risk the label of irresponsibility.
``There are many, many reasons why malaria has gone higher in recent years,'' said Paul Reiter, a national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specialist who has studied mosquitos at higher elevations.
``But none of them have been attributed to climate change.
It's just make-believe''.
Some scientists are guilty of oversimplification, said Hadi Dowlatabadi, director of the Integrated Study of the Human Dimensions of Global Change at Carnegie Mellon University.
If warming temperatures were such a powerful bridge to disease, Dowlatabadi asks, why did malaria epidemics sweep through England and other chilly locales in previous generations?
Missing from current projections, he said, are adequate emphases on public health factors.
Between 1995 and 1998, for instance, 50,000 people in northern Mexico fell sick by dengue fever, the mosquito-born disease that can cause fever, headaches and internal bleeding.
Only 50 people in nearby Texas, meanwhile, were stricken, Dowlatabadi said.
``You tell me: Does the climate change dramatically as you go the five miles over the Rio Grande''? he asked.
Researchers on the U.S.
Assessment team, while giving weight to such arguments, say they miss the larger point: With global climate shifting, risk is rising.
``There's not complete agreement on all the particulars,'' said Harvard's Epstein.
``But there is a clear consensus that climate plays a role in infectious diseases, and that climate change, with more warming and more extreme events, will have a negative impact on public health in multiple ways''.
(OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) Researchers scratching away at the question said they've found a helpful tool in a familiar weather phenomenon: El Nino.
El Nino events, the natural climate cycles that cause regional temperature extremes, rainfalls and droughts, may be useful dress rehearsals for more permanent shifts.
``To the extent that El Nino can give you a short window into long-term events, it's a valid way to look at things,'' said Dr.
Brian Hjelle, a New Mexico scientist.
Hjelle is among researchers who have examined recent outbreaks of hantavirus, the illness that has killed dozens in New Mexico and other Southwest states in recent years.
When people became sick with flu-like symptoms in 1993, the cause was a mystery.
The afflicted got fevers, aches and chills.
Next came headaches, nausea and lungs filling with fluid.
Forty died.
Around-the-clock investigation blamed the white-bellied deer mouse, whose urine can carry the virus.
Seven years later, scientists maintain a climate shift was at work.
The deer mouse population boomed prior to the outbreak, according to a study authored by Hjelle, because El Nino-driven rains in 1991-92 increased vegetation, providing food and ground cover.
When conditions turned drier the next year, the mice sought food in homes.
Scientists said they're now refining the technique of using ``climate signals'' to prepare for health problems.
In East Africa, ocean temperatures and mountain greenery can be used to predict outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, a disease that causes partial blindness in humans and forces pregnant livestock to abort fetuses.
And in the Bay of Bengal off Bangladesh, satellite imagery has shown that higher water temperatures cause plankton blooms that carry cholera epidemics.
``We really think we've made the linkage between climate variability, ecology and human health,'' said Patz, from Johns Hopkins.
``And this is where we need to go'' to understand risks.
GENEVA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Climate change is likely to disturb various natural and ecological systems, posing serious threat to human health, said a report jointly released Tuesday by relevant United Nations specialized agencies at a session on global warming issue.
"In destablizing the world's climate and its dependent ecosystems, we are posing new and widespread risks to human health", said the report, which assesses potential health consequences of human-induced climate change, while conceding that much more research needs to be done.
The pace of climate change is predicted to be unprecedentedly quick due to the accumulation in atmosphere of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.
The least direct health effects would be those due to socioeconomic disruption caused by environmental deterioration, the most direct would be those caused by heatwaves, storms and floods.
The extreme weather events may be more frequent and severe as the climate is getting warmer and wetter.
Experts predict a 1-3 centigrade degree growth in global mean surface temperature by the year 2100, and that we would have higher sea level, more heavy rainfalls, more floods, more bushfires, as well as longer and more severe droughts.
Hot weather would lead to up to several thousand extra heat-related deaths annually by around 2050 in many big cities worldwide.
The increase would outweigh the decline in winter-related mortality.
The report said that many of the indirect public health effects due to climate change would occur slowly, via climate impacts upon agriculture, ocean fisheries and infectious disease transmission.
Climate change allows disease vectors to extend territory, helping infectious diseases spread and kill more people.
In the next century, it would increase the global incidence of malaria by 50 to 80 million additional cases annually, and the vulnerable population would rise from the current 45 percent to about 60 percent of the world's total.
The incidence of food-and water-related infections such as cholera would also grow, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions, following changes in water distribution, temperature and the proliferation of microorganisms, the report added.
According to the report, by exacerbating the production of some types of air pollutants, climate change would result in the increase in the incidence of related health problems, such as cardio-vascular and respiratory disorders.
In some regions, warmer and wetter climate could also lead to higher concentration in air of various pollens and spores with a possible impact on allergic disorders, such as hay fever and asthma.
Sustained stratospheric ozone depletion -- a factor closely related to climate change, which leads to increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation, would cause increased cases of skin cancer, and possibly of ocular lesions, such as cataracts.
It may also impair human immune system, said the report, which was released at the July 8-19 session in Geneva of the Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
OTTAWA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Arctic town of Sachs Harbour in Canada on the west coast of Banks Island is slowly sinking into the sea as a result of global warming, the National Post reported Tuesday.
Climate change in the past decade has brought milder winters, warmer summers and a later freeze-up to soften the permafrost that supports the Arctic town.
Rosemarie Kuptana, an Inuit leader, was quoted as saying the situation has made it difficult for hunters to travel over an increasingly muddy landscape.
"If this rate of change continues, our lifestyle may forever change because our communities are sinking with the melting permafrost," she said.
Kuptana is leading an international project to collect Inuit observations about climate change in her hometown of Sachs Harbour.
In the northwest reaches of the Arctic, she said that experienced hunters have fallen through unusually thin ice.
The region is also seeing the appearance of species such as robins, barn swallows, beetles and sandflies.
Some of the Inuit locals have begun to suffer allergies from white pine pollen, which has never before reached Banks Island.
She urged more attention to the issue of global warming, saying, "What happens in the Arctic environment is what is in store for other regions of the world."
MONTREAL, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) today called for stronger actions to combat the threat of climate change to wildlife and natural ecosystems.
"Climate change as a result of global warming represents a serious threat to the survival of biodiversity and the protection, management and rehabilitation of protected areas," the WWF reaffirmed.
Governments and international organizations "have to stop hitting the snooze button on the alarm bell for action that global warming represents," said Adam Markham, director of the WWF's Global Climate Change Campaign.
"How many ecosystems must be threatened before we listen to this wake-up call"? he asked at a news briefing at the ongoing World Conservation Congress in Montreal, Canada.
Climate changes affecting the planet are caused mainly by the burning of coal, oil and gas.
Huge quantities of pollutants like carbon dioxide trap more and more heat in the atmosphere, ultimately disrupting the global temperature balance.
At the speed the climate is now changing, scientists predict the world will soon be warmer than at any time in the last 10,000 years.
According to a study by some 2,500 scientists of the world, atmospheric concentrations of Co2 are now 30 percent above the pre-industrial level and a warming trend in global mean temperature can be detected since 1860.
"Significant loss of species must be considered as one of the most important impacts of climate change," the study said.
Climate change is "getting worse," and it has already produced "severe" impacts on ecosystems, habitats, species, Markham noted.
In this fight against global warming, Markham emphasized that the industrialized countries should take on more responsibilities and keep their promises of Co2 emission reductions.
He singled out the United States, the world's biggest producer of green house gas emission, and Canada, the No.
1 country in per capita gas emission.
The two countries produce more than 20 percent of all gas emission worldwide, he said.
If the present level of ecosystem is to be maintained, at least 20 percent of Co2 emission will have to be reduced worldwide, Markham added.
BEIRUT, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Global warming weather will critically undermine efforts for sustainable development in Lebanon and other Mediterranean literal states, the Greenpeace Mediterranean has said in a report.
Daily Star today quoted a report issued by Greenpeace Mediterranean in Lebanon on Thursday entitled "Climate change and the Mediterranean region" as saying that climate change will add to existing problems of desertification, water scarcity, and food production in the region.
As the world warms, global sea levels will rise as oceans expand.
The level of much of the Mediterranean could rise by close to one meter by 2100, the report said.
According to the report, the worst affected areas will be the Nile Delta in Egypt, Venice in Italy and Thessaloniki in Greece as a consequence of the expected rise in sea level.
It said that the first impact of climate change will be felt in the Mediterranean water resource system.
Reductions in water availability would hit southern Mediterranean countries the hardest.
In Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Syria, Malta and Lebanon, water availability is already near the 1,000 cubic meters per person per year benchmark for water scarcity, and the report warns that live-stock production would suffer as rangeland deteriorates.
The 55-page report added that rising carbon dioxide (CO2) will also introduce new threats to human health, ecosystems and national economies.
As a result of carbon dioxide emissions, the frequency and severity of drought could increase across the region.
Temperatures could rise by over four degrees centigrade by 2100 over many of the inland areas and by more than this over the Mediterranean Sea.
The report called on all Mediterranean states to immediately demand industrialized countries adopt legally-binding obligations at the Kyoto Climate Conference in Japan next month to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent over 1990 levels by 2005.
WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Global warming in the 21st century will likely cause drastic changes in the climate of the United States, including potentially severe droughts, increased risk of flood, mass migrations of species, and widespread erosion of coastal zones, a new federal report released this week says.
The report, Climate Change Impacts on the United States: The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, provides the most detailed look ever at the possible impacts of global warming on the United States over the next 100 years.
Among its key findings, the report indicates that continued growth in worldwide emissions is likely to increase average temperatures across the United States by 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.
Impacts such as heavier precipitation and increased drought will vary widely from region to region, and some natural ecosystems, such as alpine meadows, coral reefs, coastal wetlands and Alaskan permafrost, are likely to deteriorate further and some may disappear entirely, says the report.
Changes in rain and snowfall patterns could affect the availability of fresh water, and crop productivity is likely to rise nationally due to the fertilizing effect of more carbon dioxide in the air, although regional cropping patterns may change significantly.
Yet "for the nation as a whole, direct economic impacts are likely to be modest," concludes the report, which is based on computer models and historical data, and "American society would likely be able to adapt to most of the impacts".
The program was authorized by Congress in 1990 and carried out by nine federal agencies.
The analysis was based largely on two computer simulations of future climate that often produce very different or even antithetical results.
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Experts attending the '97 China International Environmental Forum warn that failure to limit greeenhouse gas emissions will raise the global mean surface temperature by two degrees centigrades over the next 100 years.
This will in turn raise the sea level by some 50 cm.
, according to Raul Estrada Oyuela, chairman of Ad Hoc Group Berlin Mandate under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
He added that many island states will disappear by then.
People threatened by storms and floods will be forced to migrate, and climate changes will aggravate risks of famine and disease, said Oyuela.
He cited a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which noted that stablization of the concentration of greenhouse gases by the year 2100 will nonetheless be accompanied by rising temperatures and higher sea levels.
Zou Jingmeng, former chairman of the World Meteorological Organization, stressed that further proof is needed to verify the prediction, but noted that people must pay great attention to the possibility of any increase in the global surface temperature.
Experts say the concentration of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides, in the atmosphere will continue to rise due to the use of coal, petroleum, fertilizer and excessive deforestation.
Oyuela said the global mean surface temperature over the past one hundred years has climbed by 0.6 centigrades, with a rise in the sea level of between 10-25 centimeters.
He said that a 50 cm rise in the sea level will increase the number of people under the threat of flooding from the current 46 million to 92 million annually.
Climate changes will also increase the risk of heart disease, pulmonary tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases in the subtropical and tropical areas, according to experts.
An international climate conference scheduled for next month in Kyoto, Japan, will focus on greenhouse gas emissions.
SAN FRANCISCO _ Like an omen from the Book of Revelation, a wispy, silvery-blue noctilucent cloud hovered over Colorado late last month.
The timing couldn't have been more appropriate.
The cloud _ a harbinger of climate change, some call it _ appears as global warming research is becoming a major scientific industry in fields ranging from atmospheric physics to biology.
Researchers are increasingly convinced that carbon dioxide gas from the burning of fossil fuels is at least partly responsible for the marked warming of recent years.
And the warming is accelerating.
``Almost every climate model says the same thing,'' said ocean chemist Peter G.
Brewer of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Monterey.
``In the next decade, we might see the same amount of warming that we saw over the last century''.
In the diverse world of global warming research, the latest projections suggest that: _ Coastal residents can look for rainier weather, and sea levels could rise one to three feet around North America.
Heavier rain and higher seas would increase coastal damage during storms.
_ The Pacific ecosystem, especially fish that benefit much of the West Coast economy, could be threatened.
``There's lots of data showing there are big changes in marine ecosystems from the tropics to the poles,'' said biological oceanographer James P.
Barry of the Monterey Bay Institute.
For example, ``if you look at the record from 1992 to now, there's just been a precipitous decline in salmon stocks _ they're smaller and have less fat''.
&QL; _ An ominous absence of icebergs in the Grand Banks shipping lanes off Newfoundland might be an early warning sign of global warming, Science magazine reported July 2.
_ New York City will suffer repeated flooding in the next century as global warming raises the sea level, soaking subways and turning parts of Brooklyn into wetlands, said a report issued jointly on June 29 by the Environmental Defense Fund and Columbia University.
Global warming might seem like an unreal issue to residents of Northern California: They are shivering through one of the chillier summers in long memory.
Still, such short-term coolings can't obscure the long-term signal that it is getting warmer all over the Earth.
New projections of global warming indicate it might be even slightly worse than originally foreseen.
Previously, scientists expected an average planetary temperature rise of 1.4 to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 100 years.
Now they're looking at a rise of 2.3 to 7.2 degrees, said Tom Wigley, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
That 1-degree difference in projections might seem slight, but it equals the increase in average global temperature over the last century, Wigley said.
One reason for the worsened climate projections is the increased success in controlling another pollutant: sulfur dioxide.
While carbon dioxide warms the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide cools it.
Until recently, researchers hoped that sulfur dioxide would counterbalance global warming.
Now that hope is fading as nations establish tighter controls on sulfur dioxide emissions, Wigley said.
For that reason, slightly higher rates of warming and sea level rise related to warming are expected, according to a climate study written by Wigley and released June 29 by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Washington.
In the next century, the rates of rise in temperature and sea level might occur up to seven times as fast as in the 20th century, the Pew study adds.
Computer models have indicated that global warming in the lower atmosphere would be accompanied by high-altitude cooling.
In 1994, professor Gary Thomas of the University of Colorado at Boulder forecast that as the upper air cooled, beautiful noctilucent clouds _ common in polar latitudes _ would appear at southerly latitudes.
The clouds are wispy and silvery-blue, composed of very small ice crystals.
They resemble cirrus clouds, but are far higher, some 50 miles up.
&QL; On June 22, 50 miles in the sky over Boulder, a silver-bluish noctilucent cloud drifted overhead.
It is the farthest south such a cloud has been recorded, Thomas said.
The southerly drift of noctilucent clouds may be the miner's canary of global warming, a signal of bad times ahead.
``What we're seeing are some dramatic effects that are far greater than what the models are predicting'' he said.
Yet the national response to global warming remains sluggish and divided, in part because of fears that tough pollution-control measures could hurt a vibrant economy.
``We are astonished that some members of Congress continue to ignore warnings from the scientific community,'' said Walt Oechel, a biology professor and director of the Global Climate Change Research Group at San Diego State University.
``Climate scientists from around the world are in wide agreement that global warming is real and could greatly disrupt society.''
LONDON (AP) -- Global warming could fundamentally transform a third of the world's plant and animal habitats by the end of this century, threatening many species with rapid extinction, an international conservation organization warned Wednesday.
In a new report, researchers for the World Wide Fund for Nature -- known as the World Wildlife Fund in the United States and Canada -- singled out the Arctic and northern latitudes as the most vulnerable to the changing climate.
They estimated 20 percent of the species there could die out due to shrinking habitat.
The report raises the specter of a tundra denuded of its walrus and polar bear populations and a New England stripped of its spruce and fir forests if the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere is not reduced.
Many scientists believe that high concentrations of CO2 and other so-called greenhouse gases trap the sun's heat in the atmosphere, driving up temperatures and changing weather patterns.
''As global warming accelerates, plants and animals will come under increasing pressure to migrate to find suitable habitat,'' said the report's co-author, Adam Markham, executive director of the U.S.-based group Clean Air-Cool Planet.
''Some will just not be able to move fast enough,'' Markham said.
The northern latitudes of Canada, Russia and Scandinavia, where climate change is expected to occur fastest, could lose 70 percent of their habitat -- a level that rises to 82 percent for Iceland.
In several countries -- including Russia, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Iceland, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Georgia -- and in seven Canadian provinces and territories, more than half the existing habitat is at risk, the report said.
More than a third of habitat is in danger in the U.S. states of Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, it said.
The projected habitat changes and species extinctions would not be limited to northern latitudes, however.
Coastal and island areas would be at risk from warming oceans and rising waters, the report said.
The exact nature and rate of global climate change remains contentious.
According to a study published in the July issue of the Dutch journal Climate Change, Arctic temperatures in the late 20th century were the warmest in four centuries.
But, critics of the global warming theory argue there's little evidence that forces other than natural temperature swings are at work.
They have also argued that while ground monitors have shown a sharp increase in Earth's temperatures, satellite and weather balloon observations have shown little or no warming -- a discrepancy that has still not been fully explained.
Researchers evaluated data from 100 separate studies of environmental factors in North America, Europe and Asia, including air temperature measurements, air circulation, precipitation, sea ice, glaciers and plant growth.
They said parts of Alaska and Eurasia had warmed ''alarmingly'' -- by as much as 11 degrees -- during winter months during the last 30 years.
''This compilation of research results make it undeniable that a major warming is affecting the Arctic environment,'' said Michael T.
Ledbetter of the National Science Foundation in Washington, which funded the study, co-authored by 11 climatologists from five universities in the United States.
Wednesday's report -- written by Markham and University of Toronto professor Jay Malcolm -- used computer models to simulate global climate and vegetation change under a variety of conditions.
Its projections are based on the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubling from pre-industrial levels by the year 2100.
And even that estimate is optimistic, the report said.
Current concentrations of carbon dioxide -- the gas primarily responsible for global warming -- are about 30 percent higher than pre-industrial levels, and could hit double the pre-industrial level by 2050, the researchers said.
The loss of habitat would place many plant and animal species in a race for their lives, and scientists do not yet know whether they would be able to migrate fast enough to outrun the change.
The report estimates that some species of vegetation would have to migrate 10 times faster than during the last glacial retreat, about 10,000 years ago.
''A considerable portion of the globe could eventually become devoid of tree cover,'' the report noted.
The report said the most vulnerable species are those who live in isolated or fragmented habitats, including the Gelada baboon of Ethiopia; the Australian mountain pygmy possum; the monarch butterfly, which spends its winters in Mexico; and the spoon-billed sandpiper of Siberia.
The report is designed to pressure politicians ahead of November's international climate-change summit in the Dutch city of The Hague, at which politicians will attempt to ratify the 1997 Kyoto agreement limiting greenhouse-gas emissions.
''Many countries are trying to find loopholes in the Kyoto agreement,'' said Andrew Kerr of the WWF's Climate Change campaign.
''They should know that the problem is much more of an immediate threat than they realized''.
Added Markham: ''Speed kills.
We're night-driving on a mountain road with the lights switched off.''
LONDON _ Global warming could wipe out many species of plants and animals by the end of the 21st century, the World Wide Fund for Nature said in a report issued here Thursday.
The fund, known in the United States as the World Wildlife Fund, paints a devastating picture of the ability of species from Arctic polar bears and walruses, to New England sugar maple trees, to survive unless they can migrate quickly and adapt to their new environment.
Particularly at risk, the report says, are species that are rare or live in mountainous or isolated places.
Among those singled out as vulnerable are the gelada baboon in Ethiopia; the monarch butterfly, which spends winters in Mexico; the Australian mountain pygmy possum; the northern spruce in New York state, and the spoon-billed sandpiper, which breeds in the far northeastern reaches of Russia.
According to the report, up to 70 percent of the natural habitat could be lost, and 20 percent of the species rendered extinct, in the Arctic and northernmost areas of places like Canada, Russia and Scandinavia, where warming is predicted to be most rapid.
Places farther to the south, including parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Iceland and Kyrgyzstan, could lose more than half of their natural habitat.
In the United States, the report says, more than a third of the existing habitat in Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas could be irrevocably altered by global warming.
The report is based on the often used, but disputed, assumption that by the year 2100 there will have been a doubling of the emissions of carbon monoxide into the atmosphere from the level at the start of the industrial revolution.
``Rapid rates of global warming are likely to increase rates of habitat loss and species extinction, most markedly in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere,'' the report says.
``Extensive areas of habitat may be lost to global warming and many species may be unable to shift their ranges fast enough to keep up''.
According to Jennifer L.
Morgan, director of the World Wildlife Fund Climate Change Campaign in Washington, some species would have to migrate at a rate 10 times faster than after the last ice age in order to survive into the next century.
``Climate change is coming at us much faster than many habitats are going to be able handle,'' Morgan said.
``The speed of change caused by the change in climate is greater than most ecosystems are going to be able to adapt to.''
BEIJING (AP) _ Police in a far west Chinese region rocked by a series of terrorist attacks have arrested a group of suspects and seized firearms, an official newspaper reported.
The attacks occured in the Yili district of Xinjiang, a large, restive region where Muslim separatists are battling Chinese rule.
Acts of violent terrorism have occured ``many times'' in Yili since last year, the Xinjiang Daily said in its Aug.
24 edition, seen Saturday in Beijing.
Police responded with repeated efforts this year to suppress the terrorists, breaking up more than 10 criminal gangs, detaining a group of suspects and seizing guns and ammunition, the newspaper said.
It gave no details of the crackdown but said some police officers were killed and injured.
Since last year, Yili police have set up 33 new stations and hired 456 additional officers, it said.
Xinjiang was ruled by Chinese emperors for 200 years as a buffer state between China and the Muslim nations of Central Asia.
The Uighurs, Xinjiang's main ethnic group, briefly ran an independent state before communist forces retook the region in 1949.
Separatist sentiment, never fully quelled, has been reignited in recent years by the newly independent Central Asian nations created in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse and by Iran's Islamic revolution.
China has tried to counter the effect by improving relations with Kazakstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and getting them to pledge not to support anti-Chinese separatists.
BEIJING (AP) _ Threats by officials and a show of force by police forced farmers outside a south China provincial capital to abandon a planned protest Thursday, a rights group reported.
Farmers outside Changsha city blocked construction of a science park last month after the well-connected developer was three months late in paying them for their land, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement reported.
Authorities sent 700 regular and armed police to clear away the protesters in Tianmashan village on Sept.
22, and police arrested six farmers and beat more than 20, some severely, the Hong Kong-based group said.
It gave the following account: When more than 300 villagers marched on the Hunan provincial government the following day, officials agreed to provide compensation.
But the villagers were not satisfied, saying the rate was well below the market price, and they vowed to stage another protest Thursday, China's National Day.
Local officials threatened the villagers against staging the protest, saying the government ``was not made of bean curd,'' the Hong Kong-based group said.
An official with the city police department denied the report.
``Nothing like that happened in Changsha.
It's a rumor,'' said the official, who gave only his surname, Li.
China has been hit by hundreds of mostly small-scale protests over the past two years by farmers and workers upset over layoffs, government policies and perceived official indifference or corruption.
The Information Center said one of those connected to the science park development was the brother-in-law of Wang Maolin, Hunan's Communist Party secretary.
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here today that although deepening economic reform will cause certain pressure on employment, it will by no means touch off social unrest.
Li Boyong, a delegate to the on-going 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, said deepening reforms in state-owned enterprises will bring about certain pressure on employment in urban areas in China, but it is within the handling capacity of the society, and is far from touching off any social unrest.
Li, who is also minister of labor, quoted the report delivered by Jiang Zemin at the congress as saying, "With the deepening of enterprise reforms, technological progress and readjustment of the economic structure, it would be hard to avoid the flow of personnel and lay-off".
"But no such 'disastrous outcome' as predicted by some overseas figures will go off," Li emphasized.
As far as Li was concerned, the employment situation in China faces both challenges and opportunities.
Li explained that while the number of laid-off workers is to increase in the wake of further reforms in state businesses, rapid development in non-public sectors and joint stock partnership businesses, on the other hand, will undoubtedly offer more job opportunities.
The abundant labor resource in China, which totals 834 million in number, does pose quite a headache to the country's employment, he said.
Each year, there are 10 million more people seeking jobs in towns and cities.
Many of them come from surplus factory worker forces, which stand at a staggering 20 million.
In addition, approximately 130 million peasants have become idle in the rural areas, and may compete with urbanites for jobs.
However, Li said, the ongoing reemployment project has scored great achievements.
Each year from 1992 to 1996, the newly employed outnumbered the laid-offs by a margin of eight million, thus maintaining an annual unemployment rate in urban areas at about 3 percent throughout.
TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- China's stepped up bomber flights and naval maneuvers set off a dispute Wednesday between Taiwanese defense officials and experts on whether the moves were an attempt to intimidate Taiwan.
The news of the military activity detected by Taiwan's intelligent services made the front pages of the island's leading newspapers Wednesday, sending Taiwan's jittery stock market down 4.3 percent.
Military officials said the drills might be a prelude to threatening war games to intimidate the island as its new president, Chen Shui-bian, prepares to take office May 20.
Chen has said he has no plans to seek independence unless China attacks to force a reunification.
Sun Tao-yu, vice-minister of defense, doubted that the recent military maneuvers were unusual.
He said China holds exercises every spring because of good weather.
But Sun said the military had to inform the public ''to remind the people of the concept of national defense'' on the island that split with China 51 years ago amid civil war.
Ting Yu-chou, chairman of the National Security Bureau, said Taiwan's military ''was jumping to conclusions,'' the United Evening News reported.
Ting said the air drills were normal and there were no indications of large-scale ground exercises.
Lin Chong-pin, vice-chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council which handles Taiwan's China policy, said the maneuvers were part of the mainland's psychological warfare against the island.
Beijing repeatedly has threatened to attack if Taiwan refuses to reunify and declares independence.
Lin, an expert on China's People's Liberation Army, said Beijing was trying to intimidate Taiwan into starting reunification talks because Chinese leaders lack the confidence to act on their threats of an all-out war with the island.
War, Lin said, was unlikely because China's leaders fear war would bring social unrest, economic upheaval and threaten their hold on power.
China's leaders also realize that war with Taiwan would involve the United States, which has shown ''a more positive attitude'' toward the island despite its recognition of Beijing, Lin said.
Former military chief Hau Pei-tsun, who was visited by president-elect Chen, said that the drills ''looked like normal air force exercises''.
Chen in turn urged China to use peaceful methods to improve ties. ''We want peace, harmony, cooperation,'' he said .
The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July 28: In a step recalling Maoist political re-education campaigns, Beijing has sent 1,200 officials belonging to the Falun Gong spiritual movement to special schools to study Communist literature and recant their allegiance to the group.
That is disturbing behavior from a Chinese leadership that proclaims its commitment to economic reform and modernization and that signed the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights guaranteeing Chinese citizens free expression, assembly and religion.
The Falun Gong says it has no political agenda, but it has a popular exiled leader, tens of millions of followers and a remarkable ability to organize protests under the noses of China's omnipresent police.
Beijing at first treated it cautiously, but has now banned the movement, confiscated its literature and detained thousands of members in a crackdown said to be ordered by President Jiang Zemin.
Special factors may explain the vehemence of Beijing's moves against the Falun Gong.
Rapidly growing religious cults are particularly frightening to Chinese governments because of their historical role in sparking unrest.
New religious groups have grown in recent years as the discrediting of Communist ideology and the suppression of democracy movements have left a spiritual void.
The Falun Gong's emergence also coincides with economic strains.
Growth rates are falling and unemployment rising.
New reforms advocated by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji like slimming state enterprises and liberalizing trade threaten further dislocation.
None of this justifies the persecutions now under way.
For most of its followers, the Falun Gong is not about protest but traditional Chinese techniques of exercise, breathing and meditation believed to channel the body's spiritual energy.
Those who have attended protest rallies are simply exercising internationally recognized rights of association and expression for which they should not be punished or forced to submit to ideological training.
Beijing's repression may only deepen public disenchantment with the authorities, and could divert energies from carrying out needed economic reforms.
China cannot arrive at the modern future it wants by returning to the ideological monitoring and indoctrination methods of the past.
BEIJING (AP) _ Five hundred state factory workers, unpaid for four months, broke a police line Monday and marched in protest through an impoverished southwestern Chinese city, a rights group reported.
The workers demanded back pay and shouted slogans decrying waste and corruption by state factory managers as they marched through Dujiangyan in Sichuan province, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
Officials with the Chengdu city government, which oversees Dujiangyan, confirmed the protest but refused to provide details.
The Information Center gave the following account: At 11:30 a.m., 500 workers from the Min River Timber Machinery Factory gathered near a bridge in the city's center and began to march.
Dozens of police tried to block them from a main thoroughfare.
But the angry demonstrators pushed through and police did not try to use force to stop them.
Two trends converged in sparking the unrest, the third demonstration by angry workers in Dujiangyan in 13 months.
The city, a famous scenic spot in Sichuan's western foothills, 60 kilometers (35 miles) northwest of Chengdu, is home to many bankrupt state industries.
Throughout China, hundreds of protests have erupted as uncompetitive state industries founder on capitalist market reforms.
In the case of Min River Timber, the money-losing venture was serving a logging industry in severe decline after decades of unrestrained clear-cutting of forests.
Last week, the government imposed a ban on logging in western Sichuan to stop the environmental damage that compounded disastrous flooding this summer.
Workers from the 2,000-employee Min River Timber appealed many times to the Dujiangyan government about their owed wages, but never received a reply, the Information Center said.
&LR; WASHINGTON _ One year after saying China had improved its human rights record, the Clinton administration on Friday issued one of its harshest condemnations of Beijing to date and described some of the most serious human rights violations in a decade.
Released on the eve of Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright's departure for China, at a time when President Clinton has been criticized for being too easy on the government in Beijing, the State Department's annual report on rights said that the country's Communist leaders had broken their promises to adhere to international human rights conventions and instead decided last fall ``to nip in the bud'' attempts to form independent democratic parties.
The government also imprisoned several thousand political and religious dissidents, tortured prisoners, suppressed Chinese of minority faiths, especially Christians, and imposed new restrictions on the press, including the Internet, according to the report.
Added to a new Pentagon report this week that said China was continuing to be a military threat to Taiwan, the human rights document led Congress on Friday to raise new questions about the effectiveness of the administration's policies of engagement with China.
Last year's rather mild description of China's human rights policies provoked criticism that the administration was overreacting to minor improvements in the hope of removing the issue as an obstacle to trade.
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.
, said, ``There is a considerable indignation about the Chinese government's renewed human rights abuses, its proliferation of military technology and its threats to its neighbors''.
On Thursday, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution co-sponsored by Wellstone and Sen.
Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark.
, asking the administration to condemn China's human rights record at an upcoming U.N. meeting in Geneva.
``What's the hesitation of following up on this strong report with a strong condemnation _ unless commercial interests trump all other interests in this administration,'' Wellstone said.
The Clinton administration is unlikely to go along with that suggestion.
In a speech in San Francisco on Friday, President Clinton defended his administration's policy of engagement with China and suggested China was ``moving away from the rule of fear,' even though it was ``not yet rooted in the rule of law''.
Still, administration officials are worried that China is becoming a tinderbox.
``There is no question that the Chinese leadership is getting very nervous about dissidents and the opposition,'' said a senior official in the Clinton administration.
In presenting the report, Harold Hongju Koh, assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, said Ms.
Albright would discuss the report's finding with Chinese leaders when she travels there this weekend but cautioned that even the most ``robust'' dialogue would not necessarily lead to changes in Chinese behavior.
``I think it's a mistake to conclude that the human rights in China is entirely a function of what U.S. policy is,'' Koh said.
``The question here is, how can developments within China, which have led to greater economic freedom, and efforts at legal reform, which could bring about sweeping change, be pressed and pushed through a process of engagement''?
There was no immediate response by the Chinese government to the State Department report.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Clinton administration officials, scholars and leaders of human rights groups all agree that underlying the Chinese government's fears about social unrest is the downturn in the country's economy.
China's annual double-digit economic growth is a thing of the past, and Chinese leaders are worried that the growing ranks of the unemployed will join forces with political dissidents and angry farmers and create a situation beyond their control.
``They haven't had the growth they need to continue with their economic reforms,'' said a senior administration official involved in China policy.
``Their economy is flat.
Exports are flat and there is a real increase in labor unrest.
That's why the regime is very very anxious about political unrest''.
The report gave China high marks for continuing to open up the economy and thereby opening up society.
``Over all, average citizens go about their daily lives with more personal freedom than ever before: higher disposable income, looser economic controls, greater freedom of movement, increased access to outside sources of information, greater room for individual choice, and more diversity in cultural life,'' it said.
But it went on to say that economic reform has not brought political freedom and that Chinese who try to dissent ``live in an environment filled with repression''.
Edward Friedman, a China scholar at the University of Wisconsin, said, ``The hard-liners in the Chinese government are increasingly in control and the economic liberalizers have to be more circumspect''.
In recent years the Chinese earned praise from the administration for signing two major international conventions on economic, cultural, civil and political rights that include guarantees of the freedom of association, speech, assembly and religion.
China's leaders have said they would respect the spirit of the law until the national legislature ratified the treaties, a promise they broke with this year's violations.
``There has been a complete disparity in the commitments China has made by signing the various treaties and their practice of flagrantly violating their citizens' rights,'' said Mike Jendrzejczyk of Human Rights Watch.
The Pentagon's report to Congress on the military balance between China and Taiwan highlighted how Beijing's deployment of short range missiles aimed at the Taiwan Straits was meant to intimidate and threaten Taiwan.
While the report said there have been no recent increases in the number of missiles targeted at Taiwan in the past year, it added that China's plans to increase its cruise and ballistic missiles to attain an ``overwhelming advantage'' over Taiwan by the year 2005.
Congressional concerns over tensions between China and Taiwan as well as tensions between China and its southeast Asian neighbors over the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea have added to the overall deterioration in relations between China and the United States.
Those issues, as well as the ongoing repression in Tibet, will be discussed by Ms.
Albright in China next week in preparation for the visit by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to Washington in April.
Moreover, in the coming months a series of anniversaries in China could spark unrest that might further test the leadership's tolerance of dissent.
June 4 is the 10th anniversary of the military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, and on Oct.
1 the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
``China as well as the Chinese are very anniversary conscious, and the leaders will definitely want to avoid unofficial demonstrations,'' Jendrzejczyk said.
``A leadership that's already focused on stability has become obsessed by it.''
HONG KONG _ Even before China regained sovereignty over this former British colony 16 months ago, authorities began to remove the face of Queen Elizabeth II from stamps, redesign the flag and repaint royal-crested mailboxes.
Yet today, one of the most obvious signs of British rule remains.
Emblazoned in huge letters on the local headquarters of China's People's Liberation Army is a strikingly inappropriate name: the Prince of Wales Building.
Before the 1997 handover, pundits predicted that China would rip the letters from the harborside tower as soon as People's Liberation Army troops arrived.
The troops are here, but the name remains on the barracks.
China's decision to leave it there seems a deliberate move to remain as discreet as possible.
And for good reason.
Here in Hong Kong, where one in six people marched to protest the 1989 crackdown on democracy protesters around Beijing's Tiananmen Square, distrust of the Chinese soldiers ran deep.
Half of Hong Kong's residents are refugees from China or descendants of refugees, and many worried that the new government might use troops to curtail their liberties.
But so far, doomsayers' predictions have fallen flat.
Far from cracking down on demonstrators, the People's Liberation Army has become all but invisible here.
``They have been told to lie low, stay in their barracks, not to mingle with the public, and for this they were rewarded with medals and citations when Jiang Zemin visited on the anniversary of the handover,'' said Willy Lam, China editor of the daily South China Morning Post.
``They were rewarded for doing nothing, for staying out of trouble''.
Aware of the People's Liberation Army image problem, China has kept its armed forces so low-profile that some Hong Kong residents now want to see more of them.
The growing, if guarded, trust in the soldiers here reflects the growth of Hong Kong's confidence in China's promise to let the capitalist enclave maintain civil liberties that are unavailable on the mainland.
Nonetheless, military analysts warn that if massive social unrest were to grip Hong Kong, something hard to imagine under current conditions, the People's Liberation Army would undoubtedly act in the event that Hong Kong's 27,500 police officers could not handle the situation, or if they refused to move against the local people.
The primary role of the estimated 4,700 troops here and 5,300 across the Chinese border ``is to create a degree of good will or trust to convince Hong Kong that they have nothing to fear from the handover, that being part of China is not going to impinge on their lives,'' said Ronald Montaperto, a Chinese security specialist at National Defense University in Washington.
So far, that mission appears to have succeeded.
A survey by Chinese University of Hong Kong found that the percentage of people satisfied with the People's Liberation Army has risen from 30 percent in July 1997 to more than 50 percent this past June.
They are people like Leo Tang, a 17-year-old student who visited the naval barracks recently.
``We all know of Tiananmen Square, so I wondered if they would act the same way here if there were protests,'' Tang said.
``But it seems China has gone out of its way to choose a special group of soldiers here''.
According to a poll by the University of Hong Kong, as approval of the People's Liberation Army grew, satisfaction with the Hong Kong police has dropped, from 79 percent a year ago to 66 percent.
On the few occasions when demonstrators have denounced China or rallied for banned causes such as independence for Taiwan, it has been the police who have drowned out slogans with loud music or hauled protesters to the station.
In contrast, soldiers have been restricted to barracks except for rare field trips in civilian clothes.
Ironically, their absence from bars and restaurants that depended on the patronage of British troops has aroused complaints from pub owners who a year ago worried that Chinese troops might intimidate customers.
Even official business has been kept almost comically low-profile.
When the US Navy invited top Chinese officers onboard the visiting USS Blue Ridge, the Chinese were concerned about boarding the ship because they would have to walk through a busy shopping mall.
To avoid alarming civilians by marching through a public area in uniform, the Chinese asked US officials to devise a route to enter as unobtrusively as possible _ via a parking garage.
According to law, the People's Liberation Army can assist authorities in a crisis _ a natural disaster or unrest _ but only if requested by Hong Kong's Chief Executive and approved by Beijing.
It is hard to imagine social unrest extreme enough to destabilize Hong Kong.
But Tai Ming Cheung, a People's Liberation Army specialist, cautioned, ``If you asked me in 1988 if they'd have any reason to intervene on the mainland, I would have said no.
But in 1989, they did''.
So far, controversies involving the army here have been small-scale: a dispute over customs checks, a few traffic accidents, and a misunderstanding over nighttime firing practice in villages in rural Hong Kong.
The People's Liberation Army remains secretive, however.
It set up a telephone line for the media that goes unanswered, and it ignores interview requests.
Democratic politicians say that the army should be more open and have more contact with society because soldiers who befriend locals would hesitate to act against them.
Yet mixing with locals would be difficult on a soldier's salary of $66 a month.
That is hardly enough for dinner for two in Hong Kong.
So contact has been limited to posing with locals for pictures.
The most startling exception occurred during a bizarre Open House at the barracks on National Day, Oct.
1. Thousands of curious locals stood in line for hours to get tickets, and the atmosphere resembled a family picnic more than a military tour.
Parents pressed babies up for photos with soldiers.
Officers sang, danced, showed how they make beds.
``Before this...
they seemed so severe and fierce.
Now I'm changing my opinion.
They're quite friendly, singing and dancing,'' said Kwok Yuk-may, a 43-year-old housewife who joined in karaoke with soldiers.
``Why should we be afraid of them?
We're all Chinese.''
"Some people thought that the Falun Gong cult had no organizations and political programs.
But now, we have seen very clearly its political motives," said Chi Xuezhi, president of the provincial Academy of Social Sciences.
Li Hongzhi's "doomsday" remarks, filled with strong anti- society and anti-government connotations, were aimed at causing social unrest and molding public opinion for his political ambitions, said Xu Ningsheng, a professor at Zhongshan University in south China's Guangdong Province.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, April 7: Reports are only now reaching the United States of serious unrest in the northeast Chinese mining city of Yangjiazhangzi almost six weeks ago.
An account in The Washington Post this week described three days of violent rioting over job cuts and corruption that overwhelmed local police forces and continued until regular army troops arrived.
This is just the kind of social upheaval that terrifies the leadership in Beijing, who well know that protests by disenchanted citizens could someday escalate again into a serious threat to Communist rule.
Hundreds of economic protests, some of them violent, have erupted across China in recent years, rarely, if ever reported in the Chinese news media.
The Yangjiazhangzi events were unusually unruly, but worker and peasant protests have become increasingly frequent.
Market reforms like the privatization of large state companies produce unemployment and social dislocation.
When this takes place in an atmosphere of pervasive government corruption, popular anger is understandable.
Unless Beijing enforces higher ethical standards on local officials, unrest could soon become even more widespread.
State companies are scheduled to lay off more than 10 million workers before the end of this year.
Anger over alleged corruption seems to have played a major role in Yangjiazhangzi.
Miners, a formidable protest group in many societies, were already aggrieved over economic issues.
A large state-owned molybdenum mine there stopped issuing paychecks early last year.
Last November, most of the mine was shut down, but some of its facilities and equipment were apparently transferred to new private owners alleged to be friends of local officials.
What detonated the violence was the belated announcement of an extremely modest severance package for the laid-off workers.
The contrast between what looked like an undeserved windfall for the well connected and the shabby treatment of longtime employees became even more of an affront when mine authorities refused to show up at a peaceful protest meeting.
For several years now, Communist leaders in Beijing have seemed haunted by fears of explosive social unrest.
Their answer has generally been repression, along with strident nationalist campaigns designed to distract the country's attention from economic grievances.
Instead, Beijing should crack down on the corruption that has grown worse with the progress of economic reform.
Show trials of a few spectacularly corrupt individuals have not been enough to discourage others on the take.
Market reforms have benefited China and brightened economic prospects for many of its workers and peasants.
But the current phase of selling off state factories and mines is creating hardships for many longtime employees.
When they see local party officials drawing illicit profits from their sacrifices, they are sure to protest.
Beijing should heed the message from Yangjiazhangzi. &QL;
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Duan Zhengkun, vice-minister of justice, was elected president of the All-China Association of People's Mediators here today at the national congress of the association.
The ACAPM, founded in 1993, is a national organization for mediators of civil disputes.
BEIJING _ The Chinese government on Sunday night announced sweeping increases in salaries, pensions and welfare payments for 84 million people, describing the move as a birthday gift as the country prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.
Officials clearly hope the raises will help their attack, as yet futile, on a stubborn case of deflation that is holding down economic growth.
Insecure about their financial prospects, consumers are saving rather than spending and the retail price index has declined for some 22 months.
The pay increases, which are generally in the range of 15 percent to 30 percent and are retroactive to July 1, will go to workers and retirees in government offices, schools and other state-funded facilities.
In addition, monthly subsidies to millions of unemployed workers and urban poor people will increase by an average of 30 percent, according to the announcement on national television news Sunday night.
As for beleaguered state-owned enterprises, the announcement said they must decide on wages ``according to their efficiency''.
The announcement was not a surprise because officials have publicly said in recent weeks that a raise was in store.
The raise will cost the government more than $6 billion for the second half of this year, said the finance minister, Xiang Huicheng, in a television interview Sunday night.
The average increase for public workers will be only $15 a month, officials said.
Many senior bureaucrats and college professors earn little more than $100 a month in cash salary, plus bonuses and other benefits.
At the same time, many workers face rising rents as the government tries to reduce housing subsidies and create a commercial housing market.
Growth in the first half of this year is said to be 7.6 percent, just under last year's annual rate, but many experts say these figures are significantly overstated.
Slowed growth and rising unemployment in the last two years have contributed to social unrest.
In another effort to goad people into spending more, the government said last week that it would begin taxing the interest earned on personal savings accounts.
Many Chinese are not accustomed to paying income tax and that measure was greeted by much grumbling.
The government is also continuing to issue bonds for infrastructure projects, but as it runs out of options it may also have to consider devaluation of the yuan in the coming year to get the needed economic jolt, some foreign economists say.
In the interview Sunday night, Xiang, the finance minister, said he hoped that the raises would stimulate consumption and help to reduce the growing ``irregularities'' in salaries _ a reference to the huge gulf in compensation between middle- and upper-level civil servants and people in the growing private sector.
Asked whether the raises had been timed with the Oct.
1 anniversary in mind, Xiang replied, ``Yes, of course.
The 50th anniversary is a time when all of China is celebrating.''
BEIJING (AP) _ Farmers upset over high government taxes drove their tractors into an eastern Chinese city to block traffic in protest, a Hong Kong-based rights group reported Wednesday.
The demonstration Tuesday in Bengbu marked the latest outburst of discontent by farmers and workers who feel harmed by China's capitalist-style reforms and neglected by an indifferent or corrupt officialdom.
About 100 farmers from Mopanzhang village outside Bengbu pulled their tractors in front of the city's government office building Tuesday morning, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
One unidentified demonstrator told the rights group that the government had raised taxes and fees despite an appeal by China's legislature in March ``to reduce the peasants' burdens''.
Large numbers of police were sent to the scene and the farmers agreed to leave peacefully around noontime after meeting with a city official to discuss their grievances, the rights group said.
A spokesman for Bengbu's police department refused to comment on the demonstration.
Farmers and workers were once treated as protected, revolutionary classes by the ruling Communist Party.
Their current disaffection threatens to further undermine the party's tattered legitimacy and poses a challenge to its continued rule.
BEIJING (AP) _ China's villages must be run more openly and democratically, top government and Communist Party leaders say in a new order sent to rural communities, state media reported Thursday.
The circular says village leaders can no longer make decisions in secret about spending public money for development projects, leasing out farm land, birth control and distribution of relief funds.
Democratic and open village government is needed to improve relations between the ruling Communist party and the people and to promote rural development and stability, according to the new order, which was issued by the party's policy-making Central Committee and the State Council, the highest government body.
China has had a national law establishing elections at the village level since 1987.
The Ministry of Civil Affairs has promoted secret ballots, candidate speeches and fair election procedures throughout the country.
But the new order suggested that elections alone have not guaranteed that villages run their affairs democratically or have been able to rid themselves of local bullies.
It also showed that the central government wants to ensure that the countryside does not erupt in unrest.
The order was played prominently on the front page of the People's Daily, the main newspaper of the Communist Party.
Rural people, who make up 70 percent of China's 1.2 billion people, are the Communist Party's ``reliable force'' and ``the broadest and deepest mass base for political power in our country,'' the government's order said.
It called for several specific improvements in how China's 1 million villages are run.
Each village must post a report about village affairs at least every three months.
Villagers also are supposed to keep tabs on their leaders by forming congresses of all village residents or representatives.
Leaders should make decisions based on the majority's views, the order says.
Officials also are ordered to make public their own salaries and performance reviews.
The order also warns that vote buying is illegal.
``Malpractice by a few officials acting willfully regardless of the villagers' wishes must be corrected resolutely,'' it said.
BEIJING (AP) _ Several thousand taxi drivers angered by new government fees protested outside city offices, paralyzing part of a Chinese provincial capital for three days last week.
All but a few hundred of Shijiazhuang's 4,000 taxi drivers walked off the job Wednesday night, and by 9 a.m.
Thursday 1,000 striking cabbies had mobbed entrances and streets around the city government office, a human rights group said Sunday.
Hundreds of police tried to get the protesters to stop blocking the streets, and the angry strikers attacked cabbies who did not join in the strike, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
A plan announced last month to stop issuing new taxi operating licenses and to raise registration fees in Shijiazhuang _ capital of Hebei province, 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of Beijing _ provoked the strike, said the Information Center.
Protests and sporadic attacks on strike-breakers continued until city officials agreed Saturday afternoon to put off the new policy, said the Information Center and an official in the Hebei propaganda office, who gave only his surname, Wang.
While the Information Center reported that 3,000 taxi drivers went on strike, the official would say only that several thousand took part.
He added that there were no arrests.
BEIJING _ In late 1997, President Jiang Zemin announced that China would cut the People's Liberation Army, then 3 million strong, by half a million troops as part of China's drive for a leaner, more advanced military that could both defend the homeland and reinforce China's image as a power in Asia.
What the president did not say was that as the army shrank, another, more secretive branch of the military, dedicated to internal stability, was already expanding.
At the very time of Jiang's speech, it was absorbing 14 army divisions, or more than 100,000 troops.
The expansion of the People's Armed Police, a national force trained in riot control, reflects the leaders' growing preoccupation with domestic unrest.
It also reflects their wish to avoid having to resort to army combat troops to quell popular demonstrations, as occurred in 1989 around Tiananmen Square with disastrously bloody results.
Over the last year, according to witnesses and other accounts, armed police units were called out to help the ordinary police contain many of the hundreds of demonstrations and protests reported around China.
The armed police have also battled ethnic separatists in the heavily Muslim province of Xinjiang, and have long been used to help control Tibet.
The protests bubbling up around China, almost always centered on economic complaints, have generally been small, and dispersed peacefully.
But with urban unemployment soaring and farmers restive over high taxes and corruption, Jiang has proclaimed domestic stability as this year's No.
1 priority.
And he apparently looks to the force he has built up _ now 1 million strong, Western analysts say _ to keep any unrest from getting out of hand.
``As a major force for maintaining state security and social stability, the People's Armed Police shoulders a massive and formidable burden,'' he said on a visit to an armed police barracks in Beijing last month.
Last year, two China experts from the U.S. military stated the force's purpose even more baldly.
``By increasing the size of the People's Armed Police, the leadership in Beijing implicitly acknowledges that internal unrest is a greater threat to the regime's survival and Chinese economic modernization than is foreign invasion,'' said John F.
Corbett Jr.
, an American officer, and Dennis J.
Blasko, writing in China Strategic Review, a journal published in Washington.
Corbett, who works in the Pentagon, and Blasko, now a consultant, both previously served as military attaches in Beijing.
Officers of the People's Armed Police, which was formed in the early 1980s from a combination of army and public security units, declined to be interviewed.
Like Western riot policemen, the People's Armed Police officers are supposed to control demonstrations with minimal violence _ preferably with intimidation, shields and sometimes tear gas, although they carry guns and have heavier weapons.
The expansion and upgrading of the force accelerated after 1989, when it may have numbered about 600,000.
That year, the armed police's failure to disperse student demonstrators in Beijing forced the leaders to call in combat units, which killed hundreds of civilians and did lasting damage to China's image as well as to army morale.
Civilian police sometimes carry weapons too, but operate under command of the Public Security Ministry rather than the military, as most People's Armed Police units do.
The army has been only too happy to shed an unpopular mission for its regular forces.
Freed from worry about crowd control, which requires entirely different skills and equipment, the People's Liberation Army ``can concentrate on becoming a modern, externally oriented force,'' said David Shambaugh, a China expert at George Washington University and the Brookings Institution in Washington.
The expansion of the armed police may also give Jiang, who had no military experience, an important personal base of power, outside experts believe.
Deployments of the armed police to quell unrest are rarely announced, but there is evidence that they have been in action numerous times around China in the past year.
State news media often portray the armed police in more benign roles _ like working alongside regular soldiers to pile sandbags during last summer's record floods.
But in January, 9,000 armed police were sent to help existing forces ranged against a violent separatist movement in the western province of Xinjiang.
In rural Hunan in January, hundreds of armed police officers dispersed a crowd of many thousands of angry farmers by lobbing tear-gas grenades and charging with clubs, villagers said.
One man was killed by an exploding gas grenade and dozens were injured.
Most demonstrations have ended peacefully.
But Western analysts question whether the People's Armed Police would be up to its job in the event of large-scale unrest, particularly if the job of controlling it falls to the underequipped, poorly trained units deployed in areas far from big cities like Beijing and Shanghai.
``The question now is whether the People's Armed Police is up to the task,'' said a Western analyst who has closely studied the armed police, and spoke on condition of anonymity.
``Because of a limited budget and long-term quality and management problems, i's still debatable whether they can perform well in a major crisis''.
(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn In Beijing, armed police officers guard embassies and constantly patrol Tiananmen Square.
Other armed police units are involved in border defense, and guarding power plants and important sites like gold mines.
But some 730,000 of the 1 million armed police are primarily charged with maintaining public order, according to the latest estimate by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
Since the 1989 debacle, numerous army units have transferred to the armed police, mostly the lowest-ranking infantry and artillery divisions.
``They were the dregs'' of the army, said James Mulvenon, a military expert with Rand Corp.
in Washington, of the 14 divisions shifted in 1997.
It is unclear how much training and support these transfers and new recruits have received for their increasingly delicate role.
``I don't see much evidence'' that the People's Armed Police ``has really improved its operational capabilities very much since 1989,'' Mulvenon said.
In the mid-1990s, in an apparent effort to improve management and training, control of most units was shifted from the Ministry of Public Security to the Central Military Commission.
The top officers have been drawn from the People's Liberation Army.
But outside experts believe that command is relatively decentralized, and that provincial political leaders have considerable say over how the armed police troops are used.
As with the regular army, corruption and extensive involvement in outside businesses have weakened many units, and the armed police have been ordered to relinquish business activities.
The armed police were already chronically underfunded, Mulvenon said, in part because they must draw money from several different sources that have no control over their operations.
The costs are shared among provincial governments, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and Public Security Ministry, among others.
BEIJING _ China intensified its offensive against the Buddhist Law spiritual movement Thursday, announcing a ban on the organization and unleashing a barrage of charges against its founder that revealed how seriously the government takes the sect as a challenge to its rule.
The government's ban on the group, known in Chinese as Falun Gong, had been rumored since the police rounded up more than 100 leaders of the sect in several Chinese cities earlier this week.
But the ferocity of Beijing's campaign, aimed at a group of mainly middle-aged people who practice a form of Chinese breathing exercises and meditation, suggests that it regards Falun Gong as more than a movement of physical and moral uplift.
At a time when China's economy is slowing and social unrest is rising, officials here view this amorphous but fast-growing sect as a dangerous political force.
After Beijing handed down its edict Thursday afternoon, it began an extraordinary public-relations assault on the group and its founder, Li Hongzhi, through state-run television and newspapers.
The Ministry of Civil Affairs accused Falun Gong of ``inciting and creating disturbances, and jeopardizing social stability''.
In an editorial scheduled for publication on Friday, the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily said Li was pursuing a hidden political agenda that posed a ``massive threat'' to Chinese society.
State media also accused Li of misleading followers about his birth date, so that he could claim to be a reincarnation of Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism and of accepting payments for supposedly miraculous cures.
Li, 48, a former grain bureau clerk who left China for the United States last year, fashioned his sect from an eclectic blend of traditional breathing exercises, as well as elements of Buddhism and Taoism.
His followers say they disavow politics and embrace Li's teachings for their physical and spiritual health.
But Falun Gong deeply unsettled China's rulers when 10,000 of its adherents materialized on April 25 in front of the compound that houses President Jiang Zemin and other leaders.
The rally, held to demand official recognition for the group, demonstrated that this obscure spiritual sect was in fact a highly organized movement with an international network capable of mobilizing thousands of people and putting them under the noses of China's top leaders without a whisper of warning.
As word of the detentions spread this week, thousands of Falun Gong followers massed in front of government offices in Dalian, Guangzhou and 28 other cities to protest the government's crackdown, according to members of the group and a human rights organization in Hong Kong.
The wall-to-wall coverage of the ban in the state-run media underscores that the government is determined to stamp out Falun Gong.
But with a large and rapidly growing membership _ estimates range from the government's figure of 2 million to the group's claim of 100 million followers worldwide _ a fluid structure, and an appreciation of the power of the Internet to pass information, Falun Gong could prove an elusive quarry for Beijing.
``I think this is going to make us stronger,'' said Sophie Xiao, a spokeswoman for Falun Gong in Hong Kong.
``People are not simple-minded.
Educated people will hear about this group and check it out''.
There were no reports of protests following Thursday's announcement.
Late Thursday afternoon, hundreds of police and troops still circled Zhongnanhai, the leaders' compound, which has been a fortress since the crackdown began on Monday night.
The police continued to stop traffic on the western edge of the complex, where Falun Gong members held their rally in April.
A former Chinese official said police in Beijing had released several hundred people _ most of them women _ who had been detained as they massed near Zhongnanhai on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Chinese officials were clearly concerned about how the ban would be received abroad.
Shortly before the announcement was made public, a high-ranking government official briefed foreign correspondents here on why the government felt it necessary to take such Draconian action.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Beijing had moved against Falun Gong because of ``the danger it posed to our country and our people.
Any responsible government would do the same''.
He said members of the group had harassed government offices and pro-Beijing news organizations.
And he said the government had evidence that Li had been in Beijing for the three days prior to the April rally in front of Zhongnanhai.
Li, he said, had been instrumental in planning it.
The strident tone and sheer volume of the denunciations of Falun Gong baffled some experts in Chinese politics.
Why, they asked, would the government pour so much energy into fighting a group which, by its estimates, has 2 million members _ far fewer than the 100 million the group claims?
``After all, a few months ago hardly anyone had heard of it, and no one was saying it was a threat to the state,'' said one political scholar in Beijing, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``I think the party leaders felt personally insulted by the Falun Gong protest.
It made them look like fools''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) A former government official said Thursday that the unexpected demonstration last April particularly unnerved Jiang.
In briefings with government officials earlier this week, this person said, a senior leader quoted Jiang as harshly criticizing Li and the movement.
Experts said there were plenty of reasons for Beijing to worry about this kind of group.
With its mixture of martial arts and mysticism, Falun Gong appeals to people who have felt adrift since Deng Xioaping began reforming the Chinese economy and relaxing social controls in 1979.
Popular groups like Falun Gong played a profoundly disruptive role in the final decades of the last imperial dynasty.
And as the communist government approaches the 50th anniversary of its rule, on Oct.
1, China's economic engine is sputtering.
With China embarking on an ambitious campaign to overhaul its state sector _ one that has already resulting in huge layoffs _ Beijing is bracing itself for widespread unrest.
Signs that the government may feel vulnerable abounded in the flood of official denunciations Thursday.
``We must fully recognize the massive threat that the rampant spread of the Falun Gong organization is to the party, government, and people,'' said the editorial prepared for Friday's People's Daily.
In a 70-minute documentary that has been rerun almost nonstop Thursday on state television, Falun Gong was portrayed as a pernicious cult that leads members to mental instability, madness, even murder.
BEIJING (AP) _ Several hundred disgruntled residents staged protests Wednesday in Xi'an, the Chinese city famed for its terracotta warriors that will be President Clinton's first stop in China later this month, according to a Hong Kong-based human rights group.
The peaceful demonstrations by two groups with different grievances against the government began Tuesday morning.
A group of about 150 people were protesting the government's failure to allocate them new housing after they were evicted from their homes for redevelopment, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
They were soon joined by some 200 pedicab drivers protesting the city's decision ahead of Clinton's June 25-26 visit not to allow them to work as taxi drivers, the group said.
Many of the pedicab drivers are disabled and depend on their jobs hauling passengers and small loads of furniture and other goods for their livelihood.
Police did not intervene, and the demonstrators dispersed at about 6 p.m.
Tuesday. They resumed their protest Wednesday morning, the human rights center said.
Xi'an police and government officials denied that any protests had occurred, although they confirmed that the city had prohibited pedicab owners from hiring out their vehicles.
Xi'an, a grimy industrial city that was once the imperial capital on China's Silk Road, has been the site of several protests in recent months.
The Hong Kong-based group reported last week that police in Xi'an had beaten one of the thousands of onlookers watching a sit-in on June 2 by 200 workers from the No.
1 Construction Co.
who were protesting layoffs.
The demonstrations are the latest in steady outbursts of unrest as reform-minded Chinese leaders allow bankrupt state industries to lay off millions of workers.
In cities throughout China, many of the unemployed have taken to driving taxis and pedicabs to make ends meet.
In May, some 500 taxi drivers surrounded Xi'an government offices to protest licensing fees they believed were unfair.

BEIJING _ Dealing out the fourth lengthy prison term to political dissenters in a week, China Sunday convicted a man for ``providing intelligence to hostile foreign organizations'' because he gave an interview about farmer protests to the U.S.-financed Radio Free Asia, a human rights group said.
After an unusual Sunday trial in the southern province of Hunan that lasted less than three hours, the defendant, Zhang Shanguang, 42, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, according to the group Human Rights in China, based in New York.
Zhang previously spent seven years in prison for organizing an independent labor union in 1989.
This year, before his detention in July, he had formed a group to protect laid-off workers and tried to register it with local officials.
Chinese authorities, fearing social unrest at a time of rising unemployment, appear to be especially fearful of any labor organizations outside Communist Party control, and of any efforts to link up disaffected workers with democracy campaigners.
Earlier this week, as part of the most severe crackdown on dissidents here in two years, three longtime activists who promoted a new China Democracy Party, Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai, were convicted on subversion charges and given sentences of 11 to 13 years.
At his brief trial Sunday in Huaihua City, Hunan, Zhang was charged with ``illegally providing intelligence to hostile foreign organizations and persons,'' according to his lawyer and relatives.
The indictment specifically named a telephone interview Zhang gave last March to Radio Free Asia in which he discussed a protest against high taxes by 70 to 80 farmers in one Hunan county, and another incident in which a farmer who refused to pay a tax was killed.
Numerous such farmer protests have been reported around the country in recent years and top national leaders have spoken out against high, unfair burdens put on peasants by local and county governments.
Radio Free Asia, which was set up in 1996 and receives all of its funds from Congress, broadcasts news and other programs into China from transmitters in Central Asia and the Pacific.
The Chinese government sees the network as hostile and tries, with some success, to jam the broadcasts, which often emphasize democracy-related subjects that are banned in the national media.
``We deeply regret this action,'' said Daniel Southerland, executive editor of Radio Free Asia, speaking by telephone from Washington Sunday.
In the March interview, Southerland said, journalists called Zhang to verify reports of the farmer protests and ``he didn't say anything that wasn't widely known _ certainly it wasn't national security information''.
``If they want to do someone in like this, they can always find an excuse,'' Southerland said.
Radio Free Asia, which broadcasts in native languages to eight countries where news is censored, frequently quotes Chinese residents on its programs, though does not use names when it appears the speaker would be endangered.
Reeling from the recent trials, China's remaining dissidents are now waiting to see if the government will stop with the jailing of a few leaders or continue on with more arrests.
In general, only those who have been actively involved in organizing the new political party or independent worker groups have been imprisoned for any length of time.
In contrast to earlier decades, Chinese people today are fairly free to voice dissenting opinions in private _ so long as they do not act on them.
In two recent speeches, widely publicized by the official media, President and Communist Party Chief Jiang Zemin stressed the overriding importance of protecting social stability and said that any threats to the supremacy of the Communist Party would be ``annihilated in the early stages''.
Western governments as well as democracy advocates here had hoped that China's signing this year of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which calls for free speech and assembly, would lead to a softening of political controls.
But in recent weeks the government has made it clear that any actions perceived to imperil Communist Party rule will be defined as threats to national security _ and therefore outside the purview of the global treaty and other human rights conventions.
BEIJING (AP) _ Workers from a state-run cement factory surrounded government offices in central China for five days to protest a plan to privatize their plant, a rights group reported Monday.
All 600 workers at the Luoyang Cement Products Factory fear a cheap sale of both state assets and their future, the New York-based Human Rights in China reported.
About 200 workers besieged city government offices in Luoyang, in Henan province, from Monday to Friday last week demanding that approval of the sale to a private company be reversed, the group said.
Confirming the demonstrations, an official in charge of economic planning for Luoyang said the protesters dispersed after the government pledged to look into the workers' concerns.
No one was arrested or hurt, said the official with the city's Economic and Trade Commission, who only gave his surname, Pan.
Small-scale demonstrations have become almost daily occurrences in many Chinese cities as workers, the unemployed, farmers and pensioners feel they are losing out to market reforms and being abandoned by an indifferent or corrupt officialdom.
The contentious sale of the Luoyang cement factory underscores the dangers facing Beijing a year into its ambitious three-year plan to reform the largely inefficient, virtually bankrupt state sector.
Local officials have been quick to sell the best state assets, in some cases steering them to cronies.
Unrest among workers _ long used to the cradle-to-grave services of central planning _ has sharpened.
Human Rights in China said the protesters believed that the privatization plan would leave them without jobs and pensions.
They also contended that the plant was one of the city's top 100 taxpayers as recently as 1996, with 200 million yuan (dlrs 24.2 million) in assets.
But the city agreed to sell the factory for 2 million yuan (dlrs 242,000) to the private Zhongtai Company, Human Rights in China said.
Mr. Pan of the Luoyang Economic and Trade Commission said the sale will be put on hold until all concerns are settled.
BEIJING (AP) -- China will raise stipends to unemployed workers by 30 percent as part of a series of measures intended to arrest the economic slide and brighten public sentiment ahead of the country's 50th anniversary of communist rule.
Labor and Social Security Minister Zhang Zuoji promised that increased payments would begin before the Oct.
1 anniversary.
Pensions are also to be raised by varying degrees, Zhang told the executive committee of China's legislature, according to state media.
The announcements were made as Beijing prepared its second large-scale rehearsal of the planned Oct.
1 parade and performance by a half-million people on Tiananmen Square.
Police closed off streets leading to the square late Saturday, and buses brought in students and others for the practice session.
Unemployment has soared as once centrally planned industries trim bloated payrolls to cope with free-market reforms.
With millions of Chinese trying to survive on meager stipends, the communist leadership has worried about the potential for unrest.
Zhang told the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress that more than 7.4 million urban workers lost their jobs in the first half of the year, and 5.4 million of them have not found new work.
Prices have fallen for 22 months in a row, unaffected by interest rate cuts that have failed to ignite consumer spending.
Before the welfare increases, the average jobless worker received a $20 stipend and another $10 for life, medical and unemployment insurance, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
But Zhang said 300,000 workers laid off this year never received their stipends.
He noted that many local governments had been unable to collect sufficient revenues to cover the payments.
The government also has announced a 30 to 40 percent pay increase for civil servants, and halved a tax on fixed-asset investments.
BEIJING (AP) -- Seven million Chinese workers will lose their jobs in state factories as China pushes ahead with reforms of the debt-ridden government-run industrial sector, a Chinese newspaper reported Tuesday.
Vice Minister of Labor and Social Security Wang Jianlun said the government would limit layoffs to 7 million, or 1 million people fewer than last year, the China Daily said.
In order to reform its state factories, China needs to lay off even more workers.
Government leaders, however, have warned the layoffs must be restricted to prevent unrest.
The government expects to spend 24.5 billion yuan ($3 billion) to retrain and provide stipends for laid-off workers this year, Wang said.
Workers who lose jobs in China's state-owned factories get monthly allowances of 140 yuan to 380 yuan ($17 to $46) when they enroll at training centers, the report said.
The allowances are paid by the government, an unemployment insurance fund and the state factories.
Wang acknowledged that some of the troubled factories had been failing to pay pensions.
He said the government would ensure at least 50 percent of the pensions owed would be paid by the end of the year.
February 26,1989 -- Stability is an overriding issue among China's problems, Deng Xiaoping pointed out while meeting with the then U.S.
President George Bush.
on April 15, Hu Yaobang passed away.
Various mourning activities were held by people and students.
But, a small number of people took advantage of this to spread rumors, attacking the Party and state leaders, inciting the people to oppose the leadership of the Party and the socialist system.
The People's Daily, the organ of the CPC Central Committee, carried an editorial saying that there must be a clear-cut stand against unrest on April 26.
That unrest developed into turmoil because of the support and connivance of Zhao Ziyang.
The so-called "Federation of Autonomous Student Unions", an illegal student organization, urged its supporters to stage a hunger strike in Tian'anmen Square beginning on May 13.
The State Council decided to declare a martial law in parts of Beijing starting from May 20.
However, the organizers of the unrest and those scheming in the background took advantage of the restraints of the government and troops, and went about organizing various illegal activities which led to a counter revolutionary rebellion.
The State Council repealed martial law conditions on parts of Beijing on January 11, 1990.
On May 16, 1989, Sino-Soviet relations were normalized according to an announcement made by Deng Xiaoping during his meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev, the then president of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and the then general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party.
BEIJING (AP) -- A shortage of tear gas and rubber bullets forced China's military to open fire 10 years ago on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, a former top Communist Party member said Friday.
Keeping to the party's official version of the controversial 1989 melee, Zhu Muzhi said troops were justified in firing on ``thugs'' who killed soldiers and threw rocks and gas bombs.
But he acknowledged that ``innocent'' people were also killed in the crackdown on democracy advocates.
Zhu suggested that with better anti-riot equipment and more experience in dealing with civil unrest, the Chinese government might have avoided heavy loss of life.
``We never imagined there would be such an incident, that so many thugs would surround and beat the People's Liberation Army,'' Zhu, then a member of an advisory commission of party elders, told reporters.
``The police at the time had no rubber bullets, no tear gas canisters, they had nothing.
In the end, the only weapon they had at hand was guns''.
In the assault, ``many people on the streets who were watching the goings-on possibly were hit by flying bullets.
They, in fact, were innocent,'' said Zhu, who now heads a government-backed society for human rights studies.
Hundreds were killed when Chinese troops shot their way through Beijing on June 4, 1989, to quell seven weeks of peaceful protests in Tiananmen Square calling for democratic reform.
The government said the protests were an anti-government rebellion that needed to be put down with force.
It has never given a credible account of the number of dead and injured, or of the thousands imprisoned in the wave of arrests that followed.
With the 10th anniversary of the protest movement drawing near, Chinese authorities are particularly nervous about any attempts at public commemoration.
A witness to the crackdown disputed Zhu's claim that police lacked riot gear.
Robin Munro, formerly with Human Rights Watch, said he saw Chinese police with riot shields, helmets and leather boots in Beijing after martial law was declared on May 20 -- 16 days before the military assault.
``They had no justification in sending in the army.
Period,'' he said.
Zhu's claims are ``just an excuse to justify the unjustifiable''.
Speaking at a luncheon hosted by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China, Zhu recalled seeing ``thugs'' chase a group of soldiers during the crackdown and throw one of them off a highway overpass.
The crowd burned the body, he said.
The protests ``had evolved into the stage where the people wanted to overthrow the government,'' Zhu said.
``I understand why at last the PLA soldiers were forced to shoot''.
Under further questioning, Zhu conceded that police did have ``a little'' tear gas at their disposal.
China has beefed up its riot and paramilitary police, particularly in Beijing, since the crackdown.
A decade of uninterrupted economic growth since 1989 proved the crackdown was correct, Zhu claimed.
``If the handling of June 4 had been totally wrong then these past 10 years would have been difficult.
China would definitely have been in total chaos,'' he said.
BEIJING (AP) _ A thousand retirees from a nearly bankrupt state auto maker disrupted traffic in a central Chinese city Tuesday to protest a lack of pension payments, a human rights group reported.
The protesters from Wuhan's Light Auto Works General factory blocked streets for 2 1/2 hours before city officials agreed to give them three months of overdue pension payments, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
Duty officers with city agencies, reached after hours by telephone, refused to confirm the demonstration.
The protest was the sixth this month in the ailing industrial city and is part of a nationwide wave of unrest by workers as state factories cut jobs to cope with government-ordered market reforms.
The Light Autoworks, like many state enterprises, suffered from bad management and bloated payrolls, the Information Center said.
BEIJING, November 18 (Xinhua) -- China's automotive industry is working with foreign manufacturers to improve the safety records of Chinese-made vehicles, according to today's China Daily.
A seminar on automotive safety technology, jointly organized by Machinery Consultants International of the Ministry of the Machine Building Industry (MMBI) and Volvo Car Corporation, was held yesterday in Beijing.
"We need to learn from advanced auto manufacturers how better to protect drivers and passengers," said Dong Yang, MMBI science and technology division chief.
Leif Engstorm, chief representative of Volvo's China operations, said: "As the pioneer of auto safety innovation, we feel it is our responsibility to work closely with Chinese partners and safety experts to exchange views and technology".
A survey conducted by the Ministry of Public Security indicated that there were 288,000 traffic accidents in 1996, with the death toll hitting 73,700, a rise of 26 percent and 25 percent from the figures in 1992.
But the proportion of deaths per 10,000 vehicles declined from 30.2 in 1992 to 25.6 in 1996.
As the automotive industry watchdog, MMBI has issued a set of regulations governing automobile safety in the last couple of years.
It has decided to build large scale simulation facilities to carry out collision tests and promote the production of automobile safety systems.
ATLANTA (AP) -- After praising DaimlerChrysler and General Motors for their child seat safety programs, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board criticized six other automakers for not doing enough.
Chairman Jim Hall, in a speech Monday at a national highway safety meeting in Atlanta, scolded Volvo, Mitsubishi, Kia, Subaru, Suzuki and Isuzu.
Hall said the six companies have refused to set up ''fitting stations,'' where parents can get expert advice on how to install child safety seats.
Government studies have shown that eight of 10 safety seats are installed incorrectly.
''I believe that all these car companies are run by responsible adults, and if they get the message effectively -- and maybe it needs to be repeated -- they will take the steps necessary to address the No.
1 health problem for kids,'' Hall said.
Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for children 14 and younger.
Transportation officials say properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half.
The more common mistakes include using the wrong size seat and using a forward-facing seat for an infant who's not old enough to ride in one.
Volvo spokesman Soren Johansson said he wasn't sure the NTSB had even approached his company about a child-safety program, but he praised the focus of the meeting in Atlanta.
''Child safety has been on the agenda with us for years,'' Johansson said.
''It's good to see other manufacturers are now jumping on the bandwagon''.
Subaru spokesman Richard Marshall said his company sent a letter to the NTSB saying it would like to cooperate in a child seat safety program if guidelines could be worked out.
Mitsubishi spokesman Kim Custer said his company has done a series of campaigns about child passenger safety.
Representatives of the three other companies singled out by Hall did not return phone calls seeking comment Monday.
Hall praised a DaimlerChrysler program launched last month that allows adults driving any make of vehicle to make appointments at DaimlerChrysler dealerships to see if their child seat is properly installed.
He also praised General Motors, which has had a long-standing partnership with the National Safe Kids Campaign to hold car seat checkups.
''This is a viable first step taken by two of our major auto manufacturers to change the safety culture on our highways and to put the focus on our kids,'' Hall said.
He said Ford Motor Co.
officials told him Sunday that they plan to announce a major car-seat program soon.
Hall said BMW, Honda, Nissan and Saab are still deciding what sort of commitment they will make.
Toyota and Volkswagen have said they will encourage dealers to set up fitting stations, but they haven't committed any money to the effort, Hall said.
Hall also called on states to strengthen and enforce child passenger protection laws.
He said children should be in child restraints up to age 4, in booster seats to age 8 and in the back seat at all times.
''However, not one state currently has a comprehensive child passenger protection law with all of these requirements,'' Hall said.
''There must be zero tolerance for unbuckled children''.
Car crash fatalities for children ages 5-9 increased by 23 percent from 1982 to 1998.
In the same time period, fatalities for children up to 4 years old decreased by 8 percent.

TRENTON, N.J.
(AP) -- Drivers who have spent the last 15 years ignoring the state's seat belt law, listen up: The chance of getting hit with a $20 fine is growing.
On Monday, police officers throughout New Jersey will have the authority to stop drivers who are not wearing seat belts.
Previously, officers issued summonses only after stopping drivers for other reasons -- such as speeding -- and found them or their front-seat passengers without seat belts.
''We're taking a very big step in reducing the death and disability caused by motor-vehicle accidents in New Jersey,'' said Assemblyman Herb Conaway, D-Burlington, a sponsor of the measure Gov.
Christie Whitman signed into law in January.
''This isn't about punishment''.
Conaway, who is a doctor, said the change also will benefit children, who are the most vulnerable to injury in automobile accidents.
''By enforcing that requirement, we know the percentage of adults who wear seat belts will go up, but more importantly, the number of children will also go up,'' Conaway said.
The Seat Belt Safety Coalition of New Jersey has said the state's 62 percent compliance rate for seat belt use in the state falls below the national average of 68 percent.
Conaway said the council's statistics show children are belted in only 20 percent of the time when adults they ride with are not.
That figure rises to about 90 percent when adults wear their seat belts, Conaway said.
The AAA New Jersey Automobile Club reports that 60 percent of children killed in automobile accidents weren't wearing seat belts.
The safety coalition predicts the greater enforcement will save up to 50 lives and prevent nearly 2,900 serious injuries per year.
''It must be once a week that I have to tell a family member that someone died because they weren't wearing a seat belt,'' Dr.
Jennifer Wailer, a trauma physician and chairwoman of the seat belt coalition, told The Press of Atlantic City in Sunday's editions.
''I can tell you it's very tiring, because this is preventable''.
The New Jersey chapter of the National Motorists Association opposed the change, arguing that it would be difficult to enforce and that the number of traffic deaths on New Jersey roads reached a 20-year low in 1999.
The current fine of $20 will remain unchanged and offenders will not be subject to Division of Motor Vehicles points.
OTTAWA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has told automakers to improve airbag safety or face new regulations as early as the next fall.
The government wants automakers to change airbag design voluntarily for 1998 models, make airbags to deploy with less force, and not to deploy at speeds as low as they do now.
"We must work together urgently to minimize the associated risks," Canadian Transport Minister David Anderson said in a letter to automakers.
"If the cooperation isn't there, we would have to regulate," Anderson warned.
Auto airbags were introduced in the late 1980s to reduce accident injuries to drivers and passengers.
They have since saved an estimated 100 lives in Canada.
However, airbags have also been implicated in the deaths of three Canadians, according to today's Financial Post newspaper.
Now, airbags only meet specifications set by the United States, where they are tested on dummies that do not wear belts, because only 60 percent of Americans regularly wear seat belts.
In Canada, 92 percent drivers and passengers wear belts.
But the airbags are deployed with the same force as in the United States, which can kill or hurt people who are not sitting properly.
In one case, a Canadian passenger was leaning over to adjust the radio when an airbag blasted him back into his seat and killed him, the paper said.
There was a time when auto makers could not seem to sell safety to customers.
How the times have changed.
Now some manufacturers are almost playing one-upmanship in the safety world.
Volvo has become a name synonymous with safe vehicles, but other makers are saying, ``Hey, Volvo's not the only company making safe vehicles''.
Saab, which has won Swedish awards for safety, has decided not to take a back seat.
It is letting people know it has built, and continues to build, safe vehicles.
At a presentation, Saab engineers showed how &UR; &LR; the company builds cars not for government-mandated crash tests but for ``real life'' situations, with crumple zones within the vehicle effective if the car is hit on an angle, not just straight on as in federal tests.
BMW and Mercedes-Benz are also getting out the message.
Mercedes has developed a number of safety features over the years that the company freely allows others to copy.
When it comes to a safe vehicle, driving a Mercedes has been compared to driving a tank.
It's a solid vehicle.
Ford is promoting its Windstar minivan as a safe vehicle.
It received the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's five-star award in crash test ratings.
The only other minivan to receive the award is the '98 Toyota Sienna.
Windstar offers such added features as standard foam and cushioning in the ceiling and window pillars to help reduce head injuries in a crash.
The Ford minivan comes with two options for even safer driving: side airbags designed for front-seat passengers to cushion both the head and torso in a side crash, and a reverse-sensing system that starts beeping when the bumper is 5.9 feet away from an obstacle and sounds more frequently as the vehicle gets closer to the object.
The beeping is heard only inside the minivan.
Almost all cars and most trucks now have dual front air bags as standard equipment.
More air bags, though, are on the way.
Since their introduction a couple of years ago, side airbags are beginning to show up in more and more vehicles.
The bags are mounted either in the front door panels or on the side of the front seats.
With the controversy over injuries and, in some cases, deaths as the result of airbag deployments, a number of vehicles now are equipped with ``second generation'' bags.
These units tend not to explode with the force of earlier versions.
Another recent change came about because of injuries and deaths to children caused by air bags activating in the front seat.
Many trucks, which tend to have only one seat, are now equipped with key-operated shut offs for the front passenger side air bag to prevent such injuries.
Mercedes-Benz is now offering its Baby-Smart seat system in all models.
When a baby seat that Mercedes offers is placed in the front, a sensor deactivates the air bag on that side of the car.
This year, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo added air bag ``curtains'' to some models.
The curtains cover just about the entire door.
BMW offers a tube-like airbag that extends across the top of the front doors to help protect the heads of front-seat passengers.
As of Sept.
1, manufacturers were required to add extra padding around windows to protect against head injuries.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the new curtain-style airbags are innovative technology that surpass the extra padding ruling.
Side-impact airbags have already found their way into low-priced cars such as the Toyota Corolla.
Some luxury makers are also adding these for rear seat passengers.
For true safety, however, the use of seat belts to hold driver and passengers in place is a key element.
Relying on the air bags alone won't do the trick.
Seat belts have also been greatly improved both for comfort and for holding one in place in the event of a sudden stop.
Some makers are giving added protection to avoid whiplash injuries.
Volvo has a new whiplash Protection System allowing the seat backrest and head restraint to shift backward during rear-end collisions.
The system, Volvo says, reduces the force resulting from rear impact by 50 percent.
Saab also offers a similar system.
Many luxury vehicles are providing driver-systems that sense steering and traction conditions and automatically adjust to prevent spinouts.
BMW is including one in its new 3-Series.
Antilock brakes have been hailed as almost more important in preventing accidents than airbags.
The brakes are intended to prevent cars from skidding on slippery surfaces during a sudden stop and to aid in stopping faster.
The problem with antilock brakes is many people don't know how to use them.
Unlike regular brakes, which many drivers learned to pump in emergencies, antilock brakes do the pumping automatically.
Drivers pumping antilock brakes make them less effective.
Mercedes-Benz now has a system called Brake-Assist that uses a computer to determine when the use of the brakes is an emergency.
When this situation occurs, the computer automatically adds extra pressure to the brakes.
Mercedes says stopping distances can be reduced by up to 45 percent.
Without proper and well-maintained tires on the vehicle, no brake is going to stop the car or truck effectively.
Having the right tires for your make and model and having them properly inflated are very important, in even the simplest of stops.
Corvette was one of the first to offer a device that warns of low air pressure.
The feature can now be found on other General Motors makes.
The system is tied to the antilock brake system.
When a sensor detects a loss of air, it triggers a warning light on the instrument panel indicating which tire is low.
Stopping by the side of the road to repair a flat tire can be one of the most dangerous things a motorist can do There are too many reports of motorists changing tires being struck by a passing vehicle.
Some '99s are coming with tires that are capable of running for a while with a complete loss of air _ long enough to find help or a safe place off the highway to change the tire.
Getting a better grip on the road is what all-wheel-drive is about.
With AWD _ not four-wheel-drive _ power is shifted to the wheel or wheels needing it most.
Even if traction is lost on three wheels, new systems from Jeep and Mercedes will shift the power to the one wheel with traction, keeping the vehicle from skidding on ice or snow.
AWD, once a feature associated with sport-utility vehicles, is now available in sedans and wagons from Subaru, Volvo, and Mercedes.
Another new safety feature expected to be adapted by many manufacturers is blue-tint headlights designed to give drivers better road sight at night.
High-intensity discharge, or HID, headlights illuminate by creating an electric arc between two electrodes in a bulb filled with xenon gas.
These new lights have been designed to help older drivers see better.
OK, how many ways can you say ``sport utility''?
Plenty, would seem to be the answer as more car makers add sport utility models to their lineup.
And, there are hints that even more makers are about to enter the competition.
Lexus added to its '99 sport utility lineup earlier this year with the RX 300.
Now, Cadillac joins in with the Escalade, Suzuki adds the Grand Vitara, and there's even one from Quigley.
Quigley? Well, more about that later.
Volkswagen and Porsche are planning a joint venture, BMW is said to be working on one, Saab is looking for one, Saturn is giving thoughts to having one and Daewoo, which just entered the American market, reportedly has one in its future.
Jeep certainly isn't sitting by.
It has an all-new Grand Cherokee that's bigger, roomier, more powerful, and with a new all-wheel-drive train.
Reportedly the only things being picked up from the '98 version are 127 screws.
If there are not already a lot of choices in models, consider, too, that not all sport utility vehicles are alike.
Which means anyone looking for a SUV has a lot of shopping ahead _ not just for price, but for features as well.
Do you want full-time four-wheel drive, or do you really want all-wheel drive?
Do you want a low range for off-road adventure, or a choice of two-wheel, four-wheel drive?
Do you want room to spare?
Do you want to feel the ruts or ride in carlike comfort?
How high off the road do you want to be?
How easy is it to shift between drives?
What's the noise level inside like?
How does it feel going around a corner?
(Some SUVs, especially some of the smaller ones, give the feeling of an impending rollover.
If it doesn't feel right, don't go for it).
These are questions you should answer before putting your money down.
Surveys have shown that more than 95 percent of sport-utility owners never go off-road.
They simply use them for shopping, commuting, hauling the kids, a boat or a trailer.
Still, for auto dealers, a SUV or two on the lot is a must.
That's one reason Cadillac, for the first time in its 96-year history, is putting its name on a truck.
Sales of the Lincoln Navigator were too much for Cadillac to bear, it needed something to keep its flock in the Cadillac tent.
Enter the Cadillac Escalade.
The Escalade is basically an even fancier, smoother-riding version of the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon and Denali.
It's not as huge as the Lincoln Navigator but it has plenty of power in its 255 horsepower engine, and can make grand music with its Bose Acoustimass sound system.
The Jeep Grand Cherokee, its fans say, leaves almost nothing to desire.
The new Grand Cherokee may look a lot like the old, but its a far different riding, handling, all-around vehicle.
Some have reported it outclasses the Mercedes M-Class, and Chrysler reportedly was going to promote that, until they became part of the Mercedes family.
Make your own comparisons.
There's just about nothing Chrysler didn't change on the '99.
There's a new engine, new all-wheel-drive system, more room, new seats, new transmission, well, it's all new.
Even the spare tire has been taken out of the cargo area and placed under the vehicle.
Chrysler hasn't missed a trick _ it spend $2.65 billion, including $750 million in plant preparation.
The new Quadra-Drive system is designed to keep the Jeep going even if three wheels lose traction.
It has a new suspension designed for better ride and handling.
And its new 16-valve, 4.7-liter V-8 is said to offer better mileage, and 30 percent less emissions.
Add to that a long list of luxury items, including dual climate zones, and you have quite a vehicle to go just about anywhere.
The Laredo version starts at $26,220, the Limited at $34,415 for the four-wheel drive version.
The luxury market for SUVs is growing.
General Motors added the Denali last spring, loading it with lots of amenities to set it apart from the GMC Yukon.
Its one-price comes with just about everything.
The same is true of GMC's new top-of-the-line, everything-included Envoy, which has features not available in any other GM SUV product.
It's nicely styled and equipped.
While lots of manufacturers are citing the ``carlike'' ride of their SUVs, GM is stressing the ``trucklike'' strength of their models, which may have a carlike ride, but are built on truck frames.
Lexus entered the SUV market last March with the RX300 ($31,500), and like other Lexus products, shows a lot of innovation along with comfort features.
The RX300 raises the question of what is a SUV?
This new entry to the market certainly doesn't look like a sport utility, it rides more like a car (it is built on a Camry frame), and it lacks a low-range gear for true off-road driving.
But it has all the other SUV attributes _ high seating, all-wheel drive, and roomy interior.
It also gets better mileage than most SUVs _ around 19 miles to the gallon.
Lexus also offers the LX470 ($58,500), a full-size, full-time 4wd with V-8 power that is new this year, replacing the LX450.
The vehicle is similar to the Toyota Land Cruiser.
The new vehicles are aimed at becoming the ``King of 4WD,'' according to Toyota.
The vehicles have a new 32-valve, 4.7-liter V-8 that offers a 7 percent fuel gain, a new Automatic Height Control system allowing the driver to raise the body by up to 2 inches at the push of a button, a new heating system, better stability, and a spacious interior.
Winning accolades since its '98 introduction is the Mercedes-Benz M-Class sport utility.
The ML320 ($34,950) has been cited for its ride, safety, ruggedness, performance, fuel economy, usability and price _ it's in the same range as a top-of-the-line Ford Explorer or Jeep Grand Cherokee.
Consumer Reports puts it at the top of its SUV list.
The only problem with the V-6 powered ML320 is availability _ it's a long wait for the Alabama-produced vehicle.
This year, Mercedes adds a second model, the ML430 with V-8 power.
Some of the nice touches of the M-Class include bumpers set at the same level as a car (unlike other SUVs, the Mercedes bumper won't end up in a car's body, causing additional damage during a collision), BabySmart automatic child seat recognition (a system that deactivates the front passenger-side airbag if a child is in a booster seat in front), and a new Power Skyview Top option that offers a huge roof opening (about four-feet by three-feet wide).
Ford is still king of the hill when it comes to sales of its Explorer and near twin, Mercury Mountaineer.
For '99 the Explorer adds a Reverse Sensing System (a whole-range rear warning system to alert drivers of objects when backing up), side airbags, Homelink (a remote control for opening garage doors, lights, etc), Travelnote, an electronic message organizer that records and plays messages.
On an environmental note, both the Explorer and Expedition (Mountaineer and Navigator, as well) are now low-emission vehicles, producing 40 percent less smog-forming emissions than before.
The Expedition, Ford's huge SUV, adds an optional power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals that can be adjusted up to 3 inches, a plus for shorter drivers.
These features can also be found in the Lincoln Navigator and the Mercury Mountaineer.
In the lower price range, Suzuki is out to set a new standard for mini-sport-utility vehicles.
The Grand Vitara ($21,429) will be the first in its class to have a V-6 engine, and with its body built onto a steel ladder frame like larger SUVs, this vehicle is a true off-roader, complete with a four-wheel drive system.
It includes a two-speed transfer case with low range for climbing and descending steep hills.
The inside of the Grand Vitara is said to almost equal that of the Jeep Cherokee.
The Grand Vitara is joined by two four-cylinder versions: the Suzuki Vitara and the Chevrolet Tracker.
These will be available as two-door convertible or four-door hardtop.
The V-6 will only be available at Suzuki dealers.
Kia, a Korean company, has slowly been making its way to the East Coast and arrived in New England this fall.
Along with it comes the Kia Sportage, which is designed to appeal to Generation X in style, and more importantly, in price.
The Kia Sportage starts at $14,445, a thousand or more dollars less than competitors such as the Isuzu Amigo and Toyota RAV4.
The Kia will be available as a two-door convertible and four-door model.
Ever since Consumer Reports labeled the 1996 Isuzu Trooper II and the 1988 Suzuki Samurai as being unacceptable for, in Consumer Union's eye, a tendency to roll over in emergency tests, consumers have become aware that this could be a problem in any SUV.
SUVs sit high above the road and, therefore, tend to lean more in turns than lower profile automobiles.
The new Land Rover Discovery Series II offers a computer-assisted system that should allay this unsettling feeling.
The Discovery features ACE _ active cornering enhancement _ which uses hydraulic levers that counter the lateral tilt of the vehicle's body.
This is the only vehicle sold in America that offers such a system.
The Land Rover Discovery II ($35,000) is the second generation of this model.
The new model is slightly lower and six inches longer than last year's.
The added space goes for cargo and rear-seat passengers.
The new model also comes with another first _ an electronic hill descent control that supplements engine braking on steep hills by automatically applying the brakes as needed.
The Discovery is also four inches wider than the '98, and has a V-8 engine that has added power and torque.
Other SUVs already on the market include the Acura SLX ($38,300), Chevrolet Blazer ($21,600), the monstrous Chevrolet/GMC Suburban ($25,500), Dodge Durango ($27,000), available with an optional 5.9-liter V-8, the biggest engine in its class; GMC Jimmy ($21,800), Honda CR-V ($18,300), Honda Passport ($$23,800), Infiniti QX4 ($35,550), Isuzu Rodeo ($17,900), Isuzu Trooper ($27,800), Jeep Wrangler ($14,200), Land Rover Discovery ($34,500), Land Rover Range Rover ($56,000), Mitsubishi Montero ($33,500), Mitsubishi Montero Sport ($18,100), Nissan Pathfinder ($23,900), Oldsmobile Bravada ($30,700), Subaru Forester ($18,700), Subaru Outback ($24,500), Toyota 4Runner ($20,500), Toyota RAV4 ($15,400) and Toyota Land Cruiser ($45,900) Oh yes, what's a Quigley?
Quigley is a company that has been converting vans and trucks to four-wheel-drive.
Now it is marketing a four-wheel-drive based on a full-size van through Ford, Chevrolet, and GMC dealers.
LOS ANGELES, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Ford Motor Company plans to add what it calls a rollover protection system in the fall of 2001 to its sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and light trucks in an effort to reduce fatalities, according to reports from the world's second biggest auto maker.
The new system, unveiled at the Detroit auto show Wednesday, includes an airbag-like curtain on each side of the vehicle and is a response to the federal government's revelation that almost half the people who die in light trucks and SUVs die in rollover accidents.
"Its principal purpose is to help keep occupants inside the vehicle and protected," said Helen Petrauskas, vice president of environmental and safety engineering for Ford.
"We've looked at the most threatening current driving conditions and developed new technologies to improve the protection for our SUV drivers and their families," she said.
While some auto makers, including Mercedes, Volvo and BMW have air bag curtains that inflate across the car windows and could potentially help during a rollover, experts believe Ford's is the first that is designed specifically for rollover protection.
More than 9,400 people died in rollover crashes in 1997, according to the latest year statistics available.
Forty-seven percent of all fatalities in light trucks and SUVs result from rollovers, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, while 22 percent of car deaths involve rollovers.
Most often rollover deaths involve passengers being ejected from the vehicle.
Government officials and auto makers have repeatedly said that wearing seat belts is the most important single way to prevent passengers from being ejected in a rollover crash.
Forget ``boxy,'' put ``utilitarian'' and ``practical'' out of your mind and get ready to change almost all your perceptions about the venerable Volvo.
Welcome to the all-new, awe-inspiring, way-cool Volvo S80 sedan, the biggest and best and least Volvo-looking Volvo of all time.
Due in dealer showrooms as early as mid-September, this new front-drive, full-size sedan will a) alienate some Volvo diehards who think boxy is just the thing, and b) draw a whole lot of new buyers into the Volvo fold, people who just couldn't bear to buy the type of car associated with middle-age mothers.
The S80, with a price range of $40,000 to $43,000, will be the most expensive production Volvo ever.
But anyone who drives the vehicle will immediately put it in the same class as European luxury cars such as the BMW 5-series, Mercedes-Benz E-class and the Audi A6.
Volvo has gone upscale with this car, and you can bet it will be a force in the marketplace even against such heady competition.
Why? That's easy.
Take Volvo's long-standing reputation for safety, quality and longevity, add a full measure of luxury, and you've got a package that the consumer in the $40,000-sedan class has been yearning for.
Safety, which has always been Volvo's primary focus, takes no back seat in the new S80.
This car is, without a doubt, the safest Volvo ever built, thanks to innovations including computerized stability and traction control, advanced antilock braking, new seats that offer much-improved whiplash protection in rear-end crashes, and the ``inflatable curtain,'' Volvo's version of the side airbag system to protect the driver and front passenger in the event of a T-bone collision.
Although Volvo will offer the S80 with seven different engines, including two inline six-cylinders and five five-cylinders, only the six-cylinders will be sold in the United States.
The top-of-the-line engine will be the T6, a 2.8-liter, inline six-cylinder with double turbochargers, rated at a whopping 272 horsepower.
This engine's power is on par with that of 4-liter V-8s in competitive makes and Volvo will also sell the vehicle with a five-speed manual transmission.
A General Motors four-speed automatic is standard for Volvos with six-cylinder engines, and will be the one most buyers choose.
It is so smooth-shifting that it's virtually seamless.
The second engine destined for the U.S. market will be a normally aspirated (non-turbo) 2.9-liter inline six-cylinder rated at 204 horsepower.
This engine is expected to be the biggest seller; from my experience, this has all the power most buyers will ever need.
Passengers will enjoy the ride in the S80 almost as much as the driver enjoys driving it.
It's smooth and cushy but with enough road feel left to give the driver some fun on curves and turns.
The rear seat is roomy enough for three adults to ride comfortably, even on long trips, and the front bucket seats are so comfy you may want to order a couple for your living room.
The S80's distinct, modern design copies no other vehicle, yet it looks as contemporary as any of its competition from Europe or Japan.
The design is the product of Volvo's California studio, led by U.S. designer Doug Frasher.
Production of the S80 is under way at Volvo's plant in Gothenburg, Sweden.
The official on-sale date is Oct.
12, but dealers are taking orders, Volvo officials said.
This vehicle is so important for Volvo's future _ the company's first serious attempt to built a prestige vehicle based on the traditional Volvo safety and durability _ that about 25,000 dealers and Volvo employees from around the world have been brought to the Gothenburg headquarters during the past several weeks to learn about the S80, according to officials of Volvo Cars of North America.
NEW FORD MINI-SUV: Ford plans to introduce an all-new compact sport-utility vehicle for model year 2001 that will compete against the Toyota RAV4, Kia Sportage and Honda CR-V.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government announced new air bag standards Friday that seek to improve protection of children and small adults.
Critics contend larger adults who don't wear seat belts could be put at greater risk.
The new rule overhauls the government's standards for air bags, which to date are credited with saving more than 5,000 lives and blamed for at least 158 deaths.
Under the new standards, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will require air bags to protect vehicle occupants in a 25 mph crash test, the level supported by automakers, rather than a test at 30 mph favored by some consumer advocates.
The 25 mph standard will be phased in over three years, starting with 2004 model year vehicles.
Most air bag deaths have involved unrestrained children and small adults in low-speed crashes, victims most often of air bags that deployed so forcefully they caused neck injuries.
The 25 mph test will not require the air bags to inflate as forcefully as a 30 mph test.
''At the end of the day, we focused on the most vulnerable and the most at-risk of being killed by the air bags that were supposed to benefit them,'' Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said.
Some consumer groups say the new standard will put more adults at risk because the bags will not be designed to deploy with enough force to protect unbelted larger adults.
''We need a 30 mph standard because people are more likely to be killed or seriously injured in higher-speed crashes, and this is where air bags have saved the most lives,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's nonprofit group.
NHTSA required a 30 mph test until 1997, when worries about air bags injuring motorists caused the agency to approve a rule that temporarily allowed automakers to use a 25 mph test.
Rather than change the test, Claybrook said automakers should install dual-power air bags that would inflate at different speeds depending on the severity of impact and size of the occupant.
The real reason the auto industry wants the 25 mph test, Claybrook said, is that popular sport utility vehicles cannot meet the 30 mph standard because of stiff designs that do not absorb impact as well as cars.
Lance Roberts of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers rejected that argument.
If it were true, he said, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the American Trauma Society and the National Transportation Safety Board would not support the 25 mph test as the safer alternative.
''It's certainly not about saving money or about protecting any classification of vehicle,'' Roberts said.
''This rule is going to go so much further in enhancing vehicle safety, it's unprecedented''.
NHTSA also will require vehicles to be tested using a family of dummies -- an average-size man, a small woman and 1-, 3- and 6-year-old children.
Previous tests involved only average-size men.
The new regulations also attempt to recreate real-world conditions by placing child dummies in child seats on the passenger seat and in unbelted sitting, kneeling, standing and lying positions.
NHTSA estimates the new standards will increase costs by less than $100 per vehicle.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With federal regulators pondering whether they should start rating child safety seats, a major automaker began offering parents a free seat checkup service, regardless of what kind of car they have.
Child safety seats prevent thousands of deaths and injuries annually, but federal officials and safety experts say a large share of those in use are not installed correctly, posing a possible hazard to children riding in them.
DaimlerChrysler Corp.
began taking appointments Wednesday at 400 dealerships in 80 cities for child seat checkups.
Under the program, which will grow to 1,000 dealerships by year's end, even adults driving a competitor's vehicle can ask DaimlerChrysler technicians if a child seat is properly installed and children are buckled in properly.
Every year, parents struggle to install about 70 models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with different back seats.
Studies show more than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched its look at ways to improve child seat safety, including a possible rating system, with a public hearing on Wednesday.
Australia and Europe test safety seats and provide parents the results of those tests, while Japan is considering a rating system, noted Stephen R.
Kratzke, NHTSA associate administrator for safety performance.
If a rating system is developed it needs to include real-world performance, not just crash-test results, Stephanie M.
Tombrello of SafetyBeltSafe U.S.A. said.
"A rating system that is simply a star system can hinder safety because parents stop asking questions," she said.
Parents need instructions in correct installation, Tombrello said.
Kathleen Weber of the University of Michigan Medical School suggested the possibility of a weighted rating system that included explanations of tradeoffs.
"Not all test data are of equal importance," she said, noting that measurements of head movement, chest acceleration and knee movement in a crash are among pieces of information collected.
Robert B.
Waller, Jr.
, who represents car seat manufacturers, said a single rating system could be misleading.
A single rating could lead manufacturers to sacrifice in one area, such as compatibility with various vehicles, in favor of some other factor that weighs more in the rating, said Waller, of the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association.
That could result in angry consumers, frustrated that what they thought was the "best" seat won't fit in their car, he said.
He suggested improved instructions and warning labels for the seats, adding that some current mandatory labeling requires a 12th grade education to understand.
Another safety agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, called attention to the problem of wrongly installed seats, urging creation of a network of permanent "fitting stations" for child seats that the government, automakers and private safety agencies would operate jointly.
NTSB Chairman Jim Hall urged automakers to also to offer checkups as a permanent feature in every dealership.
Traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for children 14 and younger.
Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half, government officials say, but inspections indicate many parents do not know they are using the seats incorrectly.
Susan Cischke, DaimlerChrysler's vice president of regulatory affairs, said their research found that 96 percent of drivers with child seats believed the seats were installed properly -- even though less than 20 percent were.
Cischke said some of the more common mistakes were getting the wrong sized-seat for the child and moving an infant into a forward-facing seat too quickly.
Even before the NTSB recommendation, General Motors Corp.
financed periodic checkups at their dealerships with help from a private safety group, the National Safe Kids Campaign.
Under the program, more than 45,000 child seats have been inspected since 1996.
And starting this month, GM will have a minivan in each state that will be used to conduct car seat clinics at different sites.
But until DaimlerChrysler's announcement, no automaker offered parents the chance to make an appointment at dealerships on such a wide scale.
DaimlerChrysler said parents who want an appointment for a checkup should call 1-877-FIT-4-A-KID or visit the Internet site www.fitforakid.org.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top federal safety official is urging automakers to design cars with child safety in mind first.
``It's time for the automobile manufacturers to put kids first in the design of their vehicles, and to focus on the back seat where kids sit most of the time,'' Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
``Unfortunately, in the past kids have been just an afterthought in terms of the design of safety features for an automobile,'' he said.
Hall is sending that message to automakers in a speech he was delivering today at the World Traffic Safety Symposium in New York City, an event being held in conjunction with the New York International Auto Show.
In his prepared text, Hall warned: ``We need look no further than the first-generation air bag to understand the consequences of not doing so''.
Air bags inflating in low-speed crashes have been blamed for killing 131 people, including 73 children.
On Wednesday, Hall sent the speech to top auto executives along with a letter urging them ``to discuss with your peers the need to reverse the trend of motor vehicle crashes being the leading cause of death among young Americans''.
Traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for children between ages 5 and 15.
This decade, more than 60,000 children, infants to teen-agers, have died in traffic crashes.
When children are in the car, they ride in the back seat about 70 percent of the time, according to the agency's analysis of federal crash data from 1996 and 1997.
Hall said crash tests that automakers must pass for federal safety compliance should include child dummies in the back seats to learn how well the vehicles protect them from head and neck injuries.
The back seat is now empty in those crash tests.
The Safety Board also has recommended automakers: --Install shoulder belts in all rear seating positions in cars and light trucks, including the rear center seat, where they are often missing.
--Make the shoulder belts in rear seats adjustable so that they can be lowered in height to properly fit across children's chests rather than rise up at their necks.
Most autos have adjustable shoulder belts only in the front seats.
--Stock more vehicles with built-in child seats.
In a speech in January, Hall announced the safety board was recommending a nationwide network of fitting stations to check that child seats are properly installed to protect children in auto crashes.
More than 80 percent of child seats are installed incorrectly, studies show.
DETROIT (AP) -- Mercedes-Benz has recalled 6,000 high-tech child seats that automatically turn off passenger-side air bags when installed, saying a flaw in the system might keep the air bags turned on.
The system was designed to reduce the dangers of small children in child seats near air bags.
Safety experts recommend that small infants ride in rear-facing child seats, but also strongly recommend that rear-facing infant seats never be placed in front of an air bag.
At least 15 infants have been killed this way by air bags since 1994, according to the U.S.
Department of Transportation.
The BabySmart seats send and receive signals from two antennas in the seat cushion.
Air bags in some Mercedes-Benz models are supposed to recognize that a BabySmart seat has been installed and turn off the passenger air bag.
But Mercedes-Benz said Tuesday that if the child seat is pushed forward when the seat back is leaning toward the dashboard, the passenger airbag might not turn off as designed.
Drivers would know the system was not working only because an ``airbag off'' light would stay dark.
Mercedes-Benz said there have been four reports that the indicator light was off, but no reports of accidents or injuries.
The company recommended the seats not be used and that children sit in the back seat until the problem is fixed.
Mercedes-Benz said all known owners of BabySmart Infant and Booster child seats were being notified, and special posters would be hung in Mercedes-Benz dealerships.
Mercedes dealers will exchange the seats for free.
The recall does not affect Toddler seats.
DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co.
will install a device that warns unbuckled drivers with an intermittent chime until they buckle their seat belts.
The Belt-Minder system will be used throughout Ford's U.S. product line starting later this year.
President Jac Nasser announced the system Monday at the North American International Auto Show's media preview.
A sensor in the belt buckle determines if the driver has buckled up; if not, a red light on the dashboard goes on and an intermittent chime sounds until the belt is latched.
On most cars and trucks, a chime and light go on only when the ignition is turned on.
``We think it will improve safety belt usage tremendously,'' Nasser said.
Drivers who don't want to wear their belts can disable the intermittent chime by buckling, then unbuckling their belt.
Nasser said seat belts are ``the most effective safety device there is,'' but that many who occasionally fail to buckle up say they simply forget or are too hurried.
Ford said the system eventually will be expanded to include the front passenger seat.
The No.
2 automaker said major insurance companies are considering discounts for those who own or lease vehicles equipped with the Belt-Minder.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG is establishing a new service at a quarter of its dealerships to advise parents on how to install car seats to protect children.
DaimlerChrysler is the first automaker to accept a federal agency's challenge by creating a permanent free service using trained personnel to help customers fit child seats.
The company will spend more than $10 million annually and the service will be available at about 1,000 dealerships, company officials said Wednesday.
More than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed in autos.
Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half, according to government statistics.
By next year, DaimlerChrysler will have the capacity to conduct 800,000 inspections annually to make sure children are buckled properly in child seats and child seats are properly installed in both new and older DaimlerChrysler vehicles, the company officials said.
By comparison, the National Safety Council estimates 30,000 child seats a year are being inspected now at community events nationwide.
DaimlerChrysler co-chairman Robert Eaton was announcing the initiative today at a news conference.
Also involved is the child seat manufacturer Fisher-Price and the nonprofit National Safety Council.
The company's move follows a recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of ``fitting stations'' for child seats be established to prevent the deaths of children in automobile accidents.
Each year, frustrated parents struggle to install about 70 models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with different shapes of back seats, meaning there are ``potentially 100,000 different ways to confuse the average consumer,'' NTSB Chairman Jim Hall says.
This decade, more than 60,000 children have died in traffic crashes.
When Hall recommended the fitting stations, he envisioned them across the United States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle administration offices, fire stations and automobile dealerships.
Hall had said the initiative should be financed out of government transportation dollars, but he invited other groups and businesses to get involved.
So far, only DaimlerChrysler has come forward but other automakers are considering the proposal.
General Motors Corp.
also is considering some type of permanent fitting stations in its dealerships, spokesman Greg Martin said.
Since 1996, GM has worked with the National Safe Kids Campaign, a nonprofit group that promotes child safety, to hold weekend or daylong child safety seat checks at about 1,000 of the company's dealerships.
LOS ANGELES -- The evacuation of an apartment complex Friday because of an unexploded, stolen air bag reveals what police say is a thriving, illegal trade in these car safety devices.
In L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, investigators suspect there is at least one roving gang of thieves that specializes in taking orders from body shops and then going out to steal them.
Nationwide, an estimated $50 million worth of air bags are stolen every year, accounting for 10 percent of all auto theft claims in 1997, double that of just the year before, insurance industry officials said.
``It's basically a replacement for the car stereo theft of the '80s and early '90s,'' said Julie Rochman, spokeswoman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, based in Arlington, Va.
``The air bags the thieves are going after are worth more than any other item in the passenger compartment''.
Following a crash, a new air bag can cost $1,000, but police said unscrupulous body shops buy stolen ones for $150 apiece and then charge $1,500, including the installation.
And removing an explosively armed air bag, particularly if it is done in a hurry, can leave a car in bad shape.
``When air bags are stolen, they damage the steering wheel, the dash or cut the wiring harness,'' said Frank Tomota, a service consultant at West Valley Toyota in Northridge.
Insurance premiums are not expected to rise because officials said the growing cost of air bag thefts is offset by an overall decline in auto thefts.
The real losers are the motorists because with every theft, they must pay the deductible amount, arrange for the repairs and risk driving without an air bag.
The air bag that was found unexploded in Van Nuys on Friday is among the 12 or so that police said are stolen every month in the Valley.
Detectives came upon it by happenstance while making an arrest at the Royal Garden Apartments at 14625 Rayen St.
About 24 people were evacuated because the air bags contain an explosive charge that can launch its 25-pound metal casing some 80 feet, police said.
Details about the arrest were not immediately available, but police said they believe the air bag had been stolen, and that they were trying to track down the owner.
Often a group of thieves hits three or four cars on a street or parking lot and then steals from a neighbor a week or two later, said Detective Bob Graybill of the LAPD's auto-theft task force in Van Nuys.
The thieves almost always are filling an order from an auto body shop whose owner is trying to cut costs to maximize the payout from the insurance company, he said.
This can include splicing, instead of replacing, the wiring harness attached to the air bag, or in some cases not installing an air bag at all.
``The car looks good and the customer is very happy -- and until he gets involved in a crash again and finds out if the air bag works or not, nobody's going to know these are used air bags the guy jury-rigged in there,'' Graybill said.
Los Angeles police are attacking the problem through stepped-up inspections of auto shops to ensure owners are licensed and have receipts for uninstalled air bags.
By a conservative estimate, 50,000 air bags were stolen in the United States in 1996, roughly triple that of 1993, said Ed Sparkman, a senior manager of vehicle support at the National Insurance Crime Bureau in Palos Hills, Ill.
That equates to a $50 million loss to the insurance industry, assuming the average replacement cost for an air bag is $1,000, he said.
The actual rate of these thefts is believed to be much higher since these statistics did not account for the commercial auto market and because theft of air bags from rental cars, often by the person renting the car, is booming, he said.
The industry and law enforcement are now mulling over ways to combat air bag theft by using a national registry of serial numbers.
Auto parts stores sell anti-theft devices for drivers' air bags, which attach to the steering wheel or special bolts that make it more difficult for a thief to remove the safety device.
``It's definitely a growing problem,'' said Dave Unnewehr, a research manager with the American Insurance Association in Washington, D.C.

Federal regulators Thursday warned consumers that side air bags can kill or seriously injure children under 12 and urged manufacturers installing the devices in rear seats to let drivers decide if they want them activated.
Most auto manufacturers reacted coolly to the advisory from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, saying side air bags used in conjunction with age-appropriate restraints significantly enhance safety.
Although BMW already allows customers to tell dealers whether they want rear seat air bags activated, a Mercedes spokesman said the company has no plans to follow suit.
``We don't believe it's in the consumer's best interests,'' said Stuart Schorr, a Mercedes spokesman.
About 7,500 people in the United States each year die from side-impact crashes and a growing number of auto manufacturers are installing side air bags as standard or optional equipment to provide greater safety.
There have been no deaths or serious injuries attributed to side air bags.
By contrast, front air bags have been blamed for at least 145 deaths since 1990.
In those cases, the impact of the bag inflating caused serious injuries.
Most of the victims were children and short people, many of whom were not wearing seat belts.
Federal officials said more than 2.4 million vehicles with front-seat side air bags are in use, but fewer than 20,000 have rear-seat air bags.
Most manufacturers are installing front-seat side air bags, but only Mercedes, Audi, BMW, and Rolls Royce are putting them in the rear seat.
In its consumer advisory, the traffic safety administration warned that side air bags can kill or seriously injure children whose head, neck, or chest are in close proximity to the air bag at the time of deployment.
Since children under 12 are supposed to be traveling in rear seats at all times, the advisory urged car manufacturers to deactivate rear side air bags before shipping vehicles to dealers.
``Purchasers who want such air bags activated, after being advised of the potential risk to out-of-position children, should be able to have them switched on by their dealers,'' the advisory said.
The agency also urged manufacturers to allow owners of vehicles with rear side air bags to bring them back to dealers to have them deactivated if the vehicle is likely to be carrying children.
The advisory noted that children under 12 should always sit in the rear seat and use age-appropriate restraints, but manufacturers and insurance industry officials said the warning failed to point out the benefits of side air bags used in conjunction with seat belts and child seats.
Indeed, in all the crash tests cited by the agency the dummies representing children were not wearing seat belts or sitting in a child safety seat.
``We think what the agency has done today is to needlessly scare people,'' said Julie Rochman, a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
She acknowledged a child lying on the rear seat with his head near the door or kneeling with his chest against the door would be in danger if the side air bag deployed.
But she said a child in those positions would be at far greater risk if the car were hit by another vehicle.
Said Schorr of Mercedes: ``For properly restrained children, side air bags are a great safety device that will save lives''.
He said Mercedes plans to contact owners of its vehicles shortly to review the benefits of side air bags used appropriately.
A BMW spokesman said the company decided to deactivate rear-seat air bags to give consumers a chance to review the pros and cons.
There was a time when auto makers could not seem to sell safety to customers.
How the times have changed.
Now some manufacturers are almost playing one-upmanship in the safety world.
Volvo has become a name synonymous with safe vehicles, but other makers are saying, ``Hey, Volvo's not the only company making safe vehicles''.
Saab, which has won Swedish awards for safety, has decided not to take a back seat.
It is letting people know it has built, and continues to build, safe vehicles.
At a presentation, Saab engineers showed how &UR; &LR; the company builds cars not for government-mandated crash tests but for ``real life'' situations, with crumple zones within the vehicle effective if the car is hit on an angle, not just straight on as in federal tests.
BMW and Mercedes-Benz are also getting out the message.
Mercedes has developed a number of safety features over the years that the company freely allows others to copy.
When it comes to a safe vehicle, driving a Mercedes has been compared to driving a tank.
It's a solid vehicle.
Ford is promoting its Windstar minivan as a safe vehicle.
It received the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's five-star award in crash test ratings.
The only other minivan to receive the award is the '98 Toyota Sienna.
Windstar offers such added features as standard foam and cushioning in the ceiling and window pillars to help reduce head injuries in a crash.
The Ford minivan comes with two options for even safer driving: side airbags designed for front-seat passengers to cushion both the head and torso in a side crash, and a reverse-sensing system that starts beeping when the bumper is 5.9 feet away from an obstacle and sounds more frequently as the vehicle gets closer to the object.
The beeping is heard only inside the minivan.
Almost all cars and most trucks now have dual front air bags as standard equipment.
More air bags, though, are on the way.
Since their introduction a couple of years ago, side airbags are beginning to show up in more and more vehicles.
The bags are mounted either in the front door panels or on the side of the front seats.
With the controversy over injuries and, in some cases, deaths as the result of airbag deployments, a number of vehicles now are equipped with ``second generation'' bags.
These units tend not to explode with the force of earlier versions.
Another recent change came about because of injuries and deaths to children caused by air bags activating in the front seat.
Many trucks, which tend to have only one seat, are now equipped with key-operated shut offs for the front passenger side air bag to prevent such injuries.
Mercedes-Benz is now offering its Baby-Smart seat system in all models.
When a baby seat that Mercedes offers is placed in the front, a sensor deactivates the air bag on that side of the car.
This year, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo added air bag ``curtains'' to some models.
The curtains cover just about the entire door.
BMW offers a tube-like airbag that extends across the top of the front doors to help protect the heads of front-seat passengers.
As of Sept.
1, manufacturers were required to add extra padding around windows to protect against head injuries.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the new curtain-style airbags are innovative technology that surpass the extra padding ruling.
Side-impact airbags have already found their way into low-priced cars such as the Toyota Corolla.
Some luxury makers are also adding these for rear seat passengers.
For true safety, however, the use of seat belts to hold driver and passengers in place is a key element.
Relying on the air bags alone won't do the trick.
Seat belts have also been greatly improved both for comfort and for holding one in place in the event of a sudden stop.
Some makers are giving added protection to avoid whiplash injuries.
Volvo has a new whiplash Protection System allowing the seat backrest and head restraint to shift backward during rear-end collisions.
The system, Volvo says, reduces the force resulting from rear impact by 50 percent.
Saab also offers a similar system.
Many luxury vehicles are providing driver-systems that sense steering and traction conditions and automatically adjust to prevent spinouts.
BMW is including one in its new 3-Series.
Antilock brakes have been hailed as almost more important in preventing accidents than airbags.
The brakes are intended to prevent cars from skidding on slippery surfaces during a sudden stop and to aid in stopping faster.
The problem with antilock brakes is many people don't know how to use them.
Unlike regular brakes, which many drivers learned to pump in emergencies, antilock brakes do the pumping automatically.
Drivers pumping antilock brakes make them less effective.
Mercedes-Benz now has a system called Brake-Assist that uses a computer to determine when the use of the brakes is an emergency.
When this situation occurs, the computer automatically adds extra pressure to the brakes.
Mercedes says stopping distances can be reduced by up to 45 percent.
Without proper and well-maintained tires on the vehicle, no brake is going to stop the car or truck effectively.
Having the right tires for your make and model and having them properly inflated are very important, in even the simplest of stops.
Corvette was one of the first to offer a device that warns of low air pressure.
The feature can now be found on other General Motors makes.
The system is tied to the antilock brake system.
When a sensor detects a loss of air, it triggers a warning light on the instrument panel indicating which tire is low.
Stopping by the side of the road to repair a flat tire can be one of the most dangerous things a motorist can do There are too many reports of motorists changing tires being struck by a passing vehicle.
Some '99s are coming with tires that are capable of running for a while with a complete loss of air _ long enough to find help or a safe place off the highway to change the tire.
Getting a better grip on the road is what all-wheel-drive is about.
With AWD _ not four-wheel-drive _ power is shifted to the wheel or wheels needing it most.
Even if traction is lost on three wheels, new systems from Jeep and Mercedes will shift the power to the one wheel with traction, keeping the vehicle from skidding on ice or snow.
AWD, once a feature associated with sport-utility vehicles, is now available in sedans and wagons from Subaru, Volvo, and Mercedes.
Another new safety feature expected to be adapted by many manufacturers is blue-tint headlights designed to give drivers better road sight at night.
High-intensity discharge, or HID, headlights illuminate by creating an electric arc between two electrodes in a bulb filled with xenon gas.
These new lights have been designed to help older drivers see better.

NHTSA estimates the new standards will increase costs by less than $100 per vehicle.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cars should be designed with child safety first in mind, especially in the back seat where most children ride, the head of a federal safety agency says.
Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, is taking that message to automakers in New York for the annual auto show there.
``Despite overwhelming statistics indicating the need for better protection for children, child passenger safety has been an afterthought when it comes to designing cars.
That needs to change,'' Hall said in remarks prepared for delivery Thursday at the World Traffic Safety Symposium, an event being held in conjunction with the New York International Auto Show.
``It's time to put children and their safety first in vehicle design,'' Hall said.
``We need look no further than the first-generation air bag to understand the consequences of not doing so''.
Air bags inflating in minor crashes have been blamed for killing 131 people, including 73 children.
Hall said crash tests that automakers must pass for federal safety compliance should include child dummies in the back seats to learn how well the vehicles protect them from head and neck injuries.
The back seat is now empty in those crash tests.
When children are in the car, they ride in the back seat about 70 percent of the time, according to the agency's analysis of federal crash data from 1996 and 1997.
Traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for children older than age 5.
This decade, more than 60,000 children, infants to teen-agers, have died in traffic crashes.
Hall said the Safety Board is urging automakers to: --Install shoulder belts in all rear seating positions in cars and light trucks, including the rear center seat where they are often missing.
--Make the shoulder belts in rear seats adjustable so that they can be lowered in height to properly fit across children's chests rather than rise up at their necks.
Most autos have adjustable shoulder belts only in the front seats.
--Stock more vehicles with built-in child seats.
In a speech in January, Hall announced the safety board was recommending a nationwide network of fitting stations to check that child seats are properly installed to protect children in auto crashes.
Government statistics indicate more than 80 percent of child seats are installed incorrectly.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- When you get your car brakes checked or an oil change at a DaimlerChrysler dealership next year, you also may be able to get expert advice on whether a child seat is being used correctly.
DaimlerChrysler AG is establishing a new service at about 20 percent of its dealerships to advise parents on how to install car seats to protect children.
DaimlerChrysler is the first automaker to accept a federal agency's challenge by creating a permanent free service using trained personnel to help customers fit child seats.
The company will spend more than $10 million annually and the service will be available at about 1,000 dealerships, company officials said today.
More than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed in autos.
Properly used child seats cut the risk of fatal injuries in half, according to government statistics.
``Parents need help to make sure their children are properly secured in those seats,'' Robert Eaton, DaimlerChrysler co-chairman, said at a news conference.
Also involved in the initiative, which will start in several pilot cities this year and be fully in place next year, are child-seat manufacturer Fisher-Price and the nonprofit National Safety Council.
Next year, DaimlerChrysler will have the capacity to conduct 800,000 inspections annually to make sure children are buckled properly and that child seats are properly installed in both new and older DaimlerChrysler vehicles, the company officials said.
By comparison, the National Safety Council estimates about 30,000 child seats a year are being inspected now at community events.
Over the next 16 months, DaimlerChrysler will be training 2,000 certified child-seat technicians in a 32-hour course -- doubling the current number in the United States.
There will be two per participating dealership.
The company's move follows a recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of ``fitting stations'' for child seats be established to prevent the deaths of children in automobile accidents.
Each year, frustrated parents struggle to install about 70 models of child car seats in hundreds of types of cars with different shapes of back seats, meaning there are ``potentially 100,000 different ways to confuse the average consumer,'' NTSB Chairman Jim Hall says.
This decade, more than 60,000 children have died in traffic crashes.
When Hall recommended the fitting stations, he envisioned them across the United States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle administration offices, fire stations and automobile dealerships.
Hall had said the initiative should be financed out of government transportation dollars, but he invited other groups and businesses to get involved.
Hall said at the press conference that DaimlerChrysler's effort went beyond what he suggested for the fitting stations.
``I am confident the other automobile manufacturers in our country will step forward now with their own programs,'' he said.
General Motors Corp.
also is considering some type of permanent fitting stations in its dealerships, spokesman Greg Martin said.
Since 1996, GM has worked with the National Safe Kids Campaign, a nonprofit group that promotes child safety, to hold weekend or daylong child-safety-seat checks at about 1,000 of the company's dealerships.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government should set up a nationwide network of fitting stations for child seats to help save children's lives in car crashes, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended Wednesday.
``The NTSB believes that the federal and state governments should be more directly involved in assuring that child safety seats are used correctly,'' said Jim Hall, the chairman of the safety agency.
Most parents do not know a child seat is improperly installed until after their child is killed or injured in a crash, Hall said.
Another safety agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says more than 80 percent of child car seats are used improperly.
If all children using child seats were restrained properly, 68 more lives would be saved annually, the agency estimated.
Frustrated parents struggle to properly install about 70 models of child car seats in hundreds of different types of cars each year, meaning there are ``potentially 100,000 different ways to confuse the average consumer,'' Hall said.
Properly used child seats reduce the risk of fatal injuries by more than 50 percent, he said.
The fitting stations could be established across the United States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle administration offices, fire stations or automobile dealerships, Hall said.
He said the initiative should be funded out of government transportation dollars but had no cost estimate.
The board can only recommend auto safety initiatives, but its recommendations carry great weight within the federal government.
Hall also reiterated other NTSB initiatives as part of a package the board believes would reduce child deaths and injuries in traffic accidents.
Among them: --Built-in child seats should be available in more cars and trucks.
Hall believed they should be used on airplanes and school buses as well.
``Isn't it unbelievable that regulations require everything to be secured on (airplane) takeoffs and landings -- everything except our smallest children,'' Hall said.
--All states should adopt laws that allow police to pull autos over when passengers are not wearing seat belts.
Seat belt surveys have shown when a driver is buckled, restraint use for children is 94 percent.
When a driver is unbuckled, restraint use for children is 30 percent.
--Children 12 and under should ride in the back seat.
--Children ages 4 to 8 should be properly secured in booster seats because they are not old enough to fit adult seat belts.
Child safety groups said permanent checkpoints would send a strong message about the importance of proper child seat installation.
``If we can do this, it will reduce the mortality of children (in car crashes) by at least 25 percent to 35 percent nationwide,'' said Martin Eichelberger, a surgeon at Children's National Medical Center and president of the National Safe Kids Campaign.
The NHTSA is set to announce early this year a federal requirement that all new child safety seats must have the same, simple anchoring system in new cars.
The average car is about 9 years old, however, underscoring the need for child seat fitting stations for the millions of vehicles already on the road, Hall said.
There used to be a joke that a Mercury is just a Ford with the bolts torqued tighter.
It was based on the perception _ correct in many cases _ that American cars were inferior to foreign models and that little differentiated one domestic from another.
Today, thanks in part to that foreign pressure, Americans shopping for domestic autos have plenty of quality from which to choose, even as many of these cars remain distinctly American in flavor.
The 2000 Mercury Sable LS is a case in point.
Redesigned this year _ lowered at nose and rear, a smooth line running up over windshield and high roof and linking the ends in a graceful arc _ the sedan is a sleeker looking car than in the past.
The Sable comes as a wagon, as well, and engine options include a pair of 3.0 liters, one turning out 153 horsepower, the other, 200 horsepower.
With the bigger engine I got just over 24 miles per gallon.
Inside, the car is big, broad American.
In the LS model tested, the leather seats are wide and firm, essentially five bucket seats.
The thigh support up front is very good, though bucket seats need better lateral support ridges than the Sable seats offer.
The dash is deep up top and angles away nicely below, affording plenty of legroom up front.
Rear legroom is ample, as well.
A new feature _ one that ought to catch on everywhere _ is height adjustment (about 3 inches) on the gas and brake pedals.
Push a button on the side of the driver's seat and the pedals come to or move away from you.
For short drivers, this means they no longer have to move the seat far forward, pushing themselves right up to the steering wheel and bluntly in the way of an exploding airbag.
Further safety enhancements include front and side airbags, seat belt pretensioners, belt use sensors, a driver's seat position sensor, and two inflation levels for the airbags, depending on the severity of a crash.
Also sure to become standard across the industry, the Sable has an interior emergency trunk release.
The instrumentation is spartan in a simple, good way.
Fuel, tachometer, speedometer, and engine temperature are in the display behind the wheel.
Window controls, door locks, and mirror controls are on the driver's door.
In the center grouping on the dash, arranged horizontally one above the other are audio controls up top, climate controls below.
Interior bins are adequate _ no large atlases, fine for standard folding maps _ and the trunk is cavernous.
A 60/40 split rear seat allows for longer parcels and items.
The LS Premium came with the DOHC, 24-valve, Duratec V6 engine.
Because of composite cam covers and intake manifold, it is 30 pounds lighter than the standard V6, yet cranks out 47 more horsepower.
Another sign of emerging quality: Tuneups come at 100,000-mile intervals.
The shift is a four-speed automatic with adaptive shift control, and in testing it ran itself up and down the gears smoothly and click-free.
Mercury, looking to lessen compartment noise, installed a lightweight instrument panel insulator, designed to absorb sound rather than just attempt to repel it.
The repel method can lead to vibrations and rattles, and the new insulation works quite well.
Engine noise was minimal, and even during rapid acceleration the engine _ muffled through a single exhaust engineered to keep the same backflow as the dual system it replaces _ was a distant burble.
Wind noise, however, was another matter, and it was so encompassing it was hard to tell if it was coming from mirrors, windows, or the sunroof.
The engine was plenty powerful _ I'm not sure I'd be happy with the lesser mill in this car _ and pulled the Sable up steep hills, and in and out of highway traffic, with confident surges.
My only performance complaint _ and I've noticed this in other Ford Motor Co.
products _ is a strange lag time, while the car is already rolling, right after you press the accelerator.
It's as if the engine is getting the message and taking a split second to decode it.
The ride?
Big American again, though stiffer laterally than in the past.
Suspension front and rear is fully independent, with gas-pressurized struts and stabilizer bars.
This makes the Sable firm on corners (and made me wish again for better lateral support up the sides of the leather seats), and agile in commuter traffic.
What I did not like was the front-to-rear, up-and-down bounce that uneven roads produced.
Looking out the windshield at times was like looking over the bow of a gently bobbing boat under headway.
Given 200 horsepower in a front-wheel-drive auto, there was remarkably little indication of torque steer.
It was evident only in quick, sharp-turn starts from a stop, a move you don't really need to make.
On wet pavement, from a stop, rapid starts did produce a bit of chatter up front.
The power-assisted, ABS brakes _ vented discs up front, drums in the rear _ brought the car to sure, swift stops, even from 50 m.p.h.
At $23,000 for this model, Mercury is getting into the territory of some very fine, lower-level luxury cars and sports sedans.
There is no reason to exclude the Sable out of hand, but anyone looking to spend that much money should certainly do some comparison shopping.
Nice touches: --The multi-folding section between the front seats.
The lower portion folds out and down, revealing storage and cup holders; the upper folds down and becomes an armrest.
--The use of the dead space ``V'' at the lower front of the front windows to house parts of the speaker system.
This is usually wasted space behind the mirror mounts.
Annoyances: --The removable carpet pads, front and rear, are thin and cheap.
At $23,000, I'd want better.
--The fold-down armrest between the front seats could be split at the middle and hinged, opening for more convenient storage space.

``Black boxes'' for cars, a technology borrowed from the airline industry, now are poised to help auto-accident investigators pin the blame on drivers responsible for causing crashes.
Since 1990, many General Motors and Ford cars and trucks have been equipped with a device similar to an airliner's black box, or flight data recorder, which automatically records the vehicle's speed, throttle setting, braking effort and engine rpm for each of the five seconds leading to an air-bag deployment.
Until now, however, it was difficult to extract that information from the car's air bag control module.
But a California company in March began selling a device that connects a car's onboard computer to a laptop computer to quickly extract such key information from a crashed vehicle.
The $2,500 device _ called a Crash Data Retrieval System _ is being marketed to police departments, insurance companies and auto-rental agencies to help them reconstruct crashes to determine fault.
``The system lets investigators collect objective, accurate data on crashes to enhance reconstruction (of accidents),'' said Jim Zaleski, president of Santa Barbara-based Vetronix Corp.
, which markets the device.
``This opens the door to a new generation of understanding and modeling automobile accidents,'' he said.
Some of the vehicles that have the capability to provide such data also can tell investigators whether the car's occupants were wearing seatbelts and whether the passenger-side air bag had been deactivated.
Most of the data that the system gives to crash investigators isn't new _ such information has been used for decades to reconstruct accidents, said Phil Haseltine, president of the Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety, an auto-industry funded group.
But investigators had to gather the information using other sources, such as tire skid marks, in the past.
Now they can get it from the vehicle's onboard computer.
``This technology isn't measuring anything new, but it is measuring it more accurately than in the past,'' he said.
``On the engineering side, it will help the design engineer find out whether safety systems work as well in real crashes as they do in laboratory crash tests.
I predict we will see crash data recorders used by more automakers as they install more advanced air-bag systems''.
But Haseltine and others, including officials at General Motors, say there are privacy issues that have kept the technology from advancing as rapidly as it could have.
The data that a police investigator or insurance adjuster extracts from the car's air-bag control module could be translated into hard evidence for use in prosecution of a driver who is at fault in an accident, or for use by plaintiffs in lawsuits over such accidents, critics warn.
Vetronix says it is in negotiations with the California Highway Patrol to provide the devices to its officers, and the company plans to market the system aggressively to police agencies and insurance companies nationwide.
``The capability to use this information in a intrusive manner is there, and we should all be vigilant to make sure nobody tries to do that,'' Haseltine said.
``Manufacturers aren't putting these systems in vehicles with the intention that just anyone would be able to access the information.
``Giving the technology to police investigators is a gray area,'' he said.
``If a judge orders it in a court case, it can eventually wind up in court.
But it's likely that we will only see that in very serious crashes with expensive litigation.
I can't imagine using it for every little fender-bender''.
General Motors has a ``strict policy that the data belongs to whoever owns or leases the vehicle, and it won't be accessed without their consent,'' said Terry Rhadigan, the automaker's safety spokesman.
But Vetronix promotes the system as something investigators can use almost immediately, at a crash site, to download the information, and there are concerns that such a situation sometimes might preclude getting a vehicle owner's permission.
The impetus to record this information to aid crash investigators came from the National Transportation Safety Board, which recommended in 1997 that automakers develop onboard collision-sensing and -recording devices.
The NTSB has long required that such equipment be installed on most modes of public transportation, including airliners, buses and trains.
But this is the first time the technology has been extended to private passenger cars.
So-called recordable air-bag modules have been installed in many General Motors vehicles since 1990, but it has just been recently that the data from an air-bag deployment or near-deployment could be easily downloaded for use by investigators.
``There is value to this data,'' GM's Rhadigan said.
``The more we know about how our vehicles perform in the real world, the more we can improve them.
It's another way to aid in accident reconstruction, along with eyewitness reports''.
&QL; (STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS).
&QL; &QL; At present, the Vetronix system is designed to download the information only from late-model GM vehicles, and Vetronix has obtained exclusive rights from GM to market a system to retrieve the data from those cars.
Those vehicles include the 1998 Buick Park Avenue and most '98 Cadillacs; most 1999 Buicks and Cadillacs, the Chevrolet Corvette and Camaro, and the Pontiac Firebird; and nearly all 2000 model Buicks, Cadillacs, Oldsmobiles, Pontiacs, Chevrolet cars and trucks (including sport-utilities), GMC trucks and sport-utilities, the Isuzu Hombre pickup, and the Saturn S-series cars.
Other manufacturers, including the Ford Motor Co.
, have air-bag control modules that record the same information.
Vetronix says its system can be readily adapted to read the data from the other manufacturers' vehicles as soon as those automakers release the technical data necessary to develop the retrieval software.
Vetronix also plans to develop software in concert with GM to retrieve the data from air-bag-equipped GM cars dating to 1990, company officials said.
For $2,495, Vetronix provides the crash data retrieval module and Windows-based software, along with the necessary cables to connect the device to the vehicle and a laptop computer.
The software puts the data into graphs that can be printed out, showing the vehicle's speed and other data for each of the five seconds preceding the air-bag deployment.
``The potential impacts of this product are immense, since about 18,000 tow-away crashes occur daily,'' Zaleski said.
For now, the system is tied to the air-bag activation computer, and manufacturers such as GM don't see the technology evolving into a full-scale black box setup like that used in airliners, Rhadigan said.
In planes, there is a flight data recorder that keeps track of the aircraft's physical movements, and a separate cockpit voice recorder that picks up whatever the pilots say.
``We see the automobile system used in just this air-bag application,'' Rhadigan said.
``We don't ever want people to think we're going to get to the point where we record conversations and other things that occur in airplanes.
Those are pretty sophisticated devices''.

KANSAS CITY, Mo.
-- You undoubtedly have heard about the ``black box'' federal investigators retrieve from an airplane after an accident to help understand what caused the crash.
Soon similar devices could be widely used in automobiles and other modes of transportation, giving crash investigators insight into drivers' behavior before an accident.
Some researchers view the black box as a way to improve automobile safety.
Other experts, while supporting the concept, say it needs to be looked at more critically.
Since the mid-1970s, General Motors Corp.
has installed a sensing module along with its airbags that measured and recorded airbag performance.
Beginning with the 1999 model year, GM began installing a more sophisticated device that captures five seconds of data before impact.
Now investigators can know when the driver applied the brakes in the seconds leading up to the crash, as well as the vehicle's speed, engine speed and gas-pedal position, and whether seat belts were being used.
The use of such devices is favored by doctors, engineers and government officials.
They say real-world crashes can provide valuable information on how crashes affect the human body.
Ultimately the data could provide insights on how to build safer cars and improve treatment of crash victims.
Convinced of the recorders' benefits, James Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, last month called for the devices on cars, trains, buses and ships.
``It is time for all modes of transportation to realize the unlimited potential that recorder technology has to offer, both in terms of economics and safety,'' he said at a board conference last month.
The board has placed the devices on its new ``most-wanted list'' of safety improvements.
The use of black-box systems raises concerns, however.
The biggest one is whether such information could be used against drivers in litigation.
``It has that potential,'' said Bob Langdon, senior partner of the Lexington, Mo.
, law firm of Langdon, Emison, Kuhlman &AMP; Evans.
As with any new technology, the courts or Congress will have to decide whether the data collected by the black boxes is admissible as evidence, he said.
As a trial lawyer, Langdon said he had concerns about who would be collecting the data, how it would be used, how accurate the devices were and how the information would be interpreted, especially if the data contradicted other physical evidence.
``Those are issues that need to be discussed in the near future,'' he said.
``It really needs to be looked at''.
GM conceded that such information might eventually be used in litigation, but the company said it also could be used against GM to prove some type of defect with a vehicle.
Despite his concerns, Langdon is quick to point out that he supports the use of such devices, because they will show how people and vehicles react in accidents.
``I see this as another tool to be used to save lives,'' he said.
The idea of a black box for automobiles is not new.
Technology that allows for its implementation is new.
An early version of the black box was part of GM's first regular-production driver-passenger airbag systems the company introduced as an option in selected 1974 production vehicles.
Since then the modules have become more sophisticated and are capable of gathering more data.
GM has installed its latest module in hundreds of thousands of GM cars from the 1999 model year.
Those cars include the Buick Century, Park Avenue and Regal; the Cadillac Eldorado, DeVille and Seville; the Chevrolet Camaro and Corvette; and the Pontiac Firebird.
GM plans to put the module in almost all of its vehicles in a few years.
``This will help us build an objective driver database,'' said Terry Connolly, director of GM's North American Safety Center.
``Currently we don't know how drivers react seconds and milliseconds before a crash''.
Connolly said this data would let auto manufacturers such as GM design better vehicles to protect passengers by understanding how drivers react to crashes.
While some people have expressed concerns that the device is an invasion of privacy, Connolly said those fears were unwarranted.
``This is a very benign set of data that is being collected,'' Connolly said.
``There is more personal information available on the Internet than what will be collected by these devices''.
Besides, he said, GM has to gain permission from the vehicle's owner before collecting the data after a crash.
Other automobile manufacturers have installed black boxes, too.
Ford Motor Co.
has installed data recorders in all of its 1999 models.
Ford's recorders collect a limited amount of data, said Jennifer Flake, a Ford safety spokeswoman.
She added that the Motor Vehicle Safety Research Advisory Council was looking into the use of recorders to determine what data would be the most helpful for researchers.
``The use of these modules is important so that we can improve our understanding of crashes and so that we have a better analysis of how injuries are coming about,'' said Jeffrey Augenstein, a professor of surgery and director of the William Lehman Injury Research Center at the University of Miami.
``With better understanding, we can better create countermeasures,'' he said.
Augenstein, a trauma surgeon, said the future of the devices was what interested him.
He said the next step would be to have the devices automatically notify emergency crews when a vehicle was involved in a crash.
``In many parts of the country, crashes occur in isolated areas, and nobody knows about it for some time,'' he said.
``With information from a (positioning system), emergency crews could know almost immediately where the car is and what occurred in the crash''.
GM offers such a system on some models under the name OnStar.
It notifies emergency crews when a car's airbag is deployed.
Also, the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration is testing a system in Buffalo, N.Y., that automatically notifies authorities of a crash.
Eventually emergency crews, Augenstein said, would be able to look at what occurred and know what type of injuries the victims most likely would be suffering.
``It is a very, very exciting time in automobile safety,'' Augenstein said.
``There is a lot of opportunity to improve the crash experience.
It would be nice to say we know how to prevent all crashes, but there will always be crashes, that is why they call them accidents.''
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The peace of mind offered by child car seats can be deceptively deadly when they are not properly used, and the government's chief transportation safety official says few are.
Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, asked states Monday to get moving on setting up ``fitting stations'' where parents go to have child restraints installed and checked.
Speaking to state highway safety officials in San Antonio, Hall offered a variety of proposals coinciding with the busy driving period of Labor Day holiday week.
Several were driven by the knowledge that car accidents are the No.
1 killer of children.
``Safety advocates know that children should be in child restraints up to the age of 4, in booster seats to the age of 8, and in the back seat,'' said Hall -- speaking in a state where 2-year-olds can be legally restrained by nothing other than a seat belt.
But ``not one of the 50 states has a child restraint law with all of these requirements in it''.
Indeed, no state requires booster seats for children 4 to 8, he said.
In January, the NTSB asked all states to set up fitting stations.
So far, two are doing so, New York and South Carolina.
Three others -- Hawaii, Idaho and Indiana -- are establishing sites where motorists can get trained in using the seats, according to the board.
Separately, DaimlerChrysler AG is setting up fitting stations in Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., Denver and Sacramento, Calif.
Hall also urged states to pitch the value of seat belts to black youths, who he said are half as likely as whites and Hispanics to use them.
If seat belt use were universal among young blacks, that could save 1,300 lives a year, he said.
He held out New Mexico's graduated licensing law as a fitting model as the number of young people behind the wheel increases an expected 22 percent by 2005.
The law requires a learning permit followed by an intermediate license, both restricting night driving and the number of young passengers allowed.
A full license is granted only with a clean record.
Hall praised DaimlerChrysler, but said ``states shouldn't wait for automakers to do something''.
``They need to take the lead by coordinating the establishment of permanent fitting stations'' -- perhaps at repair shops, firehouses, health centers or places where cars are annually inspected for safety, he said.
So far the federal government is not weighing in with much money to help.
About $90,000 is available for fitting station demonstration grants for two or three states in the next fiscal year, said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Housing and Construction Ministry has issued 2,600 new tenders for house constructions in the settlements of the West Bank, Israel Radio reported Sunday.
All those tenders were issued after the new government came to power in July and 1,000 of them were slated for Ma'aleh Adumim, and others for several Jewish settlements in the West Bank, the Radio quoted ministry officials as saying.
Ma'aleh Adumim is the largest settlement situated just east of Jerusalem with about 6,000 settlers.
It is called city instead of settlement now.
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are one of the thorny issues to be solved by Israel and the Palestinians during their final-status talks which have been launched September 13.
The Palestinian side has repeatedly asked Israel to halt the settlement expansions pending a final solution to this issue.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in his U.N. address on Wednesday has asked Israel again to immediately end the settlement expansions in the territories.
But Israel has declared to continue new house constructions in Ma'aleh Adumim, no matter what happens in the future.
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, during his visit to this settlement on September 15, pledged to the settlers there that he would, like the late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, continue to expand it.
Barak said that Ma'aleh Adumim "is part of Greater Jerusalem," which has triggered sharp criticism from the Palestinian side.
Faisal Husseini, Palestinian Minister for Jerusalem Affairs, said that the only future in store for Ma'aleh Adumim is "evacuation".
"Creating a mixture of Israeli settlements with Palestinian cities is nothing but a ticking time bomb that will only lead to situations like those in Kosovo," he added.
JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a move seen by critics as a slap in the face of U.S. peacemakers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to attend a ceremony Wednesday to confer city status on the Jewish West Bank settlement of Ariel.
Netanyahu's planned visit to Ariel came as U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was wrapping up her attempt to try to move Israeli and Palestinian leaders toward an agreement over a long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank.
Ariel is in the middle of the West Bank, 30 kilometers (18 miles) east of Tel Aviv.
Mayor Ron Nachman told The Associated Press that there are plans to increase the population of the city from 17,000 to 30,000 by building 3,000 new housing units.
Nachman said the ceremony was set long before Albright's visit to Ariel was arranged.
Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Nachman, an opponent of the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy accords, said the ceremony of declaring Ariel a city sends a message that Israel must strengthen its presence in the West Bank.
For more than two decades, U.S. governments have held that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and are obstacles to peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
Palestinians denounce the settlements as illegal incursions on their homeland.
Nachman said 400 new apartments will be ready for occupancy in April.
He said Ariel has permission to build 2,600 additional units, but that because of a slump in the building industry the work has not begun.
Approval for the 3,000 units was given before 1992, when Israel's previous, moderate government announced a freeze on construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
One of the first moves of Netanyahu's government in 1996 was to cancel the freeze.
Ariel was established in 1977.
Nahcman said raising the status of Ariel to city is significant as a symbol ```City' means permanence, `settlement' means temporary,'' he said.
Israel's ``Peace Now'' movement, which advocates an Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank in exchange for peace with the Palestinians, is planning a demonstration across from Ariel while the ceremony is in progress.
A Peace Now statement said that ``Netanyahu is spitting in Madeleine Albright's face'' by attending the ceremony.
``He is trying his best to sabotage the peace process,'' the group said.

JERUSALEM, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The finance committee of Israel's Knesset (parliament) agreed Wednesday to allot 20 million shekels (5 million U.S. dollars) for the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
The committee said the money was required because of the recent Israeli-Palestinian peace deal and it would be used for infrastructure work in order to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Israel Radio reported.
The decision came one day after the Knesset ratified the Palestinian-Israeli peace accord with a landslide majority, paving the way for the start of Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.
The accord signed last month in Washington envisages that Israel withdraws its troops from 13.1 percent of the West Bank in return for tougher Palestinian actions against Islamic militants.
On Sunday, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon encouraged settlers to grab as much land as they can before Israel begins its troop pullback.
Palestinian officials described Sharon's remarks as "a declaration of war," and the U.S. state department criticized the foreign minister of "undermining trust and confidence" between Israel and the Palestinians.
Without directly calling for a freeze of settlements expansion, the deal stipulates that the Israeli and Palestinian sides should refrain from taking any "unilateral step" to change the status quo of the West Bank.
But Israel holds that its policy to expand existing settlements has nothing to do with the agreement.
Meanwhile, Israeli police removed Jewish settlers occupying a remote hilltop west of the Kedumin settlement in northern West Bank.
Four settlers were detained and the mobile homes they set up were demolished.
But the settlers vowed to come back repeatedly.
The settlers began to establish mobile rooms near the hilltop Monday, a day after Sharon' remarks to encourage them to seize more land.
EL DAVID, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian officials said Thursday that eight new mobile homes set up in a remote area of the West Bank, half a mile from the nearest community, is a new settlement and a violation of peace accords.
Israel's military government in the West Bank said the trailers stood on land belonging to the El David settlement which is located on a hilltop about 800 meters, or half a mile, from the trailer park.
Under pressure from the United States and the Palestinians to halt settlement construction, Israel has said it would not build new settlements but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supports expanding new settlements to accommodate what he terms ``natural growth''.
The term is loosely defined and the Jewish settler movement usually plants trailer homes on hilltops near older, existing settlements, defines them as neighborhoods, and then slowly moves in families to the new area.
Land is at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Palestinians hope to create a future state on much of the West Bank land Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
But successive Israeli government have encouraged Jewish settlement in those areas and today some 150,000 Jewish settlers live throughout the West Bank.
Khalil Tufakji, chief cartographer for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority charged that the new trailers were the beginning of a separate settlement and not part of El David.
``It's a new location and new settlers will be there.
This is a violation of agreements,'' Tufakji told The Associated Press.
Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the military government, said the trailers were set up with the approval of the Israel's defense ministry and would not remain in the area permanently.
The trailers were set-up for a temporary period until a school can be renovated in the El-David settlement, Lerner said.
``Every settlement begins with a trailer.
They put up a trailer and then they start to build, I don't care what they call it,'' said Hagit Yaari, a spokeswoman for Israel's Peace Now movement, which monitors settlement construction.

JERUSALEM (AP) _ Nearly 6,000 new houses and apartments are under construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, while close to 3,000 are standing empty, a peace group said Wednesday.
The Israeli government authorized the construction despite the United States' call for a freeze in settlement expansion.
Peace Now, an Israeli group opposed to the government's settlement policy, visited all but two of Israel's 144 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza on Wednesday and counted 5,892 units under construction.
They also found 2,888 fully built housing units standing empty.
There are currently 42,000 housing units in the West Bank and Gaza, Peace Now leader Mosi Raz said.
The new building will increase the number of units by 15 percent, he said.
Last year, Peace Now counted 5,200 houses under construction.
``These counts prove, for the umpteenth time, that this government is pro-settlements, that building is steadily increasing and that there is no thought to the consequences,'' Raz said at a news conference.
Land is central to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because the Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza.
The Palestinians charge that expansion of the settlements is an attempt to pre-empt talks on a final peace settlement.
Peace Now teams visited every settlement save two.
They were prevented from entering the Itamar settlement by residents who confronted them at the gate, blocking their way in.
One settler was detained on suspicion of striking a press photographer traveling with the group.
The survey teams chose not to enter the settlement of Itzhar, where residents are still in mourning following the murder of two settlers there last week.
Israeli troops detained two Palestinians from a nearby village in connection to the killings on Tuesday.
Israel's Housing Ministry claimed that only 220 of the units under construction were government-funded.
Any other building was private, ministry advisor Moshe Eilat said.
However that statement was refuted by both Peace Now and Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, who both said that close to two-thirds of all housing units in the West Bank and Gaza were publicly funded.
All building in the settlements, public or private, must be approved by the Defense Ministry before it can go ahead.
Statistics Bureau figures from April _ the most recent month available _ reported 3,410 units under construction, of which 2,290 were public.
The Bureau's figures are based on reports provided by the settlements themselves and on estimates based on statistical models. dh-hla
JERUSALEM (AP) _ The army has asked Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to build fences around their communities, a proposal settler leaders rejected Tuesday as ineffective and an obstacle to future expansion.
The army's request came after several attacks on Jewish settlers by Palestinian militants, including the shooting deaths of two settlers outside the West Bank settlement of Itzhar last month.
The army said it sent the request to settlements that don't have a security fence yet.
Israel army radio said 21 of 144 settlements, including Maaleh Adumim and Givat Zeev near Jerusalem, were asked to build fences.
Settler leaders said fences were ineffective and would create a siege atmosphere.
``They (the army) should close off the (Palestinian) villages since the attacks come from them,'' said Yehudit Tayar, spokeswoman of the Jewish Settlers Council.
Benny Kashriel, mayor of Maaleh Adumim, said he would not meet the army's request because it would send the wrong message to residents.
``In Tel Aviv and Jerusalem there were also attacks but does that mean we should fence in the city centers,'' he said.
Settlers also oppose such boundaries since they might be an obstacle to future expansion.
The Peace Now group, which advocates the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, said the settlers' refusal to build fences showed that their opposition to a land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians was not based on security concerns, as they claim.
``Peace Now calls on the government to evacuate each settlement that refuses to be enclosed by a fence,'' Peace Now said.

JERUSALEM, April 12 (Xinhua) -- In defiance of fresh U.S. criticism over increasing Jewish settlement activities in the West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday pledged to further expand settlement construction.
"We have done a lot, and we will do a lot more," Netanyahu said while touring an industrial park under construction on empty land between two Jewish settlements in the West Bank, according to local television reports.
He symbolically signed a contract worth 1.7 million U.S. dollars for the first structure at the park, situated between the Jewish settlements of Psagot and Adam in central West Bank and planned for high-tech industry.
Netanyahu's tour came only one day after a senior U.S. envoy publicly slammed Israel's intensified settlement activities in the West Bank in recent months.
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Netanyahu, visiting U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Martin Indyk Sunday reiterated that Washington is "concerned" about the ongoing expansion of settlements.
"We work very hard to ensure that unilateral actions on the Palestinian side are not taken...and we also have a responsibility to ensure that other actions aren't taken that can affect and prejudge the negotiations," he said.
Last week in Washington, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon that the settlement activities violate agreements signed by Israel and the Palestinians, which ban any unilateral actions by both sides.
Netanyahu said Israel has never agreed to limit the expansion of existing Jewish settlements.
Since the hard-line prime minister came to power in 1996, millions of shekels have been funnelled to the construction of new Jewish settlements or expansion of existing ones, and the Jewish population of the West Bank has grown by 30 percent.
Ehud Barak, his main rival in the May elections for prime ministership, accuses Netanyahu of giving in to Jewish settlers to ensure their support for his power.
During his visit to the industrial park, Netanyahu asked some 100 settlement leaders to work for his re-election.
In a related development in the West Bank, settlers moved four tents onto a hill near the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba outside Hebron Monday.
The settlers claimed the hilltop was within Kiryat Arba's perimeter, but Israeli soldiers declared it a closed military area and ordered them to leave.
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Army ordered Thursday to set up a force of civilian guards to protect Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, an army statement announced.
Under an order signed by Uzi Dayan, commander of Israeli Army's Central Command, the civilian guards will be operational within the next few weeks, first at some large settlements such as Ma'ale Adumin, Ariel and Givat Ze'ev, the statement said.
Ma'ale Adumin is situated by the road linking Jerusalem and the West Bank city Jericho, Ariel located between Ramallah and Nablus, and Givat Ze'ev between Ramallah and Jerusalem.
They are the three largest settlements in the West Bank.
Although the army did not give the reasons for setting up such forces, it is believed that this step is aimed at strengthening the settlements and allay security concerns by the settlers.
Since its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast War, Israel has created over 190 Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories, of which 173 are scattered across the West Bank.
The total population of Jewish settlers stands at around 150,000 and this figure does not include those settlers living in the Arab East Jerusalem, which has also been occupied by Israel since 1967.
Jewish settlements is one of the outstanding obstacles that block the progress in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, that has been halted since Israeli construction of the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem in early 1997.
Israeli government's move to create the civilian guards forces also came amid reports that Israel and the Palestinian National Authority are close to reaching an agreement on Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank.
If Israel accepts the U.S. proposal for a 13 percent pullback, about 18 Jewish settlements in the West Bank are likely to be turned into isolated islands surrounded by Palestinian-controlled areas.
Citing their security concerns, the settlers have been lobbying rightwing members of the government to disrupt any agreement on further redeployment.
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Ministry protested on Wednesday against the European Union's decision to boycott settlement products from Israel by imposing heavy customs duties.
In a statement, the Foreign Ministry said that the EU decision is "unfair" and would be "harmful" to reviving the Middle East peace process.
The EU on Wednesday decided to ask all its 15 members not to exempt customs duties for products made by Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.
These include agricultural products, processed foods, wines, flowers and others.
The statement accused that the EU's decision violated the trade agreements signed with Israel, which give partial or complete exemption from customs duties to Israeli products of these categories.
The EU said that the occupied territories are not part of Israel, and therefore the settlement products would be subjected to heavy customs duties.
In April, EU threatened to imposed customs duties on products from Israeli settlements.
Israel was making diplomatic efforts to block the EU move, which it regarded as a grave threat politically rather than economically.
There are about 190 Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
In Gaza alone the number is 19.
The settlements which encroach on ever-more Palestinian lands, are armed enclave constantly guarded by Israeli soldiers who often outnumbered the settlers themselves.
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The new housing construction tenders for settlement expansion in the Israeli-occupied Arab territories would seriously jeopardize the peace process with the Palestinians and Syrians, said an Israeli peace group here Sunday.
After learning that Israeli Housing and Construction Ministry has issued tenders for building 2,600 new houses for Jewish settlers in West Bank settlements, the Peace Now group said this action will cause more trouble for the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks The number of new tenders issued by the ministry exceeds the total number issued in the three years' tenure of the previous government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, the satement added.
The group is scheduled to ask Prime Minister Ehud Barak to explain the government's policy toward the settlement expansion, the statement said.
Meanwhile, Education Minister Yossi Sarid expressed his objection to settlement expansion in the West Bank, including the new tenders.
Housing and Construction Minister Yitzhak Levy, from the National Religious Party, said Sunday the tenders were issued under the government's guidelines.
Israel Radio reported earlier that all those 2,600 tenders were issued after the new government came to power in July and 1,000 of them were slated for Ma'aleh Adumim, the largest settlement east of Jerusalem with about 6,000 settlers.
Israel calls Ma'aleh Adumim a city, instead of settlement.
The other tenders were for several Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is one of the thorny issues to be solved by Israel and the Palestines during their final-status talks which has been launched on September 13.
The Palestinian side has repeatedly asked Israel to halt the settlement expansions pending a final solution to this issue.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a speech in the United Nations on Wednesday asked Israel again to immediately end the settlement expansions in the territories.
But Israel has declared to continue new house constructions in Ma'aleh Adumim, not matter what happens in the future.
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, during his visit to this settlement on September 15, pledged to the settlers there that he will continue to expand it.
Barak said that Ma'aleh Adumim "is part of Greater Jerusalem".
The Palestinian side strongly criticized Barak for making such remarks.
Faisal Husseini, Palestinian Cabinet Minister in charge of Jerusalem Affairs, said "the only future in store for Ma'aleh Adumim is evacuation".
"Creating a mixture of Israeli settlements with Palestinian cities is nothing but a ticking time bomb that will only lead to situations like those in Kosovo," he added.
CAIRO, November 29 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority (PA) has accused the Israeli settlement policy of aiming to prevent the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and isolating Jerusalem from the West Bank through building new Jewish settlements.
The PA made the accusation in a memorandum to be presented to an emergency session of the Cairo-based Arab League due to start Sunday.
The extraordinary meeting of the league's 22 permanent members, called at the request of Syria and the PA, will discuss new Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Golan Heights.
The settlement issue has underlined the trend of the policy adopted by the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, said the document.
Palestinians, infuriated by Netanyahu's pledge of more Jewish settlements, complain that the Jewish settlements have broken up the territories between their main cities and diminished their chances of establishing an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The memorandum reviewed the Israeli policy regarding Jerusalem, settlements, confiscation of Palestinian lands, and pushing Jewish immigrants in Jerusalem to the holy city of Judaize.
It also noted the fact that Israel has earmarked a huge budget for the settlement policy, while leaving Jerusalem suffering from deterioration in all utilities and services.
It shows that Israel has adopted an extremist policy against the Palestinians and the Syrians in the occupied lands, the memorandum concluded.
CAIRO, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to a U.N. conference on Monday urged Israel to halt construction of Jewish settlements in Palestinian areas and adhere to the peace agreements signed between the two sides.
Speakers at the opening session of the two-day fourth meeting of the U.N.
Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People criticized Israel's settlement policies.
"Building of new settlements and expansion of the existing ones have destructive effects on the Mideast peace process," said Seyyid al-Masri, Egypt's assistant foreign minister.
The international community was surprised over Israel's construction work at the Abu Ghneim Mountain and Ras al-Amoud settlements and the expansion of the Maali Adumim settlement, al-Masri said.
Israel's activities have aroused fears over the devastating consequences of its settlement policy on the peace process, he added, calling on Israel to halt the settlement activities.
Israel, which always has ignored such discussions, did not send a delegate to the meeting.
U.N. officials and delegates from member countries also started preparations for a meeting in Geneva next month that could start a process for dealing with Jewish settlements under international laws.
That meeting, called by the U.N.
General Assembly, is to urge Switzerland to enforce a ban on settlement activities in the Israeli-occupied territories as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.
The Palestinians maintain that construction of Jewish settlements in Arab East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip violates the convention, which calls for protection for civilians in wars.
The convention bans usurpation of land by an occupying power.
In a letter to the meeting, U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan called on the Palestinians and Israel to focus on building peace.
"I appeal for the political courage of the leaders on both sides and call upon them to re-embark on the negotiations process in the spirit of pragmatism and statesmanship," Annan said in the letter read on his behalf by his deputy, Chinmaya Gharekhan.
Israel and the Palestinians have failed to hold substantive peace talks largely due to Israel's settlement activities since hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in 1996.
JERUSALEM, April 11 (Xinhua) - A senior U.S. official Sunday expressed Washington's deep concern over the ongoing Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank, saying it will hamper the peace making between Israel and the Palestinians.
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Martin Indyk urged Israel to stop these activities which "can affect and prejudge the negotiations".
Indyk arrived in Israel earlier Sunday for talks to enhance the U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding on Strategic Cooperation, which was signed in October last year and designed to improve Israel's defense and deterrence capabilities.
He said the U.S. and its principal ally in the Middle East should remain coordinated in face of threats of ballistic missiles and non-conventional weapons in the region.
But he said the strategic cooperation also has another aspect, that is, to look for ways to move forward the stalled peace process.
"The window of peacemaking is closed," he said, citing the frozen agreement between Israel and the Palestinians and the stalemate on the Israeli-Syrian track.
He said "some questions have occurred" concerning the U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation, referring to the Jewish settlement activities in the West Bank, "particularly in central West Bank".
For the last two months, Washington has expressed its concern on several occasions over Israel's land grabbing and settlement expansion in the West Bank, saying it is a reversal of Israeli assurance that such activity would not be carried out.
According to Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, both sides should not take unilateral actions which will change the status quo in Gaza and the West Bank before the talks on final status end.
Washington said unilateral actions include Jewish settlement activity on the Israeli side and a unilateral declaration of statehood by the Palestinians.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright raised the settlement issue during talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon in Washington last Friday.
Earlier this year, U.S.
Middle East envoy Dennis Ross bluntly dismissed the settlement activity as "destructive" to the peace process.
Reacting to Indyk's remarks, Netanyahu repeated the government's line that Israel has pledged not to build new settlements but never promised to stop the expansion of existing settlements.
Washington has, however, said that the accelerated Jewish settlement activity in the recent months included construction of new settlements as well as an expansion of settlements well beyond their existing perimeters, in many cases involving expansions to distant hilltops.
JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a move seen by critics as a slap in the face of U.S. peacemakers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is to attend a ceremony Wednesday to confer city status on the Jewish West Bank settlement of Ariel.
Netanyahu's planned visit to Ariel came as U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was wrapping up an attempt to try to move Israeli and Palestinian leaders toward agreement over a long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank.
Ariel is in the middle of the West Bank, 30 kilometers (18 miles) east of Tel Aviv.
Mayor Ron Nachman told The Associated Press that there are plans to increase the population of the city from 17,000 to 30,000 by building 3,000 new housing units.
Nachman said the ceremony was set long before Albright's visit to Ariel was arranged.
Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar-Illan, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Nachman, an opponent of the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy accords, said the ceremony of declaring Ariel a city sends a message that Israel must strengthen its presence in the West Bank.
Ariel was established in 1977.
Nachman said raising the status of Ariel to city is significant as a symbol ```City' means permanence, `settlement' means temporary,'' he said.
For more than two decades, U.S. governments have held that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal and are obstacles to peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
Palestinians denounce the settlements as illegal incursions on their homeland.
Israel's ``Peace Now'' movement, which advocates an Israeli withdrawal from most of the West Bank in exchange for peace with the Palestinians, is planning a demonstration across from Ariel while the ceremony is in progress.
A Peace Now statement said that ``Netanyahu is spitting in Madeleine Albright's face'' by attending the ceremony.
``He is trying his best to sabotage the peace process,'' the group said.
JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a show of solidarity with the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel's Arab community on Friday announced a boycott of 120 goods made in Jewish settlements.
The Palestinians hope to establish a future state in the West Bank and Gaza, and fear independence will be increasingly difficult to attain with the expansion of the Jewish settlements.
Israel's nearly 1 million Arabs often have split identities.
While citizens of Israel, many also support the aspirations of their brethren in the West Bank and Gaza.
The decision to boycott settlement products was made by a group of Israeli Arab leaders, including legislators and mayors, on Thursday.
Starting Monday, a list with 120 products to be boycotted, including ice cream, canned foods and sweets, will be posted in Arab-owned shops and published in Arabic-language media, Ahmed Saad, a member of Israel's parliament, said Friday.
``We expect that the citizens will fully comply with the boycott because they are politically aware of our goal,'' Saad said.
Jewish settler leaders said they might retaliate by not employing Arabs in the settlements.
About 17,000 Palestinians from West Bank and Gaza as well as thousands of Israeli Arabs work in the settlements, the Jerusalem Post daily said.

JERUSALEM, August 2 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government today authorized simpler procedure for granting permission for Jewish constructions in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in a bid to ease the settlement building freeze imposed by the previous government.
The decision was made during today's weekly cabinet session, following a series of meetings between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and leaders of the settlements last month.
Netanyahu reportedly accused, at the cabinet meeting, the previous government of handicapping the natural developments of Jewish settlements, while failing to impose same restrictions on Palestinian buildings.
He noted that the building of a kindergarten in the Jewish settlements used to be approved by a special ministerial committee in the last four years, calling it "discrimination" of Jewish settlers.
The Israeli premier declared that it will no longer continue like that, and from now on, only he himself and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordehai would give the greenlight.
However, he stressed that any proposal to build new settlements would still require a special full cabinet approval.
Israeli media pointed out that the message appeared to be that the freeze of settlement activity is over, although no operative decision was made at today's cabinet meeting.
In reaction to the cabinet decision regarding to the settlements, the Council of Jewish Settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip warmly welcomed the decision.
However, the council also expressed its disappointment that there has been no decision on actual developments and buildings of the Jewish settlements.
Also today, Knesset (Israel's parliament) member of Meretz, Yossi Sarid said he had information on government plans for an unprecedented settlement campaign.
Sarid, environment minister in the previous Labor-led government, charged that the settlement activity was the biggest enemy of the peace process.
Former Finance Minister Avraham Shohat also added his voice to the criticism, warning the government's decision would lead to large scale of investments in the settlements, and would lead to reductions in American loan guarantee.
JERUSALEM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat today urged Israel to cease settlement construction and refrain from actions against Arab residents in East Jerusalem.
Speaking on a tour to the West Bank city of Jenin, Arafat said that Israel should abide by the interim agreement it has signed and not attempt to alter it.
He criticized Israel's moves of continuing the building of settlements in the territories including East Jerusalem, and canceling state of permanent residents for Arabs living in East Jerusalem.
The Palestinian leader said that "the Palestinians were stronger than the settlements and stronger than the settlers".
He added the PNA leadership had decided to conduct dialog with the opposition of the Israeli government in its struggle against the expansion of settlements.
Arafat's call came a day ahead of the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian talks on further implementing the interim agreement.
The talks signaled the continuation of the peace process following Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron last month.
The resumption of the talks was agreed in the summit held last Sunday between Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
Eight joint panels will start negotiations Sunday to discuss economic and security issues related to the interim agreement, including the opening of safe passages between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the construction of an airport and sea port in Gaza, and the development of economic and security cooperation.
The Israeli negotiating team will be headed by Foreign Minister David Levy and the Palestinian one by Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas (or Abu Mazen).
A day earlier, Arafat convened a joint meeting of the Palestinian Council and PLO Executive Committee in the West Bank city of Jericho.
The meeting condemned Israel for failing to respond to the messages issued by the council on the settlement issue, and called on Palestinians to continue fighting against the settlements.
The Palestinian leadership also adopted a resolution to grant health, housing and financial assistance to the 30 Palestinian women detainees released by Israel earlier this week.
GAZA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official Tuesday repeated objection to the continued expansion of Jewish settlements, saying it could prevent the beginning of the final status negotiations and destroy the peace process.
"Settlements will have a negative affect on the position of Palestinian negotiators, it will destroy the peace process," said Nabil Abourudeneh, advisor to Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat.
Abourudeneh made the remarks in the West Bank city of Ramallah after a meeting between Arafat and visiting Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, during which the two leaders discussed the latest development in the peace process.
The Palestinians, who regards Jewish settlements as violation of signed agreements, have been angered by the Israeli cabinet's approval of the construction of 2,600 new housing units in four West Bank settlements this week.
Arafat has condemned the decision on several occasions.
PNA Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo went further by calling it "crazy decisions".
Israel denied it was expanding settlements, saying all the new housing units are within the borders of existing settlements.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who took office in July with a pledge to revive the stalled peace process, said that he will neither build new Jewish settlements nor dismantle existing ones.
In a move apparently aimed to appease the Palestinians, an Israeli ministerial committee reviewing the settlement policy of the former right-wing government met Sunday for the first time and identified seven settlements as illegal.
The seven outposts were among the 42 settlements established in the three years of the former Israeli government.
The accelerated settlement activity in the last three years was seen as an attempt by the settlers to grab as much as land before Israel and the Palestinians entered the final status talks, in which the thorniest issues including the fate of settlements will be dealt with.
Israel and the Palestinians held a ceremony on September 13, kicking off the long-overdue talks, but the Israeli side has yet to name its negotiators.
JERUSALEM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel will begin from next week to dismantle 12 Jewish encampments in the West Bank under an agreement reached between the government and settler leaders, the Prime Minister's Office said Thursday.
Danny Yatom, political and security advisor to Prime Minister Ehud Barak, met settler leaders here Wednesday night.
The two sides agreed to remove 12 hilltop outposts instead of 15 as decided earlier by Barak.
Of the 12 outposts, one will remain as pasture land and another as a preparatory school through the end of the school year and their future will then be discussed.
The settler leaders, who had opposed Barak's decision, said they were satisfied with the results and promised that they would help facilitate the evacuations.
Commenting on this issue, President Ezer Weizman said that the dismantlement of the illegal encampments is necessary and the result could help push the peace process forward.
After the first meeting Sunday of a ministerial committee reviewing the policy on Jewish settlements under former right-wing government, Barak informed Jewish settler leaders Tuesday that he plans to dismantle 15 encampments illegally built in the West Bank.
Barak said his decision was based on the recommendations from the defense establishment, which found that settlers have established 42 encampments throughout the West Bank since the signing of the Wye River peace accord last fall and their legalities were all in question.
"I consider settlement activities in the West Bank, which was always conducted at the behest and with the authorization of the government, very important.
But I think the law is of utmost importance," Barak told the leaders.
The Palestinians regard Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as illegal and demand that Israel evacuate all 144 settlements in these areas.
They were angry with Barak for approving the construction of 2,600 new housing units this week in four settlements near Jerusalem, saying the settlement expansion could prevent the start of the final status talks and destroy the peace process.
Israel denied it was expanding Jewish settlements, saying that the new housing units are all within the borders of existing settlements.
One month after a ceremonial start, Israel has yet to name its negotiators in the final status talks, in which the fate of the Jewish settlements will be dealt with.
The Palestinians accused Israel of foot-dragging.
WASHINGTON, April 4 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration today expressed concerns over a new Israeli plan to expand the existing Jewish settlement on the West Bank and near Jerusalem, indicating such a move will further erode confidence between the Israelis and Palestinians.
During a photo session with Norway's Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godfal, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters that she raised the issue during a meeting Thursday with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
"It's a very delicate moment in the whole situation, where it's very important to do everything we can to rebuild the bonds of confidence.
Within that context, I expressed my concern to Minister Mordechai about the thickening of the settlement," she said.
Mordechai announced this week that there is a plan to add 358 housing units to the West Bank settlements of Jenin and Sharei Tikva and several thousand near Jerusalem.
And he told a Jewish group in Washington today that the existing settlements "must be able to develop and grow".
The Clinton administration has opposed construction of new settlements as complicating to territorial negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, but said expansion of existing ones wasn't a problem as long as it was a product of "natural growth".
But this time, the Clinton administration expressed "concerns" as it is at a sensitive time.
JERUSALEM (AP) _ Coinciding with the start of a Mideast summit, Israel radio reported Thursday that bulldozers are leveling ground for the 12-fold expansion of a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
The Israeli group Peace Now said the construction site is more than 1 kilometer (mile) away from the Alei Zahav settlement.
The building constitutes the start of a new settlement, not the expansion of an existing one, the group said.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised the United States and the Palestinians that he will not start new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but only expand existing ones to accommodate natural population growth.
The Palestinians say settlement construction is part of an illegal land grab by Israel and undercuts their claims to statehood in the West Bank and Gaza.
Israel radio said the Defense Ministry has approved the construction of 1,200 homes near Alei Zahav, which is located about 5 kilometers from the invisible line between Israel and the West Bank.
Peace Now said Alei Zahav has about 100 homes now.
Project manager Arieh Ofri told the radio that in the first stage, 100 homes would be built and future construction would depend on demand.
``This is a very desirable area,'' Ofri said, noting the proximity of the settlement to Israel and the Tel Aviv metropolitan area.
``So far, everything that has been built has been sold''.
Peace Now leader Mossi Raz said that calling the project an expansion of Alei Zahav was a ruse.
He said that while the construction was taking place within the municipal boundaries of Alei Zahav, in fact a new, separate community was being built.
``Legally, it's not a new settlement, but for all intents and purposes, it is, to any rational person,'' Raz said.

AMMAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Serious differences arose between Jordan and Israel over a planned expansion of Jewish settlement in the West Bank, Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher has said.
"I've clarified the Jordanian position regarding the settlements and stressed that this constitutes a threat to the peace process," said Muasher Friday when concluding a four-day visit to Israel.
"There are big differences between the Jordanian and Israeli perspectives on the issue of settlements," Muasher said after his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Natanyahu in West Jerusalem, according to Jordan radio.
Muasher's remarks coincided with an Israeli government decision Friday to give tax breaks and generous grants to Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a move that could entice more Israelis to settle in the occupied area.
The decision would likely boost construction and investment in the 144 Jewish settlements.
The Palestinians sharply opposed the settlement expansion and warned that it would lead to the collapse of the peace efforts.
Muasher told Israel TV Thursday that Jordan was committed to working with Israel "to protect the achievements" of peace, but warned that Netanyahu's policies were endangering them.
Muasher, who was Jordan's first ambassador to Israel following the kingdom's 1994 peace treaty with the Jewish state, cited the settlement expansion plans and the delays in implementing the Israeli-Palestinian accords in particular.
He said Friday that the construction of new settlements in Ras Al Amud area in Jerusalem and the Israeli cabinet decision to provide additional facilities to the settlement activity posed a threat to the Arab-Israeli peace process.
Muasher said that during his meetings with Israeli officials, he stressed Jordan's keen interest and desire to work with all peace-loving forces to push the peace process forward, and to block all attempts to abort the peace process.
A statement issued by Netanyahu's office said the prime minister assured Muasher that Israel was still committed to the Middle East peace process.
"The Israeli government remains committed in the peace process with the Palestinians and respects the peace treaty signed with Jordan," the statement said.
"Israel is conscious of Jordan's needs for stability and prosperity," Netanyahu told Muasher, according to the statement.
GAZA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel confiscated 17,000 donums (1,596.3 hectares) of Palestinian land in 1998 to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and 154 Palestinians were killed in conflicts triggered by the expansion activities, said an official report.
The Jewish settlement activities also led to the destruction of 20,000 trees and 157 Palestinian houses, the withdrawal of the identity cards of 420 Palestinian citizens living in Jerusalem, said an annual report issued on Tuesday by the Palestinian National Committee on Settlement Combat.
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza reached 200, with settlers to be 170,000 by the end of the year 2000.
The Israeli authorities issued tenders for building 3,000 housing units early last July, the report said.
On Monday, the ongoing settlement activities led to the suspension of the Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks that deal with thorny issues including the future of the Israeli settlements.
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Disputing the government's defense of its expansion of Jewish settlements, the Israeli peace group Peace Now revealed in a survey Thursday that a large number of housing units in settlements are vacant.
The Peace Now survey showed that at least 2,880 housing units in the Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories of West Bank and Gaza Strip are vacant.
Peace Now, the leading Israeli peace organization supporting the Middle East peace process, also revealed that there are still 5,892 new housing units now under construction in various settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip because of the Likud-led government's policy of encouraging the settlement expansion.
The survey said the population growth rate at the Jewish settlements is only 3.2 percent, while the housing construction is increasing at a rate of 15 percent despite the oversupply of housing.
These results refuted the Likud government's claim that the construction of new housing units in settlements is necessitated by rising housing demand caused by the natural growth of the population of settlers.
Last year, the U.S. government issued a similar report on the housing situation in the settlements which also showed that a large number of units were vacant.
Israeli government strongly denied the report, saying that the settlements faced a housing shortage due to the growth of their population.
The Peace Now survey was conducted by 20 teams that it sent to settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to inspect the housing situation there.
Photographer Yoav Leff of Israel's newspaper Ha'aretz, hired by the Peace Now to document the activities of the Peace Now, was attacked and slightly injured Wednesday by a group of settlers in the Itamar settlement near the West Bank city Nablus.
Israel has built 190 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip since it captured them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War.
Settlement expansion is one of the most sensitive disputes in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which have been stalled since March 1997 when Israel broke ground for the Har Homa settlement in the disputed Arab East Jerusalem.
The previous Labor government in Israel froze the settlement expansion in order to conduct peace talks with the Palestinians, but the right-wing Likud government immediately revoked the ban after it came to power in mid-1996.
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Activists from Israel's Peace Now movement scuffled with Jewish settlers Friday when they toured a hilltop near a West Bank settlement to monitor what they called illegal settlement expansions.
The activists and settlers pushed and sometimes threw punches at each other on the hilltop about three miles from the settlement of Itamar in central West Bank, Israel Radio reported.
The visitors called the outposts set up by the settlers illegal, but a spokesman for the settlers said the camps were within the range of Itamar and called the tour of the activists provocative.
The tour was cut short at a nearby settlement of Berakha, where Israeli soldiers barred the activists from entering, declaring it a closed military zone.
Right-wing legislator Uzi Landau from the Likud party called on Prime Minister Ehud Barak to ban similar "provocative visits" by members of Peace Now, a watchdog monitoring settlement activities in the West Bank and Gaza.
Since taking office early last month, Barak has pledged to move forward the peace process stalled under the three years of rule by his hard-line predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu.
But he has been at odds with the Palestinians over Jewish settlements.
The Palestinians have urged Barak to dismantle all the settlements, calling them illegal and inconsistent with peace accords signed by the two sides.
Barak has promised to halt building of new settlements, but vowed not to remove existing ones before Israel and the Palestinians enter the final-status talks.
The ex-army chief has said that large blocs of Jewish settlements would remain under Israeli control after a permanent peace accord was reached as a result of the final-status talks.
Earlier this week, Peace Now said that Jewish settlements are expanding under Barak's government at a faster pace than under the Netanyahu government.
The group said in the month since Barak took office, the Housing Ministry has issued tenders for the construction of 1,517 apartments in the settlements, six times the average monthly rate of house construction in the settlements under the former government.
The Housing Ministry said the figures were incorrect and tenders had been issued for only 678 new homes.
Nearly 200,000 Jewish settlers live in more than 150 settlements which scattered in the West Bank and Gaza, dividing the areas into many isolated parts.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Kim Dunderdale doesn't have to worry about her kids running into violence at school -- they're at home, like thousands of others across the country.
``When we first decided to home school our oldest daughter, we didn't say we wanted to keep our children out of public school and away from all the horrible things that go on there,'' said Dunderdale, a Pittsburgh woman who teaches three of her five children, the oldest of whom is in eighth grade.
``But over the years, we are glad our children are shielded from those things,'' she said.
Last week's shootings at a Littleton, Colo.
, high school that left 15 people dead reminded the more than 700,000 U.S. families that teach their children at home why they chose to take their children out of school.
Many abhor what they consider immorality, violence and peer pressure in the nation's school systems.
``I am trying to shelter them from negative influences, foul language, lack of respect for authority, lack of respect for themselves or others.
It is those kinds of things that led to the Littleton thing,'' said Kurt Boese of Lodi, Calif.
, where he home schools his three children.
Teaching children at home has gradually moved into the educational mainstream.
Unlike 15 years ago, each state now recognizes the parental right to home school and all states have legislation or case law governing academic standards.
An estimated 1.7 million children are taught at home across the country, according to the Home School Legal Defense Association.
The reasons given by parents are varied -- religious guidelines, the desire to spend more time with their kids, a better education, concern about morals taught at school.
It is a burden, however.
``Home schooling your children because you fear violence and fear what will happen to them will not take you through the rough times,'' said Cindy McKeown, a mother of four from Middletown.
``It is a tremendous sacrifice of time, finances.
You have to home school because you believe it is the best option for this child''.
And home schooling cannot prevent tragedy or keep kids from growing up, said Ruth Blount, who home schools her six children in Nantucket, Mass.
``There's always a risk with children.
Something horrible could happen in our family even if we home school,'' Mrs.
Blount said.
``At a certain point, your kid's going to have to choose on their own.
But when you home school, you have the time with them to plant those seeds more easily.''
The technology of home schooling has provided business opportunities on several levels.
Tammy and Dan Kihlstadius, a Bloomington, Minn.
, couple with seven home-schooled children, established an online computer reselling business and software review publication catering to Christian home schoolers in the early 1990s (www.homecomputermarket.com).
Their reselling business now averages about 100 orders a month, with business from Appalachian hill families as well as affluent home schoolers from around the world.
Their first computer guide was published in 1993 with only four pages and was handed out free at home-schooling conventions.
Today, they charge $7 for their ``Home-schooler's Computer Guide,'' which is more than 100 pages long and contains reviews of more than 300 educational software titles.
Their annual catalog includes a section called ``100 Programs You Should Not Buy'' and notes if a title features witchcraft, magic or aliens.
``I don't have a problem with aliens as long as they're not mean or nasty, but some of our readers don't like software with aliens,'' Mrs.
Kihlstadius said.
Wendy and David Orth, a Cherry Valley, Mass.
, couple with six home-schooled children, have built the gigantic, Homeschool Publishing House(bravewc.com/hph), which produces the ``Homeschool Seller'' catalogue.
The Orths list home schoolers' used supplies in the catalog at no charge, and when a sale is made, the home schooler pays them 15 percent of the sale price.
``It pays its own bills, but my husband certainly can't quit his day job,'' Mrs.
Orth said.
Most of the items listed are Christian-themed.
Major educational publishers are eyeing the scene, but so far few heavy hitters have embraced the home-schooling market.
The notable exception is Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft.
Vulcan Northwest, his 12-year-old umbrella organization for his business ventures, is backing a new online tutorial called APEX (Advance Placement Excellence).
APEX, an advanced-placement tutorial, is in its pilot phase (www.apex.netu.com).
The first course is advanced placement calculus.
This winter, the curriculum will be expanded to include microeconomics and American government.
The goal is to add five more courses next year and five more each each subsequent year.
The courses have been designed in cooperation with the College Board, which oversees advanced placement classes _ college-level courses offered to high-school students that can count toward college credits.
The company's is aiming to attract business from both the home-schooling and the institutional schooling markets.
For $300 per semester, a student can tap into a library of 15-minute teacher-narrated tutorials with multimedia animations of key concepts; participate in bulletin board discussion sessions, and complete both online and off-line homework.
The activities go into a database and can be reviewed, critiqued and ``debugged'' by the teacher.
The calculus course involves more than 250 learning activities.
Between 30 and 40 students are taking it this fall, but as many as 150 could participate in the microeconomics and government courses.
My daughter isn't ready for kindergarten yet.
Which is good, because neither am I.
The biggest question _ public vs.
private education _ quickly breaks into myriad other questions, all crucial and all confusing.
As dissatisfaction with the state of American education grows, the alternatives also grow, creating a plethora of hard-to-evaluate choices.
Public education has deep roots in our society.
A vast empire involving almost 50 million young people, 88,000 schools and trillions of dollars, public schools long have been the social balancing wheel of society, fostering diverse interests, dreams and goals.
Americans stood by public education through integration in the 1960s, the burgeoning magnet and alternative schools in the 1970s and the draconian financial cuts of the 1980s.
But attitudes have shifted in the 1990s.
In a recent study titled ``Where Connoisseurs Send Their Children to School,'' Denis Doyle, educational analyst and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, reported that urban public-school teachers are more likely to send their children to private schools.
In Jersey City, N.J., 50.3 percent choose private schools.
In San Francisco, it's 36.7 percent, Cleveland is at 39.7 percent and Chicago at 36.3 percent.
``And let's not forget home schooling,'' Doyle says.
``It's the fastest-growing trend in the country''.
Brenda and Tommy Teepell of Baton Rouge, La.
, have home schooled their four sons, now ages 23, 22, 17 and 14.
The boys were in a Christian school when the Teepells decided to make the change.
``I wanted more of our family values to be part of our children's lives,'' she says.
``The boys participated in plenty of outside activities, such as sports and the 4-H Club.
``Life simply turned into a big classroom,'' she adds.
``If we went shopping, the boys calculated prices.
Traveling was a rich history lesson.
The boys matured faster than their peers, and are extremely independent young men''.
Approximately 1.2 million children are home schooled, according to the National Home Education Research Institute in Salem, Ore.
Catholic schools, because of their affordability and diversity, remain a leading private option for middle-class parents.
And parochial schools score high academically.
Between 1993 and 1996, parochial enrollment increased by almost 590,000, according to the Washington-based National Catholic Educational Association.
Private institutions are flourishing across the country.
The Hudson Institute says there are 28,000 private schools nationwide, with 5.9 million children enrolled, and that private enrollment has risen faster than public for the past five years.
Clearly, private education is not everyone's favorite option.
Many parents and educators insist that public education is the cornerstone of democracy.
``Education is not just academics _ it's socialization, real America with all its glory and depravity,'' says Michael Castleman, a public-school advocate and an author who specializes in health.
``It's a tremendous commitment,'' adds Castleman, whose two children survived a difficult search for a public school in San Francisco.
San Francisco has 15 alternative sites and 59 regular elementary schools.
Castleman and his wife, Anne, along with several hundred hopeful families, opted for an alternative program.
The couple investigated a dozen schools, keenly aware that their chance of obtaining a spot in one of the city's five most sought-after alternatives was slim.
San Francisco has open enrollment, a process that offers a modicum of choice: An application places the child's name in a lottery.
Only a handful of families get into their schools of choice, but the lottery takes certain ZIP codes, a previously enrolled sibling and ethnic balance into account.
In their search, the Castlemans uncovered an alternative school that many of their peers had overlooked.
``San Francisco Community Alternative School sits in the middle of San Francisco's working-class stew,'' Castleman says.
``It's ethnically and economically diverse.
It's not everybody's first choice, due to location and no after-school care.
We were delighted to receive our letter of acceptance without having to contend with the arduous appeal process''.
Ginny Gjedsted and her husband, Al, did not fare well in the open-enrollment lottery.
They also were reluctant to gamble on an appeal, so they enrolled their two daughters in an ecclesiastical girls' school.
Within a year, however, they moved them to a private, secular, coed school.
``The rhetoric and the reality of the prestigious girls' institution didn't match,'' Gjedsted says.
By the time the Gjedsteds' third child entered preschool, tuition for three hovered around $30,000.
``It's a hefty chunk of our salaries, but I can't quibble with the education,'' she says.
Educator Joe Nathan, director of the Center for School Change at the University of Minnesota's Hubert H.
Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs and author of ``Charter Schools: Creating Hope and Opportunity in American Education'' (Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1996), thinks public schools have failed to help many youngsters reach their potential.
Nathan, who also co-founded the charter-school movement, says the cards are stacked against children's being steered toward their highest potential.
``Achievement and accountability are not emphasized,'' he says.
``Schools receive no extra federal or state monies for parent participation or high test scores _ many innovative educators feel stifled''.
Nathan cites numerous examples throughout his book of teachers' successes which have been marginalized, their ideas ignored or challenged.
In 1991, Nathan helped spearhead the Minnesota charter-school movement, a reform in public education that has spread to 29 states.
Charters are public schools in which teachers, parents and community members work together to decide on educational programs and curricula.
As public schools, receiving tax money, they are accountable to the state, as well as to the parents and the community, for academic results.
But they operate independently of most district and state regulations, cutting through bureaucratic red tape that may hinder other public schools.
Not every parent feels the need for such innovations as charter schools, open enrollment or lotteries.
Lloyd and Lori Thacker of Portland, Ore.
, sent their elder son, Jacob, to a suburban neighborhood school.
They feel lucky.
``It wasn't a perfect school, but Jacob received a solid education,'' says Lloyd Thacker, who himself is a counselor at a Jesuit-run private high school.
Yet Lori Thacker admits she wonders if 5-year-old Sam will get the same education as his brother.
``I feel burdened by recent local tax attitudes,'' she says.
``People don't understand the relationship between the polls and public schools''.
Last year, Portland followed a growing trend: Like one in four local districts nationwide, its voters rejected higher property taxes _ a boost for property owners, but a blow for schools, which are funded by federal money and local property taxes.
Fiscal cuts often mean fewer enrichment programs and more leaky roofs.
The educational schism isn't likely to disappear anytime soon.
More choice, not less, is the wave of the future.
These dichotomies have taught me to prioritize and become proactive in my search.
I've learned to compare schools and family needs, to look into after-school programs, computers, art, libraries, physical education and more.
I've become accustomed to asking questions, talking to principals and networking with other parents.
But even so, the process isn't simple.
Even with the amount of data I've uncovered, I'm still not sure which route _ public or private _ my daughter will take when she starts school.

POLYGAMIST (Colorado City, Ariz).
- School opens in Colorado City.
Nearly 700 students don't show up, as the fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints begins its ambitious home-schooling and private schooling project.
Church leaders warn about the evils of the outside world.
Parents kept their students out of school, the latest in a series of events of the church saying they want to withdraw from society and to keep alien ideas out of the town.
Meanwhile, as 350 students did go school, dozens of students from the fundalmentalist families were riding motorcycles and tractors around town.

&UR; Close to Home &LR; When Mae Shell was a child, her parents homesteaded in Washington State, building their own houses and living off the land, for a time without running water.
So when it came time to educate Mae and her three younger sisters, the method they chose seemed to fit right in _ teaching them at home in the small town of Georgia, Vt.
``We did it pretty informally,'' said Ms.
Shell, now 21.
``It was very self-directed.
We did horseback riding at a stable nearby.
We went everywhere with my mom, to the grocery store, to run errands, to the theater.
Math was kind of the only thing we really sat down at our desks to do''.
Ms. Shell said she did not read until she was 8, which she realizes is considered late.
She and her sisters also had little interaction with the local schools or the state system, and didn't take standardized tests.
``There wasn't really anything we wanted to do in school,'' she said, ``or that we thought the school had for us''.
They received diplomas and transcripts from their parents, who lobbied unsuccessfully against a change in Vermont law requiring home-schooled students to submit a portfolio of work to the state or have their work reviewed by certified teachers.
``We were concerned about how much control the state would have over how home schools worked,'' Ms.
Shell said.
``True learning takes place when it is directed by the person who needs to be learning it.
In the public schools it's sort of forced on the kids''.
At 17, she took a few classes at a local community college.
She enjoyed a short-fiction class, but found it difficult to be given an assignment to write.
She preferred to be naturally inspired and did not like ``learning in such a formal way,'' she said.
She was much more excited about working in the public library in nearby St.
Albans, where she began volunteering at 16.
She considered going to college and trying to get a master's degree in library science, but ``No college in Vermont offers that,'' she said, ``and I didn't really feel like I wanted to go out of state at that point''.
So while two of Ms.
Shell's younger sisters went to college (one is at Smith College, the other at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst), Ms.
Shell decided to live at home and get a paying job at the library, where she maintains the Web page, enters catalogued books into the computer and takes books to nursing homes and shut-ins.
Sue Wade, a librarian at St.
Albans Free Library, said that compared with children educated conventionally, the Shell daughters were ``more mature in a lot of ways and less mature in some ways''.
``They have no problem talking with adults,'' she said.
``But sometimes they seem nave about certain things.
They haven't had to be kids.
They've just had to be people''.
They have had little experience with the kind of competition or teasing common among schoolchildren, she observed, because they spent their time among family members.
``They may not understand why people would even tease someone in a cruel way,'' she added.
She said home-schooled children, who are relatively common in the St.
Albans community, seem to ``do things that are less likely to put themselves in situations where they have to be cutthroat, because they haven't had to be,'' Ms.
Wade said.
``They have been often raised by people who are potters or farmers.
One of the home-schoolers has a father who is a produce manager.
That's about as competitive as it gets''.
Last year, in Growing Without Schooling, a magazine about unschooling, Ms.
Shell wrote of her only complaint: ``I feel very separated from my schooled peers because of seemingly insurmountable differences in our values.
I have many friends, but they are all significantly younger or older than me.
I often feel lonely, and long for friends my own age who are going through the same experiences as I am''.
She has dated but finds it hard to meet many men her age.
Still, she says that for now she is happy living with her parents: her father builds wooden boats, and her mother is a former potter who went back to college several years ago to get a master's in counseling.
Ms. Shell helps out at home by doing the grocery shopping and chauffeuring her youngest sister to dance classes.
She also writes poetry and designs Web pages.
``I really like it here,'' she said.
``I don't feel the need to go anywhere else''.
&UR; A Life With Great Books &LR; School just wasn't working out well for Emily Murphy.
A bright child who started reading as a toddler, Ms.
Murphy puzzled her teachers, who seemed uncertain where to place her.
``They were shipping me off to gifted classes in the morning, putting me in higher grades,'' recalled Ms.
Murphy, now 25.
``One teacher in first grade took an irrational hatred to me.
I was really unhappy.
The other kids would kind of pick on me because I was different''.
Teachers were also so critical of her handwriting, saying it was illegible, that she hated to write.
After third grade, her parents decided to teach her at home, where she could proceed at her own pace.
There was an added advantage: stability.
Ms. Murphy's father worked for a railroad and had to move the family every couple of years, settling finally in Wellsboro, a small town in central Pennsylvania.
Home schooling ``fit the transient life style,'' she said.
Ms. Murphy's parents worked to help her feel comfortable writing.
She would dictate essays, and her father would write them down, until ``it got to the point where he couldn't write as fast as I would dictate,'' Ms.
Murphy said, ``so I got frustrated and I would just write it myself.
I doubt the school system would have had the patience''.
On Sunday evenings, they held sessions to review what Ms.
Murphy and her younger brother and sister, also home schooled, had accomplished and to set goals for the following week.
``Some of them could be very tense,'' Ms.
Murphy said.
``We did clash quite a bit when I was a kid _ `I don't want to do this'; `You have to do this'.
'' Her parents, now both English professors at Mansfield University, in Mansfield, Pa.
, decided that the children should take standardized tests and submit work to schools for approval.
``The way you beat the system is to learn how to do standardized tests really well,'' Ms.
Murphy said.
She also took classes in dance, drama and art, enrolled in courses at a community college, and by 13, was working in a local library and in a historical society's rare-books collection.
Her parents encouraged their children to talk to adults about their work, including the plumbers and electricians who came to the house.
``My parents had the attitude that the world is not made up of 30 people your own age,'' she said.
Ms. Murphy always intended to go to college, and scored a combined score of 1330 on the SAT's.
But one of the two schools she applied to, Penn State, ``basically sent me a rejection letter because I didn't fit into their system,'' she said.
The other school, St.
John's College, a small institution in Maryland, accepted her.
She felt right at home with its ``great books'' curriculum.
She said colleges seemed to be more receptive to home-schoolers by the time her siblings applied.
Both chose Williams College.
Now Ms.
Murphy is an assistant registrar and curator of photographs at the Maryland State Archives in Annapolis.
She squeezes a social life into her busy schedule but says she hasn't had time to date.
Her answering machine's outgoing message features quotes from Jane Austen and Emily Dickinson.
Would she home school her own children?
``My mom is a saint,'' she answered.
``I have no clue how she managed to handle three kids, all very bright, all rambunctious.
I don't know that I would have the patience to do it''. &QL;
BURLINGTON, Vt.
(AP) -- A home-schooling mother was released from jail Tuesday after spending nearly two weeks behind bars in a dispute with public school officials over her son's special education needs.
In a case closely watched by advocates of school choice, Karen Maple was set free by the judge who had jailed her on contempt charges on Sept.
1. She had refused to follow an order to take her 15-year-old son, Trevor, to Vermont's child protection agency so his education needs could be evaluated.
In setting Ms.
Maple free, Judge Michael Kupersmith threatened to fine her $100 a day if she doesn't take Trevor to the agency on Friday.
Ms. Maple said she didn't know where her son was, although she believed he was staying with friends.
``I don't want my son locked up and treated the way I've been treated for the last two weeks,'' the 36-year-old single mother said, weeping, after the hearing.
``He's now considered a fugitive and he's just a child''.
William Young, the commissioner of the child welfare agency, said officials had no intentions of locking up Trevor.
``Many of the children in our custody are at home,'' he said.
The case has drawn wide attention and sympathy for Ms.
Maple. About 30 people demonstrated in her support outside the courthouse Tuesday and then lined the spectators' gallery during her hearing.
An editorial last Friday in The Wall Street Journal said cases like Ms.
Maple's extend ``beyond the issue of home schooling to the fundamental rights of families to raise their children the way they see fit''.
Vermont parents are allowed to school their children at home but must submit an annual report to the state Department of Education describing the academic program.
But Ms.
Maple and her local school district in Bakersfield were unable to agree on an education plan for Trevor, and administrators decided Trevor needed special education services because he was behind on reading and other language skills.
Ms. Maple says her son loves science, is a whiz at math and that they're working on his language skills.
She said she's agreed to have a tutor brought in to help Trevor with language skills.
Ms. Maple has said she resented school officials' intrusion into her family's life.
Kupersmith granted Ms.
Maple's release Tuesday on a motion by the state Department of Corrections, which argued that the state needs its scarce jail beds for violent offenders.
``This case is supposed to be about the best interests of the child,'' the judge said.
``While Ms.
Maple is incarcerated, all of T.M.'s (Trevor Maple's) interests are being ignored''.
Kupersmith also acknowledged that continuing Maple's incarceration ``is not likely to ensure the appearance of her son.''
CHICAGO _ Education has always been a local issue in America.
Now an increasing number of parents are choosing to make it even more local: they are doing it themselves.
The number of Americans teaching their own children has more than tripled since the beginning of the decade.
Home-schooling groups put the number of students learning at home at 1.23 million, or slightly more than all the public-school students in New Jersey.
Such numbers are notoriously imprecise, since some of the most populous states, such as Texas and Illinois, collect no meaningful data on home schooling.
Still, experts reckon that the number of families teaching their children at home has exploded over the past decade and is growing by at least 15 percent a year.
Why? Twenty years ago home schooling was a hippie habit, the natural complement to free love and natural healing.
But the flower children soon had strange bedfellows.
In the mid-1980s, home schooling was embraced by Christian fundamentalists as a means of providing family-based religious and moral education.
Recently, there has been a boom in secular home schoolers who are dissatisfied with public schools.
The Florida Department of Education has for years sent a crude survey to home schoolers asking them why they withdrew from the regular system.
Two years ago, for the first time, dissatisfaction with the public schools was a more common answer than religious preference.
According to Mary Anne Pitman, an educational anthropologist at the University of Cincinnati, one fast-growing group of home schoolers is black professionals, worried by the lack of safe, effective public schools for their children.
Two decades ago, home schooling was illegal in many states and strongly discouraged in most others.
Students were hunted down as truants; parents were arrested and sometimes even jailed.
All 50 states now allow it, though the degree of regulation varies enormously.
In Minnesota, home schoolers must register, check in regularly, and take part in standardized exams to make sure the children are not falling behind.
In Illinois, they are virtually unregulated.
Some states have become downright accommodating.
Washington and Iowa require the public schools to enroll children on a part-time basis if they ask for it.
In California, children can enroll in an independent study program through a public school and then do their studying at home.
Not surprisingly, the busiest opponents of all this are school administrators, particularly superintendents.
They can be expected to have a belief in public schools, of course, but not all their concerns are so well-intentioned.
In most states, schools are financed according to the number of pupils attending.
``Superintendents see every kid who doesn't come in as a potential $6,000 loss,'' says Michael Farris, the president of the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA).
The teachers' unions are not fond of home schooling, either.
The National Education Association handbook declares that ``home schooling programs cannot provide the student with a comprehensive education experience''.
Yet the legal climate has changed, in large part, because home schoolers have developed into a potent political and legal force.
Their association with the Christian right has earned them strong Republican backing.
They are also very good at bare-knuckle, grass-roots politics.
The HSLDA has a staff of 50, including seven lawyers, who lobby on Capitol Hill but also pick fights at the state level.
When a Michigan couple was arrested in 1985 for teaching their child at home without a teacher's license, the HSLDA fought the case all the way to the Michigan Supreme Court, where the law requiring home-schooling parents to be licensed teachers was struck down as unconstitutional.
Farris boasts that he can generate 100 telephone calls to every congressional office within a matter of hours.
At the same time, public opinion on home schooling has shifted.
When the Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll on public attitudes towards education first asked about home schooling in 1985, 73 percent of those surveyed said it was a bad thing, compared with 16 percent who approved.
When the same question was asked in 1997, the objectors had fallen to 57 percent and the supporters had more than doubled, to 36 percent.
Favorable stories about home schooling are starting to creep into mainstream magazines.
Amazon.com, the biggest Internet bookseller, now lists over 200 books on the subject.
But what happens to the children?
The HSLDA claims that, on average, home-schooled students outperform their public-school peers by more than 30 percentage points in all subjects, and that the longer a child is schooled at home the larger the test gap grows.
The figures may be tilted, and home-schooled students, whose parents are an exacting bunch, would probably do well in public schools too.
Still, home schooling is not creating a generation of dullards.
Harvard has seen fit to accept a handful of these children over the past two decades.
``Some of these kids are absolutely terrific.
They've done interesting things,'' says David Illingworth, the senior admissions officer.
Illingworth has challenged the movement to find a better name, since many of its most successful students have taken some courses in public schools and even in community colleges.
The picture of a mother working with her children around the kitchen table does not do justice to the idea, he says.
And there is a harder question: is it possible to develop socially without ever going to school?
Home schoolers argue that their children are exposed to children and adults of varying ages rather than becoming ``peer-dependent''.
Farris decided to begin educating his six-year-old daughter at home when he realized that she cared more about the approval of other six-year-olds than she did about her own family.
``Real life,'' he says, ``does not consist of age-segregated herds''.
Harvard's Illingworth says the sociability of home-schooled applicants varies as much as it does among ordinary ones.
The exceptions come from religious families who have deliberately withdrawn their children from a world they consider tainted.
One shadow lies over home schooling.
Joe Nathan, a senior fellow at the Hubert Humphrey Institute at the University of Minnesota, has spent much time interviewing parents who teach at home.
Most want to give their children a better education; but a tiny minority are dangerously racist, angry or alienated.
``There are some real haters,'' says Nathan.
In general, he considers home schooling to be a good thing for bringing change to the public schools; many home schoolers have already been drawn back into the system by charter schools and other such experiments.
But there is a worrying group lurking in the home-schooling shadows.
Even so, most home-schooling parents choose to teach their children at home at great cost to themselves because they reckon the public schools are missing the mark; and, in many cases, they are right.
A surge of defections may finally send a wake-up call to the whole public system.
Rather than merely talking of change, it is time to bring some about.

DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential contender Gary Bauer said Tuesday that school voucher proposals should be expanded to cover the cost to parents of educating their children at home.
Bauer noted that most school voucher proposals provide funds for moving children to private schools or public schools outside the home district but don't include home schooling.
``The politicians didn't think very much about this particular alternative,'' he said.
``This is a legitimate choice and I want to make sure the playing field is level''.
The proposal came as Bauer met with a group of parents who home-school their children.
Voucher programs allow parents the freedom to take the education funding earmarked for their child and use it to pay the costs of attending a school other than their neighborhood public school.
Most of the debate is over whether tax money for public school students should be used for tuition at private schools.
Public school advocates say that undermines public education, but most conservatives favor that step.
Bauer favors voucher programs for private schools, but expanded that Tuesday to include home schooling.
He said parents could use the money for curriculum material, or to hire help in areas where they don't feel competent to teach.
Home-school advocates won a years-long legislative battle that allows them to teach their children at home.
Many are religious conservatives unhappy with the public school curriculum and the lack of religious instruction.
Bauer is appealing to these conservatives in his bid for the Republican presidential nomination.
He made it clear he would favor home schooling if he's elected.
``I will never allow the federal government to get into the business of regulating home schooling,'' said Bauer.
He argued that there's some history of youngsters who are taught at home, and they measure up well against students taught in both private and public schools.
``If the parents are engaged, the children are in pretty good shape,'' said Bauer.
``Those of you who are engaged in home schooling are doing something incredibly important for your children''.
Under Iowa law, parents do not have to be licensed teachers to home-school youngsters.
They register youngsters with the local school district, which has staffers who will offer assistance and advice.
The youngsters are tested periodically and can take part in some extracurricular activities.
Bauer said advocates won that law by pressuring politicians, and demonstrated effectiveness.
``At the end of the day, politicians fear unemployment more than anything,'' he said.
BOSTON _ When naming their three black boys, Michelle and Alan Shaw chose words that would underscore treasured roots and religion: Chinua, Nigerian for God's own blessing; Yesuto, Ghanaian for belongs to Jesus; and Obasi, Nigerian for in honor of God.
So, when it came to selecting the best school for their boys, the Dorchester couple _ she an attorney with a Harvard law degree, he a computer expert with a master's and doctorate from MIT _ took the same care.
Home, they decided, was the best place to teach their children strong academics, religious values, and instill their own sense of ethnic pride.
``For black people in this country, there is a need for not letting our kids forget their history,'' saidAlan Shaw, whose sons are 3, 6, and 7.
``We shouldn't look to something that's been designed by the state as a way for us to teach our kids about their past and their future''.
Fueled by a desire to rescue their children from academic failure and neglect at the hands of overburdened public schools and determined to weave tight-knit families, more African-Americans and other minorities nationwide are deciding that when it comes to school, there's no place like home.
This, even as they are accused of abandoning the very public school system that for decades minorities who fought to overcome separate and unequal education have been told is the ticket up and out of oppression.
``Many of them have recognized that academically the public school system has not saved them,'' said Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute, a nonprofit based in Oregon.
While there are no concrete figures, anecdotally, experts say there is a growing diversity in homeschooling.
Single parents are venturing into it, and it is proving to be a sanctuary for many interracial couples.
In the past, homeschooling has been a choice made mostly by white, middle-income families who could afford setting themselves apart from the traditional educational system.
``Homeschooling has now become so prevalent that it has gotten to the point where it is not seen as wacky or nutty,'' Ray said.
``So it makes it easier for minorities to try it''.
He estimates that there about 1.3 to 1.7 million K-12 homeschooled children nationwide, about 1 percent of those black and a lesser percentage Hispanic.
``I think over the next five years, you're going to see real growth,'' he said.
The rapid expansion and growth in use of the Internet also has meant plenty of inexpensive resources for homeschoolers, easing some socioeconomic barriers.
A book written in 1996, ``Freedom Challenge: African American Homeschoolers,'' even features essays by 15 families that serve as a road map.
The interest in homeschooling is growing so much that Joyce and Eric Burges of Baker, La.
, are creating a national networking group that encourages African-Americans to homeschool.
``My husband and I want to put a beacon of light out there that says this is an option, this is a choice you have,'' said Joyce Burges, an executive secretary who homeschools three children.
Missy and Rick Parker, who have been homeschooling for 16 years, created a similar group in 1994 in Detroit.
``It's a matter of commitment,'' said Missy Parker, a Southern Baptist who homeschools to teach religious values.
She estimates that at least 200 African-American families in Detroit are homeschooling.
``Most African-Americans wouldn't venture to do it because they didn't feel they were equipped.
But, that's what the support group is for, so you don't have to do it on your own''.
Homeschooling, however, doesn't come without challenges or criticisms as any family, black or white, knows.
These include fear of the unknown, lack of support from relatives and friends, financial belt-tightening and questions about the legitimacy of homeschooling.
And for African-Americans the accusation of black flight.
``Anything that we take away from the public schools, especially in the cities has a detrimental effect,'' said Steven C.
Leonard, headmaster of the Jeremiah E.
Burke High School in Dorchester.
``I would much rather have minority parents, black parents, all parents, fight to strengthen the public shcool systems because like it or not that's where the bulk of the students who compose our future will be educated''.
Other African-American educators believe students lose something when parents chose to school at home.
``One of the great benefits of public schooling is that we teach people, children how to both ask for help from others as well as to give help to others who need it,'' said Charles Willie, a Harvard professor emeritus and one of the designers of Boston public school's controlled-choice assignment plan.
``These are valuable learnings that are difficult to replace in an isolated learning environment'' Still, minorities are choosing to homeschool for reasons as diverse as the ways in which they are teaching their children.
Some, like the Shaws, say the public school system is failing African-American children, who often end up at the bottom of achievement assessments.
Results by race on the 1999 Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System showed black and Latino students behind whites in every category for every grade.
In contrast, the Shaws point to a 1997 study by Ray and the Home School Legal Defense Association showing less of a disparity between achievement rates in math and reading among minority and white homeschoolers.
In addition, lamenting the loss of close-knit black communities, some parents say homeschooling allows them to fortify their children in nuturing environments.
``This early stage is critical to establishing what is important, what we believe in,'' said Alan Shaw, a computer consultant who works from home.
Some, like Kevin Brooks, a divorced father in Arlington, say they are homeschooling to compensate for school systems that allow too many children to fall through the cracks.
Brooks, a researcher for Motorola, pulled his 14-year-old son Kristoff out of public school in February when he found he was spending hours trying to help his son through course work the youth should have already mastered.
This year, Brooks also plans to homeschool Kristoff's twin sister.
He uses a network of friends, black and white, to help teach Kristoff.
``One of my challenges, and it will increase, is feeling comfortable having someone who isn't black talk to my kids about issues of race one-on-one,'' said Brooks, who shares custody with his formerwife.
During a recent homeschooling session, one of Brook's white friends and Kristoff had a complex conversation on how black people are sometimes portrayed negatively in cartoons.
It taught Brooks a lesson: ``When you are learning from the world, outside the classroom system, you are exposed to more things,'' he said.
``So talking about stuff is a lot more important now''.
From the moment that Beverley Foreman, a Jamaica native, set foot in this country in 1976, she had trouble with traditional schools.
It started with her youngest son, who at 5 was already at a second-grade level, able to read and write in cursive.
Here, he was placed in kindergarten and put in a corner to play with blocks, she said.
``He became so distracted and disinterested in school,'' she said, and watched as he was bused out of his community to a school with special needs students, and told her son might have attention deficit disorder.
He eventually graduated high school, but after that Foreman pulled her other children out of public schools.
The Maynard mother of four boys was ``terrified'' when she began homeschooling seven years ago, but she got over her fear and is still homeschooling her youngest son using libraries and museums as classrooms.
The teachable moments, insist the families, proves it is worth it over and over again.
The Shaws, for example, were there when one son assumed God was white.
They told him God has no color but people generally project on Him an image with which they identify.
And while it was their parents' choice, some minority homeschool children also applaud the move.
Candace Burges, 15, values the one-on-one attention.
``If I were in school now, the average teacher has to teach about 30 kids in one classroom.
With my mom, it's only three,'' she said.
And self-esteem, Burges said, is nurtured at home.
``Sometimes African-American students are underestimated in school and they are teased and people really don't know who they really are,'' she said.
Alan Shaw, who attended public schools, says he never envisioned homeschooling his children.
But, back in college he was one to go against the grain, he said.
``I've always been hoping there would be some alternative to mainstream life,'' Shaw said.
He found it at home.
PURCELLVILLE, Va.
_ The dormitories are still under construction in the hilly fields, but Patrick Henry College already has a few rules: Students will wear uniforms.
They won't drink.
They won't date, unless their parents ``are informed of the potential romance'' and approve.
All of which will set the college apart when it opens next fall.
Yet what is drawing national attention to the school is not its strict code of conduct, but its future student body.
Almost every undergraduate entering Patrick Henry College will have been home-schooled.
That makes them graduates of one of the most controversial movements in American education, one that gained steam in the 1980s amid a series of legal battles pitting parents against the government.
Now that the first wave of the country's 1.5 million home-schooled children is reaching college age, there is a new debate: When, and how, should they be thrust into the ``real world''?
Critics of home-schooling have long argued children need exposure to the outside world and peers to grow into well-rounded adults.
And home-schoolers freely admit their aim is to ``let children be children'' by sheltering them from the harsh realities and temptations of the modern world.
But when do children stop being children?
How do they make that transition?
And what kind of adult lives will home-schooled children be prepared to lead?
Officials at Patrick Henry College, believed to be the first ever to target home-schoolers, think they have found an answer in their curriculum: The only major for incoming freshmen will be government.
In addition to their classes, students will write legislative papers for US congressmen, which they hope will then be used as actual guides for congressional staffers.
Students will also participate in Capitol Hill ``apprenticeships,'' all to train them for a future in the most unsheltered of careers: politics.
``If the real world means Capitol Hill, they'll be as prepared as anyone,'' said the school's founder, Michael P.
Farris, who has home-schooled his 10 children, the oldest of whom is 24.
``If it is defined as the college bar scene?
No, they're not going to be prepared for that a bit.
It would be fair to say we're skipping one phase of wildness.
We're skipping them straight into adulthood''.
This intertwining of politics and home-schooled students is bound to draw notice, especially since the home-schooling movement is so often depicted as antigovernment.
In the last 19 years advocates for home schooling have filed hundreds of lawsuits in more than 40 states, according to the Home School Legal Defense Association.
The purpose of the litigation, in most cases, has been to get government out of citizens' educational lives.
But to Farris and his colleagues, the vision is entirely consistent.
Patrick Henry College will be a breeding ground for the next generation of crusaders _ who may abstain from partying with the rest of the world, but will still work to change it.
The school's promotional material states the goal: ``Eventually, these highly-qualified public servants will themselves begin to run for elective office and will have the opportunity to lead our nation back to its constitutional roots''.
Those roots do not exclude religion, in Farris's view, and fundamentalist Christianity is clearly at the core of what the college hopes to stand for.
Students will attend daily chapel.
They must ``show evidence of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ,'' the school pamphlet says, and must subscribe to a seven-point statement of faith that includes believing in the literal resurrection of Christ.
Emblazoned on the blue-and-white folders being distributed to prospective students is a school motto: ``For Christ &AMP; For Liberty''.
Farris's vision for student relationships is also closely tied to faith.
He hopes to develop a ``practice of courtship,'' in which students ``engage in the activity of seriously looking for God's partner in life''.
Students who find themselves attracted to one another will be required to call their parents to discuss it.
The role of parents, Farris said, is ``to help them make a wise choice of whether they will marry''.
Campus life is still just a dream, of course.
The main hall is little more than a steel frame in the middle of a muddy field, surrounded by cranes and construction material.
The administrators, including Farris, work out of a cluster of townhouses in a subdivision of this tiny town in western Loudon County, whose other inhabitants include a Dunkin' Donuts and a McDonald's along a two-lane main road.
But, if all goes well, the state higher education council of Virginia will recommend Patrick Henry be approved to enroll students, a final step toward opening its doors in 2000.
Farris said he hopes to send out applications as early as this week.
And he is in the midst of fund-raising to help pay the school's $50 million in long-term costs; since June, he said he has raised close to $1.5 million.
Among those who have helped is the Republican Governor of Virginia, Jim Gilmore, who signed copies of a Patrick Henry biography at a party to raise funds, Farris said.
There are other political connections, too: Janet Ashcroft, the wife of Republican Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, is on the school's board of trustees.
And Farris considers Representative Steve Largent, an influential Republican from Oklahoma, a ``good friend''.
Those political ties will become increasingly important if the apprenticeship system is put into practice, as some of the 100 to 140 students begin to write legislative papers for congressmen.
But there are those who wonder whether integrating home-schooled, and to some degree ``home-colleged'', students into the political culture of Capitol Hill will be as easy or productive as Farris makes it sound.
``Their experience is of being cut off, to a large extent, from people with different values and different backgrounds,'' said Mark Rozell, a professor of politics at Catholic University.
``Once anyone goes into politics, to be successful it's necessary to know how to converse with different people and to know how to work effectively with them''.
But to Brad Jacob, the school's provost, that is exactly why schools like Patrick Henry are in demand.
``We see this college as a transition from the home, and from a home school, into the real world of living on your own,'' he said.
``We don't think it's necessary to make that transition by dumping an 18-year-old cold turkey on a college campus.
We're trying to make that transition in a controlled way.''
BOSTON _ In a major victory for home schoolers that also serves as a warning to school districts statewide, Massachusetts' highest court Wednesday ruled that Lynn school officials have no right to visit parent's homes to see how they teach their children.
Capping a seven-year lawsuit over parents' rights to teach children any way they choose, the ruling comes at a critical time for home schoolers: As their numbers have quadrupled in the last decade to an estimated 4,500 statewide, hundreds of families are struggling to understand their rights in vaguely written laws and court rulings.
Lynn will not appeal the decision and the new school superintendent said Wednesday the district had already begun to revamp the policy before the Supreme Judicial Court ruled.
``Still, this ruling definitely clears the air for school districts,'' said Lynn superintendent James Mazareas, who took office in August.
The district originally pursued the case because ``Six or seven years ago this was uncharted territory,'' he said.
The case stretches back to 1991, when Stephen and Lois Pustell filed a suit against the Lynn School Committee because the board required home schoolers to be periodically observed by school officials.
In 1994, Michael and Virginia Brunelle faced criminal charges in the same city when they objected to home visits and refused to submit their educational plans to Lynn officials.
While the criminal charges were dropped, the Brunelles, Pustells and their attorneys challenged the validity of Lynn's policy first in the federal courts and then in the state courts during the past three years.
Meanwhile, both couples, each with five children, continued teaching their children at home rather than sending them to school.
``We're just thrilled with the decision,'' said Stephen Pustell, 44, a computer analyst, Wednesday.
The city's job ``is to know that children are being educated, not to educate them''.
The court did not rule on the constitutionality of visiting home schoolers and instead relied on a much simplier argument: there is no state law that says school districts can require home visits.
The court also re-emphasized parents' long-standing rights to educate their children in the best way they see fit.
``It's a big victory with national significance,'' said Michael Farris, a lawyer from the Virginia-based Home School Legal Defense Association, who represented the parents.
``Home school laws are in constant flux.
If this decision would have gone the other way, we think there would have been copycat school districts all over the country''.
While Lynn is considered the only school district in the country to have required home visits, some school districts statewide have had the requirement on their books, but did not enforce it.
Some districts that did not have the requirement would ask parents for home visits.
Many times parents, unsure of their rights, agreed to allow inspectors into their homes.
``This ruling will help clarify things,'' said Pat Farenga, president of Holt Associates, publisher of a magazine about home schooling.
``There are a lot of people who don't want to report they home school because of the vagueness'' of regulations.
State law does allow local boards to monitor home schooling.
Most school systems require some type of documentation _ portfolios of student work, assurances that students are being taught the full school year, or proof of lesson plans.
Wednesday, some school districts said they welcomed the SJC decision to give them guidance.
``The law is very vague.
..it's been difficult,'' said Lois Sullivan of the Cambridge Public Schools.
While home visits can be part of an agreement between a home schooler and the district, it is never required, she said, adding, ``This will help us''.
While flatly rejecting the inclusion of home visits as a mandatory right of school board's oversight, the SJC left the door open for home visits in cases where a child may be failing educationally, or if other families send their children to a neighbor for schooling.
But the SJC said there was no valid reason to consider home visits essential today to meet the state goal of ensuring all children are being properly educated.
``Teaching methods may be less formalized, but in the home setting may be more effective,'' Greaney wrote.
While not directly endorsing the home schooling movement, the court said officials need to trust that parents who choose home school over public school are capable of educating their children _ although it many be in a different way than a public school.
``We doubt that parents like the (Brunelles and Pustells), who are so committed to home education that they are willing to forgo the public schools, and devote substantial time and energy to their children, will let the children's progress suffer for lack of adequate instructional space,'' he wrote .
WASHINGTON _ Gov.
George W.
Bush of Texas faced an audience of more than 1,600 home schoolers Friday, offering encouragement but stopping short of supporting tax credits or vouchers for parents who choose to bypass public schools.
``In Texas, we think home schooling is something to respected and something to be protected,'' the Republican presidential front-runner told the first national meeting of the Virginia-based Home School Legal Defense Association.
``Respecting the energy and commitment of loving mothers and loving fathers.
Protecting them from the interference of government''.
That line got rousing applause from the audience, many of whose members are fearful that any government help might come with strings, such as testing and curriculum requirements.
The association supports tax credits, but not vouchers, said Michael Smith, the group's vice-president.
The best thing Bush could say about home schooling is ``nothing,'' said Bob Mann, 42, of New Jersey, who home-schools his five children.
``The state of New Jersey has no laws regarding home schooling, and I would like to keep it that way,'' he said.
Bush's home schooling message met with applause Friday, but he has departed from conservatives on key education points.
Earlier this month, he proposed a limited program of vouchers _ giving parents tax money for educational choices other than public schools _ that some Republicans said doesn't go far enough.
And he has proposed placing the federal Head Start program under the U.S.
Department of Education, expanding a federal agency that is anathema to many conservatives.
On Friday, Bush delivered a variation of his stump speech designed neither to alienate nor appease an audience unsure about whether his ``compassionate conservative'' message is conservative enough for them.
``This is a group of people who have rejected the educational system as it is,'' an unconvinced Mann said afterwards.
``All he did was uphold ideals of government sponsored education.
... He's trying to be all things to all people.

They are pioneers, in a way: the first wave of the modern home-schooling movement, the first generation of children to be taught primarily by their parents.
Some 15 years after states began legalizing home schooling in earnest, these early graduates are starting to make their way in the world.
Some have found the transition challenging, especially when trying to convince colleges and employers that home school is as good as high school, or when trying to get used to working in groups and socializing with peers.
Others have had easy success, building on talents nurtured in their home incubators and drawing on a sense of competence fed by their teacher-parents' undivided support.
The experiences of these young adults have paved the way for the increasing numbers of children coming after them.
Following years of court battles, home schooling is now legal in every state.
While there are no exact figures, estimates suggest that the number of home-schooled children has jumped to anywhere between 500,000 and 1.5 million today, from 15,000 in 1970.
Many, if not most, go to college, and schools like Harvard and Yale now have policies for evaluating their work.
The Internet has vastly broadened the range of home curriculums.
Still, many mainstream educators remain wary _ about socialization skills and about the potential inability of parents to give their children the rigor and depth they need in all subjects.
There are two major trends in home schooling: one philosophy is rooted in religious objections to the secularization of schools and to teaching subjects like evolution; the other, the more free-form philosophy called unschooling, initially embraced by families who considered themselves part of the counterculture, encourages independent expression and exposure to a broad menu of experiences.
Increasingly, home schooling is appealing to more conventional families, too _ parents who worry that their children are not getting enough individual attention in school and are either excelling faster than their classmates or need more help in certain skills.
Today home schooling can involve strong links to local schools: consultations with teachers, playing on school sports teams, even attending a class or two.
Many states now require standardized tests or portfolios of work for evaluation by state authorities or certified teachers, mainstream benchmarks that were up to parents to accept or reject in the earlier years of modern home schooling.
Still, some families have almost no dealings with schools and view grading systems as inadequate or irrelevant to real learning.
Other parents take care to immerse their children in extracurricular programs so they will meet children their own age.
Still others encourage individual activities, including internships and volunteer work, which help make their children comfortable with adults, but not always at ease with their peers.
All of these decisions shape the way home-schoolers adjust to the larger world.
&UR; Big Achievements, High Expectations &LR; Other kids always asked Tad Heuer why he wasn't in school and if he spent his days watching television.
Sometimes in his hometown, Holliston, Mass.
, west of Boston, he'd get stopped by a police officer who would ``try to get me for truancy,'' he said.
But Heuer, now a 20-year-old senior at Brown University, loved being able to study American history and music without having to switch subjects every 50 minutes.
He also loved going on a monthlong tour of Civil War battlefields and coal mines.
``I'm sure there were points when I was just miserable and said, `How could my parents do this to me'?
'' he said, ``but I don't think there was ever a time that I wanted to be in school''.
Like an increasing number of contemporary home-schoolers, Heuer had an education that was constantly intertwined with the conventional school system.
His mother, a former elementary school teacher who thought she could do better than the schools, made sure he and his younger brother took the Iowa Test of Basic Skills and enlisted certified teachers to review her sons' work.
Heuer took science classes at the high school, partly because, he said, ``it's not easy to buy one frog in formaldehyde'' for home study.
In 11th grade, he took an English class.
He had violin lessons at the school, played on the basketball team and worked on the school newspaper.
These activities connected him with children his age and with what they were learning.
At the same time, he had to work hard to be accepted by the world of mainstream education.
When he decided that he wanted the ``credential'' of a high school diploma, the Superintendent of Schools and the school committee were reluctant, suggesting he take a year of college first or seek a high school equivalency.
``There was a lot of inherent mistrust of someone who's been home schooled _ `How do you know you did the same thing everybody else did'?
'' Heuer said.
He persisted: he deserved a diploma because of his strong links to the school and community, he said, and the officials gave in.
He had less trouble being embraced by the working world.
At 15, he spent a summer working for a Democratic Massachusetts State Representative, Barbara Gardner, after she wrote him a letter praising an article on term limits he'd written for a local newspaper.
Ms. Gardner said he seemed more well-rounded and mature than others his age.
At 16, he worked for the unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign of Mark Roosevelt, a Democrat, impressing the staff so much that he was promoted from making copies to doing research on the opposition.
``My guess would be home-schoolers would give you pause if they seemed to be a person of average talent,'' said Michael Gritton, Roosevelt's former communications director, now policy director for a nonpartisan think tank, the Massachusetts Institute for a New Commonwealth, where Heuer also worked after the Roosevelt campaign.
``You'd be thinking, `Who is this person?
What have they done?
What do they know'?
You'd think to yourself, `Are they, like, coming out of a cult or something'?
But he's so talented, you think, `Well, geez, maybe this home-schooling thing is something to consider'.
'' With a combined SAT score of 1290 (the national average is 1017), Heuer applied to nine colleges, improvising a 55-page application that detailed the work he had done and included exhibits _ a science paper on Canada geese, a tape of his viola playing.
The transcript his parents created was 30 pages.
Heuer was rejected by Harvard and Yale but accepted by Johns Hopkins, American University, Catholic University and Brown, where he is pursuing a bachelor's degree in public policy and a master's in political science.
Last spring he won a $30,000 Harry S.
Truman Scholarship, one of 105 such awards given annually nationwide.
nn Heuer felt comfortable at college immediately, introducing himself at orientation.
``No reason I was going to be any different than anyone else,'' he said.
His home-schooling background has made him interested in a career involving education policy, trying to ``transfer the schooling I got into the public schools,'' he said.
But he's not sure he'll end up home schooling his own children.
``If I could save the world and home school my kids at the same time,'' he said, ``no question I would home school my kids''.
But, he added, ``Am I going to please everyone who's expecting me to go off and do great things, be a high-powered lawyer or whatever?
It's weighing the advantages that we've received from home schooling, and do we put that back into home schooling''?
&UR; Now, a Drink or Two - and Evolution &LR; When Julie Vickery's parents pulled her out of school in the sixth grade, she was in shock.
``I thought that was something they did in the 1800s,'' she said.
Ms. Vickery grew up in Central, S.C., near Greenville, and had been one of the better students in her elementary school.
She was convinced that she was going to be a failure because she wasn't going to regular classes.
Her parents, she explained, decided on home schooling primarily for religious reasons.
``My parents were quite fundamentalist in their approach to life,'' said Ms.
Vickery, now 23.
``They thought the public schools would brainwash the kids, not teach them how to read and write, but teach them all this horrible liberal thought.
They were concerned about creationism versus evolutionism and the move away from the phonics approach to reading''.
Religious home schooling tends to be structured more like a classroom setting, with the mother serving as teacher and using religious materials to supplement more standard academic lessons.
Ms. Vickery's mother, a homemaker, tried that approach.
``After two weeks,'' Ms.
Vickery recalled, ``I said, `Mom, you don't know anything.
Let me do it'.
'' With that, Ms.
Vickery was allowed to choose her own textbooks _ ones that approached history, science and art from a biblical perspective _ and she became an indefatigable learner.
``We had a core curriculum based on scriptural principles,'' said Norma Vickery, Julie's mother.
``At the same time that we were doing the academic study, we were also incorporating the biblical principles that went with them''.
At first, Ms.
Vickery's social world turned upside down.
``My three or four best friends all told me, `My mommy and daddy don't want me playing with you anymore,''' she said.
```They say your parents are really strict'''.
That hurt.
But Ms.
Vickery, who had also been teased at school because she was a brainy, nonathletic child, said she soon had an experience common to many home- schoolers: she began making friends outside her age group.
She asked the Clemson University professors who lived in her neighborhood about geology or history.
She played piano at a nursing home.
``Instead of missing out on socialization,'' Mrs.
Vickery said, ``we probably were more selective in the kind of socialization she was getting.
Sometimes in the school situation, they can socialize with the wrong kind of people, people with entirely different values or no values, or just troublemakers and that sort of thing''.
To broaden her experiences, her father took her on a ride with a truck driver, on a tour of an automobile factory and to see how a newspaper worked.
Going to the grocery store became a lesson in math.
By the time Ms.
Vickery was 14, she had ``finished every high school course that was recognized by the state of South Carolina,'' she said, and had taken the SAT's and scored a combined 1390.
She spent the next two years researching and writing papers, mining the libraries of five nearby universities.
At 17, Ms.
Vickery and her parents decided she would go to college.
``You're not going to gain acceptance in the world if you don't have the credential,'' she said.
She chose Northland Baptist Bible College, a small, religious school in Dunbar, Wis.
``I think if I had gone to a larger setting,'' Ms.
Vickery said, ``I would have had more of a problem getting adjusted''.
In general, she felt more comfortable socializing with the staff than the students.
The hardest part was learning to ``work as part of a team,'' she said.
``That was very difficult for me''.
In one course, for example, Ms.
Vickery, who was majoring in education, had to collaborate with other education students to determine the best way to tutor a child.
``One person wanted to complete the textbook,'' she said.
``One person wanted something else; not all of those ideas could work.
At the beginning I was hesitant to express my ideas to others.
I thought, `I haven't been through the system; they have.
I don't know how students are supposed to learn, I just know how I learned'.
'' Things improved as she became more comfortable.
But she was still hesitant to talk about her home-schooling experience.
Her faculty adviser did not find out until her sophomore year and, she said, ``He just about choked.
He said, `You couldn't have been home schooled, you can read and write'.
'' After graduation, Ms.
Vickery went to Korea to teach at a private language institute affiliated with a church.
Told she would be teaching English-speaking high school and college students, she was disappointed to find that her students were Korean-speaking preschoolers.
At the end of the year, she returned to this country and formed a group called Teachers for Christ International, a religiously based educational organization geared toward giving young teachers more control over their educational careers overseas.
She plans to return to Korea but is spending this year getting a master's degree in education at Bob Jones University, a conservative Christian institution in Greenville, S.C., that emphasizes religion.
She believes that her home-schooling background can help her teach effectively because she can see classroom problems from an ``outsider's perspective''.
But now she wants to learn the insider's ropes, too.
Ms. Vickery said she is not as conservative as her parents.
She allows herself to wear pants in public, for example.
She also allows herself an occasional drink or two.
And while she does not believe in evolution, she would teach the theory as part of a science class.
These days, she has a group of friends her age and goes on casual dates.
She does not unequivocally recommend home schooling.
She has seen other home-schooled children who, at 10, cannot read and spend their days running around outside, saying they are looking for bugs for a science lesson.
``There are some kids who are so social, they thrive on team sports,'' she said.
``You lose that if home schooled''. nn
After bouncing in and out of so many schools in Europe, Africa and the United States that he can't remember all their names, Simone Liverani found himself in Kolokani, a town in Mali, the west African country where his mother worked for a company drilling water wells.
There was no diplomatic or international school anywhere nearby, so he tried a local high school.
Liverani, an Italian who also speaks English and understands some French, had been told classes would be taught in French, but most teachers spoke Bambara, the native language.
``This was the last straw,'' he said.
``It was a mess''.
An official at the United States consulate suggested the Independent Study High School, based at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln.
Founded in 1929 as a correspondence program to educate rural Nebraskans, the school has one of only a few fully accredited distance-education programs offering high school diplomas; other well-known programs include the North Dakota Division of Independent Study in Fargo and Texas Tech University Distance Learning in Lubbock.
They offer an option for the children of diplomats and missionaries, or those who can't or don't want to go to a schoolhouse every day.
Among young athletes and actors who have studied through Nebraska are Michelle Kwan, the Olympic silver medalist, and Lisa Bonet, a star of ``The Cosby Show''.
While most students take courses to fill gaps in their school records, some 3,400 students have received diplomas from Nebraska since 1968.
With the emergence of home schooling as a viable choice for teen-agers, enrollment has increased almost 50 percent in the last decade, according to James Schiefelbein, the Nebraska school's principal.
Today there are some 5,000 students at any given time, representing more than 130 countries.
Joining the new wave in distance education, the school has begun offering on-line courses and is developing a complete on-line, four-year curriculum with the help of a $15 million grant from the federal Department of Education.
For now, students must take a mix of Web and correspondence courses to meet diploma requirements, which are 40 courses, or 200 course hours.
A course can be completed in as little as five weeks of intensive study, or stretched out for as long as a year.
Assignments are submitted by mail, fax or e-mail to 9 permanent teachers, who grade them with help from 10 to 15 part-timers.
When written examinations are required, a proctor approved by the school administers the tests.
``Our kids do very, very well post- secondary,'' Schiefelbein said.
``They are not dependent on somebody to tell them what to do and when, so they have a little bit of an advantage on their peers because they have become more self-disciplined workers''.
The school designed a program for Liverani, now 28, that allowed him to finish his diploma requirements in a year and a half.
From his remote home, he sent assignments by mail, and they were graded and returned that way.
``They managed to make you feel that you were part of a school,'' said Liverani, who worked this past summer in New York City as an intern at The Economist and is hoping for a journalism job in Europe.
``I sent in a lot of material, and it would be corrected.
They would write a lot.
That was important because it was a continuous relationship''.
Allison Rizzuto, of Omaha, an Independent Study graduate, remembers getting a big box of experiments in the mail for physical science class.
``It's kind of funny, because you are in the kitchen with a bunsen burner and you have to do all these experiments by yourself,'' she said.
Ms. Rizzuto, worried that attending a traditional school until 3 p.m. would derail her career, had convinced her parents to let her take correspondence courses so she could sing in a folk-pop group with her three older sisters.
She studied from 8 a.m. to noon for four years, spending afternoons practicing or touring the county and state fair circuit.
In May her group, Mulberry Lane, named for the street the sisters grew up on, released a debut CD, ``Don't Cry _ Til You Get to the Car,'' which they recorded themselves in their home studio.
``I learned to be self-motivated,'' said Ms.
Rizzuto, now 22.
``In correspondence school, every textbook you get, you have to finish the whole thing.
You read every page of the book''. &QL;
While the teacher settled his class down for a discussion of ``The Iliad,'' a 14-year-old student, Magnus Elhardt, chuckled at a classmate's wisecrack.
The moment was typical of a high school literature class, except the teacher was 150 miles away, the classmate was 3,000 miles away, and Magnus, a home-schooled student in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
, was sitting in front of a computer in his family's kitchen.
His mother, Maria, was ironing a shirt a few feet away.
The lesson, transmitted via computer speakers and computer screen, had the give-and-take of a classroom, complete with student banter and teacher scolding.
But on this particular morning, the teacher, Fritz Hinrichs, was giving a lecture that was dogged by audio bugs _ stutters, reverberations and interruptions.
At times, the class was reminiscent of the Apollo 13 mission, with Houston frantically trying to reach an errant spacecraft.
The technology may be rough, but educational experiments like Hinrichs' are becoming increasingly common among home schoolers.
Since the 1980s, home schooling has largely been viewed as an option for religious fundamentalists and ``Whole Earth Catalog'' types, but there may be a shift in the reasons people choose that approach.
In the 1990s, the number of home schoolers has tripled, and many participating families say they see home schooling as an alternative to mediocre public schools and expensive private schools.
Although it is difficult to categorize those participating in home schooling, Patricia Lines, a researcher at the federal Department of Education, said that in Florida, considered a bellwether state, a survey of home schoolers revealed a shift in recent years in the reasons for choosing home schooling: dissatisfaction with public and private schools was listed first most often, moving ahead of religious reasons.
``It doesn't mean they're secular home schoolers, but their primary motivation has shifted,'' Lines said.
Home-schooled children now number one million, according to Lines, or 1.6 million, according to Dr.
Brian Ray, a researcher at the National Home Education Research Institute, a home-schooling advocacy and research organization based in Oregon.
(The estimates are based on different sources _ it is difficult to track the home-schooling population because reporting rules and mandatory school requirements vary by state).
Technology is playing a role in the popularity of home schooling by providing a support system for novices and helping to blur the line between school-based and home-based education.
Home schoolers, as a group, own computers at a higher rate than other American families.
As of 1996, as many as 86 percent of home schoolers had computers and almost as many were using them to teach their children, according to a study by Ray.
By contrast, computer ownership was less common among the general population of families with children.
Twenty-four percent of single-mother households and 58 percent of married-couple households with children owned computers, according to 1997 figures from the United States Department of Commerce.
Computers can give home-schooling parents expert support for college-preparatory and elective courses for children of high school age, and a large number of children taught at home in the 1980s have now reached adolescence.
Home-schooling sites on the Web range from online academies to support groups for home-schooling parents.
There are virtual trading posts where home schoolers barter for used books or supplies, and Web pages catering to special interest groups, like self-described pagan home schoolers and home schoolers in military families.
The emerging role of the Internet in home schooling has cracked open the door to more collaboration between home schoolers and schools and led to more interest in home-based learning.
In regions where home schooling is so popular that it threatens the financial health of public school districts, some school leaders have used computers to lure home schoolers partway back to the fold.
In 1997, an Alaska school district seeking to raise funds to build a public boarding school developed a program that offered home schoolers the use of new computers (for a $200 refundable deposit), free curriculum supplies and support from an expert teacher if they would enroll in the district.
The families kept home schooling, but their enrollment allowed the district to qualify for more state aid.
The program attracted 2,000 applicants, far exceeding district estimates, and the extra state money helped pay for the new school.
Similar programs are in place in Washington State.
Some public school districts and charter schools are going a step further, offering their curriculums on line.
Usually such services are free for home schoolers who pay local taxes; others must pay tuition.
One of the pioneering online districts, the Federal Way School District in Washington State, began offering its Internet Academy (169.204.208.10/Ia/newlook.htm) to home schoolers three years ago.
In its second year, only 2 of the 250 families enrolled dropped out because of technical problems.
The academy's principal, Linda McInturff, attributes the program's success both to its strong technical assistance, both on line and by phone, and to the home schoolers' willingness to help one another.
nn ``I have found them adopting each other,'' Ms.
McInturff said.
``They are so excited about getting our curriculum that they're willing to go the extra mile''.
Janie Levine Hellyer, a home schooler in Olympia, Wash.
, said on her four-year-old online support network, the Family Learning Exchange (www.flexonline.org): ``Home school parents, by design, are motivated, Home schoolers aren't afraid to ask questions''.
There is disagreement among home-schooling leaders about whether the cyberwave is a major, positive trend or a minor, negative one.
Among those who see technology in home schooling in a rosy light are Mary Pride, publisher of Practical Homeschooling, a bimonthly magazine published in Fenton, Mo.
, and Michael Farris, president of the Home School Legal Defense Association, a lobbying group based in Purcellville, Va.
They characterize technology as a tool that makes it possible to offer advanced classes to the growing number of home schoolers of high school age and as a way to draw school-based students to home schooling.
They predict extensive growth in the number of home schoolers using technology for direct instruction.
``I believe what we're seeing today is not even the tip of the iceberg _ it's the glistening of the water underneath the iceberg,'' said Farris, who offers a yearlong constitutional law class on line.
Home-schooling traditionalists, both religious and secular, express concern about the trend toward high-tech schooling.
The skeptics include Susannah Sheffer, editor of Growing Without Schooling, a 21-year-old bimonthly magazine, and Matt Hern, a writer and home-schooling advocate.
They see technology as, at best, a minor tool that merely encourages the social networking that home schoolers have done all along and, at worst, as an unhealthy replacement for face-to-face community building.
``The point is not to slip into some kind of Luddite freak-out but to realize that technology always replaces something,'' Hern said.
``As a culture, we have an inability to limit our access to technology and our use of tools like the TV and the car.
To say that to be a good home learner you've got to have a $5,000 Pentium computer in the living room is confirming the elitist perception of home schoolers''.
&QL; Technology enthusiasts like Mrs.
Pride, the publisher, counter that the anti-computer home schoolers _ particularly those affiliated with the so-called unschooling movement, which rejects most packaged educational programs in favor of more free-form learning activities guided by children's interests _ are the elitists.
``I think unschoolers sometimes exaggerate the benefits of doing everything yourself,'' she said.
``There is a reason I don't pump my own water and build my own well and make my own electricity and grind my own wheat.
Yes, I could be doing these things, but if the objective is to have kids with characters and have a good education, there are many routes to reach it.
I feel to limit yourself and say, I have to do it all myself, is a mistake.
The outsiders _ they are used to delegating things to other people.
It's this group we're discussing''.
Mrs. Pride holds degrees in electrical engineering and computer systems engineering and was author of one of the first books providing extensive software reviews for home schoolers in the early 1990s, ``Pride's Guide to Educational Software'' (Crossway Books, $25).
Mrs. Pride has 10 computers in her home, three telephone lines connectible to the Internet, and five children enrolled in online courses.
She has experienced the headaches and joys of using technology for home-based learning.
``My 11-year-old is always downloading some dumb game that I always have to delete,'' she said, but the computers have been an unqualified godsend for her 18-year-old son, Theodore.
He was born with fibromuscular disproportion, a condition that led to uneven muscle development.
Four years ago, he suffered a life-threatening bout of pneumonia and endured a series of painful operations for scoliosis.
Today he lives with three steel rods attached to his spine and one-third normal lung capacity.
During his recuperation, his home-schooling curriculum increasingly focused on the computer, and he was a tester for several online learning academies.
He still requires breathing assistance at night, but he has nearly completed school and has started two Web-based businesses, one that creates Web sites and one that monitors and updates company Web sites, both of which he operates from two computers in his bedroom.
``Learning at home without computers would be much more difficult and much less interesting,'' he said.
``A hundred years ago, he would have died,'' Mrs.
Pride said.
``Fifty years ago, he wouldn't have been able to finish his own education or have a job''.
Mrs. Pride is convinced that the home-schooling movement will grow because technology increases the comfort level of ``outsiders'' to the prospect of teaching their own children.
Even die-hard home schoolers like Maria Elhardt and her son Magnus can see the advantages to getting some help.
Neither felt up to the task of tackling Homer on their own.
The weekly online sessions with Hinrichs might have static, but they provide a solid structure for some challenging reading.
&QL; nn ``I really like it because I do learn a lot and it gives me an opportunity to read these books,'' Magnus Elhardt said.
``I probably would not do it on my own because of the length''.
His mother added that Hinrichs knew more than she did about Greek poetry and could do a much better job teaching the subject.
The demand for teaching expertise inspired Janet Hale, 40, a longtime schoolteacher, to quit her job and reinvent herself as a digital tutorial entrepreneur.
The result is Willoway Cyberschool (www.willoway.com).
``A lot of people who have never home-schooled before are hesitant to start because they feel they're going to be completely responsible for their child's education,'' Mrs.
Hale said.
``Now there's teachers behind it all''.
She now operates from a nerve center in her Reading, Pa.
, home, complete with eight computers and numerous tiny eyeball videocameras so she can conduct classes via videoconferencing.
For tuition of $2,250, she works with 40 home-schooled middle-schoolers around the country as their full-time online teacher.
Her program is grounded in technology.
Students create Web pages to hand in assignments and form groups to take part in teacher-guided Web searches for social studies and science lessons.
To appeal to a broader audience, Mrs.
Hale is seeking formal accreditation for her program and planning to market it to schools seeking support for supplemental gifted programs.
Both Mrs.
Hale and Hinrichs see technology as an opportunity for teachers to tailor their work to their own needs.
``The bane of teaching is paperwork _ teachers spend all their time doing paperwork for the administration,'' said Hinrichs, 30, who founded Escondido Tutorial Service (www.gbt.org) close to five years ago.
``I get to read.
I get to really play the role of a scholar and teacher''.
Today he and a partner in Idaho electronically teach a total of 300 students through a $10,000 computer system run out of Hinrichs' home, each earning a comfortable income of more than $55,000 a year.
They teach classes at assigned times all day long using cameras and microphones, and charge students a class-by-class subscription rate.
Easy access to proven expertise and guidance is a key appeal of other online academies, too.
Wendy Pierce, 42, a home schooler in Boston, was overwhelmed by the responsibilities of teaching her eldest daughter high-school-level mathematics several years ago.
She had to compromise by reluctantly sending her teen-age daughter to junior college classes to complete her high-school education.
Today, she solves the same problem by linking her younger children to Scholars Online and Regina Coeli Academies, a pair of online educational programs offered by the Institute for Study of the Liberal Arts and Science, a nonprofit corporation.
These academies link students to expert tutors in all the basic high-school subjects.
``I would be lost trying to figure out the formulas and stuff,'' said Mrs.
Pierce, who now works for the two online academies.
The academies began in 1995 as a Compuserve discussion group for a few students by Linda Robinson, a schoolteacher in Louisiana at the time.
Today the academies attract 140 students in 33 states, Canada and South America.
Classes include live chat, e-mailed assignments, tips on Web surfing and help for parents in organizing the curriculum.
Junior-high-school classes cost $250 a year and high-school classes range from $300 to $350 a year.
The program technology is simple, like a ``schoolbus'' as Mrs.
Pierce puts it: ``It gets you there''.
The teachers work from their home computers, monitoring chat sessions, fielding homework filed by e-mail and organizing bulletin board discussions.
As much as anything else related to technology, the online tutorial is a communication form in transition.
Will the ultimate form lean toward canned lessons available through streaming video coupled with moment-to-moment recording of student performance on an online database, as Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, proposes?
Or will it lean toward live lessons with video, audio and various collaborative tools, as Hinrichs' model does?
That may be one of those questions answerable only by time and technical innovation.
The potential benefits of live interaction were obvious while watching Magnus Elhardt study Homer.
The students chattered in class just as students do everywhere, only this time, their jokes about the teacher's long-winded lecture and age were typed into the chat page for everyone, including the teacher, to see.
Several times, Hinrichs had to remind students not to just type out their answers but to do the online equivalent of raising their hands _ typing an exclamation point.
There was something comforting and familiar about this interaction, and both Magnus and his mother enjoyed the interplay.
``You can tell the smart aleck in the class,'' said his mother, peeking over his head at the computer screen.
ST. LOUIS (AP) -- When other kids were reading Dr.
Seuss or Winnie the Pooh, George Thampy was curled up with Noah Webster.
''He could sit with the dictionary for hours and hours, and still enjoy life,'' said his mother, Bina Thampy, laughing.
''I've never heard him in all these years say 'I'm tired,' 'I'm fed up,' 'Mommy, another day'''.
George started with the dictionary at age 6 and kept on reading it because ''I just really want to be educated''.
It paid off last week when the 12-year-old from Maryland Heights, Mo.
, won the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee by correctly spelling ''demarche'' -- a step or maneuver.
According to George's parents, the key to his victory wasn't the time he spent with the dictionary or the hours of preparation.
It was the hours he spent as a home-schooled student.
''We teach these children the art of studying,'' said K.
George Thampy, George's father.
''If I give him a new thing today, I'm confident he'll become a master of it in a very short period of time with very little help''.
Take, for example, George's second-place performance in the National Geographic Bee a week before the spelling bee.
He began preparing just four months before the finals.
George's successes, along with those of other home-schooled students in such high-profile and high-pressure events, are bringing attention to the home-schooling movement.
The top three finishers at this year's spelling bee were home-schooled, as were four of the 10 finalists in the geography bee, the most ever.
''Events like those of the last week have really helped drive home a strong message that people need not worry about our academic quality,'' said Michael Farris, president of the Home School Legal Defense Association in Purcellville, Va.
''We're going to do just fine''.
The National Home Education Research Institute estimates the number of home-schooled children somewhere between 1.3 and 1.7 million, a number that's growing by at least 7 percent a year.
The Thampys became part of those statistics while living in an area of Houston where public schools had installed metal detectors.
That wasn't the kind of school environment the two immigrants from India had pictured for their children.
They made the decision to home-school six of their seven children.
Mrs. Thampy does most of the teaching, working during the day on languages, economics, social sciences.
Thampy, a fellow in endocrinology at Washington University, works with his kids on math and science at night.
George's brother Eapen was a national finalist in the geography bee in 1997 and 1998, and sister Mallika finished sixth last year.
''We believe we can provide an all around education, an all around development of the child,'' Thampy said.
Farris cites a study that found home-schooled students scored higher than public and private school students on two widely used standardized tests.
''It's not just a few kids that really excel, but that the average home school kid is a top student also,'' Farris said.
There are critics.
The National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers' union, doesn't believe home-schooling can provide students with a comprehensive education.
But NEA spokeswoman Kathleen Lyons admits there are obvious advantages to home-schooling.
''What a great class size,'' she said.
''Every teacher in America would like that''.
George's education stresses the three Rs, as well as public speaking, personal hygiene and health.
He takes field trips with other home-schooled students to museums, farms and his dad's endocrinology lab at Washington University in St.
Louis. Sometimes he learns in a group with his siblings, but often he is taught individually and frequently he does in-depth research on subjects via the Internet.
''I have no trouble relating to kids who go to conventional schools.
They don't think I'm strange because I'm home-schooled, especially since we study the same subjects, only in a different way,'' George wrote in a letter published Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal.
His parents caution that it's not as easy as it might sound.
The couple put in long hours into teaching their children -- as well as forging an extremely close, personal relationship with each of them.
''The struggle is the time,'' Thampy said.
''It is extremely expensive in the aspect of time.
You never can do all the things you want for the children.
Your work gets behind''.

America must never give up on public education.
The surest predictor of any nation's future is the priority it gives to educating its young.
Nations, like families, express their priorities in the things for which they're willing to spend their money.
Excellence in education can be expensive, Lloyd Bentsen once remarked, ``but not half as expensive as ignorance''.
One of the policy disagreements that kept Congress and the president at loggerheads for months this year was whether to budget $1.1 billion to help states hire 100,000 more classroom teachers and thus reduce the widespread overcrowding that handicaps learning.
The item was finally accepted.
But other goals, like computerizing every classroom, making sure every child reads by the third grade, and making two years of junior college as standard as a high school diploma went unfunded.
Legislators who assent without murmur to annual military budgets approaching $300 billion and multibillion-dollar highway bills seem pickier when it comes to the public schools.
Some hark back to pre-World War II days, when federal monies played practically no part in educating America's children.
States and school districts had virtually the entire responsibility.
Glaring disparities were widespread.
Massachusetts, for example, apportioned eight times as much for each of its students annually as did Mississippi.
For low- to medium-income families throughout America, the quality of educational opportunity became an accident of geography.
Then modern war taught us that the general level of learning was as essential to our national survival as the quality of our arms.
By President Lyndon B.
Johnson's administration, it became a matter of national pride to ensure the humblest American child a birthright to a first-class education.
Virtually every American profited in some way from the GI Bill of Rights that sprang from World War II.
It may have been history's most massive transfusion of money into education.
That program paid rich dividends to the nation.
The percent of America's youth finishing four years of college increased in one generation from 4.5 percent to 21.5 percent.
America boomed economically and bloomed intellectually.
As a financial investment, the GI Bill paid for itself at least 40 times over.
Because college graduates earn more, they've paid more taxes.
As a direct result of America's enhanced earning power, the coffers of the U.S.
Treasury have been enriched enormously.
And every one of us is a beneficiary of the discoveries, inventions and technologies flowing from the fountains of knowledge that bold experiment unleashed.
When the Soviets beat us into space in 1957 with Sputnik, it shocked us into the sudden realization that we'd neglected scientific studies.
Uncomfortably apprehensive at being behind, we launched our massive space effort, which ultimately overtook and surpassed that of the Soviets.
With a sense of national survival at stake, Democratic and Republican members of Congress submerged their differences and joined hands, not quarreling over credit.
The global economy now bursting upon the scene must convince us that our quality of life depends more than ever upon a high level of education, broadly shared.
A handful of geniuses won't suffice.
The widespread diffusion of knowledge and modern job skills among ordinary Americans will be our surest salvation.
Some haven't yet comprehended the truth that it matters to all of us how the rest of us are educated.
Here in Texas, some residents of affluent neighborhoods appear to resent the state law that shares a part of their property taxes with our state's impoverished school districts.
A few school boards have sought ways to circumvent that law.
Meanwhile, some critics are almost ready to give up on the public schools.
Conscientious parents, eager to have the best for their children, increasingly resort to home schooling.
Both national and state legislators, looking for an easy fix, want to abdicate the responsibility of providing excellence in public education.
They'd prefer to offer vouchers, subsidizing private schools while further draining public school systems, relegating them to second-rate status.
There's a lot to admire in parents who are willing to oversee their children's education personally on a daily basis.
Parental guidance is vital.
It takes patience and perseverance to teach one's own child, at home, all those things that an enlightened educational curriculum requires.
My hat is off to those who try.
For most Americans, however, daily home schooling would present insurmountable problems.
The vast majority of parents today couldn't manage that.
The average American family now has two bread-earners, not one.
What comforts will they sacrifice so that one can be at home all day, every day, teaching the children all the good things they'd otherwise learn in school?
Moreover, I believe that a vital part of the learning comes from the mixing.
A broad education cannot be administered in a vacuum.
For most children, the elementary grades have been our most important introduction to the wide world of other people.
And in this increasingly global environment, nobody and no nation can survive indefinitely within a protective shell.
That's why I do not rue the property taxes we pay on our residence to the Crowley school district, or resent any portion that may end up helping children in El Paso or the Rio Grande Valley.
It could tap some wellspring of undiscovered genius from whose works mankind will benefit.
What better use of money could there be?

WASHINGTON _ The fast-spreading home schooling movement got another boost from this year's national spelling and geography bees.
For the third year in a row, at least 5 percent of the participants in the National Spelling Bee were being educated by their parents at home, rather than in a public or private school.
``I guess cream rises to the top,'' joked Bry(cq) Conley of Newark, Calif.
, as she discussed the strong showing by her son Sean and the dozen other home schoolers among the 249 students in the spelling bee.
In the televised climax Thursday, two of the eight finalists were home-schooled.
They were Ann Foley, 13, of Marion, Ohio, who tied for sixth, and George Thampy, 11, of Maryland Heights, Mo.
, who tied for third.
Last week, five of the 55 contestants in the National Geography Bee were home schoolers, and David Beihl of Saluda, S.C., became the first home schooler to win the geography bee.
In the spelling bee, the first and only home schooler to win so far was Rebecca Sealfon of Brooklyn, N.Y., two years ago.
``The spelling and geography bees offer confirmation that home schooling can work very well indeed,'' said Michael Farris, president of the Home School Legal Defense Association in Purcellville, Va.
, which helped topple many legal barriers to home schooling.
``I think the movement's coming of age''.
The strong showing by home schoolers really beats the odds.
U.S. Department of Education studies indicate that their numbers have more than doubled in this decade, and now probably exceed 1 million.
But that is still less than 2 percent of all children of school age.
Home schooling ``is excellent for a very few parents, with very strong motivation,'' said K.
George Thampy, shortly before his son's third-place finish Thursday.
Thampy works as a biochemist and physician, and his wife Bina teaches young George, his two brothers and three sisters at their home near St.
Louis. ``Our decision to home-school our children was scripturally based,'' Thampy said.
``We wanted their education to stress character development and godly values which are not promoted in local schools''.
Conley, on the other hand, said she and her husband, Mike, a software engineer, were primarily interested in creating ``customized educations'' for Sean, 11, and his two younger brothers.
``What's cool about home schooling is that you can pick up whatever method, subjects or approaches work for your family and for your kid,'' said Conley.
She said her sons will sometimes concentrate on one to three subjects for two to three months in a row.
``Parents who try to reproduce the factory-school system _ you sit at the kitchen table and study the same courses as regular schools from 9 to 3 _ burn out after two or three years,'' Conley said.
``But that's what's great about home schooling: If you don't agree with me, you can do just that''.
``More than half of all home schooling parents are motivated by religion, usually Christian,'' said policy analyst Kevin Welner of the graduate school of education at the University of Denver, Boulder.
``But there is great diversity within that group, and among the rest of the home schoolers, both in pedagogical theory and in (ideological) orientation''.
For example, he said, some wouldn't want their children to compete in bees.

KANSAS CITY, Mo.
_ At 13, Michael Brown pulled apart 60 computers that had been left for trash.
As part of his home-schooling, he turned them into 35 working machines.
Five years later, those computers are being used by his four brothers, a sister and home-schoolers in their Blue Springs, Mo.
, community.
There is sweet symmetry to this: The proliferation of computers is partly responsible for a boom in home schooling, a movement that's attracting more gifted children.
Access to the Internet has made home curriculums richer than ever before.
And they've also provided the parent/teachers the information they need to enter their students in local, state and national competitions.
.MDNM/And those students are winning.
Just last week, homeschooler George A.
Thampy of Missouri placed first at the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee in Washington.
Two other home-schooled students placed second and third.
The previous week, George placed second in the National Geography Bee.
The 12-year-old from suburban St.
Louis was the second homeschooler to win the spelling bee.
In 1997 Rebecca Sealfon of Brooklyn, N.Y., won.
``As homeschoolers learn they are eligible to compete in these competitions, they begin joining in droves,'' said Michael Farris, executive director of the Center for Home School Education Legal Department.
``We started a national homeschoolers' debate program four years ago with about 150 kids.
Now there are 1,200 members''.
Twenty-seven of the 248 national spelling bee contestants this year were schooled at home.
But computers alone don't explain why more home-schooled children are appearing in major academic competitions.
Within the last five years, some educators say, major corporations that sponsor these contests have begun to accept home schooling as a legitimate, alternative form of education.
``Years ago when we applied to get into district contests, we were turned away,'' said Barbie Lay, president of Johnson County (Kan).
Parent Educators, which has more than 900 families as members.
``But doors continued to open as more numbers of us started knocking on them saying, `Can we get our children involved'?
'' No firm statistics exist on the prevalence of home education, but experts say it's becoming more popular.
According to the Center for Home School Education in Virginia, as many as 1.7 million children in the United States are taught at home.
About 30,000 to 35,000 live in Missouri, and 15,000 to 17,500 in Kansas.
In the early days of the movement, most parents home schooled for religious reasons, and not all of the students did so well, said Peter Rosenstein, executive director of the National Association for Gifted Children.
``But now a lot of gifted kids become home schooled because their school can't meet their needs,'' he said.
Brown is a stellar example.
When he was 11 and ready for sixth grade, his mother said, she wanted him in the Blue Springs School District's gifted program.
She says she was told that he hadn't lived in the district long enough to be properly tested and therefore wasn't yet eligible.
The Browns had moved from California two years earlier.
``We decided his needs were not being met and he would be educated at home,'' said Brown's mother, Robin Brown.
``He was our experimental child''.
By 16, Brown was enrolled at Longview Community College.
While his peers in the class of 2000 were collecting high school diplomas, he was getting his associate's degree.
Brown starts a pre-med program at the University of Missouri-Columbia in the fall.
He wants to be a doctor or medical researcher.
``I think being home schooled made the difference,'' said Brown, who is 18.
``If I had stayed in public school I wouldn't be where I am now''.
Brown was not a contest joiner, but his 13-year-old brother, Grant, wants to be.
He's constructing a Web page he will enter in a local technology competition this summer.
He learned about the contest from other homeschoolers he chats with via computer.
Public schools still have the advantage in areas like science and sports.
But as even more resources become available, advocates of the movement predict that homeschoolers will be more competitive in those arenas, too.
``Home-schooled children are just like public school children _ they are all different and they learn differently,'' said Robin Brown, who is teaching Grant and his sister Nicole, 11, at home, while their brothers, Nathan, 10, Ephraim, 7, and Caleb, 6, attend Young Elementary School.
Robin and her husband, David Brown, dispute those who say only the gifted home schoolers are successful.
But Cathy Zeysing, owner of Cathy's Creative Dance School in Independence, has noticed that the homeschoolers in her studio who excel are also otherwise exceptional.
Zeysing is a parent, and she teaches remedial reading in Blue Springs schools.
Like others involved in mainstream education, she wonders whether the home schooler can be well-rounded.
``I am a teacher and I don't think I have all the skills to teach my child everything my child would need to be successful in life,'' Zeysing said.
``My hats go off to parents who do this''.
The Browns say it's not easy, but the key is remembering this: ``Gifted is a relative term''.
Their daughter Nicole doesn't like to read.
She prefers crafts and animals but has read many of the same books Grant has read.
``She is also pretty good at the hula,'' her dad said.
But unlike Grant, their mother said, Nicole probably will not go to college.
She wants to go to cosmetology school.
``I tell her fine, just do your best.
Nicole will probably be a gifted hairdresser.''
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The growing home school movement commanded an audience Friday with five of the nine Republicans running for president, each proclaiming that if parents want to teach their children at home, the government should let them.
``We view home schooling as something to be respected and something to be protected,'' Texas Gov.
George W.
Bush told a conference of the Home School Legal Defense Association.
``Respected for the energy and commitment of loving mothers and loving fathers.
Protected -- protected -- from the interference of government''.
The candidates, who appeared separately in the Daughters of the American Revolution auditorium, were unanimous in their salute of the movement's progress.
An association-sponsored study last spring showed that home-schooled students, numbering an estimated 1.5 million, score well above the national median on standardized tests and often study above their normal grade level.
``No parent in America should be forced to send their child to a lousy school.
Period,'' said publisher Steve Forbes.
``You've shamed the regular school systems with what you've achieved.
For those who have carped and criticized and said, 'What about socialization'?...
you look at some of our schools, you call that socialization''?
Gary Bauer, an undersecretary in President's Reagan's Education Department, promised, ``When I'm in the White House, you will have a reliable friend for home schooling sitting in the Oval Office''.
Home-schooling parents are ``on the front lines, the cutting edge of the education debate,'' Bauer said.
The speaker's roster of presidential candidates, including Republicans Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes, plus independent New Hampshire Sen.
Bob Smith, was testimony to the potency of education in this campaign and the growing appeal of home schooling among religious and political conservatives disenchanted with public schools.
Since the association was founded in 1983, when home schooling was not even legal in all 50 states as it is today, the number of children whose parents eschew schools for at-home lessons grew from a couple hundred to today's estimate of 1.5 million to 1.7 million, said HSLDA spokesman Richard Jefferson.
During a musical slide show between political speakers and prayer offerings, the audience -- sprinkled with baby strollers and slouched children in play clothes -- burst into applause when the screen flashed Patrick Henry's immortal line, ``Give me liberty or give me death''.
Michael Farris, president of the Virginia-based association, said his 65,000-member families -- up from 29,000 in 1993 -- have just one message to Washington policymakers: ``Leave us alone''.
Bush offered just a couple sentences on home schooling before launching into his standard stump speech.
``I know this might not be the proper forum for a political speech,'' Bush said.
``But I can't resist''.
He encouraged activism by his religious audience.
``The role of the president is to say to people of faith, 'You're welcome to help change America because changing hearts will change America for the better,''' Bush said.
Jan Childress, visiting from Kalona, Iowa, with her home-schooled son, sported a Keyes campaign button.
But, after hearing Bush, she told a reporter: ``Maybe it won't be so bad if he is elected.
I'm beginning to feel like I can more trust what he's saying.''
DENVER (AP) -- When Sherie Ferguson learned two teen-age gunmen opened fire at Columbine High, she jumped in her car and sped through traffic to find her daughter, a 15-year-old freshman at a neighboring high school.
The next day, with the death toll in the Littleton school massacre at 15, Ms.
Ferguson decided she would teach Brandi at home.
``Sending her back to Bear Creek, where security is virtually nonexistent, to me that's gambling,'' said Ms.
Ferguson, a single parent.
``Look at all the copy cats.
I don't think it's going to stop.
How can it''?
It is too early to know how many parents will opt for home schooling, but educators in Colorado said there was a 30 percent to 40 percent increase in interest immediately after Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, went on their rampage April 20.
The two seniors killed 12 classmates and a teacher and injured 25 others at Columbine before committing suicide.
A month later, Thomas Solomon Jr.
, 15, was accused of wounding six students at Heritage High School in Conyers, Ga.
, amplifying jitters about school safety.
``There's a tension out there, and parents are very curious what they can do about it,'' said Brian Ray of the National Home Education Research Institute in Oregon.
``Many people see home schooling as a way to protect children''.
Although the number of headline-seizing, multiple-victim attacks recently has gone up, government figures show a general decline in school crime.
In a report released last year, the Education Department found 90 percent of schools reported no serious violent crime in 1996-1997.
Fewer students brought weapons to schools, based on surveys beginning in 1993 of students in grades 9-12.
And the overall crime rate at schools dropped between 1993-1996, based on surveys of students 12-19.
``My feeling is that it is not the safety issue as much as that that was the last straw,'' said Michael Kasson of the Colorado Home Educators Association.
For most parents, the decision to home school can take years and is based on numerous factors, including the quality of public school education, the specific needs of a child, a wish to emphasize moral or religious guidelines, or distance from the nearest school, particularly in rural areas.
Increasingly, however, parents are citing security as a reason for turning living rooms into classrooms.
``It certainly was a stick in the fire,'' said Terry Deharsh, a locksmith who attended the Christian Home Educators of Colorado's recent statewide conference on home schooling.
Although there is an elementary school across the street from the Deharshes' home in Greeley, Deharsh and his wife, Lindee, plan to home school their 5-year-old daughter.
``Thrill-seekers are going to look for a group,'' Deharsh said.
``If someone wants to kill my daughter at home, they have to know her, they have to have a reason to kill her and they have to come looking for her''.
Even without Columbine, the number of home schoolers has increased 7 percent to 15 percent nationally in the past five years, with up to 1.6 million children home schooled in 1998, according to National Home Education Research Institute.
Suzy Parker, director of the Colorado Department of Education's home schooling program, said she received five calls a day, twice the normal amount, from parents seeking information in the month that followed the Columbine shooting.
In several states with fatal school-related shootings -- Pearl, Miss.
West Paducah, Ky.
Jonesboro, Ark.
Edinboro, Pa.
and Springfield, Ore.
-- there may have been an increase in interest in home schooling, but not necessarily in numbers.
``What comes mostly is we get more opportunities to speak, to go talk to people about it,'' said Richard Karman, chairman of the board of the Oregon Christian Home Education Association Network.
``Those requests are up probably, a ball park figure, maybe as much as up a third.''
Once upon a time, immigrant families turned to the public schools to Americanize their children: teach them English, introduce them to the broader culture, and point them in the direction of the streets paved with gold.
But today, as the melting pot metaphor is eclipsed by multiculturalism, more and more Americans are rejecting public schools and turning to home schooling in an effort to safeguard their children's cultural and religious identity.
Muslims, one of the United States' fastest-growing populations, are following the lead of other groups, including evangelical Christians, in opting out of American public schools.
``They're growing up as Americans, and they have to integrate, but we want them to keep their Islamic identity intact, and not have it washed away or assaulted,'' said Beverly Beresford, a 36-year-old Muslim mother of three teaching her children at home.
The surge in home schooling is part of a broader trend in which many Americans driven by moral as well as educational concerns are choosing religious, charter, and pilot schools for their children.
For some, it's a development that raises fundamental, even troubling, questions about the future of public education.
``We are living at a time in which the schools are under attack, and people are seeking alternatives,'' said Arthur E.
Levine, president of Teachers College at Columbia University.
``The nature of socialization has also changed,'' he said.
``Once the hope of people entering was that they would become Americanized and indistinct from the pack.
Now we're having a battle over how much we want in common and how much we want to be different''.
Muslim home-schoolers scoff at the suggestion that their children might somehow be isolated from the larger culture because they are home schooled.
Their children play in sports leagues with non-Muslim children, go on field trips with non-Muslim children, meet with non-Muslim home-schoolers, and are inundated with mainstream American culture, they say.
``We're not trying to withdraw or create a shell _ that's unrealistic and unfair to the children,'' Beresford said.
The challenge, Beresford and other parents say, is communicating Islamic faith, history, and values to their children in the face of the broader and more dominant culture.
``Muslims are a new, emerging community, and a number of them are not happy with the public-schooling system, either because they feel that the schools are not really teaching their kids right or they object that they are not paying attention to moral issues,'' said Aly Abuzaakouk, executive director of the American Muslim Council, who said education is the top concern of Muslims in America.
``There is a secular turn in public schooling that Muslim families are not happy with, and some of those who are not able to join Muslim schools do home schooling''.
The Muslim home-schooling movement resembles, and in some ways piggybacks on, the wider home-schooling movement popularized by evangelical Christians since the 1980s.
The Christian home-schoolers cite many of the same reasons as Muslims _ a desire to inculcate their children with values and behavioral norms that are off-limits in public schools.
``If a person has a strong belief in the area of religion, they're going to want to pass it on to their children, and the only effective way is to teach them at home,'' said Michael Smith, president of the Home School Legal Defense Association.
The organization estimates that 1.7 million American youngsters are now home schooled _ a number contested as too high by some _ and although the majority are thought to be white evangelical Christians with highly educated parents, Smith said his group is seeing rapid growth in home schooling among other religious groups, such as Muslims and Catholics.
But for American Muslims _ an ethnically diverse and fast-growing group whose population is estimated to be 6 million to 7 million _ it is not yet clear whether home schooling will be a permanent part of the landscape or a temporary phenomenon until the community builds more private schools.
Already there are two Muslim grade schools in Greater Boston, the Al-Hamra Academy in Northborough and the Islamic Academy of New England in Sharon.
There are no statistics about the numbers of Muslim home-schoolers in this country, but it is clear that most Muslims still send their children to public schools and depend on weekend Islamic schools for religious instruction.
Nevertheless, there are several organizations devoted to the topic, including the Muslim Home School Network (www.muslimhomeschool.com), which is hosting a home-schooling convention in Sharon on Saturday and Sunday.
The organization is directed by Cynthia Sulaiman, a mother of four, who started her eldest children in the public schools but then decided to teach her family at home.
Like Sulaiman, Beresford sent her eldest son to public school for a year before deciding to try home schooling.
``Our local school is quite good, but we felt that because in Islam, you want to integrate religion into all aspects of life, we could achieve that better by home schooling,'' she said.
Beresford and Sulaiman teach their children at home for some of the same reasons cited by other home-schooling parents: a desire for safety, a concern about the secular nature of public schools, and a hope their children will do better with individual attention.
But they have other, less familiar concerns: They want their children to pray five times a day, they want their daughters to be able to cover their heads without fear of teasing, and they don't want boys mixing socially with girls.
They teach the basics _ reading, writing, and mathematics _ alongside Islamic history, culture, and religion.
Beresford and Sulaiman are both converts to Islam who married immigrants from Islamic countries.
Scholars say home schooling has been particularly popular among American Muslim families in which at least one parent was born in the United States, perhaps because the home-schooling phenomenon is most familiar to Americans, and perhaps because of a concern that children of converts are thought to be less likely to retain their parents' chosen faith.
``There are more parents who want to do it, but feel they are not equipped, and those who are equipped are often African-American or Euro-American Muslims,'' said Shabbir Mansuri, executive director of the Council on Islamic Education, a California-based organization that works to improve and expand the depiction of Islam and Muslims in textbooks.
Variations of home schooling, such as groups of families teaching their children together, have been popular particularly among African-American Muslims, said Ilyas Ba-Yunus, a sociologist at State University of New York at Cortland.
``Many of these people are new converts who are very unhappy with the drugs and guns and dating and sex that they consider to be un-Islamic,'' Ba-Yunus said.
``They think their own teaching at home will be morally strong, and that they will be able to counter whatever immoral things are happening in school.
They're not always successful, but this is their logic.''
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.
_ One problem with home schooling: There are too many parts in the school play for one little family.
Nine-year-old Kaemmerle Fitzpatrick must be a red-scarfed sailor set sail for Roanoke Island, as well as an aproned lady expecting the first English baby in the colony.
She and her sister, 10-year-old Annika, the white-wigged captain, take off for the New World on a lawn chair.
But it's their mother, Freya Fitzpatrick, who thinks of herself as the real pioneer in this suburban Lantana back yard.
She has taught her two girls at home for the past seven years _ before the home-schooling magazines sold, the Orlando conventions opened, and the trendy (and home-schooled) Hanson brothers inspired widespread teen love.
The Fitzpatrick sisters are two of the 2,240 Palm Beach County students who may sit barefoot at their kitchen desks this year, while their parents put on teaching caps.
Since 1994, their numbers have tripled in Palm Beach County and nearly doubled statewide.
There were 31,440 Florida students home schooled last year.
In Palm Beach County, home-schooled students must register with the district superintendent's office.
State law also requires them to keep a portfolio that can be shown to the superintendent on 15 days' notice.
The rapidly increasing numbers may be due, in part, to new state laws.
In 1996, home-schooled students were allowed to participate in sports and music programs at high schools.
And as of May 1997, they may apply to two-year colleges with merely an affidavit signed by their parent.
The school district doesn't keep figures on how many home-schooling students participate in public school activities or enroll in high school classes, but a few do, said district spokesman Nat Harrington.
The home-schooling community here offers at least six support groups from Boca Raton to Palm Beach Gardens.
They meet weekly for martial arts in Royal Palm Beach; they buy blocks of tickets for Kravis Center events; and they hold their own spelling bees.
There are chess and stock market clubs, field trips to the Space Center and SeaWorld, and special classes taught by parents: How to measure temperature using a cricket.
As the home-schooling community has grown, it has become more diverse.
It is not exclusively white or Christian anymore.
And the reasons parents are choosing it also are becoming more varied.
When state specialist Mary Lou Carruthers started talking to home-schooling parents three years ago, there were mainly two reasons for their choice: They had wanted the little ones to learn about Christ in the classroom, or they worried about drugs, knives and guns.
More and more, parents talk about the latter, the safety issue, she said.
In Palm Beach County, parents also talk about crowded classrooms and they worry their children might not get their teacher's attention, said Beth Kramer, local director of the Florida Parent Educators Association, who has taught five children at home.
Before deciding to home school, Freya Fitzpatrick considered Indian Pines Elementary, less than a mile from her home.
But administrators said no when she asked to spend a day in a kindergarten class, she said.
``If they're not willing to let me see school in action, I'm not comfortable sending my daughter there,'' she said.
Fitzpatrick, who has a master's degree in education, taught five years in public and private schools.
When she first heard about home schooling, she thought it was a terrible idea.
``I thought it just had to be one of the craziest things that parents who weren't educators could think they could teach.
It was presumptuous,'' she said.
But out of desperation, she bought alphabet posters and measuring cups, and then realized she'd have plenty of help.
Her father gives tennis lessons, her former Latin professor advises, and other parents offer geology and Spanish classes.
``I am the general contractor and I know how I want the house to turn out.
Not everybody wants to build a Christian child; they might want a non-religious or Muslim child.
That's the nice thing about home schooling, you can choose,'' she said.
For an educator like Fitzpatrick, it's an exciting opportunity.
She can build an entire human being as if she were painting a whole picture, not just the corner, she said.
Their day starts at 8:15 a.m. with violin lessons.
At 8:30, Fitzpatrick and her girls kneel under a homemade time line that notes both Moses and William Tell, and recite the Lord's Prayer.
They belong to the New Church _ the girls' father and grandfather were missionaries _ which broke from the Methodists 200 years ago.
The church emphasizes independent thinking, Fitzpatrick said.
Fitzpatrick's schedule, which she plans months ahead, sets out 15 or 30-minute blocks for Russian, Swedish, Spanish and traditional subjects like math and dictation.
When they fall minutes behind, she says, ``We're wasting time!
And that's what life is made of''.
But not all home schoolers are so organized.
``Unschoolers,'' who believe learning should be naturally led by the children, wouldn't have planned classes.
They might spend a week learning about bats, if their children felt like it, and go to the zoo, build a bat house, and read bat books.
During spring break, home-schooled students can take a standardized test, or a certified teacher can gauge their progress by looking at a student's portfolio at the end of the year.
The Florida Parent Educators Association encourages parents to find a teacher who ``understands home-schooling philosophies''.
The students only have to show appropriate progress for their age, according to state law.
The state has never been able to compare the achievement of home-schooled students against public school students, as much as they'd like to, Carruthers said.
One national study shows the average home schooler scores at the 73rd percentile on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills.
The national average is 50.
Those results are unreliable because the students in the study were selected by the researcher, a home schooler himself, Carruthers said.
On Monday afternoons, Annika has chemistry _ she wants to live on a Mars colony some day _ and she skips around the kitchen wearing safety glasses.
For an experiment on the atomic weight of magnesium, the Fitzpatrick's gas stove must be a home-schooling Bunsen (cq) burner.
Annika would be a fifth-grader, if enrolled in public school, but she works at a sixth-grade level, sometimes seventh- and eighth-grade, her mother said.
Socially, she may not be comfortable with her peers in a public school unless they were gifted, she added.
The girls do socialize.
They take karate on Monday afternoons with 30 other students and roller skate on Fridays.
They belong to a New Church youth group, a home-schooling aviation club and 4-H Explorers Club.
When neighbor kids stop by, Annika flops down on the carpet with a board game and offers to teach the competition.
``I don't need sixth grade, I've already done all their work and some of the work I do is high-school work,'' Annika said.
She and her sister work unsupervised for much of the day.
Freya Fitzpatrick wants them to learn responsibility, as well as their spelling words.
Kaemmerle still needs a little help.
Each plastic block holds one flea, according to today's fanciful lesson plan, but Kaemmerle has no idea how many fleas fit in her seven-story hotel.
(It has four rooms on each level).
She doesn't remember yesterday's math equation _ volume equals height times area _ and she doesn't want to admit it.
So she cries at the dining room table and snaps at her mother.
``You haven't taught me,'' she accuses.
``It's not that I haven't taught you, you don't remember,'' replies Freya Fitzpatrick.
``We've talked about this before, but every so often you get confused, which is OK.
It's why we're here''.
Fitzpatrick has uncommon patience, but it breaks occasionally.
She is the only authority for her children for much of the day.
When they stop listening to her, it might be time for regular school, she said.
The girls say never.
``I like home schooling.
We can have some decision in what we learn and she can focus on just us, not a whole class,'' Kaemmerle said.
``She's our mother, we have her attention''.
But their mother is clear-eyed about the whole adventure.
Someday her children might need lessons that she's unable to teach.
Someday her husband, an accountant at Office Depot, might not want to shoulder the financial burden alone.
But right now, she believes there's no better education for her girls.
By the way, Kaemmerle figures it out _ yes, it's 28 fleas _ and tosses the paper across the dining room table.
``Happy''? the 9-year-old asks her mom.
``Yes,'' comes the reply.

PALO ALTO, Calif.
_ Education reformers of conservative or libertarian stripe are already hanging crepe for the school voucher initiative on the California ballot next month.
It will be a major blow to their movement nationally if voters in the most populous state reject, for the second time in less than 10 years, the idea of giving public money to parents to help students escape public schools.
Vouchers are an intellectually interesting but largely untested article of faith for many in the camp that correctly diagnoses the poor state of public education but then often fixates on teachers unions, vehement opponents of vouchers, as the taproot of a problem that has far more diverse causes.
The California initiative, Proposition 38, would give parents $4,000 for every school-age child that could be spent for any form of currently sanctioned education _ including parochial, secular private, charter school, home schooling.
It's the brainchild of high-tech venture capitalist Tim Draper, a guy with more money than political skill.
Draper unwisely rejected pleas of some voucher supporters to target the proposal for the poor or on demonstrably wretched schools (which are virtually one and the same thing).
He also did not seek to insulate the measure from criticism that helped doom a similar California initiative in 1993, especially a lack of rules to guarantee equity and access in private education.
Draper has pledged to spend up to $20 million on the campaign.
And with the issue tanking, he has offered Hawaiian vacations, computers and shopping sprees to folks who'll sign up supporters.
But it seems a lost cause, Stanford political scientist _ and voucher supporter _ Terry Moe told a Hoover Institution seminar staffed by what the professor called ``a small band of nonconformists''.
``Who is supporting this?
No one,'' Moe said.
``It's a bump along the road that didn't have to be there''.
The most recent statewide survey of the Public Policy Institute of California showed more than a majority of likely voters already oppose Prop.
38 _ a near-fatal standing for a ballot initiative a month before an election.
The PPIC analysis is that the measure ``faces an uphill battle in large part because it is not viewed as a solution to improving schools or student performance''.
A similar fate may await a voucher initiative next month in Michigan, where even Republican Gov.
John Engler opposes the proposal, which at heart is a repeal of the state's constitutional ban on public aid to private schools.
The Michigan plan would provide just over $3,000 of state money per child in districts that graduate less than two-thirds of their students _ a formula that would include the giant (and egregiously problem-ridden) Detroit system and about 30 others statewide.
Among the initiative's biggest backers is the self-interested Roman Catholic Church, operator of the state's largest private school system.
Model sermons are being drafted for pre-election exhortations.
The National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union, is, as usual, playing tough.
At its national convention in July, the NEA instituted a &QL; $5-a-member assessment to fight voucher programs, $3 of which (or some $6 million) is earmarked for the ``no'' campaigns in California and Michigan.
Only about 50,000 students are in voucher programs, meaning suggestions of success are anecdotal at best and provide far too sketchy findings on which to base wholesale changes in the nation's education system, even as troubled as it admittedly is.
Given vouchers' political baggage and the prospect of approaching bad luck at the polls, it seems that incremental advances with smaller, experimental programs, for vouchers as well as other proposals, would be a better way to go.
But that suggestion from the Hoover audience drew what seemed to be an unappreciative sneer from some of the crusading ``nonconformists''.
Chester Finn, a Vanderbilt professor and Manhattan Institute fellow who was a Reagan administration Education Department official, said that reaching for something bold and extreme sometimes allows the merely interesting to bubble up.
That could be a desirable cause and effect, but there is little evidence that it's actually occurring.

Fragrant Night Bloomers Q.
I love fragrant plants, but I don't like bees!
Is there anything I can grow that will perfume the garden without attracting insects?
A. Perfume that doesn't attract insects would be a horticultural oxymoron: putting out the come hither for pollinating bugs is a flower's raison d'etre, and perfume is a large part of the mating dance.
But you can have a fragrant garden low on bees by planting flowers and shrubs that open their blossoms at night.
Choices range from the small, inconspicuous, but mighty perfumed annual known as night-blooming stock (Matthiola bicornis) to the many cultivated varieties of Brugmansia, a tropical tree that can grow to 10 feet and has been showing up in nurseries under the name angels' trumpets.
All parts of Brugmansia are highly poisonous, but there's no denying the plant's appeal.
Its huge flowers blare tropical sweetness from dusk until almost sunup.
White is the most common color, and usually the most fragrant, but Brugmansia also comes in yellow, orange, peaches and pinks.
You'd never know it from the modern cultivars, which have been bred to stay open during the day, but old fashioned flowering tobacco (Nicotiana alata) has a very strong night perfume, and so does its much taller, more architecturally splendid cousin, N.
sylvestris. Other candidates include moonflower vines, night-blooming jasmine, evening primrose and the oddball Pardon Me, a day lily that doesn't get going until the sun goes down.
Brugmansia and matthiola are widely sold.
Pardon me (and other fragrant night bloomers) can be mail ordered from Snow Creek Daylily Gardens, P.O.
Box 2007, 330 P Street, Port Townsend, Wash.
98368, (360) 385-1738, catalog, $3.

The Potato Beetle Wars Q.
Help! Colorado potato beetles are destroying my potato plants.
I've been trying to go the organic route, handpicking them every day.
It's not working.
If I don't do something soon, I'm afraid the plants will die.
&QL; A.
Leptinotarsa decemlineata, to give the miserable creature its proper name, is among the most difficult garden pests to control, organically or otherwise.
Don't panic.
Potato plants can take a lot of defoliation and still produce a decent crop.
But do take action, employing multiple strategies for best results.
Start by applying a dose of the organic gardener's friend, Bacillus thuringiensis var.
san diego (or var.
tenebrionis). It is effective at killing small larvae, though only after they've consumed some of it.
This means spraying thoroughly (and repeatedly) according to the directions that come with the stuff.
It also means you're still stuck with larger larvae and adults.
Those can be killed with rotenone, a comparatively mild botanical poison permitted for use by organic gardeners.
Neem extract (Azadirachtin) is also on the organic list.
Well-stocked garden centers and farm supply stores will usually have these products.
Handpicking is still very useful, if it includes crushing the clusters of bright orange-yellow eggs that hide under the leaves.
It costs nothing, it doesn't pollute or kill any other creatures.
It keeps populations down and soothes gardeners, who if they have potato beetles, also have frustrations and aggressions that need release.
Unfortunately, it's not perfect.
No matter how thorough you are, you always miss a few, and you don't have to miss many to lose the war.
A single female can have 10,000 decendants by the end of summer.
One advantage (for the beetles) of numbers like these is the chance at resistant mutations.
No matter which controls you use, a few will be resistant, and those few will be multitudes ere long.
That's why it's important to attack on several fronts.
To add insult to infestation, Colorado potato beetles can live a full two years.
But they won't stay around where there's nothing to eat, so the final, or first, line of defense is late planting.
If they don't find any potato, eggplant or nicotiana leaves when they emerge from the ground in spring, they'll leave.
More will appear, but if you can thwart that first wave, subsequent ones will be much smaller.

Spiders kill off insects and help plants boost seed production in exchange for dollops of sugary nectar, say scientists in New Jersey.
Many species of plants produce enticing nectar bonuses known as extrafloral nectaries (EFNs).
The EFNs attract ants which defend the plant against leaf-eating insects in return for the sweet treats.
Some tropical tree species can die without the ants' protection.
Only a few spiders are known to take an interest in EFNs.
To find out more, Steven Handel and Scott Ruhren from the State University of New Jersey in New Brunswick studied the interactions between jumping spiders from the genera Eris and Metaphidippus, and a yellow-flowered legume (Chamaecrista nictitans) common to the eastern United States.
Greenhouse experiments showed the spiders jumped onto plants with active EFNs six times more often than they visited those without, and regularly ate the extra nectar.
The plants also benefited from the spiders' presence in the field, with seed production rising by 8 percent.
''This is the first evidence that spiders can increase plants' fitness in terms of seed production,'' says Handel.
''It's a completely unexpected link in nature''.
Most spiders sit and wait for their prey, says Handel, but jumping spiders move around and are aggressive _ just like the ants that protect trees.
Handel suspects the spiders play as vital a role as ants in protecting plants.
''Most people hate spiders.
Now there is finally one reason to like them,'' he says.

ROCKY MOUNT, N.C.
_ A growing trend among gardeners today is organic gardening.
Maybe you've thought about starting an organic garden, but it seemed too overwhelming.
It really isn't.
If you can grow a conventional garden, you can grow an organic one, said Dr.
Mary Peet, a professor in the department of horticultural sciences at N.C.
State University.
Organic gardeners don't use synthetic fertilizers or pesticides on plants.
When you garden organically, you think of your plants as part of a whole system within nature that starts in the soil and includes the water supply, wildlife and even insects.
Just like you would do if you were starting a conventional garden, look around your yard for an area that receives 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily.
Prepare the site by loosening the soil with a shovel.
Add several inches of compost to it.
Vegetables, fruits, herbs and flowers thrive best in raised beds, which are built 4 to 6 inches above the ground, Peet said.
Soil in raised beds drains quickly so plants never sit in water.
When selecting plants, choose ones that aren't prone to diseases.
Ask your neighborhood nursery and garden center for help in selecting plants.
``Most organic gardeners go through a trial-and-error period,'' said Jeffery Hedgepeth, manager at The Green Thumb Nursery in Rocky Mount.
``Gardeners usually have to experiment to find the best crops or plants that work best with their soil conditions.
We can only help point you in the right direction''.
Conventional gardeners control weeds with herbicides, but not organic gardeners.
They arm themselves with mulch.
Decaying plant wastes, such as grass clippings, leaves and vegetable scraps from the kitchen are great building blocks for compost, the ideal organic matter for your garden soil.
``Reuse and recycle,'' Peet said.
``Don't put waste in the trash when you can put it back in the ground.
Live with nature, not against it''.
A layer of mulch blocks light from weeds and stops or slows their growth.
If weeds make their way to the surface, Peet says, buy a good hoe and get to work.
Conventional gardeners apply pesticides to the garden to ward off threatening insects.
Organic gardeners don't use synthetic chemicals, but they can take other steps to protect their garden from pests.
Insects usually attack stressed or sick plants.
The best defenses against insect attack are preventative measures, Peet said.
Grow plants suited to the site and they'll be less stressed.
Don't let plants get too wet, too dry or too shaded.
Many plant diseases are encouraged by constant moisture and too little air circulating around plants, Peet said.
To remedy that, plan your garden with enough room to accommodate full-grown plants, because water evaporates more slowly and air doesn't circulate well among crowded plants.
Organic gardeners work constantly to build nutrient-rich soil.
Peet describes the ideal soil as dark-colored, sweet smelling and full of earthworms.
Gardeners can achieve ideal soil by continually adding organic matter, such as compost or manure, to their soil.
Interest in organically grown food is evident at grocery stores everywhere.
Consumers are reading labels and buying products that were raised without synthetic fertilizers or pesticides.

CHANGSHA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Spiders once were considered disgusting for their dangerous, ugly appearance.
However, for local paddy growers in the Dongting Lake area in central China, spiders have become their best friends for killing pests.
Some paddy land has been idle to set up safety for spiders.
"If the spiders can pass the winter safely, the pests will not be a threat to the crops," says a local farmer.
Chinese books written 2,000 years ago read, "All are happy when spiders are flourishing".
A spider eats five-to-six insect pests every day, a local expert says.
The lake area is the first in China to study pest control with spiders.
Many local villages have benefited ecologically.
"The area used to be plagued by pests," recalls Liu Hui, a local expert in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, "and chemicals had been used as the only weapon to fight them".
The amount of chemicals used was drastically reduced after spiders were introduced, which has resulted in better quality of farm products, according to the expert.
According to local officials, the natural technology has become popular in the area and is expected to be adopted by farmers in other parts of the country.
Nevertheless, local people want to gain something from their invention.
Xiangyin County plans to turn its vast spider-guarded farmlands into a new destination for tourists, and a school for outside farmers who are eager to learn the cost-effective natural technology.
BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has sold out of ladybugs and other varieties of pest-eating insects, as residents of the Chinese capital have opted for a cheap and environmentally- friendly means of pest control.
The city's supply of several million ladybugs had been housed by the Biological Prevention Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science for use in scientific experiments.
But they went on sale when the prevalence of plant pests in the city in the first four months of the year created public outcry, today's Beijing Daily reported.
During the same period, tens of thousands of insects kept by the Chinese Academy of Forestry Science also became hot items in short supply.
Increasingly, Beijing's parks and work units are battling pests with bugs.
The Temple of Heaven Park, Beijing's first park to use the pest-control insects, initiated the method in 1991.
The park has brought in a large quantity of insects to kill tree pests this year and the results have been good, according to park officials.
A researcher with the biological prevention institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science said his institute has bred over a dozen species of insects for pest control in the past decade.
He said the anti-pest insects can also be applied to crops, and for vegetable and fruit tree growth, and will help to improve the quality of farm produce.
Ladybugs are less expensive than pesticides, selling for a few cents apiece.
BUFFALO, N.Y.
(AP) -- The city plans to make a party out of hunting for grubs by hand as its phase-out of pesticide use begins in earnest.
Hundreds of volunteers will be enlisted for an August get-together, at which they will comb a municipal golf course for signs of the grass-destroying pests that have wreaked havoc in the past.
The goals are early detection and organic solutions.
Buffalo last year joined Albany, San Francisco and a handful of other municipalities that have committed to stopping virtually all pesticide use on city property.
Buffalo's Pesticide Sunset Ordinance took effect in September.
''This is brand new for us,'' said Gary Carrel of the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy, which is making plans for the first grub-scouting party at the Delaware Park golf course.
Rather than spray the entire course with dangerous chemicals, volunteers will target problem areas in an organized effort.
The hunters will line up five-to-10 feet apart and walk forward in tandem along the fairways, stopping at intervals to pull up small sections of ground and examine them for grubs before replacing them.
''These efforts are more environmentally friendly,'' but, he said, ''they also take a large volunteer force''.
So came the idea for the grub-scouting party.
The hope is there will be no sign of the pests, which staged a major infestation in 1995.
If they are detected, however, there are several non-chemical solutions being considered, including the use of parasitic nematodes which feed on the larvae but don't harm the ground.
Chemical spraying would be a last resort.
''It's just moving to a whole environmentally friendly way,'' Carrel said.
''Golf courses are traditionally very chemical dependent''.
Under the city's Pesticide Sunset Ordinance, the most dangerous chemicals will be eliminated first, followed by the less hazardous pesticides.
Exemptions will be allowed for nontoxic and low-level pesticides and city departments can get waivers in emergencies.
Delaware Park has become a sort of testing ground for environmentally friendly groundskeeping.
The park's rose garden is being tended with organic compound and soon will be watered with a drip-irrigation system, rather than sprinklers, which soak the whole plant and encourage fungus growth, and in turn, pesticide use.
City officials hope residents will follow suit and stop using harmful chemicals on their own lawns.
''Part of our mission is to increase public awareness,'' said Nancy Smith, co-chairwoman of the Pest Management Board, which was formed to help guide the city away from its chemical dependency.
''The exciting thing is, we're getting phone calls from around the country.
We're considered a leader in this.''
Adjectivally speaking, the most coveted garden flowers tend to be choice, delicate, exquisite or elegant, and preferably also fragrant.
Roses, in other words, or lilies or lilacs or masses of sky-blue flax on gracefully nodding stems, but definitely not marigolds.
Not many would describe the fat, heavy flower of a marigold, jammed so full of petals that it looks more like a Koosh ball than a blossom, as delicate or elegant.
Odoriferous comes to mind, but not fragrant.
Still, there are other attributes worth considering in a garden flower.
Colorful, easy, reliable and pest-free are not bad adjectives, and if the marigold is more often thought of as common than as choice, those qualities may explain why.
There is much good to say about a flower with a sunny disposition and a desire to please.
In August, when most perennials are in their summer sulk and the annual flower garden looks a bit ratty, marigolds can be counted on to look presentable.
The season is long, and fidelity in a flower is as praiseworthy as flamboyance.
They don't look any different than they did in late June _ mounds of roly-poly flowers in shades of orange, yellow and sort-of red _ but marigolds look good when their neighbors are starting to fade.
Indeed, it would be nice to be an iris in one's youth and a marigold in middle age.
It's true that a large bed of one variety of marigold can be a bit boring.
The plants are so uniform that a mass looks stiff and soldierly.
They look better planted in clumps among other annuals or in drifts in front of evergreens or shrubs.
But there are so many varieties of marigold that it would be fun to plant a marigold library, the way some botanical gardens plant libraries of daffodils and roses.
There could be tall African marigolds, rising to three feet or more, and sprightly dwarf French marigolds, some only six inches tall.
Giant-flowered hybrid marigolds, with their impossibly huge, puffy flowers, could contrast with signet marigolds and their dime-size blooms.
There could be quite an array of flower shapes, too.
Not all marigolds have the carnation form, which is the term used to describe those petal-jammed flowers.
There are many varieties of single-flowered marigolds, which have a single rim of petals and look like gaily colored daisies.
A particularly interesting one is Striped Marvel, which has a single tier of thin petals, red on one half and yellow on the other.
It makes a bushy two-foot plant, but most single-flowered marigolds are dwarf or semi-dwarf varieties that grow no more than a foot tall.
Disco is one of the best, and it comes in a mixture that includes a delightful array of yellow, orange and bicolored flowers.
Marigolds in the Sophia class fall somewhere between the single-flowered and carnation-flowered types _ they have a double rim of petals, russet-red or orange edged with gold.
The marigold color range is limited to oranges, yellows, near-reds and combinations of those colors, although breeders have come up with several varieties so pale yellow that they appear ivory or white.
White marigolds have less of the characteristic scent, making them nice for gardeners who don't grow marigolds because they object to the smell.
To my nose, the scent of marigolds is much nicer than that of some salvias, which smell like a used litter box, but olfactory preferences vary.
The scent is probably why marigolds, which make fine cut flowers, do not get used in floral arrangements more often.
Most of the smell, however, is concentrated in the foliage.
The flowers themselves are almost odorless.
If you strip off the foliage, the scent of marigolds won't permeate the house.
You can also grow marigolds that don't have the characteristic scent.
Signet marigolds (Tagetes tenuifolia), also called gem marigolds, have citrus-scented foliage that is lacier than standard marigold foliage and a lighter shade of green.
The blossoms are small and dainty, with a single rim of petals.
Mexican mint marigold (T.
lucida), also called Mexican tarragon marigold, has the scent of anise and can be used in cooking as a substitute for tarragon.
Some gardeners plant marigolds as a companion to vegetable crops, assuming the scent is a pest repellent.
It's true that some marigolds can help control certain species of destructive nematodes, tiny soil-dwelling worms, but it's a chemical in the marigold roots, not the odor of the foliage, that does the trick.
Only French marigolds (T.
patula) are effective in controlling nematodes.
African marigolds (T.
erecta) and other varieties, including hybrids, won't work.
You also won't see any benefits until the year after the marigolds are grown, because the chemical is released from the roots as they break down in the soil.
If nematodes are a problem in your garden, rotating the vegetable patch with a bed of French marigolds may help.
Simply planting marigolds among the tomatoes and peppers probably won't do much, although it will certainly look nice.
Marigolds like full sun and soil that is decent but not too rich.
To keep them blooming steadily, snap off the spent flower heads occasionally.
There are some sterile varieties, called triploids, that do not set seed and will keep blooming even if the dead flowers are not removed, but even those will look better if they're cleaned up periodically.
If marigolds can't be elegant or exquisite, they can at least be immaculate.

About 40,000 ha of farmland was planted in this mixing pattern in the prefectures of Honghe and Xishuangbanna in the province, said Li.
Yunnan plans to expand the acreage to 70,000 ha next year, and nine provincial areas in China, the country's major rice-producing areas, also plan to introduce the technique following satisfactory experiments of their own, said Li.
He said the Asian Development Bank, one of the sponsors of the program, plans to introduce the technique to countries such as Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
In their latest issues published on August 17 or August 18, the weekly science magazines Nature and Science each published a paper by Professor Zhu and his colleagues on the experiments.
Christopher Mundt, a plant pathologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis and a co-author of the paper, explained that different types of rice blast attack different varieties of rice.
In a monoculture field of rice, the blast can spread "like a fire through a field of dry grass".
The fungus has a harder time finding a compatible host in a mixed environment.
In his commentary on the experiments published by Nature, Martin Wolfe, a plant pathologist and research director of the Elm Farm Research Center, an organic farming research center in Britain, supports the approach.
Rice is the staple grain for about 3 billion people, mostly in Asia, or half of the world's population.

Q: Something is chewing small holes in the leaves of my vegetables.
I have looked closely to try to find an insect, and something appears to hop away when I move the leaves.
Any clue as to what this is?
A: Flea beetles are minuscule insects _ adults are about 1/16 inch long and black or greenish-black _ that appear in spring and leap among plants and chew numerous, small holes in leaves.
They hop like fleas, therefore their common name.
If there are enough of them, they can do considerable damage.
Leaves may wilt and turn brown, and the plant may die.
There are several species of flea beetles that damage vegetables and ornamentals.
Among those that visit here are the tobacco flea beetle, the potato flea beetle and the eggplant flea beetle, which prefer nightshade-family plants such as eggplant and tomatoes.
You may find flea beetles in your arugula, broccoli and corn, as well.
This pest is an accidental import, thought to have arrived in North America in the early 1900s, probably from Europe or Asia.
Adult flea beetles hibernate in the soil, then lay eggs in the soil or around the base of a plant.
In a week or so, larvae are feeding on plant roots before pupating and emerging as adults.
Seemingly overnight, flea beetles recently visited our garden, peppering the leaves of two fuchsias with so many small holes that they left mere outlines of the foliage.
If you are an organic gardener, you need quick hands to catch and squish these agile pests, as they bound away with the slightest hint of your approach.
They can slip underneath a leaf before you bat an eye.
Like other beetles, they are hard-bodied, and this, coupled with their acrobatic ability, makes it tough to easily nab them with a pesticide.
The pesticide needs to make good contact with the beetles, so you may be looking at more than one application.
Some of the chemicals commonly used around the garden target the pests.
So do products that contain neem, a botanical pesticide.
Rotenone and pyrethrum products can work, too.
In addition to eliminating as many of the enemy as possible with speedy fingers, the organic gardener has additional options: Use row covers to keep the pests off spring vegetables; repel them with garlic and hot pepper sprays; or capture them on white or yellow sticky traps.
Q: Could you give me some advice on the care of my bearded iris?
I have four different beds with different varieties and differing amounts of sunlight.
All bloom poorly.
What fertilizer should I use?
When and how often?
Do these irises require an acid or alkaline soil?
I water them regularly from early spring to late summer.
Then they get only rainwater until next spring.
When I separate them and give them to friends, these irises bloom quite well.
A: I am not sure which bearded iris you have, but I have found the easiest to be the large-flowered, fragrant ``early purples,'' believed to be a form of ``Iris x germanica,'' or German irises.
``Iris x albicans,'' the cemetery whites, are another group of more easily grown bearded iris.
I have learned from growing these that they prefer to be planted shallowly, demand good drainage and like sun.
And, as you've found, division encourages better flowering.
This is often necessary every three years.
A well-prepared, raised bed of soil enriched with compost or well-rotted manure is important, as well.
These irises tolerate a soil pH between 6 and 9, preferring a soil that is slightly alkaline.
I understand a low-nitrogen formula, such as a 6-10-6, is best, as too much nitrogen can lead to rhizome rot.
Apply such a fertilizer in the fall and after flowering.
An application of a superphosphate in late February, before flowering, can be beneficial.
I also have found these bearded irises to be surprisingly drought-tolerant once established.
Give them adequate moisture, but don't overdo it, especially if the soil is slow to drain.
Q: My magnolia is dropping leaves.
What's the problem?
A: Magnolias, although called ``evergreen,'' must drop old leaves to make room for new.
Those in our neighborhood are shedding like crazy.
By late winter, magnolia leaves, having been on the tree for a growing season, often look weary.
They may be scorched, and even have fungal spots.
Then, in late April and May, the tree drops these leaves.
If your tree is replacing these with fresh, healthy leaves, don't worry.
Magnolias may also drop leaves at other times during the year.
Keep trees watered well.
The roots are especially shallow, and long, hot summers are tough.
A layer of organic mulch beneath the canopy is a good idea as it helps preserve soil moisture and keeps soil temperature down.
It also boosts the soil when it breaks down.

&QL; &QL; XXXX END OF STORY &QL;
&QL; &UR; SALINAS, Calif.
_ &LR; Tom Jones is a hands-on farmer, not some touchy-feely type with sentimental ideas about Mother Nature and her eternal wisdom.
Yet Jones listens to his strawberry plants which, he asserts, change every day.
You get in trouble when you interfere with their natural cycle and try to make the plants do what &LR; you &LR; want, he says.
At the same time, the co-owner of Windward Farming Co.
in Salinas explains that he loves strawberry growing because it is not a totally mechanized process but one that allows for much creativity.
In his case, that creativity includes an increasing emphasis on organic farming.
Fresno native Jones, 37, came up through the farming ranks.
At 16, he was picking melons in Arizona.
After that he worked as a trucker and an irrigator, among other jobs, eventually ending up in the Salinas Valley strawberry fields in 1982.
``I got hooked on strawberries,'' he says with a laugh.
He is also hooked on the valley with its ideal growing conditions created by rich soil and a relatively cool, moderate climate.
Several years ago, he and two partners converted eight of their approximately 125 acres of strawberries to organic, and the results were everything they could have hoped for.
The berries taste and look great, and there is increasing demand for them.
Windward had been moving toward less reliance on chemicals for at least 10 years, reducing pesticide use by as much as 80 percent, Jones says: ``Then we started thinking, if we can control pests organically, why not go all the way?
(Using fish emulsion and other non-chemical fertilizers)''.
Windward Farming now has 22 acres of organic berries and more acreage in transition.
It takes three years to convert from conventional to certified organic status, and therein lies a problem.
Jones and partners, like many small- to medium-size agricultural enterprises in the area, lease their land, typically on a two-year basis.
To go through the conversion process and make it worthwhile, ``we really need six- to eight-years leases,'' he asserts.
At the same time, he understands why such leases aren't offered.
The land, for the most part, is not owned by large companies but by families with long ties to the area.
The land is so valuable that they just cannot tie it up in long-term leases, he admits.
At the same time, that value is a certain guarantee against encroaching development.
``Last time farmland was for sale here,'' Jones reports somewhat incredulously, ``it went for $30,000 an acre''.
Jones' advocacy of organic methods is both philosophical and practical.
So-called trap crops _ flowers, alfalfa _ planted alongside cash crops attract beneficial insects and simultaneously take care of such nasty critters as the lygus bug, a small insect that winters in the hills and comes down to the valley in spring.
The lygus injects a poisonous substance into the seeds on the skin of strawberries, causing the seeds to die and making for misshapen berries.
However, given a flavor choice of strawberry or alfalfa, the lygus will go for alfalfa every time, leaving the berries unmolested and proving that organic methods not only make good sense on ecological grounds but are also cost-effective, Jones says.
What's more, organically grown berries always win in taste tests, report employees of Driscoll Strawberry Associates, the large shipper that contracts with Jones and many other growers.
(Jones also gets his patented plants from Driscoll's nurseries).
While organic growing methods are still in their infancy nationwide and account for a relatively small percentage of fruit grown in the Salinas Valley, the idea is catching on.
For growers like Jones, the popularity of organic produce means higher prices, which in turn means that field workers receive a better wage _ typically $9.80 an hour rather than the $9.35 working in conventionally cultivated fields _ guaranteeing their commitment to these environment-friendly methods.
``Our people (workers) are the real key to our success,'' says Jones, adding proudly that his company experiences a 95 percent return rate among the roughly 150 workers employed during the May-November harvest season.
During that time, 16-hour work days are common.
Jones admits ruefully that at times he's so bushed that he forgets to bring home berries for his wife and three children for days on end.
``But my wife (Ruth Anne) knows how to improve my memory,'' he admits.
Sometimes when Farmer Jones looks in his refrigerator, he finds a couple of store-bought baskets _ grown by one of his competitors.
&QL; &QL; &QL; &QL; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; &QL; &UR; TAKE A FEW SERVING TIPS FROM THE GROWER &QL; &LR; &QL; Asked his favorite way to eat strawberries, Tom Jones, who grows strawberries both by conventional and organic methods in the Salinas Valley, has a quick answer: ``Right in the field''.
The Jones family _ Tom, his wife, Ruth Anne, and their three youngsters _ never tire of taking an evening stroll and nibbling fruit still warm from the day's sun.
Twelve-year-old ``Angie is the best picker,'' her father reports.
The Jones family makes jam and Ruth Anne sometimes fixes a very adult treat: She injects berries with liqueur, then dips them in melted chocolate.
They also sweeten sliced berries to taste with brown sugar and add a few drops of balsamic vinegar.
After they macerate 10 minutes or so, spoon them over slices of pound cake dolloped with lightly sweetened whipped cream.
&LR; &QL; &LR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; &QL; &LR; &QL; &LR; &QL; &UR; GEORGEANNE'S KITCHEN: Lip-Smacking Ideas for Fresh Strawberries &LR; &UR; &QL; &LR; &UR; &QL; &LR; &UR; By Georgeanne Brennan &QL; &LR; &UR; c.
1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL; &LR; &UR; &QL; &LR; &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR; Here are some ways to use the best of the local crop of fresh strawberries now in our markets.
&LR; &QL; &UR; Strawberry and Rhubarb Puff Pastry Tart.
&LR; Thaw frozen puff pastry.
Slice about 6 rhubarb stalks into 1/2-inch-thick slices and cook them in enough water to cover, along with some brown sugar, a little lemon juice and a split vanilla bean, until they are soft but still hold their shape.
Drain and chill, reserving the juice.
When chilled, mix the rhubarb with 2 cups strawberries (halved if large, whole if small).
Add about 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 cup brown sugar; mix well.
Roll out the pastry and put it on a baking sheet.
Heap the fruit mixture in the center; then fold pastry up around the fruit, leaving an open space about 4 inches in diameter.
Dot this with butter and bake in a 375 oven about 30 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed and golden.
While the tart is cooking, reduce the reserved juices to just a few tablespoons.
To serve, dust the tart with powdered sugar, cut into wedges and drizzle with the reserved juice.
&LR; &QL; &UR; Fresh Strawberry Ice Cream.
&LR; Wash and hull 2 pints of strawberries; then mash them together with 1/2 cup sugar and let them stand for an hour.
Combine 2 cups heavy whipping cream and 2 cups milk in a saucepan; add 3/4 cup sugar and a split vanilla bean.
Cook and stir over medium heat until the sugar dissolves but the mixture is not boiling.
Whisk together 4 to 5 egg yolks in a bowl; then whisk in about 1 cup of the hot milk mixture.
Slowly pour this into the saucepan.
Continue to whisk until the mixture thickens, about 5 minutes.
Do not boil.
Remove the vanilla bean and stir in the mashed strawberries.
Freeze in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions.
&LR; &QL; &UR; Strawberry-Chocolate Shortcake &LR;. Hull and thinly slice strawberries.
Stir in a little sugar, and refrigerate at least an hour and up to 8.
Make a favorite shortcake recipe.
Cut the warm shortcakes in half.
Top each half with strawberries.
Melt semisweet chocolate in the top of a double boiler over warm (not boiling) water.
Drizzle chocolate over the shortcakes; then top with dollops of lightly sweetened whipped cream.
&LR; &QL; &UR; Strawberry Trifle.
&LR; In a trifle or other footed glass bowl, make a solid layer of 1/2-inch-thick slices of pound cake or ladyfingers.
Drizzle with a little kirsch.
Top with a 1/2-inch-thick layer of softened strawberry ice cream, then add a scattering of sliced strawberries.
Repeat the layers twice more.
Cover the top with whipped cream; then decorate with clusters of sliced strawberries and a dusting of toasted almonds.
&LR; &QL; &UR; Strawberries in Red Wine with Rosemary.
&LR; Hull strawberries, leaving small ones whole and cutting larger ones in half.
Cover with a light red wine, such as a Beaujolais, and add a little sugar and about 1/4 teaspoon minced rosemary.
Cover and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours or overnight.
Spoon into bowls, adding some of the juices, and serve with cookies for dipping.

Viburnums Under Attack Q.
In my Western New York garden I used native viburnums, partly because they are supposed to be more pest resistant.
Now, I find that my arrowwood and cranberry bush viburnums are being attacked by something.
The leaves look more like lace tatting, and underneath some of them I am finding small larvae.
If native shrubs are supposed to be more pest resistant, why are they being attacked?
Is there something I can do about it?
A. Native shrubs and trees are normally better adapted to the resident pests as well as to the climate, but the viburnum leaf beetle (Pyrrhalta viburni) is a stranger who has come to dinner.
Originally European, the beetle was first discovered in Ontario in 1947, and has now migrated to 27 Western and Central counties of New York, as well as Maine.
The larvae skeletonize leaves in May and June, starting from the bottom of the plant and working their way up, and the adults finish up any leftovers from July to October.
Eggs are laid in slits on the underside of the tips of young branches in nice, straight lines that appear as dark brown bumps.
And that's the key to their control.
Prune and remove any branch tips that have eggs laid in them, any time from mid-October, when the adults finish depositing them, to early May, when the larvae hatch.
Left untreated, heavy infestations can kill vulnerable viburnums in two or three years through repeated defoliation.
Plants too large to prune can be treated chemically.
Call your local county cooperative extension for the name of a control product labeled for use against the viburnum leaf beetle.
Most vulnerable to the beetle are arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum), European cranberry bush (V.
opulus), American cranberry bush (V.
trilobum) and, to a lesser degree, Sargent viburnum (V.
sargentii), and their cultivars.
Hybrids and cultivars of Viburnum x burkwoodii, V.
carlesii, V.
x juddii and V.
rhytidophyllum resist the beetle.
Raking vs.
Mulching Q.
We've been using a mulching lawn mower regularly for several years now.
When leaves start to drop in fall, we mulch and leave them in place as well.
We cut once or twice a week.
Our lawn is one of the better looking and healthier ones in the neighborhood.
However, we can't convince any of our neighbors that they should stop picking up grass clippings and spending hours removing leaves in the fall.
Why do the majority of homeowners insist on the removal of grass clippings and leaves from their lawns?
That is, are there big risks associated with mulching?
A. Don't brag about your lawn; it just sets the neighbors to dumping more fertilizer on theirs.
Just mention that according to studies done at Michigan State University, the nutritive value of mulching and leaving grass clippings saves 20 to 25 percent of the fertilizer one would ordinarily use.
And then talk about how improved your golf game is since you have been spending more time with a club and less with a rake.
And if they start talking about thatch buildup, inform them that a three-year Cornell University experiment found no difference in thatch thickness or quality of turf between areas where 6 inches of fallen leaves, both oak and maple, were shredded by a mulching mower and left on the grass, and areas where the leaves were raked off.
Thatch is the dead, dying and decaying organic matter, mostly old turf stems, that accumulates in a layer just above the soil.
But weekends can't be all golf.
You either have to rake or run the leaves over with a mulching mower.
You can't just leave them there because they'll block the light and eventually kill the grass, along with your neighborhood reputation.

VALLEY VILLAGE, Calif.
-- Shaken like salt from their paper cartons, ladybugs tumbled into the trees Tuesday above suburban Valley Village Park in the San Fernando Valley to do battle with a menacing pest.
Workers with the Los Angeles parks department carefully dropped 2 million ladybugs into the park's eucalyptus trees in hope the red-shelled beetles will eat strange Australian plant lice attacking the trees.
Park officials and entomologists don't know whether the plan will work.
The invading red gum lerp psyllid, which drains the juice from eucalyptus trees, is a newcomer to America, and experts don't yet know the best way to fight it.
But Kevin Regan, chief arborist for the parks department, said the ladybugs are worth a try.
They already have been seen eating psyllids in the park, and Regan would rather give them a shot at beating back the infestation than immediately resort to pesticides.
``If this doesn't work, we've lost nothing,'' said Regan, as helmeted workers atop cherry pickers shook $1,700 worth of ladybugs into the trees.
``We got to try using some kind of biological control first''.
If they gobble up the invaders, Regan will start dropping ladybugs into more city recreation areas, probably starting with heavily infested Griffith Park.
``Really, just about everywhere you go, you'll find them,'' he said.
The tiny psyllid first appeared in America last year and already has spread through much of California.
Los Angeles County agriculture officials spotted three infested trees just across Interstate 10 from their El Monte office in June.
The pest showed up in the Bay Area at virtually the same time and has now hit the San Gabriel Valley and Orange County, said Rosser Garrison, an entomologist for the Los Angeles County agricultural agency.
The city's worst infestation is in a stand of 70-year-old eucalyptus surrounding a picnic area in Valley Village Park.
Young psyllids have covered the trees' sickle-shape leaves with sticky white cones, called lerps, that protect the insects as they grow.
While entomologists say the psyllids by themselves probably can't kill the trees, they can put them under stress so they are more susceptible to attack by other insects.
The thought of losing Valley Village Park's eucalyptus trees worries those who live nearby.
In late afternoons, the park is filled with couples playing with their children and residents walking their dogs.
``It's a lovely park, and people come here for the shade,'' said Paul Goolnick, who has lived in the neighborhood 10 years.
``If the trees died, that would ruin the place''.
The question is whether the ladybugs, which usually feast on aphids, will eat enough of the psyllids to make a difference.
``They're nice to have, and they may eat some of the psyllids, but I don't think you'll see a serious drop in the population,'' said Garrison.
He said further studies must be done to find out what insects attack the psyllids in their Australian home.
Steve Hazzard, president of the company that supplied the ladybugs released Tuesday, said a gardening Web site lists the specific breed of ladybugs he used as a predator of the invading psyllids.
Since ladybugs tend to fly during daylight, workers waited until late afternoon to begin placing them in the trees.
Shipped in cartons that look like pint-size ice cream containers, the red bugs had been stored in a refrigerator to simulate winter hibernation and, Hazzard hoped, make them emerge ravenous.
``They've gone from November until now without anything to eat, so now is the time,'' said Hazzard, of Organic Control, Inc.
Parks officials will monitor the bug war for the next 30 to 40 days, Regan said.
If the psyllids persist, the department might use a low-level pesticide that can be injected directly into the trees without leaving a residue.

LONDON _ Exchanging their confines for a temporary stay in the open country air, seven prisoners from Her Majesty's Prison Leyhill in the Cotswolds won their second gold medal last week at the Hampton Court Palace Flower Show, the Royal Horticultural Society's summer extravaganza.
Their show garden, ``Take a Walk on the Wild Side,'' included a woodland garden of wildflowers and grasses under linden and beech trees, with a stream flowing under a stone bridge.
``It is one thing to make a garden, and another to mimic nature,'' Adrian Foulkes, a prisoner, said of the difficulty of forcing bluebells and wild garlic into bloom.
Foulkes, who is 39 and is nearing parole on a life sentence for murder, heads the prison's garden committee this year.
The flower show, which ended last weekend, is an annual event on the grounds of Hampton Court Palace, in the London borough of Richmond-Upon-Thames, on the Thames River.
The show, which attracts horticultural groups and garden designers, uses displays that are designed so that visitors can walk through them.
The prisoners' exhibit, situated on the banks of a long canal with spouting fountains, seemed like a real woodland in which one could rest on a willow seat under linden trees.
The Hampton Court prize also honored the prisoners' vegetable garden display: a kitchen garden (carrots, onions, parsnips and runner beans) enclosed by cordoned apple and pear trees and a rusty fence overgrown with blackberry bushes from the prison's grounds.
The kitchen and woodland gardens were designed by Gareth Goundrill _ not a prisoner, but the 18-year-old son of Jeff Goundrill, who oversees business enterprises at Leyhill.
The younger Goundrill made the designs as his final exam for a high school technology course, and the prisoners dug the grounds and planted the flowers, vegetables and trees with the help of the prison farm foreman, Martin Brookes.
Leyhill, a minimum-security institution, has been participating in Royal Horticultural Society flower shows at Hampton Court Palace and Chelsea since 1991.
``It is a real pleasure to work with the Leyhill team,'' said Stephen Bennett, the director of the shows.
``They have become good friends; they provide much pleasure to the gardening public, and their skillful use of plants _ all grown at the prison _ makes a valuable contribution to horticulture and the community''.
Leyhill is in the town of Wotton-Under-Edge in the Cotswolds, one of England's best-known garden belts, about 100 miles west of London.
The institution, on about 250 acres, with three acres under glass, is surrounded by crumbling stone walls.
``In order to work as a gardener,'' said Tom Williams, the prison's warden, ``a prisoner needs no horticultural experience.
But he must be quick to learn, work hard and have a sense of humor under pressure''.
Leyhill's grounds include an arboretum with more than 1,000 specimen trees and a stately home, Tortworth Court, a 60-room mansion that was built in 1853 and is the former seat of the Earls of Ducie.
Henry John, the third earl, created the arboretum from 1853 to 1921.
The arboretum has been managed by Leyhill since the prison acquired it in the 1940s.
Leyhill also maintains pasture land for raising rare Gloucester cattle and runs a museum of old farm machinery in the prison's Tortworth Visitors' Center, which also includes a farm stand.
The arboretum is open to the public on weekends and bank holidays from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
The visitors' center is open the same hours daily.
Information: 011-44-1454-260-681.
The prison's gardens have become a serious moneymaking enterprise over the last five years.
This year, Leyhill has supplied a million carpet-bedding plants to nearby towns, and it distributes organically grown vegetables to 27 other prisons.
``If a prison serves a bad meal, it sours the whole atmosphere,'' said Colin Lennox, the farm manager.
And the prison takes the word ``organic'' seriously.
Pests are controlled by their natural predators instead of by sprays and pesticides.
A computer monitors the prison's nine greenhouses along with irrigation and fertilization.
There's an additional enterprise for the Leyhill gardens: They provide organic salads and sandwich fillings for British Airways Concorde flights originating at Heathrow Airport.
For all the efficiency of the prison's garden operation, there is one drawback: As Jeff Goundrill said, ``The best gardeners are always being released.''
One of the best things to happen to salads in decades is that zippy Italian green called arugula.
It's literally a weed in Italy, and it would grow just as easily in anybody's garden if not for one tiny problem: the flea beetle.
Flea beetles are minuscule black insects that appear early in the spring and spend the rest of the season leaping among the plants, chewing holes in leaves.
They hop like fleas, hence the common name.
If there are enough of them, they can nibble seedlings to the ground.
Actually, there are several species of flea beetles.
Some prefer nightshade family plants like eggplant and tomatoes, and some prefer cabbage family plants like broccoli and arugula.
In my garden, the cabbage-eaters are more numerous, and they adore arugula.
If I sow arugula seeds in early spring, to take advantage of the cool weather they like, I have to swathe the spot in one of those diaphanous row covers immediately, before the seeds germinate.
If I don't, the flea beetles will chomp the seedlings into oblivion the moment the first leaves peek above the surface.
Even so, the flea beetles know the arugula is there.
They alight on the protective cover, patiently waiting for me to lift it to snag a bunch of arugula, so they can sneak in and start munching.
I imagine saliva dripping from their little jaws.
It is no comfort to know that this pest is an accidental import, like the European corn borer, the Japanese beetle and the gypsy moth.
Flea beetles are thought to have arrived in North America in the early 1900s, probably from Europe or Asia.
They got off the boat in British Columbia and made their way steadily eastward.
The North American countryside is rich in cabbage family weeds like yellow rocket and winter cress, and the flea beetles flourished.
The tiny terrorists arrived in the Northeast in the 1950s and have spent the last half-century establishing themselves as garden pests, as if anyone needed more of those.
Several mild winters in a row have made the problem even worse by allowing more flea beetles to survive.
What's a gardener to do?
At a conference in New Haven this winter, research scientists and organic farmers pondered the perplexing problem of Phyllotreta cruciferae, the cabbage-crunching flea beetle, as well as its nightshade-noshing cousins.
Not much research has been done on the agile insects, because they are not a big problem for conventional vegetable growers.
(Pesticides applied to kill other insects tend to keep flea beetles in check).
For organic growers and most backyard gardeners, though, they are tough to control.
Like other beetles, they are hard-bodied.
They also bound away at the slightest disturbance.
Those characteristics put them out of reach of most botanical pesticides and even the chemicals commonly available for home use, because the pesticide has to touch the insects to kill them.
Aside from keeping the beetles' favorite foods under cover, farmers reported trying _ with limited success _ to repel them with garlic and hot pepper sprays, planting cabbage family crops among aromatic herbs and vacuuming the insects off their crops with leaf blowers adapted to work in reverse.
Some tried to snare the flea beetles on sticky traps: pieces of white or yellow poster board taped to bamboo sticks and coated with a gooey product called Tangle-Trap.
Flea beetles are attracted to white and yellow, and they paste themselves to the traps in numbers.
Kimberly Stoner, an entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, tried baiting sticky traps with mustard oil, the substance that cabbage-loving flea beetles home in on when they're looking for their favorite snack plants.
The baited traps worked, perhaps too well.
``I suspect that they attract many more beetles than they trap,'' she said.
Those tempted to try this at home should be warned that concentrated mustard oil can make eyes water and burn skin.
Repellent sprays, traps and covers are usually enough to keep flea beetles from doing fatal damage to crops like broccoli, turnips and rutabagas, but nothing can keep them from making unattractive holes in leafy greens like arugula and mizuna, a mild Japanese mustard that's also splendid in salads.
For now, there is only one solution to the flea beetle problem: grow the most vulnerable crops in the fall.
Flea beetles run roughshod over the garden until autumn, when they stop reproducing and start looking for a cozy place to spend the winter _ in the soil, fallen leaves or a grassy spot.
From September until hard freeze, the arugula is pristine.
What do Italians do about flea beetles in the arugula?
Nothing. The beetles aren't considered a big problem in Europe, suggesting that they made it to North America unaccompanied by the natural predators that keep them in check in their native lands.
A European study found that up to 90 percent of wintering flea beetles of the arugula-munching variety had been killed by beneficial nematodes, tiny soil-dwelling worms.
BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Vegetables produced in suburban Beijing have higher hygienic standards than before, thanks to the use of biological preparation in pest control.
A survey by Beijing Municipal Agricultural Bureau on nine varieties of vegetables, including tomatoes, cucumbers and cabbage, shows that no organic chlorine or phosphorus are found on their leaves, and the residue of mercury, cadmium and other heavy metals all are lower than the state-set standard.
To protect the environment, Beijing forbid the use of organic chlorine and other organic chemical elements in pest control in the 1980s.
Farmers were encouraged to use biological preparation instead of pesticide to prevent vegetable and plant diseases.
Trichogrammas have been widely used to prevent corn borers in suburban Beijing since the early 1970s.
The city also set up factories to breed trichogrammas in the counties of Miyun and Shunyi.
Trichogrammas have also been used to kill bollworms, defoliators and other plant pests.
To protect drinking water quality in this Chinese capital, industrial plants for producing biological preparation have been established in Miyun, Tongxian and Changping counties in suburban Beijing.
At present, biological preparation has been used for the prevention and cure of more than 30 kinds of vegetable and plant pests and diseases.
The pest control is carried out on an area of over 33,000 hectares annually, and saves 15 tons of chemical pesticide.
Bugs. A lot of people see them and respond with the bottom of their shoe.
John Howard Garrett, a local gardening expert on all things organic, sees them as a positive byproduct of a chemical-free way of life.
In Garrett's eyes, very few bugs are bad, most are beneficial, and several, wasps for example, are downright gorgeous.
Garrett, who tends to vault onto his soapbox at every chance, teamed with Malcolm Beck, a like-minded soul, to write the definitive work on regional insects, the ``Texas Bug Book'' (University of Texas Press, $24.95, soft cover).
The book is a hit.
Bugs, it seems, are much more attractive than ``Plants of the Metroplex,'' another Garrett tome.
``This book is outselling my others,'' he says.
``It appeals to groups I never even considered.
Children are fascinated by it''.
While the subject may be off-putting to some, those who open the cover are almost immediately captivated.
Most folks haven't spent much time looking at bugs since their roller-skating, scabby-knee days.
This book takes readers back to the time when a stick and a bug meant hours of summertime entertainment.
The authors beguile their readers with homey stories about their bug observations, satisfy the scholarly with all the scientific names and descriptions, and tempt the bookstore browser with a multitude of photographs.
A useful appendix lists beneficial insects, the reason they make the good-guy list and their preferred habitat.
Garrett includes his basic organic program and some of his most-requested organic recipes.
The road to publication was rough for Beck and Garrett.
The way was littered with the objections of several doctorate-wielding entomologists who kept the presses from running for three years.
``The general philosophy of the book is: If you have healthy soil, plants can resist diseases and insects as well.
Some entomologists don't believe plants have an immune system.
We do,'' Garrett says.
Writing the book changed some of Garrett's notions about what were acceptable gardening methods.
``I have completely changed my recommendations on pesticides,'' he says.
``I don't like the organic pesticides any more than the chemical ones.
They kill beneficials.
So Malcolm and I have switched over to biological things or use repellents.
Garlic, for example, is a systemic, it's a cleansing kind of thing, and it works as a repellent, too.
``It becomes more and more apparent, if you understand how it works, that we need all these bugs.
Nature is in balance.
We are the ones who have created the imbalance''.
He concludes: ``We have to stimulate life, we've got to stop killing and we have to stop trying to dominate the systems.
By eliminating the chemical pesticides and fertilizers, we'll see better results and more bugs.
But that's a good sign''.

&UR; &QL; &LR; &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR; In this time of eye-popping technology where kitchen appliances talk to you and the electronic map in your car chides you for being such a navigational nerd, it is almost refreshing to hear an unbelievably low-tech way of grape farming.
Almost, because the principles of biodynamics, a sort of ``beyond organics'' implies some far-out ideas and practices that modern folks have long since dismissed as archaic and backward.
Farming by the movement of the planets and the moon, burying a steer horn packed with manure in the vineyard and spraying vines with crystals, may sound like weird science but it swayed Jim Fetzer.
He's selling his 100 percent biodynamically-grown grapes to Fox Creek Winery for the first commercial biodynamic wines.
Fetzer, a member of the Mendocino Fetzer wine family, was once a traditional California wine-grape grower leaning toward organics.
He now owns Ceago Vinegarden vineyard in Mendocino County, a certified biodynamic vineyard.
Fetzer looked at the evidence of farming the biodynamic way and how the program replenishes the earth, and was impressed.
He found soils that had become sterile from too many chemicals could be brought back to health and produce high quality grapes.
``You can smell the difference in the soil,'' Fetzer says.
``Pick up a handful of dirt from any vineyard and it doesn't have a smell.
The soil in my biodynamic vineyard is aromatic and rich, with hints of anise and natural elements''.
Although biodynamics is a complex system based on theories developed in the 1920s by Austrian scientist and philosopher Rudolf Steiner, many of the practical applications are simple.
Biodynamics does not use chemically synthesized fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, fumigants, hormones, antibiotics or growth regulators.
Crop fertility is centered around compost manures, green ground covers and crop rotation.
Weeds and pests are controlled by a balanced farm ecosystem.
Fox Brook Winery is owned by Rutherford Benchmarks Group and housed in the old Fetzer winery in Redwood Valley, Mendocino.
Winemaker Greg Graziano has taken the biodynamically-grown grapes from Ceago Vinegarden and produced two exciting wines.
While organic wines in general have met with less than enthusiastic reviews and sales, these biodynamic wines may turn things around.
Fox Brook 1998 Ceago Vinegarden Mendocino Chardonnay ($29) is a lovely wine with floral and green apple aromas, crisp acidity, citrus accents and subtle oak notes.
Some of the 1997 Fox Brook Chardonnay may still be in the market; the wine benefits from the extra year in bottle and is more complex with mineral notes.
Fox Brook 1997 Ceago Vinegarden Mendocino Merlot ($39) is a concentrated rich wine with deep black cherry and spice flavors, excellent balance and a long finish.
The wine is bright and packed with flavor and balanced with nicely integrated tannins.
If you've been avoiding Merlot because it lacks personality, try this one.
&LR; sh &LR; Green Business Organic grape growing and biodynamics represent a strong commitment to pro-environment farming, but protecting the environment goes beyond farming.
Recently, the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors awarded Green Business Certificates to Davis Bynum, Benziger, Asti, Chateau Souverain, Kendall Jackson-Vinwood Cellars and Trentadue for ecologically friendly business practices.
&QL; BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; &QL; &UR; A Corking Good Year &LR; One of the myths that seems to circulate around the wine industry every year or two is a shortage of high quality natural cork for wine stoppers.
Jochen Michalski, president of Cork Supply USA, says not to worry.
``Winemakers can look forward to a stable supply of high quality corks as a result of another good year for the cork harvest,'' he says.
The 1999 harvest from Portugal and Spain, the two main cork suppliers, is slightly lower than last year's but both countries have had outstanding cork harvests the three previous years.
The string of good cork harvests also means that prices for wine corks should not increase.
Although the cork is a small part of the overall cost of a bottle of wine, anything that helps to keep the cost down is good news.
&UR; Riesling Reprieve &LR; For years, a growing number of wine writers and concerned wine drinkers have come out against the use of foreign names and terms, like Champagne and Chablis, on U.S. wines, and most have been eliminated.
One, however _ Johannisberg Riesling _ seems to have more lives than Morris the cat.
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has issued a ruling allowing the use of the term ``Johannisberg Riesling'' on American wine labels for seven more years.
Johannisberg is a German place-name and, like Champagne, doesn't belong on American wines.
What's wrong with just plain old ``Riesling?''
SANTA ROSA, Calif.
_ In the quest for great grapes, some growers along the northern California coast, including the wine industry leaders Michael Topolos and Michael Benziger, are embracing age-old peasant farming methods and performing rituals such as burying cow horns and spreading crystals in their vineyards.
``I did this on a leap of faith.
I don't even pretend to understand all this stuff, but I'm committed because I've seen the results in my vineyards,'' said Topolos, co-owner of Topolos at Russian River Vineyards near Forestville.
He said yields have increased and grape quality has improved.
Topolos and Benziger, both practical businessmen prominent in the wine industry, are among the practitioners of biodynamic agriculture, a system of raising crops that uses methods as old as farming itself along with some New Age spirituality.
Simply stated, biodynamics is an organic farming system that doesn't employ pesticides, herbicides or synthetic fertilizers.
Instead, it relies on manure, crop rotations, biological pest control and cosmic forces to put life back into soils and the ecology surrounding the vineyard.
It works with nature and involves astronomy and homeopathy.
``If nothing else, biodynamic farming is helping to clean up the chemical disaster caused by pesticides and fertilizers that came with the industrialization of agriculture following World War II,'' Topolos said.
``We can't continue to poison our way through''.
Some scientists dismiss biodynamic farming as junk science and question its impact on grape quality.
``This kind of thing is used more as a marketing tool to sell wine,'' said Dr.
Roland Meyer, a soil science specialist with the University of California, Davis.
``Chances are biodynamic farming would have little or no effect on the flavor of the grape or the quality of wine''.
Biodynamics is so mystical and far-fetched, he said, that it's not even considered for further research at UC Davis.
It's estimated that biodynamic farming methods are used on 1,000 of the 100,000 acres of vineyards on the northern California coast.
The percentage is small but with names like Topolos, Benziger and Fetzer involved, this kind of farming is considered more than a fringe movement.
``The North Coast is the hot spot for biodynamic farming in California,'' said Chuck Beedy, executive director of the San Francisco-based Biodynamic Farming and Gardening Association.
The approach also is gaining momentum in France, he said, where dozens of wine estates have adopted biodynamic farming methods.
Thirty vineyards, orchards and vegetable farms are certified biodynamic in Northern California, Beedy said.
Nationwide, he said, 50 growers have earned biodynamic certification.
Biodynamic farming was developed in the 1920s by Austrian-born philosopher and spiritual leader Rudolph Steiner, who came up with a system of composting and special preparations that remains the foundation of the biodynamic farming movement.
Benziger, president of Benziger Family Winery in Glen Ellen, said he was drawn to biodynamics because of the promise that wine grapes will attain superior flavors _ flavors that reflect the vineyard site, a term the French call terroir.
Pesticides and herbicides kill natural organisms that give grapes an originality specific to the site, he said, an individuality that cannot be copied anywhere else in the world.
Before adopting biodynamics two years ago, Benziger had weaned his vineyards from toxic chemicals.
``The goal is to produce a wine that is one of a kind, a wine that has sense of place and a uniqueness that cannot be duplicated,'' Benziger said.
Other winemakers believe great wines can be made without using biodynamic principles.
``Biodynamics may be good for the soil and environment, but is it going to make a better wine''? asked Mike Gulyash, winegrower at Glen Ellen's B.R.
Cohn Winery, which has won accolades and awards for its ultra-premium wines.
``Biodynamics is not a bare-bones requirement to make a great wine''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS).
Biodynamics remains very much an alternative approach to grape growing because it rejects so much of what mainstream viticulture encourages _ chemical pesticides, synthetic fertilizers and routine disking, which disrupts the ecosystem on the vineyard floor.
``Biodynamics is giving up control over the vines.
The hardest thing with biodynamic farming is not jumping on the tractor and spraying when you see a problem,'' Benziger said.
What raises eyebrows among scientists and conventional growers is biodynamics' strange practices, such as applying herbal potions by the phases of the moon, spraying microscopic crystals and burying cow dung in a female cow horn.
Greg Willis, the biodynamics consultant at Topolos vineyards, said the buried horns, crystals and moon calendar that are part and parcel of biodynamic farming make the approach difficult for some growers to embrace.
He suggests that farmers get out of their boxes and try something new.
``We can argue all day about putting a horn in the ground, but we know it works,'' said Willis, owner of a Napa-based consulting business called Agri-Synthesis.
Interest in biodynamics is growing, Beedy said.
``We are hearing from people that organic farming didn't answer all the questions they had.
They had questions about the unseen quality of life and how to work with the forces of nature,'' he said.
Alan York, a biodynamics expert, manages the vineyards at Jim Fetzer's Ceago Vinegarden.
He is also advising the Benziger Family Winery as it makes the transition to biodynamics.
Topolos, who before adopting biodynamic farming principles three years ago had farmed his vineyards organically for the 10 years, said biodynamics heals the negative effects of farm chemicals by helping the soil to regenerate its original energy so the vines can fend off insects and diseases.
Believing in the tenets of biodynamics and natural forces _ ``some that we understand and some that we don't'' _ is key to its success, he said.
The most mystical preparation is made by packing a cow horn with manure and then burying it a foot deep during the fall solstice.
It's dug up in the spring.
The manure ferments into a sweet-smelling humus-like material _ Topolos calls it black magic _ that is mixed in water and sprayed onto the land.
Topolos agrees that biodynamics requires growers to forget almost everything they have learned and to adopt a new way of thinking.
As both an organic and biodynamic farmer, Topolos said there is some overlap between the two, but that there are real differences.
He said organic farming is more passive.
``Organic farming is not doing things,'' Topolos said.
``Biodynamics is quite the opposite.
Not only do we do things, we have to do them on a schedule based on a lunar calendar''.

BOSTON (AP) -- Who knew sex could be such a powerful weapon against hungry cranberry-eating pests?
A new pest-fighting weapon interferes with the moths' mating rituals, resulting in fewer of the dreaded Sparganothis fruitworm.
``Moths are going to have to take lots of cold showers,'' said Jeffrey LaFleur, executive director of the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association.
With 14,400 acres of bogs, Massachusetts is the second-largest producer of cranberries in the nation, producing 1.8 million barrels a season.
Wisconsin produces 2.5 million barrels.
The fruitworms can be devastating to a cranberry crop, infesting and destroying up to 50 percent of a bog in a bad year.
They burrow into the fruit, munching their way from one to the next, rendering the cranberry useless as food or drink.
The latest antiworm device uses the insect's own pheromones, which control sexual desire, to lead the bug astray.
Moths mate around this time of year, producing eggs that turn into the worms that feast on cranberries between late summer and early autumn.
Scientists were able to replicate the pheromones released by the female moths to attract males for mating.
The pheromones have been bottled in liquid form, for all practical reasons an insect perfume.
The liquid is then mixed into a cranberry bog's irrigation system, sending the moths into a blind sexual tizzy.
The males smell the females, but because the scent is everywhere, they can't find the potential partners (unless, of course, they are fortunate enough to bump into one).
The result: fewer eggs are laid, and that translates into fewer of the berry-eating worms, said LaFleur, who sounds positively gleeful as he discusses the insect's demise.
Where the pheromones leave off, the worms' predators -- such as wasps -- take over.
LaFleur predicts the fruitworm could disappear from Massachusetts cranberry bogs over several years.
This season, a handful of growers are testing out the pheromone on several hundred acres of Massachusetts bogs.
The product is nontoxic to other species and to humans, said LaFleur, whose organization represents about 80 percent of the cranberry growers in the state.
------ HAYS, Kan.
(AP) -- A smaller wheat crop in northwest Kansas, combined with dismal prices, means trouble for many farmers here who were hit hard by hail before the harvest began.
And even in southwest Kansas, where the harvest was more bountiful, many farmers are opting to sell at low prices rather than store their crops.
At Garden City, the Johnson Co-op is already full and piling grain on the ground -- with corn harvest expected in just 60 days.
The elevator has been shipping grain for storage to terminals in Kansas City, said grain accountant Jerry Popejoy.
Farmers have already sold 25 percent of their grain at the Johnson Co-op, he said.
The Scott Co-op in Scott City has also seen heavy selling, with farmers there selling 20 percent of their harvest rather than store it in hopes that prices will improve.
Junior Strecker, general manager of the Scott Co-op, said farmers are selling so much because of loan deficiency payments.
There are no incentives to hold the grain.
TECATE, Mexico _ Enrique Ceballos is showing two visitors through the organic gardens at Rancho La Puerta, a spa here on the Baja peninsula just across the border from California.
As he talks, he picks his supper.
``See the holes in the Swiss chard''? he asked.
``People don't normally buy it because of the holes.
I prefer to eat the holes than the chemicals''.
Then he makes a little joke: ``If you are lucky, you get extra protein from the bugs''.
In fact, there are very few blemishes on the rows of chard and lettuce, spinach and cabbage, even though chemicals are never sprayed in this three-acre garden.
Ceballos' work is guided by one principle: ``In nature, all is in balance, and if you kill part of that balance it damages the environment''.
He also applies that belief in cultivating the olive and fruit trees at the resort, and in tending its beehives.
In summer, 90 percent to 95 percent of the fruits and vegetables served to Rancho La Puerta's 150 guests have been grown by Ceballos and his staff; in the winter, the proportion drops to 50 percent.
Ceballos, 44, a biologist from Tecate with a master's degree in ecology from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, intended to be a wildlife manager.
But 14 years ago he was persuaded to work at the ranch by Sarah Livia Brightwood, the daughter of its founders.
She wanted to restore the organic garden her father had planted 50 years earlier.
``If you talk about healthy living at the ranch, you should be eating healthy food,'' she said.
The garden had lain fallow for 25 years, abandoned when a nematode problem overwhelmed the crops.
The worms were still there when work began, but new strategies have been developed for dealing with them.
For example, a crop of a species of marigold that is a nematode suppressor was planted.
The marigolds did their job so well that other crops could be planted near them.
The area of heaviest nematode infestation is now planted with fruit trees that are resistant to them, and with herbs and flowers the pests aren't interested in.
Being an organic farmer requires sensitivity, creativity and observation to decide what is planted, and when, where and how; to know such things as which weeds should be left and which pulled, and what companion planting accomplishes.
Following are some lessons learned from a stroll in Ceballos' garden.
_ Flowers are essential in a vegetable garden because they attract beneficial insects like praying mantises and ladybugs, which eat aphids.
_ Basil and tomatoes are planted together because the herb repels worms that love the fruit.
_ Plants in the onion family, like chives or garlic, are planted with broccoli and cabbage because the alliums discourage aphids from feasting on the cruciferous vegetables.
_ Plants are placed close to one another, to conserve water.
Cabbage is planted with lettuce, which matures first; after the lettuce is picked the cabbage fills in the spaces.
_ Spinach that grows in the wild is transplanted to beds of cultivated spinach; the wild spinach is more resistant to bugs and gives the cultivated spinach more of a chance.
_ In a form of crop rotation, celery is planted after tomatoes because tomatoes take a lot of nitrogen from the soil and celery needs very little.
_ Weeds that are not too aggressive are allowed because their roots help retain moisture in the soil.
Ceballos plans to make herbal teas from the new herb garden, and soon there will be eggs from the organic chickens that have just arrived.
He also makes about 300 gallons of cold-pressed, unfiltered olive oil from trees in the garden.
``This farming is a low-tech activity,'' he said.
``It depends so much on the senses, knowing the cycles of the moon, the soil''.
Many spa guests spend part of their stay weeding and planting.
``Some people who live in apartments never have had the opportunity to feel soil,'' Ceballos said.
``They ask me about the trees carrots grow on.''
WASHINGTON _ When a critical farm chemical is banned by the Environmental Protection Agency, vegetable farmers in South Georgia and Florida may have a simple way to rid the soil of plant diseases and weed seeds _ by cooking them.
Experiments at the U.S.
Agricultural Research Service Horticultural Research Laboratory in Fort Pierce, Fla.
, have demonstrated that sheets of clear plastic laid over the soil trap enough solar heat to kill most of the harmful organisms.
For years farmers have used methyl bromide to destroy weed seed, plant diseases and nematodes, the microscopic worms responsible for billions of dollars in crops losses, in the soil.
However, the chemical is known to destroy ozone when it evaporates from the soil and floats to the stratosphere.
As a result, the Environmental Protection Agency has announced it will ban its use in 2005.
Daniel O.
Chellemi, an ARS plant pathologist at the Ft.
Pierce laboratory, has shown that the plastic traps heat in the soil in a greenhouse effect.
Employed for at least six weeks during the summer, the system can kill off weed seeds and diseases that would otherwise wreck a winter crop, Chellemi said.
The system has its limitations.
For example, it cannot be used for spring crops because the plastic must lie on the soil for at least six weeks prior to planting, and in the winter before spring crops are planted there is insufficient heat for the system to work.
In 1998, Chellemi applied the treatment to four commercial farms in Florida.
On three of the farms, yields on solarized fields ranged from 96 to 123 percent of those from methyl bromide-treated fields.
A comparison was not possible on the fourth farm, operated by Vero Beach organic grower Kevin O'Dare, because O'Dare does not use methyl bromide or any other chemicals.
``I can't say enough for it,'' O'Dare says of the plastic treatment, which Chellemi calls ``solarization''.
The weed purple nutsedge was close to taking over the 10 acres of O'Dare's Osceola Organic Farm when he turned to solarization.
After two years, he said, ``our production was up 30 percent, our labor was down 75 percent, and our profits were up 100 percent''.
The solar sheets are not a perfect replacement for methyl bromide, notes University of Florida horticulture professor Steve Olson, who has collaborated with Chellemi.
For example, it is not particularly effective against the nematode that causes ``root knot,'' he said.
These worms burrow into plant roots, and intercept nutrients moving up to the plants stems and leaves.
Olson has worked with tomato growers Dale and Greg Murray of Decatur County, Ga.
, on a solarization approach that also use small amounts of approved chemical to destroy the nematodes.

WASHINGTON, Va.
_ Sunrise at Sunnyside Farms is greeted by a ritual that startles the uninitiated.
Workers advance upon windowless structures on wheels that are scattered around the 539 acres and lower the sides, releasing thousands of clucking chickens eager for a good day's work at what they do best: eating bugs.
David Cole, venture capitalist, philanthropist and organic farmer, uses these coops on wheels _ chicken mobile units, they're called _ to move his chickens where the pecking is needed most.
The mobile units are just one of many labor-savers he employs on the organic farm he started in 1995 in the middle of Rappahannock County, home to the very rich who have made their money elsewhere and to farmers who barely make a living.
Like the cattle, sheep and goats that keep the pasture trimmed, the chickens take care of fertilizing it.
Like every aspect of his $11.5 million farm, the mobile units are state-of-the-art equipment intended to ensure the success of his experimental farm.
Money is no object, and money is not the only objective.
The farm is not a rich man's hobby.
It is a rich man's business, and Cole, who made his name as president of Internet services at America Online (and his money in a variety of other computer technology businesses), predicts confidently that Sunnyside will turn a profit by 2004.
In addition to its wagonloads of chickens, the farm has 424 head of Wagyu cattle (close relatives of the famous Japanese Kobe beef); 60 to 70 varieties of vegetables, herbs and flowers; and 8 to 10 varieties of berries, as well as pear, apple and cherry trees.
It is experimenting with more than 200 kinds of fruits and vegetables.
But even more important to Cole is Sunnyside's role in promoting organic farming as economic savior.
By helping local growers profit in an era when independent farms are struggling, he hopes to create a model for reviving depressed agricultural areas around the country.
The idea of saving a region through organic farming might once have sounded outlandish.
But the demand for organic food nationwide is greater than the supply, and sales have increased by at least 20 percent annually for several years.
Buyers looking for such food _ independently certified to be free of chemical pesticides, genetically engineered ingredients and antibiotics _ willingly pay a premium for it.
Cole, 47, calls his system network farming: a large central farm is the hub, with smaller nearby farms the spokes, their production marketed through the hub.
Sunnyside's system is designed to show that diversified organic farming, with a mix of vegetables, fruits and animals, can be profitable while protecting the environment, not only from tract housing but also from the damage done to it by traditional farming methods.
Such a system would be particularly useful in helping small organic farmers compete.
The concept is not new.
Walnut Acres Organic Farms in Pennsylvania, which Cole just bought, operates in the same fashion.
But Sunnyside was set up to be an experimental demonstration farm.
``What he is doing is really rare,'' said Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade Association.
``That he has the ability to have this diversity on his farm makes it unique.
It totally encompasses the breadth of on-farm innovation and research.
He is really taking new and old ideas and combining all that information into a full farm approach''.
So far three small farms have signed on with Sunnyside, and conversations with a dozen more farmers are under way.
The farm pays to educate them in converting to organic techniques and gaining organic certification and gives them access to the expensive equipment needed to run an organic farm.
It also pays them 20 to 30 percent more than they would get if they were selling conventional food and, more important, gets their products to consumers.
``A weakness of a lot of farmers is marketing,'' said Brian Cramer, the gardener and orchard production manager at Sunnyside.
Selling at farmers' markets or farm stands, with no middlemen, ``is always preferable,'' he said, ``but some farmers don't want to do it''.
``Some don't have time to do it,'' he said, ``so they leave it to someone else, and they get taken advantage of''.
nn In the summer Sunnyside is opening a market in an 1835 building Cole is restoring in the center of the tiny town of Washington, Va.
, less than a block from his most prestigious customer, the Inn at Little Washington.
Its farmers' products will be sold there, at a farmers' market in Washington, D.C., and to restaurants, the Fresh Fields natural supermarket chain and an organic wholesaler who sells up and down the East Coast.
There will be more than 30 varieties of tomatoes, 15 different peppers and three dozen kinds of greens.
``Eventually we could have 8 or 10 spoke farms, and that could have a tremendous economic impact on the community,'' said Cole, who has restored the 1720 house on the farm, one of several places he lives with his wife of 30 years and the youngest of their four children.
(One son works for Sunnyside full time, another during the summer).
The original 1,000-acre farm had been in the same family for 276 years.
When Cole bought half of it, in 1995, the land had been worn out by conventional farming.
It took two years of intensive working and enriching the soil for the first earthworms to return, and Sunnyside was certified organic in 1999.
DiMatteo, of the Organic Trade Association, said she doubts that aylne has ever started an organic farm from scratch on so grand a scale, and while she greatly admires what Cole is trying to do, she is not certain it will succeed.
``People either go into organic farming gradually or specialize in one crop while they figure out crop rotations,'' she said.
``Wealthy people do organic farming, but profitability is not what it's about, and he's setting a goal of a working farm that is economically feasible.
``This is the food industry.
It's not like the technology industry.
You can't force nature to perform according to some bottom-line expectations''.
John Burns, a consultant who was hired by Cole in 1995 but left after a falling-out two years later, agreed.
``When there is such an excess amount of capital around,'' he said, ``the solution seems to be spend more money, get more people and get more equipment, as opposed to scaling back and concentrating on fewer things.
It's the mentality of his other enterprises: you get enough brain power and enough people and you can get it solved, and farming isn't that way.
It's the cycle of life and nature; it's not microchip speed''.
Cole, though, maintains that with enough money and his successful business experience he can help nature along.
For instance, his recent purchase of Walnut Acres, the oldest organic food mail order company in the country, provides Sunnyside with built-in marketing advantages.
He has also scoured the country for the best people in organic production, like Wes Beall, a cow's version of the horse whisperer: cattle trust him.
To assure a steady supply of loyal farmworkers, who are recruited from two villages in Mexico, Cole provides benefits including trips home for two or three months at a time and 401(k) plans, matching the workers' contributions.
Cole has also planted several varieties of dwarf fruit stock to see which grow best.
These varieties, Cramer said, bear more fruit more quickly, and are easier to pick and to spray with organic pest controls.
Many are heirloom varieties like Roxbury Russet and Grimes Golden apples and newer varieties like Liberty that are immune to a serious apple disease called scab.
Sunnyside has its own weather station.
It alerts the orchardist when to expect an outbreak of pests and prepare for it.
For example, it can pinpoint the moment when the Japanese beetle's larvae are about to emerge.
While the commercial grower is bringing out the pesticides, Cole is sending out the chickens.
The farm uses animals in an intensive grazing rotation, a technique now being reintroduced into organic agriculture.
``In order to save human labor we enlist animal labor,'' Cole said, ``by having them do what they do naturally''.
For a day or two cattle graze on high grasses in a particular field; when they move on, the sheep and goats come in for a day to eat everything else.
They are followed by the chickens, which scatter the manure left behind by the other animals as they eat the weed seeds out of it, at the same time depositing their own nitrogen-rich manure.
(The chickens also provide eggs for the farm to sell).
Then the rotation begins again.
All of these approaches will be shared at the Sunnyside Institute, to be built on the farm.
It will provide information not available from federal and state agriculture agencies, which have spent little time or money studying organic farming.
``No one has ever coordinated all this information,'' DiMatteo said.
Cole traces his interest in the environment to his childhood in Hawaii.
His family has financed global conservation efforts for 15 years, most recently through the Cole Family Foundation.
He chose Virginia for his experiment because of its climate and its proximity to one of his homes.
He found the farm through his friend and now neighbor, John Sawhill, president and chief executive of the environmental group the Nature Conservancy.
In an interview for ``Dream Makers,'' by Michele Hunt (Davies-Black Publishing, 1998), Cole said entrepreneurs need to redefine capital to include not only money but the earth itself and stop treating it like an unlimited resource.
``Instead of saying the world is going to hell in a handbasket, you have to say we can do something about this.
We can change our relationship to the earth''.
Like any rich mogul who comes to town and buys up all the available land, Cole has his detractors.
But even those who have parted ways over differences of opinion admire what he is trying to do.
Burns, who quit as a consultant, said Cole is ``brilliant''.
But he added: ``He makes it hard for some people to deal with him, because you have to do it his way.
He wants to do too much too fast.
If I'd had my druthers, I would have managed the farm for three years without growing a thing, but he wanted to have crops in 18 months''.
In early April, Cole was invited to lecture at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London on organic food trends in the United States.
In his speech he described his attempt to fuse two totally different cultures: the high-powered, fast-paced world of technology and marketing and a slow-paced place from the past where success is based on the production yields of organic farming.
Cole leaves no doubt of his certitude that he can apply the principles of the Internet, where rewards can come at warp speed and most problems can be remedied with brain power and capital, to farming, where even the best-laid plans are subject to the vagaries of nature.
``He wants to do good, and he really sees this as an important step,'' Burns said.
``And being a leader in a previous industrial incarnation, he wants to do the same thing in the organic world.
But organic mogul may be an oxymoron.''
BUFFALO, N.Y.
(AP) - For the first 15 years of their farming lives, Gail and Mike Thorpe of East Aurora relied on a conventional arsenal of pesticides and fertilizers to grow their fields of fruits and vegetables.
But for the last three years, the couple has scrapped chemicals in favor of things like tricho gamma wasps, green lace wings, bars of soap, live bacteria, and lots of weeding.
The Thorpes have gone organic.
''It's been like learning to farm all over again,'' said Gail Thorpe.
''But it has been worth it.
We feel really good about what's coming out of our fields''.
This past week that feeling was backed by an official designation of their accomplishments.
The Thorpes passed a final inspection by the Northeastern Organic Farming Association/New York Chapter, and have the right to claim 896 acres of their farm as ''certified organic''.
These local farmers are part of a growing national trend of organic farming, joining more than 6,000 other growers of everything from fruits and vegetables to animal feeds and food-grade soy beans.
Nationally, the organic head count is up 20 percent in two years.
In New York, more than 230 growers have earned official organic status, with another 50 or so expected to pass muster this growing season.
Although less than 2 percent of all food produced in the U.S. is certified organic, annual sales now total more than $6 billion said Sarah Johnston, executive director of the New York branch of the organic farming association.
''Our farmers are still the little guys, but we're seeing a steady growth trend as consumer demand grows and producer awareness increases,'' she said.
By definition, organic farming eschews artificial fertilizers and pesticides, instead harnessing the power of natural substances, such as compost, bacteria and pest-targeted insects and protective netting, to build healthy soil and keep invading forces at bay.
While any farmer can opt to use these methods, those who want to label the fruits of their labors as ''certified organic,'' are required to go through a three-year process that includes extensive documentation.
While the ranks of organic farmers are steadily increasing, it's still considered an oddity.
Steve Porter, in his 11th year of organic growing, is the state's largest organic vegetable producer.
He said he continues to be scrutinized by non-organic neighbors.
''We're still considered the weird ones,'' Porter said of the Elba farm he runs with his father, Jack, and brother, Bill.
''A lot of them scratch their heads, but a few are getting interested in how this works''.
While other farmers were writing checks for annual applications of herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers, the Porters have faced higher upfront costs on soil preparation, including equipment, organic substances and labor.
''The costs probably work out to be comparable, but they're paying and applying chemicals several times a year, every year, while our biggest costs are up front,'' Porter said.
Over the past decade, the Porters have seen their organic business bloom from a one-acre vegetable patch to more than 500 acres of produce.
The goods find their way to the table via Wegmans and Tops supermarkets, health food stores, food cooperatives, natural foods wholesalers, and the farm's own Community Supported Agriculture program.
Through the CSA program, participants pay up front for a season's worth of produce, and receive weekly installments of fruits and vegetables from early summer through early winter.
More than 160 families in the Buffalo and Rochester areas are currently paying about $200 each for the steady supply of organically-grown goods.
The Porters also produce organic grains sold to organic dairy farmers as feed, and raise food-grade organic soy beans to ship around the world for tofu production.
While declining to discuss profits, Porter said he hasn't had to ''run to the bank to borrow money''.
''You don't go into farming to get rich,'' he said.
''We're holding our own financially, expanding our acreage and finding new markets, so I guess we're a success.''
WASHINGTON (AP) -- First, parents clamored for the hormone secretin in hopes it would help their autistic children.
Put to the test, however, secretin is proving disappointing.
Now a new theory is triggering desperate parents' interest -- and this time the stakes are higher because it could spur misuse of the nation's most precious antibiotic, vancomycin.
An Illinois mother persuaded scientists to try a bizarre-sounding experiment, testing whether vancomycin might help her son's severe autism.
To their surprise, little Andrew Bolte got better.
Dr. Richard Sandler of Rush Children's Hospital in Chicago was skeptical of Ellen Bolte's theory that a neurotoxin-producing intestinal infection was behind some of her son's symptoms.
He administered the antibiotic anyway.
Andrew ''was not cured, but all of a sudden he started saying words, became toilet-trained,'' Sandler recalled.
''I found that very intriguing.
It's not supposed to happen''.
So Sandler treated 11 autistic children who, like about a third of children with this serious brain disorder, also suffer painful gastrointestinal problems.
Neuropsychological testing concluded that 10 children improved, he reports in this month's Journal of Child Neurology -- but only for a while.
And that's the problem: Andrew and the others worsened again after just a few months.
Yet already parents are calling doctors about vancomycin.
That's worrisome because overuse of vancomycin, considered the best weapon against the problem of antibiotic-resistant infections, will spur germs to become impervious to it.
''It is a danger,'' said Sandler, who has quit using vancomycin, calling it inappropriate until more research proves if it is a real clue or a false lead.
Another Chicagoan, Dr.
Michael Chez, plans to compare vancomycin to a dummy drug this fall, important because simple attention during medical research markedly helps autistic children, the so-called ''placebo effect''.
(Send an e-mail to rushstudy@aol.com for study information).
Like other autism experts, Johns Hopkins University neurologist Dr.
Andrew Zimmerman is bracing for families' calls.
''It's heartbreaking, because you know they really want answers,'' yet the study is far too weak to back antibiotic use, he said.
Still, it's ''provocative,'' Zimmerman said, because scientists are scrutinizing whether bowel problems are caused by or worsen autistic symptoms, or are a coincidental side effect of the terrible brain disorder.
More than 400,000 Americans have autism, characterized by profound social withdrawal, inability to communicate, repetitive behavior and sometimes aggression.
No one knows what causes it, although much research suggests something goes wrong during critical fetal brain development.
Several thousand children have taken secretin, an intestinal hormone, after a mother said one dose brought her son out of autistic isolation.
But in scientific studies, secretin so far has proved no better than a dummy injection.
Intense behavior therapy is autism's only proven treatment.
But Andrew Bolte was so aggressive the therapy didn't stand a chance, his mother said.
He screamed for hours.
He even chewed drywall from the walls.
Complicating matters were severe diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Bolte blames antibiotics prescribed for fluid in Andrew's ears shortly before he became autistic at 19 months.
Her unproven theory: those drugs killed Andrew's normal gut-protective bacteria, allowing an intestinal infection that can produce nerve-killing toxins, which entered his brain.
Vancomycin, she thought, could kill that infection.
Thirty-six doctors scoffed.
After all, autism typically appears between ages 14 and 22 months, and no sufferers have ever been found with neurotoxic infections.
Sandler called it ''highly improbable,'' too, but he tried because Andrew, by now 3, was miserable.
Two months later, Andrew was ''very calm,'' allowed Bolte to hug him and finally followed verbal commands.
Aggression and other symptoms soon returned.
But Bolte believes vancomycin eased his bowel problem enough to open a window for behavior therapy, saying Andrew retained his language improvements.
Even she cautions against demanding vancomycin, however.
Instead, she is raising money for bacterial research.

The discovery that autistic children appear to have subtle abnormalities in body movements that can be diagnosed as early as 3 months old is leading researchers to hope for new treatments.
The findings, by Philip Teitelbaum, a psychologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville, are preliminary.
But they have generated intense interest because for the first time, a method is being proposed for diagnosing the condition in babies whose brains are still developing rapidly.
Most autism is not diagnosed in children until they are at least 3 years old.
But if there were a reliable way to diagnose autism earlier, Teitelbaum and other researchers said, doctors might be able to devise therapies to alleviate or eliminate the condition, when the brain is its most malleable.
Autism is a disorder of the brain and behavior that affects about 5 of every 10,000 children.
While autistic children appear healthy, they may stare into space for hours, throw tantrums, show no interest in people and pursue repetitive activities, like head banging, with no apparent purpose.
Teitelbaum made the discovery by examining videotapes of babies who were later found to be autistic.
These infants showed a specific cluster of movement abnormalities when rolling over, sitting up, crawling and walking, Teitelbaum said in a telephone interview.
But, he cautioned, the results are still preliminary.
Researchers need to look at many more babies, he said, to see exactly which movement abnormalities can predict autism and which suggest developmental disorders like schizophrenia or attention deficit disorder.
``I think he's on to something,'' said Dr.
Dan Geschwind, a neurogeneticist at the University of California at Los Angeles and scientific adviser to Cure Autism Now, an organization based in Los Angeles run by parents of autistic children.
``He's got a very intriguing piece of preliminary data which, if it turns out to be true, will be very important''.
Temple Grandin, a highly functioning autistic woman who is an assistant professor of animal science at Colorado State University in Fort Collins and an authority on animal behavior, said: ``He's on to something really good, and I fully support it.
I like the fact that he is objectively measuring something that is biological''.
It may be, she cautioned, that Teitelbaum has discovered general problems in the nervous system that are not unique to autism.
But even that, she said, is a benefit for doctors, parents and teachers, who now have nothing to go on before children are 2 or 3 years old.
Anne Donnellan, a professor of rehabilitation psychology and special education at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said: ``Teitelbaum's work is important because it reflects a reality about autism that has been missed.
We tend to think it's a problem with the mind.
But now that we are really beginning to see how the brain works, we know that the mind is embodied.
Body is part of mind and there's no way to separate them''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Teitelbaum said he got the idea of looking at autism as a movement disorder partly because of his work with brain-damaged animals.
As they recover, he said, they go through predictable stages, for example recovery of movement, that reflect fundamental aspects of brain organization.
Because human babies also pass through predictable stages of development, he theorized that defects in the brain might be reflected in early movements.
A few years ago, Teitelbaum sent out word to parents of autistic children through various national organizations that he was looking for videotapes of babies before their autism was diagnosed.
He received 17 tapes that showed the babies during major milestones of motor development, including rolling over, sitting, crawling, standing and walking.
He also videotaped 15 normal infants as they passed through the same milestones.
Portions of each tape were analyzed, using a special technique, for subtle differences in patterns of movement.
No two babies develop motor skills in exactly the same way, but the autistic babies show a specific cluster of movement abnormalities, Teitelbaum said.
Some were subtle and others quite obvious.
Normal children may temporarily show some of the same movements.
For example, none of the autistic babies in the tapes learned to roll over like normal children did, he said.
Normal babies use a corkscrew motion to go from back to stomach or vice versa.
Starting at about 3 months old, they first turn their pelvis to one side, followed by the trunk and finally the shoulders and head.
By 6 months, the order is reversed: the head goes first and the rest of the body parts follow, corkscrew fashion.
Some of the autistic babies in the tapes never learned to roll over.
Others did, but in a peculiar fashion, Teitelbaum said.
Starting from lying on their sides, they rolled to their stomachs or backs by raising heads and pelvises.
Then they threw the upper legs forward and toppled over, moving all body segments together.
And unlike healthy babies who usually learn to sit up at 6 months, even while turning the torso or head, some of the infants whose autism was diagnosed later on toppled easily, falling to one side ``like a log'' and failing to break the falls with their hands.
Teitelbaum, who described his findings in a recent issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, also noted anomalies in the way the autistic babies in the tapes learned to crawl and walk.
Babies typically start to crawl at about the same time they begin to sit, holding their bodies symmetrically with arms vertical at shoulder width, palms on floor, fingers pointed forward.
Thighs are vertical and hip-width apart with knees on the ground and lower legs and feet resting on the floor pointing backward.
Weight is commonly distributed equally on all four limbs.
The autistic children in the study showed an asymmetrical lack of support in the arms or legs, Teitelbaum said.
One baby supported himself on his forearms rather than his hands.
He raised his pelvis high in the air, bird-dog fashion, but could not move forward.
Another baby crawled by scooting his left knee on the floor but used his right foot to push himself forward.
Teitelbaum said that every autistic child showed some degree of asymmetry in walking.
Many tended to shift their weight at the wrong moment, which made their walking appear slightly stiff.
Others kept their arms in a more infantile position, arms extended forward.
Interestingly, many autistic children walk more slowly and with shorter steps, like Parkinson's disease patients whose motor skills are damaged, Teitelbaum said.
Early diagnosis has long been a goal of autism researchers, who theorize that the condition results from brain abnormalities that develop before birth.
Some researchers think the glitch occurs as early as the 20th to 24th day of gestation, long before women know they are pregnant.
Others believe the injury, which could be a mutation or environmental insult, occurs later on, perhaps in the second trimester of pregnancy.
In any event, researchers say that in autistic people, most of the brain forms normally but that some basic scaffolding of nerve fibers is incomplete or improperly developed.
Because the human brain grows rapidly in the first year of life _ literally constructing circuits that will last a lifetime _ this is the best time to intervene.
The goal of intervention would be to stimulate the baby's brain to circumvent the bad wiring or develop connections to compensate for a defect, Donnellan said.
By correcting movements through some form of physical therapy, it may be possible to used feedback to help correct abnormal brain development.
When Evan Rosenberg was 2 years old, he didn't play like other children.
He spent hours gazing out the window, clapping his hands.
He didn't make eye contact with his mother.
He wasn't talking.
He couldn't point to objects, or follow basic commands.
Fearing her son couldn't hear, Wendie Rosenberg took him to an audiologist.
``The audiologist said there's nothing wrong with his hearing,'' she said.
Then he said a word that strikes a chord of panic in a parent's heart: autism.
``I thought autism meant sitting and rocking in a corner, severe mental retardation and no skills at all,'' Rosenberg said.
``I couldn't say the word `autism' for a year.
It was like falling into a black hole and not being able to get out''.
That was seven years ago.
Today, Evan rushes to the door to greet visitors.
He not only makes eye contact and talks, he's doing fourth-grade-level work in most subjects.
He still has autistic traits, including a slightly formal manner of speech, and a propensity for re-enacting conversations to himself.
But for the most part, he just blends in.
Evan, 10, is one of an exploding population of children with autism in Washington.
He also is one of the success stories, a child who functions almost independently in a normal, mainstreamed classroom after years of intensive, one-on-one therapy to draw him into the world of his peers.
Autism is a mysterious brain disorder that affects between 1 out of 500 and 1 out of 1,000 children.
Scientists cannot agree on the incidence, except to say it appears to be growing.
No one knows exactly why.
But the rise is fueling an unprecedented concern over the best way to help children with autism, as well as intensified research into possible causes and cures.
A study by the California Health and Human Services Agency this year found that the number of people with autism in California had nearly quadrupled (up 273 percent) between 1987 and 1998, a time when the population base increased 19 percent.
Other studies have put the increase as high as 500 percent or 600 percent, said Portia Iversen, founder of California-based Cure Autism Now Foundation and the parent of a 7-year-old autistic son.
In Washington, programs that take children with autism are having to turn children away.
``In 20 years, we've never had a wait list,'' said Mimi Siegel, executive director of the Kindering Center, an early-childhood development program in Bellevue.
``We have always been able to shoehorn kids in''.
Until this year.
The situation has gotten so acute that a group of 30 local families has banded together to lobby for improved services and persuaded Children's Hospital to begin a program specializing in pediatric autism.
Due to be in operation early next year, the center will be jointly run by the hospital and the University of Washington's Center on Human Development and Disability.
For parents like these, the rising caseload is chilling.
The disease impairs a child's ability to form language and relationships, and strikes at the very heart of being human _ the ability to connect with other people.
As one mother puts it, ``It's as though someone broke into my home and stole my child's mind and left his helpless body''.
Autism affects imagination, communication, social interaction and reasoning ability, creating a spectrum of impairments.
Children may develop odd ritualistic behaviors, quirky language patterns, or hypersensitivities to stimuli, such as sounds.
No two children with autism are alike.
Some develop high verbal skills, but their thinking remains concrete.
Others understand language perfectly, but remain mute.
Some children fixate on objects, such as car wheels, or develop narrowly focused obsessions, such as with weather broadcasts.
Some flap their hands.
Some bang their heads.
Some make eye contact readily.
Others seem lost in their own worlds.
Evan's success is the kind of story that parents of young children with autism dream of and pray for, give up their jobs and sometimes their life savings to achieve.
Only about half of children with autism respond to treatment as well as Evan did.
The problem: Researchers can't tell in advance which 50 percent will respond.
The refrigerator myth: First described in 1943, autism was once thought to be a disease of upper-middle-class dysfunctional families.
The myth of the ``refrigerator mother'' _ a parent who failed to attach to the child _ persisted until the late 1960s, when research began uncovering the neurological roots of the disorder.
Today, scientists have identified some patterns of brain abnormalities that may reveal the organic, biological basis for the disease.
Overall, for example, children with autism tend to have slightly bigger heads with heavier brains.
Many children with autism have anomalies in various brain structures.
Brain-damage studies and post-mortem analyses have found differences in the frontal lobes, which help plan and process complex information; the cerebellum, which is involved in motor coordination; and the limbic system, which helps regulate emotions and social behavior.
The locations of the damage help explain some of the symptoms of autism.
Scientists now believe the neural connections aren't ``wired'' the same way in damaged areas, making it impossible to deliver the right signals.
``Most social interactions require ability to process complex sets of information, such as facial expressions, body movements, language, all at once, and monitor our own role in the conversation,'' said Geraldine Dawson, professor of psychology and director of the autism project at the UW.
``The timing of it and the complexity of it is too much (for children with autism)''.
Scientists are still puzzling out how this process is interrupted.
``How does something that leaves 99 percent of the brain normal, how does it derail so many diffuse psychological functions''? said Dr.
Alan Unis, associate professor of psychiatry at the UW School of Medicine.
And even more puzzling _ how does autism occasionally result in ``savants,'' such as the character portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the movie ``Rain Man''?
``Some children (with autism) have islets of preserved, or exceptional, ability,'' Dawson said.
These so-called ``splinter skills'' may show up as amazing feats of memory, or exceptional abilities in math, music, drawing or the ability to decode puzzles.
``It's similar to a person who is blind who has more acute hearing or ability to use touch,'' she said.
``If you're not using certain areas of the brain involved with language and people, other areas having to do with objects, space and numbers are exercised''.
Autism has sometimes been called ``mind blindness,'' an attempt to describe how difficult it is for children with autism to be able to imagine, or ``see,'' what's going on in the minds of others, an essential task for forming social relationships.
Many children with autism don't know, anticipate or react to what others are thinking.
This makes the world a confusing, unreadable, unpredictable place and contributes to the child's isolation.
Biochemical fingerprints: The UW, which has one of the largest autism research programs in the country, currently has several long-term studies under way looking at how brain structure and activity correlates with the development of autistic traits.
Using tools such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a way of visualizing brain tissue, researchers are working to identify the ``biochemical fingerprints'' of the disorder by identifying which areas of the brain are associated with different symptoms.
Tying these biochemical patterns and the source of the damage to specific types of behavior is a complicated task, but scientists believe it will help them develop early predictors of outcome and better treatments.
Scientists are particularly interested in correlating areas of brain abnormality with outcome of interventions, Dawson said.
It is believed there are different subtypes of autism, and the goal is to find the best form of treatment for each one.
For families, treatment is the most pressing concern.
The Rosenbergs tried many ``remedies,'' including special ``anti-yeast'' diets and vitamins from Europe.
``Families are so vulnerable,'' she said.
``We had a whole biochemical work-up, spent thousands of dollars not covered by insurance.
But for him, (diet) wasn't the answer''.
Finally, they started applied behavioral therapy, a form of intensive, highly repetitive teaching that breaks learning into tiny incremental tasks, each one reinforced with positive rewards.
Most children learn by osmosis from their environments.
Children with autism need to be taught even the simplest things, like responding to their names.
The process is strict, labor-intensive and excruciatingly time-consuming.
It can take days or weeks to learn a task as simple as pointing, years to learn language.
``We had to teach him how to nod,'' Rosenberg said.
``We had to teach him what language was for''.
At first, Evan was oblivious.
They kept at it, 20 to 25 hours a week, month after month.
``It was intense.
We lost all our privacy,'' she said.
``People were constantly in and out.
But we kept him engaged, kept him focused''.
Within three months, Evan was making eye contact, playing with blocks, pointing spontaneously to objects and forming words.
``At the beginning, people who don't know about (behavioral therapy) think we're breaking their spirit,'' Rosenberg said.
``But you'll never hear that (criticism) from parents whose children do it''.
Today, Evan continues to get 10 hours of therapy a week outside of school, and he continues to make progress, one task at a time.
This year, for example, he went to day camp without a full-time aide for the first time.
Rosenberg is heartened by his progress, and his acceptance into the world of his typical peers.
``When we first started this journey, we were advised don't ever tell anyone (your child has autism) because their expectations will drop,'' she said.
On this day, Evan and his therapist, Kim Domis, are setting out more goals, tasks and rewards in Evan's tidy upstairs bedroom.
They are working on reading comprehension as well as manners and figures of speech.
Like many children with autism, Evan understands language at a literal level, but struggles to understand its abstractions.
There's a rhythm to the therapy.
A question.
An answer.
A mark on the board.
The marks accumulate.
The minutes go by.
When he meets his goals, he gets a reward.
Every 10 minutes or so, he gets a break.
``What does it mean to find a needle in a haystack''?
Domis asks.
``It's hard to find,'' Evan says.
He seems pleased when he gets his answers right.
They move on to working story problems in math.
Occasionally, Domis throws in an unexpected question.
``What does it mean to stay on your toes''? she asks.
``Pay attention''.
Evan looks to make sure he gets a point for the correct answer.
At the break, he gets to work on a jigsaw puzzle, one of his favorite activities.
Today it's a rhinoceros puzzle, a complicated adult one with more than 1,000 pieces.
``Remember just three pieces,'' Domis says.
``Just remembering,'' he says.
``Thanks, Evan''.
``You're welcome, Kim''.
There are stacks of completed puzzles mounted on boards against the wall, each assembled a piece at a time, like the neural circuits in his brain.
The break's over, and he's back at work.
He picks up his reading-comprehension book.
``Is that a book you can judge by its cover''?
Domis asks.
Evan laughs.
``You can't judge a book by its cover,'' he says.
``Means you can't tell what's on the inside.''
NEW DELHI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- There are an estimated 1.7 million autistic persons in India suffering from developmental disorder that affects communication and social abilities of people, Welfare Ministry sources said here today.
Autism is known as a "spectrum disorder," in which the severity of symptoms range from a mild learning and social disability to a severe impairment with multiple problems of highly unusual disorder.
It is stated that 20 out of a population of 10,000 in India suffer from the spectrum disorder.
Out of this, 80 percent affected by autism are boys.
The Action for Autism, a non-profit organization based here, is conducting a three-day training workshop for parents of autistic children.
According to the Action for Autism, there are no medical or genetic tests which can detect autism.
Diagnosis of autism is not easy, the onset may occur at birth, or a child may have a period of normal development followed by a deterioration of verbal and social skills around one-and-half to two-and-half years.
&UR; (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate) &LR; &QL; Support services for people with autism _ children and adults alike _ fall far short of fulfilling their needs today, says a new study.
And the lack of specialized help contributes to the increased behavioral and social problems among autistic adults living outside their family homes, the researchers say.
People with autism, a disorder that affects brain development, tend to have trouble communicating and relating to the outside world.
More than a half-million Americans have autism or some form of pervasive developmental disorder, says the Autism Society of America.
More cases of autism are being diagnosed than ever before, in part because of changes in diagnostic criteria, says study co-author Marsha Seltzer, a professor of social work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
``The service system is experiencing a crunch.
In some states, families have to have to wait several years or longer to get the services they need,'' Seltzer says.
Although many people think of autism as a childhood disease, she says it's really a lifelong struggle.
``Parents just shoulder a tremendous responsibility,'' Seltzer says.
``Most research on autism is on early childhood autism, right around the time of diagnosis,'' she says.
After that, she says, ``It almost falls off the face of the research charts, but it never leaves the sphere of the family''.
Many families surveyed by Seltzer and her colleagues think their autistic children lack essential services.
Her on-going long-term study involves approximately 400 Wisconsin families who have either an adolescent or adult child with autism.
Roughly 40 percent of the autistic participants are aged 20 to 50.
David Holmes, who chairs the Autism Society of America's panel of professional advisors, echoes the sentiments of the study.
``The complexities of autism require more specialized adult services,'' Holmes says.
Autistic people need specialized services, experts say, because the disease is multifaceted, with wide-ranging symptoms, and because autistic people often have a secondary condition.
More than 80 percent of the autistic subjects, for instance, also have mental retardation, obsessive-compulsive disorder or a seizure disorder, the researchers say.
Without special help, especially for autistic adults living away from their parents, behavioral and social problems develop, say the researchers.
Because autistic people need a stimuli-controlled environment, as well as fairly constant training in communications, behavior management and task completion, Holmes says generic programs don't work _ and even can harm those with autism.
``Adult services for other forms of developmental disabilities are not often appropriate for adults with autism,'' Homes says.
But, he says, ``Adults with autism can continue to develop new skills if only given the chance''.
Seltzer and her colleagues presented their early findings last week at a meeting of the International Association for the Scientific Study of Disability in Seattle.
Funded by the National Institute on Aging, the study is a joint effort by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Brandeis University, in Waltham, Mass.
----- (The HealthScout.com Web site is at http://www.HealthScout.com.)
The explosion in the population of children with autism has created huge demand for therapists who can provide ``Applied Behavioral Analysis'' (ABA), the only widely accepted treatment for autism.
ABA is an intensive, one-on-one form of therapy that helps ``rewire'' the brains of children with autism through repetitive teaching and positive reinforcement.
Therapists with training in ABA are in such demand they've started guarding their phone numbers to avoid disappointing parents who stand no chance of getting their services.
And special education preschool programs that offer even limited ABA services are having to put students on a waiting list for the first time.
Frustrations such as these are driving a grass-roots organization effort by parents, who are trying to improve services and options for children with autism.
They are also forcing parents to do battle with insurance companies, school districts and state agencies to try to get services to help their children.
``About 10 percent of parents in the (autism) clinic are engaged in some type of legal or adversarial interaction over their children's educational placement,'' said Dr.
Alan Unis, psychiatrist and autism expert at the University of Washington.
``It's as bad as the civil rights movement in the 1960s.
If these children don't get an appropriate education, the risk of them spending the rest of their lives in institutional placements is much higher''.
ABA is widely recognized as the treatment with the most scientific credibility for helping children with autism, said Geraldine Dawson, professor of psychology and director of the autism project at the UW.
Twenty years ago, the prognosis for children with autism wasn't good, Dawson said.
Today, if a child is identified by age 2 or 3 and given high-quality, intensive early intervention _ at least 25 hours of one-on-one therapy a week for two to three years _ about 50 percent respond really well, she said.
``They have an average IQ point increase of 28 points,'' she said.
That's enough to move a child from the mildly retarded to normal intelligence range.
But such interventions are costly and time-consuming.
``One of our concerns is the research seems to point to certain minimum number of hours (of treatment to be successful,)'' said Nellie Allnutt, social services coordinator of the Developmental Disabilities Division, King County.
``We're very concerned we won't be able to meet what's defined as best practice for these kids''.
Current funding through state and federal developmental disability resources allows only for a few hours a week for those children who qualify, she said.
Most insurance plans don't cover ABA.
Many parents want more, and they are afraid if they wait to get it, they will miss the window when their children's brains can still be reprogrammed.
Tracey Newsome is one who didn't want to wait.
Newsome's younger son Elliot, 3, was diagnosed with ``Pervasive Developmental Delay,'' one of the disorders on the autism spectrum, about eight months ago.
``At about 18 months, he wasn't doing the things we thought he should be, like pointing to stuff,'' Newsome said.
``I'd say, `Point to your eyes, point to your nose,' and he wouldn't do it''.
At first Newsome tried not to compare his progress with his older brother's, figuring all siblings are different.
``But in your heart, you know it's not just a second-kid thing,'' she said.
Newsome was one of the lucky ones.
She was able to find a therapist to begin doing behavioral therapy with Elliot.
``The ABA approach has been incredible,'' she said.
``It's like a huge light bulb going on.
``Before, it was like he didn't even know what we were saying.
He gets it now''.
Children with autism lack the necessary neural connections to learn automatically, but those connections can be established through repetition and reinforcement, Dawson said.
The technique takes advantage of the fact that the brain's circuitry is still under construction in the early years of life.
Children born with a cloudy cataract in one eye, for example, will develop normal vision if the cataract is removed before age 3.
If it's removed after age 3, they will remain blind in that eye because the neural pathways that process visual information in the brain were never stimulated.
Like muscle cells that get stronger in response to exercise, brain cells respond and adapt to stimulation from the environment.
Newsome, a former Microsoft manager, is working now to help other parents get access to behavioral therapy.
Together with several other Microsoft parents (who also have children with autism) and professionals, she has helped form Northwest Behavioral Associates, a non-profit program to provide educational and behavioral support services to children with autism.
The group, which provides therapy and school-consultation services, is also putting together a tutor-training program to increase the pool of people qualified to work with children with autism.
The group joins other established parent organizations, such as FEAT (Families for Effective Autism Treatment), which are also working to increase training, awareness and funding for autism therapy.
Other institutions are responding to increased demand for services from parents as well.
Children's Hospital, for example, is developing a new autism program in collaboration with the UW's Center on Human Development and Disability, to provide comprehensive services for children with autism.
The center, which will be directed by Dawson, will certify and train therapists.
It also will provide ABA therapy, as well as other services, including school interventions, for children with autism.
Therapists themselves are organizing.
The Northwest Association for Behavioral Analysis has formed a committee to try to bring a national certification test to Washington.
So far, five states, including Florida and California, have certification standards for behavioral therapists.
``We need to discriminate between the qualified and the unqualified,'' said Michael Fabrizio, a trained behavioral therapist in Seattle.
Certification is critical for increasing insurance coverage.
Currently, many parents can't get insurance to pay for therapy because behavioral intervention doesn't fit into conventional categories of treatment.
``It's not a medical model where you go in and get a shot,'' he said.
``And it's not a typical therapy model, like speech therapy, where you get an hour a week''.
Insurance companies blanch at the thought of paying for 20 to 40 hours a week of therapy, at an average cost of $30,000 a year, he said.
Advocates for people with autism are glad to see the increased focus on intervention in a population that can't speak for themselves.
``Because of their poor ability to communicate, (children with autism) tend to be misunderstood and pushed aside,'' said Audrey Horne, president of the Autism Society of America.
``But they are treatable and educable.''

It was a remarkable development for a girl who for years had been rousing her parents at 4 a.m.

After a long and contentious hearing in Congress Thursday, Republican and Democratic leaders in the House Government Reform committee, who agreed on little else, agreed to ask the Department of Health and Human Services to set up an extensive, impartial study of whether vaccination may cause a small number of causes of autism.
The agreement came after arguments among witnesses and sparring between leaders of the House Government Reform Committee, in which the hearing was held.
The hearing was called by Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind.
, whose granddaughter has autism, and who believes she may have got it from a vaccine _ even though current research has not found any connection between getting vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella, and the onset of the brain disorder, autism.
Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the ranking minority leader on the committee, prodded witnesses and complained to Burton that the hearing was unfairly stacked to show a connection.
He said that while getting the science right was important, in this case getting parents to mistrust vaccines would certainly lead to deaths from diseases society has mostly beaten.
Mainstream medical organizations and leaders in the field of immunization agree that there is no convincing evidence for the theory that the vaccine called MMR _ measles, mumps and rubella _ causes autism, a brain disorder characterized by an inability to socialize and a tendency to engage in constantly repeated actions or comments.
The leading proponent of the idea that MMR vaccine may cause some cases of autism is Dr.
Andrew Wakefield of the Royal Free and University College Medical School in London.
He said he took his cue from parents whose experience of autism seemed to be different than the usual.
The disease is suspected in most cases of being genetic, and it appears gradually in the first two years of life as a failure to speak, the beginning of repetitive motions, and a withdrawal from social interaction.
But the parents Wakefield dealt with said it came on rather suddenly, over a period of months, and often just after vaccination with the triple vaccine.
The signature symptoms, he reports, are bowel pain, inflammation and erratic bowel habits, in children who also begin to show the usual mental symptoms of autism.
Wakefield has published studies on a dozen such cases, and will soon publish reports on another 60.
He said there is some suggestive laboratory work, as well, but the chief message he said was: ``Here is something we need to study''.
On the opposite side, apart from the skepticism of most of the medical community, is Dr.
Brent Taylor, a senior colleague of Wakefield at the same London Medical School.
Taylor has done the largest and best-controlled study to date on the subject, of 498 autistic children in London.
He found no relation between the children's vaccination dates and the onset of their disease.
The disease is usually diagnosed when retarded development shows up in the first two years of life; vaccination usually is done at about 16 months of age; Parents and doctors noticing the two coming together could be coincidental, he suggests.
Burton said that whatever the case with most autism, ``We owe it to our children and grandchildren to ensure we're being diligent in looking for causes of autism.
We can't stick our heads in the sand and ignore the possibility''.
Among the parents who told their stories, and who became teary-eyed along with most in the packed hearing room was Shelly Reynolds of Baton Rouge.
She said her son Liam was the normal bubbly child who would sing `itsy bitsy spider,' and chime in with Eieio on `Old McDonald'.
But within days of his vaccination, she said, he became either unruly or spaced-out, and lost his ability to speak and interact.
She told the committee that you cannot miss such sudden awful and sudden changes if you are a parent.
``Parents like me are relying on you to demand that the pharmaceutical companies retrace their steps once again, and the public health community look at the possibility that these things might not be a coincidence''.
Complicating the whole question, and making it more urgent at the same time, is the dramatic rise in the reporting of autism in several countries, including the United States.
In the 1960s, various estimates suggested there were about one to four cases of autism for every 10,000 children.
By the 1990s, the numbers had shot up more than four-fold to 12 per 10,000 in England, and two-to-five fold in different studies in the U.S.
But it is unclear whether the increase is due to increased reporting of the disease, which has become much better known in recent years, especially after the film `Rain Man' about an autistic man.
After listening to exchanges of scientific details for two hours, Waxman read the language of a proposed letter to the secretary of Health and Human Services asking for an impartial study of the question; Burton agreed to co-sign it, but added that he will continue to dog the issue with further hearings until better answers are forthcoming.
The only thing more puzzling than autism itself is why it appears to be on the rise.
Grasping at clues, researchers and parents have come up with a variety of theories _ many of them at odds with one another.
But so far, the answer remains as inaccessible as the patients themselves.
The most likely explanation is that there are multiple causes, and that some interaction between genetic and environmental factors causes brain development to go awry.
Proposed triggers range from milk or wheat allergies to viruses or environmental toxins.
Many children with autism, for example, have digestive problems, including food allergies, a phenomenon that has given rise to the ``rogue peptide'' theory.
The idea is that children who have trouble digesting wheat gluten or cow's milk create peptides that mimic natural hormones or neurotransmitters.
When these rogue peptides get into the brain, they interfere with normal development.
Other theories postulate that autism develops after something triggers an autoimmune response in the brain.
One recent study, for example, found that the autistic children who had antibodies to the measles virus in their blood also had higher levels of antibodies to their own brain tissue, particularly to a protein found in myelin, the substance that forms the protective sheath around nerve fibers.
The viral connection has been fueled by anecdotal evidence from parents whose children first showed autistic symptoms after being immunized with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which is usually given between 12 and 15 months.
So far, however, no scientific studies have been able to link vaccines and autism.
According to a recent report in the British medical journal Lancet, for example, the incidence of autism in the United Kingdom has been increasing since 1979.
The MMR vaccine was introduced in 1988, but there was no sharp increase in cases of autism after that.
In addition, the average age of onset of autism is the same for children whether they have been vaccinated or not, further weakening a proposed link between the vaccine and the disorder.
But parents are still worried, and researchers acknowledge the question needs further study.
Although the debate surrounding viruses continues, there is some definitive evidence that outside agents can cause autism.
For example, it is known that babies whose mothers took the anti-nausea drug thalidomide at 28 days' gestation have a much higher incidence of autism.
Autism also has been associated with children born to mothers who were given drugs to control their epilepsy, said Dr.
Alan Unis, associate professor of psychiatry at the UW.
Those examples suggest the development of autism is foreshadowed in the earliest stages of embryonic brain development.
There may be many more unknown agents that could cause such damage.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, have been investigating whether an unusually high incidence of autism in Brick Township, N.J., could be related to environmental causes, or is simply a statistical artifact.
There have been 40 cases of autism diagnosed among the 6,000 3- to 10-year-old children living in the township, a rate that is at least triple the estimated national average.
Whatever the cause, the overall rise in the incidence of autism nationally has been dramatic.
``It's very difficult to estimate prevalence,'' Dawson said.
``Twenty years ago, we said 4 or 5 out of 10,000.
Today, we say 1 in 500 or 1,000.
``We don't know if the increase in prevalence is accounted for entirely by diagnostic methods getting better, or whether there is an (actual) increase''.
Clinicians, however, say the increase is real.
``Absolutely, it's becoming more common,'' said psychology professor Eric Trupin who heads the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Children's Hospital in Seattle.
And some parents say the many competing theories don't have to be mutually exclusive.
``Autism causes such a broad spectrum (of symptoms),'' said Audrey Horne, president of the Autism Society of America and parent of a 31-year-old son with autism.
``There has to be more than one cause.''
Repligen Corp.
said Wednesday that secretin, its drug to treat autism, does not appear to work after a single injection, although company officials predicted that more positive results will appear with higher doses.
The Needham, Mass.
biotechnology company said the New England Journal of Medicine will publish Thursday a study by a North Carolina group that independently tested the drug on 18 patients.
``A single dose of synthetic human secretin is not an effective treatment for autism or pervasive developmental disorder,'' the study concluded.
Repligen, which owns the drug, was not involved in the evaluation but plans to launch its own test early next year with about 100 autistic children taking multiple doses over three or four months.
Repligen stock closed Wednesday at 3 3/16, up 3/16.
Autism affects 500,000 Americans and is a disorder in which a young child cannot develop normal social relationships.
There are no drugs to directly treat the disorder, although in some cases drugs are used to control aggressive and self-destructive behavior.
Many autistic youngsters also suffer from gastrointestinal problems such as repeated diarrhea.
Repligen maintains that multiple doses _ not the single dose results chronicled in the New England Journal of Medicine _ will lead to changes in behavior.
``Kids whose diarrhea disappears in 48 hours after taking secretin tend to have normal stools and very often this leads to improvement in autistic symptoms, such as better eye contact, improved communications and trailing after siblings,'' said Walter C.
Herlihy, Repligen president and chief executive, officer whose 8-year-old daughter Lilian is autistic.
He explained that in March, a Wall Street Journal article revealed some promising results based on anecdotal evidence from over 1,000 autistic patients who had used secretin as an experimental drug.
Those findings prompted a group of investors in Ashville, N.C. to sponsor a formal clinical trial.
However, they relied on a single dose of secretin with four weeks of observation.
``What they did is analogous to measuring behavioral changes in an Alzheimer patient with one dose of a drug,'' said Herlihy.
``We have always said a single dose does not produce significant results.''
When news broke a few months ago that Seattle would become one of two places in the country doing federally funded research on an experimental treatment for autism, the researchers were deluged with calls.
Fifty-one slots.
Four hundred families.
The overwhelming response is an indication of how desperate families are for something that works better than available methods.
Hopes surrounding secretin, a natural digestive hormone that may help treat autism, have been building since two parents accidentally discovered that the hormone appeared to help their autistic child.
In 1996, Victoria and Gary Beck of New Hampshire went to a gastrointestinal specialist to help diagnose some digestive difficulties in their autistic son, Parker.
The doctor injected the boy with porcine secretin, a hormone commonly used to assess gastrointestinal problems.
Shortly after the doctor's visit, Parker's autistic traits began improving dramatically.
He went from being non-verbal before the injection to saying words.
Initially, the Becks had to fight with skeptical doctors to get them to acknowledge that secretin might have had something to do with the results.
The biological explanation is not as far-fetched as it might seem.
On a basic level, the ``purpose of the brain is to keep the stomach full,'' said Dr.
Alan Unis, professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington.
The brain and the gut communicate with each other.
``They need to have a common language,'' Unis said.
Secretin, which binds to receptors in both the gut and the brain, could form that link.
It is plausible that altering secretin levels could affect brain function.
It has not taken much convincing for other parents.
Publicity about the Becks story has fueled worldwide demand for the hormone, creating shortages and driving up prices.
That worried the National Institutes of Health.
Although secretin is approved for use as a one-time injection as a diagnostic agent for stomach problems, it hasn't yet been approved for multiple injections as a therapeutic agent.
Concerned that children were being given an untried drug with unknown results, the NIH expedited a clinical trial to study the drug's potential.
The Seattle group is testing a preparation similar to that used in the Becks' case.
The preparation, derived from pigs, is about 60 percent secretin and 40 percent unknown ``pig gut'' ingredients.
Researchers are also testing a pure, synthesized version of secretin.
The purpose of including both is to rule out the possibility that some other unknown compound in the porcine secretin preparation is having an effect.
Each child will get one injection of secretin or a placebo and be evaluated for effects one month later.
Researchers expect to have preliminary results in about six months.
Children began receiving the injections late last month.
However high the hopes, experts warn that secretin is not the first treatment to look promising.
``Autism has a terrible history of wild cures,'' said Eric Trupin, a UW psychology professor who is also director of the child and adolescent psychiatry at Children's Hospital in Seattle.
Some work for a few families.
None seems to work for all.
Most have not been scientifically tested.
``We are a very vulnerable group,'' said Audrey Horne, president of the Autism Society of America.
``Most parents, there's not a thing they wouldn't do if they thought it would cure their child''.
That has led to a parade of treatments, including megavitamins, special diets, auditory training, ``holding therapy'' and swimming with dolphins.
Such treatments gain footholds in part because there is a powerful ``placebo effect'' at work.
Parents are often so hopeful for results, they see them where objective observers would not.
Researchers have seen hopes raised by drugs before.
In the 1980s, fenfluramine, a drug that reduces the blood level of serotonin, was being touted as a wonder drug for autism.
About one-third of children with autism have higher than normal levels of serotonin, another chemical that acts in both the digestive system and the brain.
Initial optimism about the drug faded after studies failed to find beneficial effects.
So far, secretin seems promising.
Researchers caution, however, that although it is tempting to hope for a pill or a shot that will make autism go away, the reality is likely to be much more complicated.
Based on anecdotal reports, secretin seems to have some beneficial effect in about half the families that try it, Unis said.
It may be that there is a subtype of autism that responds to secretin.
Frustrated by the lack of scientific backing for many treatments, parents have begun organizing to raise money and press for better research.
In addition to lobbying for more research funding, the Cure Autism Now Foundation also has established a gene bank of ``multiplex'' families with more than one autistic child to help speed the identification of genes associated with autism.
In just over three years, the bank has enrolled 465 families, creating an unrivaled genetic data bank for researchers.
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.
, who has a grandson with autism, has co-sponsored legislation to earmark $46.5 million for autism research.
The legislation failed this fall, but autism advocates have vowed to redouble their efforts to get the funding this spring.
Better understanding of the disease is likely to lead to better treatments, Horne said.
``With autism, we're just beginning to come out of the dark ages.''
ATLANTA _ Aside from Hollywood's sometimes inaccurate portrayal of autism, few people know much about the disorder.
A gathering this week in Atlanta sponsored by the Autism Society of America, ``2000 National Conference on Autism: Celebrating Our Future,'' is focusing on treatment options, research and the incidence of autism.
The conference continues through Wednesday.
``We hope to bring in 1,000 attendees, and, hopefully, people will have a better understanding about autism at the end of the conference,'' said Vernell Henry, director of conferences for the society.
Parents and people whose family members are affected by autism are the target group of the conference, which is organized around five areas: communications; education; family and community; medicine and research; and options for adulthood and independence.
Autism was previously thought to affect one in 500 people, but the number is actually closer to one in 250, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Here are some frequently asked questions about the disorder, with answers by the Autism Society of America: Q: What is autism?
A: Autism is a complex developmental disease that is four times more prevalent in boys than girls.
It affects the normal development of the brain in the areas of social interaction and communication skills.
No one knows what the cause of autism is.
It knows no racial, ethnic or social boundaries.
Adults and children living with autism usually have difficulty with verbal and nonverbal communication, and leisure or play activities.
In some cases, aggressive and self-injurious behavior may be present.
They may exhibit repeated body movements, such as hand flapping and rocking, unusual responses to people or attachments to objects and resistance to changes in routine.
Some people with autism may also have other disorders that affect functioning of the brain such as epilepsy, mental retardation and Down syndrome.
They may also have genetic disorders such as Tourette's syndrome or Williams syndrome.
Q: What causes autism?
A: Current research links autism to biological or neurological differences in the brain, but no specific cause.
Autism is not a mental illness.
It is not caused by bad parenting, and children with autism are not kids who choose to misbehave.
Q: What are some of the treatments?
A: Studies show that individuals with autism respond well to highly structured, specialized education programs tailored to their needs.
Early intervention leads to better results.
Q: Is there a way to diagnose autism?
A: There are no medical tests.
Accurate diagnoses should be based on observation of an individual's communication, behavior and developmental levels.
Signs of autism typically appear during the first three years of life.
Q: Should parents shelter their children once it is determined they have autism?
A: ``It is very important that children be kept close to other developing children,'' said Gail McGee, director of the autism center at Emory University.
Parents should push for children's inclusion in normal social activities to induce growth and development in that area, she said.

It's time, once again, for the screaming.
Evan O'Neal, 4, ambles into an examination room at the Southwest Autism Research Center cradling a worn Big Bird.
His other hand, as usual, hangs from his mouth like a large extra tooth.
As he's hoisted onto the table for an injection to test secretin, the drug his parents hope will cure his autism, Evan explodes with a piercing, sirenlike scream.
His father drapes his body over the writhing boy.
The doctor with the needle hums in a soothing baritone.
Evan's mother strokes his forehead.
Evan stops long enough for a couple of mucus-choked coughs.
Then, he screams again.
As Evan flails, the needle pops out.
As the doctors and nurses scramble to reinsert it, Evan's arms come free and he grabs his father as if his neck were the last life preserver on a sinking ship.
Evan's mother, Mary, also draped over her son, starts singing the alphabet.
His father, Benton, joins in.
So do the nurses and doctors.
``Is it working''? one asks.
Another responds, half-jokingly, ``I don't know about him, but it's comforting for us''.
The five-minute procedure seems to last a day.
Finally, his parents rip off the Velcro restraints.
Dazed and red-eyed, Evan grabs Big Bird and wanders off to a playroom.
``God,'' someone says, ``I hope he got the real thing''.
&QL; &QC; Evan is one of the lucky ones.
Out of hundreds of candidates, he was one of 30 Valley children selected for the double-blind test.
Two-thirds of the kids got secretin, the drug that many believe will cure the enigma that is autism.
More and more families are suffering its heartbreaking effects.
Their babies are born seemingly typical; then, within two or three years, they stop looking Mom and Dad in the eye, they stop making sense when they talk.
Some stop communicating at all.
In some profound way, autism throws a child's world out of balance.
Either the child becomes overly sensitive and withdrawn, or nothing stimulates him and he become disengaged.
Everything, it seems, is too much or too little.
Such children can't distinguish their grandparents from strangers.
They can't look forward to Christmas or make best friends.
Hardly ever do they say, ``I love you, Mommy''.
They wear weighted vests in preschool play circles to keep their bodies, at least, from wandering off.
They scream when movie theater lights go down.
They live in houses without doorknobs.
Houses where playmates never come to visit.
Yet, physically, they look like other children.
How do you so completely lose your child who's right there, nestled in your arms?
So, parents cling to the idea that there ``is'' an answer, that it will take only one good nudge to bring their child back.
And, like Mary O'Neal, they pray that secretin is that nudge.
&QL; &QC; Evan's day begins with a ritual to reinforce that he's part of this world.
While her son is still in his pajamas, O'Neal firmly massages his arms and legs.
Then, she gently pushes up against his bones.
Some with autism get too much stimulation.
It's like living with a headful of stereo speakers and a psychedelic light show, so they turn off their senses and seem blank.
But other autistic children, like Evan, have too little sensitivity.
Evan once grabbed a cactus and got a palmful of needles; he didn't cry.
His eardrum burst; he didn't cry.
As O'Neal presses against her son's pale skin, she sings softly.
He never looks at her.
He wiggles down into his parents' dark green comforter.
His back is rigid, his head cocked.
He listens intently to something no one else hears.
When the 45-minute massage is done, Evan skitters across the room, his arms flapping to continue the stimulation.
The flapping is so typical that parents and researchers call it ``stimming''.
Evan never played with any of his toys, O'Neal recalls.
But he loved carrying around his father's blow dryer and listening to the noise.
``He thought that was the greatest thing since cream cheese,'' she says.
When Evan was 2, his pediatrician delivered a diagnosis that sounded more like a life sentence.
``She spent 20 minutes with him and closed her book and said to us, `Well, I think he is autistic, probably mentally retarded.
You should probably be aware of the fact that you will have to put him in an institution someday,' '' O'Neal says.
Instead, the O'Neals have tried to outfox the diagnosis.
They've eliminated wheat and cow's milk from Evan's diet.
Added vitamins.
Attended support groups.
Consulted doctors and more doctors.
Analyzed and reanalyzed his urine.
Searched the Internet.
Second-guessed themselves.
Gone through physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy.
They've turned their living room into a gym.
And now, Mary O'Neal, 39, watches her younger son, Tim, for signs of autism.
The risk of having a second autistic child is about one in 20.
At the breakfast counter, O'Neal leans into Evan's face.
``Where's Tim''? she coos.
Evan points to his brother.
Delighted, her face nearly splits with a grin.
``This is a high,'' she says.
Then she asks, ``Where's Mommy''?
He points to her.
Then she asks, ``Where's Evan''?
His gaze wanders off.
``Our highs are so high,'' O'Neal says.
That's because everything is such a struggle.
Evan doesn't like things near his face, so he can stand to have only half of his teeth brushed at a time.
He doesn't like mushy foods.
He screams when he touches Play-Doh.
He's never been calm enough to eat at McDonald's.
``At times, I would give my right (arm) not to do this,'' O'Neal says.
``You know, I used to take the easy way out.
I was a follower, not a leader, but I can't be that way anymore.
I am his advocate, and I cannot let him down''.
So now, she spends her days trying to get her son potty-trained.
``Sure he's cute now,'' she says.
``But no one is going to want to change his diapers when he's 18''.
Evan doesn't speak, emitting only an undulating warble when he's excited or happy.
But he can grab the picture cards attached to objects throughout the house to indicate when he wants to watch a video.
Even the smallest payoffs demand vast patience.
Evan can now dunk a ball into a hoop 4 feet off the ground.
``It took us a year to do that,'' his mother says proudly, sadly.
&QL; &QC; ``What's going to set them off''?
Karen Jason wonders as she waits for her two kids after school.
Jason carries that worry around all day, starting at 6 a.m. when she hides their shoes and socks in the trunk of her car.
If they saw them, they'd throw a fit and never leave the house.
Despite her best efforts, something goes awry.
Instead of getting off the school bus and running toward her, 6-year-old Sean runs the opposite way.
He's like a hummingbird with a snootful of caffeine.
Running behind a pole, zigzagging across the parking lot, completely unmindful of people and cars.
Jason, her face flushed, chases him, scoops him up and gives him a piggy-back ride.
It does no good to scold him; words ricochet off.
Jason speaks deliberately.
``Sean, Sean.
We have to get into the car.
Rebecca is waiting for us''.
Even though onlookers are fascinated by the spectacle, Rebecca pays it no mind.
At 8, Sean's big sister doesn't have an ounce of girlishness or silliness.
She gives off no sparks, no spasms of giggles or tears.
She is purposeful as she plays, her mouth set in a straight line that almost never bends.
This is Karen Jason's family: Sean, the rambunctious 6-year-old with the mind of a 3-year-old, and Rebecca, quiet and aloof but considered high-functioning because she communicates more easily.
With both of her children diagnosed as autistic, ``in my world, it's autism that is normal,'' Jason says.
To live in her world, you have to know the language.
What Jason calls ``video talk'' is the only way Sean communicates.
When someone gets angry at him, Sean puts his fist in the person's face and says, ``Will this help''?
It's not a threat, it's a line from ``The Prince and the Pauper'' when Mickey Mouse shows his regal ring and is released from his captors.
At times, translation is more difficult.
Once Jason made an unexpected potty stop.
Because they were in an elementary school after hours, Sean's words echoed in the hallway.
Sean started roaring.
To Jason, it made sense.
The echoing made the same sounds as ``Once Upon A Forest,'' a favorite dinosaur movie.
But his roaring was so loud that the school staff gave them dirty looks as they left the bathroom.
After she told them he was autistic, they apologized.
``But I told them, `Thanks for the look,' '' Jason says.
An elementary school teacher, Jason knows it's a gamble to take her kids out.
Once interested in something, they become fixated.
After spending six hours in a Disney store, they want to stay and will scream like extras in a horror movie when it's time to leave.
When Sean wants reassurance, he'll rush over to Jason and wiggle his head into her thigh.
``He craves that kind of pressure,'' his mother says.
``Of course, it looks really weird''.
Jason knows she must get her kids out of their usual life with its built-in eccentricities _ Sean must have his right sock and shoe on before putting on his left sock.
She's got to get them into the real world.
So, damn the dirty looks, full speed ahead.
She's enrolled them in special baseball programs and had them in talent shows.
She takes them grocery shopping even though the trips take twice as long and often end up in temper tantrums.
At times, Jason will sneak into her son's room and rearrange his two dozen stuffed animals, just to provoke him into communication.
``You've got to pick your battles,'' she says.
Some nights, she lets them interrupt dinner for the umpteenth time to make sure the computer screen hasn't gone blank.
``Everything is so regimented because they like it that way,'' Jason says.
``Life has glitches, and they have to get used to it''.
&QL; &QC; Karen Jason sits expectantly in the center's waiting room as children like Evan O'Neal scream while getting shots.
The expectation level is so feverish that the waiting room feels like a prayer hall.
Sean, playing with his omnipresent stuffed-animal gang, is oblivious of the other children's screams.
Rebecca, as suspicious as an old woman, frets around the room.
For so long, Jason has been doing the best she can _ coping, praying, cajoling, crying.
``Could this drug actually help them''? she wonders, for the thousandth time.
``Is this what they need''? &QL;
WASHINGTON _ Many parents of autistic children haven't been happy with Sen.
Slade Gorton since he proposed making it easier for teachers to suspend from school unruly disabled children.
Gorton, R-Wash.
, isn't backing off his position that schoolteachers need more disciplinary tools to restore order in the classroom, but Wednesday he took another step that drew praise from families of autistic children.
Joined by ``ER'' star Anthony Edwards and former Seattle Mariners pitcher Bill Krueger, Gorton and Rep.
James Greenwood, R-Penn.
, said they would introduce legislation to focus more money and attention on autism research, much of which is conducted at the University of Washington.
The bill would set up five centers for autism research around the country.
Most of those supporting the bill have been touched by autism in some way.
Gorton Wednesday for the first time mentioned publicly that he has an autistic grandson; Edwards has an autistic nephew, Krueger an autistic daughter, and Greenwood worked with autistic children as a social worker before he was elected to Congress.
Infantile autism is a severe neurological disorder appearing in childhood that is characterized by an inability to relate to others, highly repetitive play, and language impairment.
Autism is the third most common developmental disorder among children.
An estimated 400,000 people in this country suffer from the disease.
Gorton called autism ``one of the most common disabling conditions with which children are afflicted, but one that the physicians and the scientists and the researchers tell us can in fact be cured, and is not something that we simply must accept.
``A very significant amount of fine research has already been accomplished, much of it at the University of Washington, and what we would like to do is expand that research across the country, see to it that the researchers are able to work together and share their results, and to try to see that they have sufficient amounts of money and facilities with which to conduct it,'' Gorton said.
The University's Center on Human Development and Disability, funded in part by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, is conducting research aimed at early detection of autism and at understanding the role of genetic factors in autism.
In addition to the autism research centers, the bill would create a greater role for parents in the National Institutes of Health funding decisions, a gene and tissue bank of autism materials, and a national autism awareness program.
The bill, which sets aside $40 million for autism research over the next year, was pushed by an organization called Cure Autism Now, which was started by Jonathan Shestack, the producer of ``Air Force One,'' and his wife, Portia Iversen.
Scientists for the first time have discovered what they believe may be biological markers in the blood of newborn infants who later develop autism and mental retardation.
The markers consist of abnormally high levels of four brain chemicals that help construct the basic architecture of animal brains, researchers said.
The finding supports what many experts believe may be the root cause of both autism and mental retardation: faulty wiring present from birth.
The discovery, presented by scientists at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in San Diego, still needs to be replicated in larger studies.
But if it proves true, it could open the door to new opportunities for treating these devastating mental disorders that affect as many as six out of every 1,000 newborns.
If doctors can screen for autism and mental retardation at birth, scientists say, affected babies could be given special early enrichments or drugs designed to help their brains develop more normally.
The research, described for the first time publicly Wednesday by Dr.
Karin B.
Nelson, a neurologist at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Md.
, was carried out by that institute in collaboration with the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program in Berkeley and George Washington University Medical Center in Washington.
Nelson said in a telephone interview that the study was in the process of being submitted to a scientific journal.
The new work ``is really exciting,'' said Dr.
David Amaral, a neuroscientist at the University of California at Davis and a leading expert on neurodevelopmental disorders, who was not involved in the study.
The world of autism research is littered with false hopes, he said, but this could bring new ways of attacking the problem at a basic scientific level.
``If this study can be replicated and confirmed, it will be very important,'' said Dr.
Eric Courchesne, an autism expert at the University of California in San Diego.
People have been looking for triggers, like measles vaccinations, to help explain the onset of autism symptoms, he said.
But this study suggests that the defects may be present much earlier and it certainly ``stimulates new ideas about the cause of these disorders,'' he said.
Still, it could turn out that these brain proteins ``are not predictive of anything,'' said Dr.
Edwin Cook, a psychiatrist and autism expert at the University of Chicago.
``The work is exciting and I hope it's correct,'' he said, but the fact that four proteins are elevated ``does not mean there is one simple pathway'' in the brain to explain these disorders.
Researchers have long suspected that autism and mental retardation are caused by faulty brain wiring or abnormal brain chemistry that are present from birth, Nelson said.
But this notion has been very difficult to prove because the main symptoms of the disorders, severe social withdrawal in autism and low IQ in mental retardation, are generally not diagnosed until children are around 3 years old.
There has never been a way to identify the babies who might have these brain abnormalities and so researchers have not been able study the problem early in life.
The latest findings are the result of a collaboration of researchers from three scientific disciplines: neurochemistry, epidemiology and analytical immunochemistry.
Neurochemists have identified many brain proteins that help cells survive, make connections between cells and lay the basis for learning and memory, Nelson said.
The thinking was that some of these molecules might be involved in autism and mental retardation, but which ones remained a mystery.
``We chose eight of them,'' Nelson said, ``and went on a fishing expedition''.
The ``fishing'' took place at the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program, which is in Berkeley.
The program, established nearly 20 years ago, takes and preserves blood samples from one in seven babies born in California each year and uses the blood to help track down causes of birth defects.
For example, the program recently helped show a link between babies born with cleft palates and mothers who smoked cigarettes.
The blood samples are stored in a warehouse and can be fetched any time epidemiologists have questions to explore, said Dr.
John Harris, director of the program.
In this case, staff members in the program went to clinics in Northern California and located teen-agers _ 64 with autism, 66 with an IQ below 50 but no autism, 65 with cerebral palsy and 54 normal controls.
All the teen-agers were born between 1983 and 1985 and all had blood samples stored in the warehouse.
The samples were sent to Dr.
Terry Phillips, an immunochemist at George Washington University and at the Office of Research Services at the National Institutes of Health who uses sophisticated new techniques to fish tiny amounts of proteins out of blood samples.
Four of the brain proteins looked the same in all the teen-agers, he said.
But the other four _ vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), calcitonin-related gene peptide (CGRP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT4) _ were extremely high in nearly all the autistic and mentally retarded teen-agers.
None of the controls and fewer than 10 percent of those with cerebral palsy had elevated levels of these proteins, he said.
High levels of these four proteins are like ``smoking guns'' present at birth in the brains of infants who go on to develop autism and mental retardation in early childhood, the researchers said.
While these disabilities have many manifestations and run a gamut from severe to mild, they often overlap, Nelson said.
Too much or too little of these brain chemicals at different points in development could help explain the spectrum seen in so many children.
Nelson stressed several caveats: that the findings would have to be replicated using other groups of children, that the technique used for testing blood was new and not widely available and that more work needed to be done to show exactly what was normal and not normal in regard to these proteins at birth.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn But researchers who are familiar with the four proteins said the finding was highly provocative given what was known about them.
For example, Dr.
Douglas Brenneman, chief of the section on developmental and molecular pharmacology at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, said one protein, VIP, was akin to a master molecule used for ``putting brains together''.
It exerts powerful effects on at least a dozen brain chemicals, including the other three identified in this study, he said.
Early in development, fetuses get VIP from the mother's immune cells.
After birth, the baby makes VIP in parts of the brain that underlie cognition, learning and memory and also in other parts of the body, including the intestines, where it dilates tissues.
Secretin, a digestive hormone that is being given to many autistic children with the hope that it will alleviate their behavioral problems, is in the VIP family, Brenneman said.
But there is no evidence that VIP-like substances from the intestines can ever get into the brain, he said.
Nearly every controlled clinical trial of secretin has failed to show that the hormone works as claimed, Amaral said.
On the other hand, there could be ``brain and gut interactions'' that are not yet understood.
This finding about biological markers ``opens the barn door wide open to look for deeper causes of autism and mental retardation,'' Harris said.
``Until now, we didn't even know this barn door was there.''
On the outside, the Brestler house looks like any number of gracious Eastside homes for a growing family with three children.
On the inside, it's a little different.
But it's not obvious at first.
There are invisible alarms on all the doors here, to keep children from wandering away.
And what looks like a well-appointed playroom is really a fully equipped behavioral therapy center.
The Brestlers have three boys.
The two youngest have autism.
Max, 8, and Kevin, 6, look like typical children.
Inside, they are a little different.
And it isn't always obvious at first.
They, too, have ``invisible alarms'' locking away parts of their brains.
The brain disorder interferes with their ability to develop language and form relationships.
Even a few years ago, the fact the Brestlers have two boys with the disease would have seemed an almost unfathomable coincidence.
Today, researchers believe there is a strong genetic component to autism, which is three to four times more common in boys than girls.
The odds are about 1-in-20 that a family with one child with autism will have another.
That's 50 to 100 times the rate expected in the general population.
That indicates a high genetic component to autism, said Geraldine Dawson, professor of psychology and director of the autism project at the University of Washington.
``We believe at least five genes are involved''.
In studies of identical twins in which one twin has autism, the chance of the other twin being affected is about 70 percent.
In fraternal twins _ those who do not share identical genetic status _ the chances that the second twin will also be autistic is about 5 percent.
When Max was first diagnosed at age 2, Linda Brestler had no idea she would soon face a second loss.
But she was already worried about Kevin, still under a year, who at 10 months had such low muscle tone he could not hold his head up and was not crawling.
She remembers reading the book ``Let Me Hear Your Voice,'' a book by a mother of two autistic children.
``When I got to the section where her second son was diagnosed, I threw the book across the room,'' she said.
``It was mind-boggling, the thought I could possibly have two.
I remember rocking Kevin, saying, `Please, God, don't take him away from me, too'''.
But rearing Max and Kevin has given her a different perspective.
``People lose the idea they're just kids,'' Brestler said.
``You forget, they're regular kids before they're autistic''.
And like regular kids, Max and Kevin are as different from each other as any two siblings.
Dark-haired Max doesn't speak.
He struggles to move his tongue to form sounds.
The shapes of words elude him.
About one-third of children with autism remain mute.
``Are you hungry, Max''? his mother asks.
``Ahh''. Soft, plaintive.
Max's way of saying yes.
Even though he doesn't talk, his receptive language _ ability to understand _ is near normal.
Max has a shy smile, a tentative walk.
He doesn't like long hair, or the feel of grass under his feet.
``He has a thing about textures,'' says Bridgette Tuttle, one of his therapists.
He is afraid of stairs.
Max was about 18 months old when his parents first noticed he was losing eye contact.
``He was withdrawing, and we started questioning his hearing because he wasn't responding to his name,'' Brestler said.
The word autism never entered her mind.
Doctors told her to watch and wait.
The more she waited, the more nervous she got.
Eventually, she looked autism up in a medical dictionary.
``It was a three-line definition,'' she said.
``Everything fit Max.
``The first year of life, they're developing seemingly normally,'' she said.
``Then that second year, you just lose them; it's quite devastating''.
Six years later, Max is taking a break from his daily regimen of behavioral therapy.
He sits in a small rocker, fading in and out.
Occasionally, his hands dart together in quick claps.
He has an obsession with rectangles, especially videotape boxes.
He likes to hold them, turning them slowly in his hands, or incessantly rearranging them.
Brestler redirects him every few minutes with a question.
The questions get him out of his ``self-stimming,'' the slang parents of autistic children use to describe the range of baffling, repetitive behaviors that steal their children's attention away from the world.
Kevin, in contrast, is the lively, social one.
On this day, he hurtles across the family room into his mother's lap.
The room is strewn with soft-cover books, their bindings curled.
He doesn't read them.
They are a ``self-stimming'' object, like his brother's videotapes.
Unlike his brother, Kevin was a social baby who made good eye contact.
``But motorwise (as a baby), he was starting to have problems,'' Brestler said.
``He presented very differently (than Max)''.
Today, Kevin is verbal, although he mainly talks to himself.
He responds to simple commands and questions, but can't engage in conversation.
He doesn't understand as much language as Max.
One of the hardest things about having two children with autism is the misconceptions people have about the disorder, Brestler says.
It's not true, for example, that children with autism aren't affectionate, or can't learn, or are completely out of touch with reality, she said.
She has seen otherwise.
It has taken 20 hours a week of therapy for nearly six years, but Max finally has grasped the intent of language, and communicates by pointing in a book of photographs to his favorite foods and activities.
He has worked his way up to about 10 sounds.
``He says, `Aah uuh ooh,''' she said.
``It means `I love you.'''
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A new test aimed at helping doctors predict whether newborn children will develop autism or mental retardation confirms that such disorders are present at birth and are not the result of nurturing, researchers said.
Autism likely arises from a combination of genetic defects and exposure to toxic chemicals, viruses or other environmental substances, according to the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program, which is run jointly by the state and the March of Dimes.
The crucial period for such factors is the early weeks of pregnancy as the central nervous system forms, the researchers said.
''I don't use the word breakthrough lightly, but that is what this (test) looks like to me,'' said Dr.
John Harris, chief of the program.
''This could potentially have a huge impact on society''.
The findings, reported Wednesday at a San Diego meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, could lead to better treatment for patients and new ways to prevent the disorders, Harris said.
Experts cautioned that the results have not yet been formally published and reviewed by other scientists.
Some parents believe that autism can be caused by adverse reactions to disease vaccinations because many children develop the first signs of the mental disorder after immunization at 18 months.
A team from the monitoring program examined stored blood samples collected from 249 infants during the 1980s.
The researchers found unusually high levels of four proteins associated with brain development in nearly all the samples from children who later were diagnosed with autism or mental retardation.
None of the proteins appeared in infants who developed normally.
''This really is an exciting finding, but it doesn't mean scientists have a specific test for autism, since mentally retarded children had the same elevated protein levels,'' Dr.
David Amaral said.
Amaral is director of the MIND Institute at the University of California, Davis, which provided part of the funding for the study.
For both mental retardation and autism, this is the first time a clear biological marker has been identified at such an early age, said Walter Herlihy, president of Repligen Corp.
The company is testing a hormone called secretin as a potential treatment for autism.
''I'm going to go back and incorporate this in our clinical trials to see if the markers are present in older children as well,'' he said.
To validate its own research, the monitoring program is preparing to study as many as 5,000 autistic children, said Dr.
Judith K.
Grether, the study's principal researcher.
The findings will be compared to tests of several thousand healthy children serving as a control group, she said.
The validation study is expected to take five years to complete.

WEST WINDSOR, N.J.
_ One family came from India, others from Greece, Italy and Israel.
An Australian family is thinking about coming.
By comparison, Rob and Anne Mandel had it pretty easy, giving up his medical practice and a life they loved in Indiana to get their son, Sam, the help he needed in New Jersey.
Sam is autistic, and his parents' move here made the Mandels part of a phenomenon: families that, desperate for the most sophisticated special education services for their disabled children, have moved from other states and even other nations in search of care.
But, increasingly, the needs of parents with autistic children are clashing with the bottom lines of school districts that have to pay for enormously expensive services _ often more than $40,000 per child per year _ for students who may never set foot in district classrooms, but will be sent to private institutions at a school district's expense.
Most districts are sympathetic to the needs of families, increasingly armed with sophisticated knowledge about programs and treatments, who uproot themselves to get their children the best care.
But many districts, particularly in states like New Jersey with programs that are magnets for families around the country and the world, say schools are bearing too much of the cost with too little control over which children get what care.
``It's driving the suburban school districts crazy,'' said James H.
Lytle, the superintendent of Trenton's public schools.
``If you have eight kids who need to go to a special school, you have to go to your taxpayers for $400,000.
That's essentially like sending them all to Andover''.
Dr. Lytle added, ``I hate the whole thing''.
A 1975 federal law, guarantees a ``free and appropriate public education'' for all disabled students.
But the education available in most places cannot compare with what is offered in states like New Jersey, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, which have the most sophisticated private programs for treating autism.
So families, many of whom share information on the Internet, are increasingly relocating to areas with the best programs.
Total school enrollment in New Jersey grew by 11.8 percent from 1991 to 1997, the most recent year for which comparable figures are available.
The number of disabled students increased by 14 percent.
The number of autistic children registered in New Jersey increased sevenfold, from 234 to 1,634.
Part of the increase may be due to better diagnostic methods or the inclusion of children with behaviors that resemble autism.
But migration obviously plays a major role.
``If you're a parent of a child that has been diagnosed with something like autism, you are not going to wait,'' said Gary S.
Mayerson, a New York lawyer who specializes in representing families battling school districts over care for disabled children.
``You are going to look at your beautiful house and realize that it is a noose around your neck.
So people are moving all over the country to get to states that are most responsive to their child's needs''.
The treatment most in demand for autism is a method known as applied behavioral analysis, a form of highly structured and very expensive one-on-one coaching by trained teachers.
While other treatments try to help youngsters cope with their disabilities, applied behavioral analysis, administered at an early age, offers children the possibility of eventually being able to attend regular classes, its advocates say.
So parents flock to the Princeton Child Development Institute, where Sam Mandel and 34 other students are enrolled, or the Eden Institute, in West Windsor, N.J., or to the Martin C.
Barell School, in Levittown, N.Y.
And they go to the Connecticut Child Development Center in Milford, where a couple from India showed up with their child earlier this month, hoping in vain to gain enrollment even though the school was full, said Suzanne Letso, the school's director.
``I'm a doctor _ I sent people to have sophisticated tests all the time in Indiana,'' Dr.
Mandel, an anesthesiologist, said.
For that reason, he said, ``I thought there was no reason to be closer to New York City to get these sophisticated services for Sam.
But you know what?
There's nothing back there like what we have here''.
For $46,024.20 per year, the Princeton institute provides 10 months of intensive training to help autistic children discover a sense of the rewards of learning that they are born without.
Although they may be capable of brilliant feats of intellect _ think of Dustin Hoffman's character in ``Rain Man'' _ autistic children totally lack both curiosity about the world and the instinct to learn by imitating other children and adults.
Patricia Krantz, director of the Princeton institute, said that half the children who came to her school early enough were sent to regular classrooms within five years.
If people object to paying something like $200,000 to achieve such a goal, she said, they should think of the alternative: a lifetime of institutionalization, ``not to mention the human cost''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn Sam Mandel is making spectacular progress, his parents say.
But for every winner like him, the huge expense of special education programs and the scarcity of places at the most sought-after schools also create losers.
Only a comparative handful of autistic children gain admission to the best private programs, and they tend to be the children of parents with the education and money and careers that permit them to move from state to state and from country to country to seek out those programs.
An engineer in India, for example, researched his child's disability over the Internet and pinpointed Lawrence Township, N.J., as a good place for treatment, said Terry Rosenfeld, Lawrence's director of special education.
Then he found a job at Bell Laboratories in Hopewell, secured the necessary work papers to allow him to immigrate, and moved his family to Lawrence.
Rosenfeld said eight severely handicapped children who had moved to the district to receive treatment were now enrolled.
``We definitely have parents moving in just for these services,'' said Susan DiDonato, director of special services for West Windsor-Plainsboro public schools.
``Sometimes they call ahead and ask us what we have available''.
But the migration and the legal requirements for ``appropriate'' education raise issues of cost and control.
``The parents' definition of appropriate and the district's definition of appropriate are often very different,'' said Rosenfeld.
If the disagreement leads to litigation, ``when you go to court, the courts often look at what parents are saying before they listen to us,'' he added.
``And that is why, to me, I think the system is totally out of control''.
As Rosenfeld suggested, local schools want control over the assignment of students and their education plans, and generally favor local or county-based programs, typically at a local community college.
Parents complain that the local programs, while cheaper, do not offer enough hours of training per week, let alone the special benefits like home visits that places like the Princeton institute offer.
The federal law requires the federal government to to pay 40 percent of a the cost of services provided under the education act.
But the government has never paid his district more than 8 percent, Rosenfeld said.
The state, meanwhile, reimburses school districts on a sliding scale, depending on the severity of the disability, but never more than $11,000 per child.
Some educators, in defense of the special-care migrants, say that parents who relocate should be applauded for placing confidence in their new homes' school systems.
``If anything, we should be proud that we are so successful,'' said Barbara Gantwerk, director of the Office of Special Education Programs at the New Jersey Department of Education.
Indeed, advocates for the children say, the biggest problem is not what it costs to educate such children at the best treatment centers, but that not enough children get that care.
But Rosenfeld, at Lawrence public schools, said he was deeply discouraged over the drain that expensive treatments for a few children were imposing on other programs.
``The parents will do absolutely anything for their children, and it's wonderful that these kids have such great advocates,'' Rosenfeld said.
``But it costs a lot of money, and that money has to come from other programs''.
And for families, everything is secondary to getting results for their children.
So when Tim and Leslie Quinn of Charlotte, N.C., realized their son Ryan, now 4, showed signs of autism, Tim Quinn transferred to his company's headquarters in Hackettstown, N.J.
The Quinns sold their dream house in Charlotte, took their two teen-age daughters out of high school and moved to Belle Meade, in the Hillsborough school district, to enroll Ryan in the Princeton school.
They have no regrets.
``Ryan has shocked us all,'' Quinn said.
``Up until September he was not speaking and he was not doing a lot of things, and it was very discouraging.
But then he started speaking, and he's doing very well.''
LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Sex hormones can influence brain development in the young, memory in the old and may explain why young men tend to develop neurological problems like autism and dyslexia while older women suffer from depression and anxiety, scientists say.
``We are recognizing with some surprise the extent to which the brain responds'' to sex steroids, said Douglas Meinecke of the National Institute of Mental Health in Washington.
``These hormones _ testosterone, progesterone and estrogen _ have profound effects on the brain and the brain is profoundly responsive''.
Meinecke discussed the role of sex hormones in development and aging Monday at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting.
Researchers hope the hormones can be used to fend off the ravages of aging and disease.
Already, estrogen replacement therapy has been observed to protect older women against Alzheimer's disease.
Nancy Forger, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts, said she's found that sex hormones can prevent cell death.
Men have more motor neurons in their spinal cords that govern muscles attached to the penis, she found.
The neurons are found both in men and women before birth; however, in the absence of male hormones, the neurons degenerate in females.
Ms. Forger is trying to learn how male hormones save these cells and understand the role of proteins that regulate growth and survival of neurons.
Margaret McCarthy, a physiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, suggested that early exposure to male hormones can create permanent brain changes.
Testosterone levels in rats are as high in development as they're going to be in adulthood, she said.
Giving a female rat testosterone creates ``a male brain never to be switched back''.
Similarly, if testosterone-producing organs are removed from the male rat, he ends up with a ``female brain,'' she said.
Only male reproductive organs produce sex hormones during development, she said.
Female sex organs, which produce estrogen, are inactive until later.
``As far as we know, it is also true for humans,'' Ms.
McCarthy said.
Asked about male and female brain differences, she noted that boys suffer from more neurological disorders than girls.
They're more likely to have schizophrenia, autism and dyslexia, while girls are more likely to suffer neurological illnesses later in life such as major depression, anxiety disorders, panic disorders or eating disorders.
``This hormonal difference early in life may set up a situation that more easily goes awry and explains why boys are more susceptible at an early age,'' she said.
John Morrison, a neurobiology professor at Mount Sinai Medical School in New York, said his studies of estrogen's effects on a brain region called the hippocampus may shed light on aging.
He has that found the number of receptors on hippocampal cells fluctuates, depending on how much estrogen is present.
``The hippocampus mediates memory and loss of memory is one of the key events to aging,'' he said.
In the first study in the country on the incidence of autism among young children, the Centers for Disease Control confirmed Tuesday that there was a striking number of autism cases in Brick Township, N.J., but found no link between the disorder and environmental factors in the town.
Agency officials, who traveled to Brick Tuesday to report the findings of their yearlong investigation, also said that, while there were no other studies in the United States with which to compare their results, the overall prevalence of autism in the country might be higher than previously believed.
The study in Brick Township, prompted by the suspicions of one couple with two autistic children who noticed many other autistic children in their community, found a rate of 4 children with autism per 1,000 between the ages of 3 and 10.
In the of 72,000 people, 36 children are autistic, the study found.
Some studies in Europe and Asia have indicated that as many as 2 of every 1,000 children have some type of autism, the officials said.
``The rates are higher than we previously thought in this country, and nationwide, they may be more in line with what we found in Brick,'' said Jacquelyn Bertrand, who headed the study.
The CDC's objectives were to verify the number of cases of autism in Brick among the children who lived there during 1998 and to examine whether the disorder was linked to chemicals in the township's drinking water, its former landfill and the Metedeconk River, where some residents swim.
It found no such link.
But the number of cases found surprised some people involved in autism research.
``The CDC's findings are astonishing,'' said Dr.
Eric London, vice president of medical affairs for the National Alliance for Autism Research in Princeton, which funds autism research.
Autism is a disorder that affects a child's ability to communicate and function socially.
It varies in severity and has no known cause and no cure.
The study did not confirm the presence of a ``cluster'' of autism cases, a term used by those who have tried to link high cases of a disorder or disease, such as cancers, to a geographic location and its environment.
But, London said, the study in Brick might indicate there may be more autism cases nationwide than anyone previously believed.
``The fact is that we simply do not have enough data to determine the prevalence of autism in this country,'' London said.
``We do not know if this is an unusually high number or if it is representative of autism prevalence in the United States.
Only through additional research will we be able to evaluate the strikingly high numbers found in Brick to determine if they reflectthe population or if there are disparities in the rates in different geographic areas''.
Officials from the Centers for Disease Control held public meetings all day Tuesday at the Brick Township Municipal Building to inform people of their findings.
At an informal briefing Tuesday night, 30 to 40 people milled about, looking at the yellow and blue research graphics on easels or on the walls and asked questions of officials who wore name tags.
Some in the group were parents of autistic children who said they were disappointed at the scope of the study, which was limited to children who had lived there in one year.
Sheryl and Bob Nichols of West Milford, in Northern New Jersey, came to the meeting because they have a 9-year-old son who is autistic.
Nichols said she had contacted CDC officials to tell them she had lived in Brick Township until she was 20 years old, before she became pregnant with her son, but they did not include her in the study because she did not fit into their parameters.
``I still think it has something to do with the environment,'' Nichols said.
``They just haven't found it.
They didn't even interview us''.
The call for the study of Brick Township's problem began through the actions of Bobbie and William Gallagher, who had two autistic children and found that many other autistic children lived near them.
The Gallaghers, with the help of a few other parents of autistic children, conducted their own rudimentary survey of the histories of these children and became concerned about a possible link between Brick Township's environment and the incidence of autistic births.
Inspired by new findings on the way animal brains develop before and after birth, scientists are developing provocative new theories to explain autism, a mysterious brain abnormality that prevents human infants from developing normal social and cognitive skills.
By studying the anatomy of autistic brains, researchers are trying to figure out when in development and where in the brain the complex interaction of genes and environment causes things to go astray.
In the process, they are learning more about the brain circuitry that gives rise to quintessential human traits like language, empathy and the awareness that other people have beliefs and desires different from one's own.
An entire brain circuit has been compromised in autism, said Dr.
David G.
Amaral, a neuroscientist at the University of California at Davis.
Researchers have only begun to study how different brain regions interact dynamically to give rise to such circuits, he said, which puts autism at the frontier of modern neuroscience.
Autism undermines many aspects of human behavior, including movement, attention, learning, memory, language, mood and social interaction.
It can be detected in the movements of babies who roll over, sit up, crawl and walk in oddly uncoordinated ways.
At 18 months, an autistic toddler will not point, share attention with others or follow the expressions of other people.
By age 2 or 3, autistic children display a profound lack of responsiveness to others.
Many do not talk; instead, they may engage in rituals, like arm flapping, that stimulate their bodies.
They dislike change of any sort.
The symptoms of autism range from mild to severe, making the true incidence of the disorder difficult to assess, said Dr.
Marie Bristol-Power, who coordinates autism research at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md.
Classical autism in its more severe form, which results in mental retardation, occurs in about one in every 1,000 births, she said.
When milder forms of autism like Aspberger's syndrome are included, the incidence is one in 500.
The common feature among all children with autism is a lack of social relatedness.
Some states are reporting what appear to be significant increases in cases of autism, Dr.
Bristol-Power said.
But it is not yet clear if the reports reflect higher incidence of the condition or better diagnosis and the availability of better treatment.
Fifty years ago, researchers believed that autism was caused by cold ``refrigerator'' mothers and weak absent fathers.
Today they are zeroing in on genes.
In identical twins, if one has autism, the second will also have it 90 percent of the time.
At least five or six genes contribute to autism, said Dr.
Bennett Leventhal, director of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Chicago.
Studies thus far of autistic siblings suggest that these genes are on Chromosomes 7, 13 and 15.
What these genes are doing is still anybody's guess.
Studies of developing animal brains have found numerous growth factors and proteins that guide fetal brain cells into making proper connections.
Other genes make factors that act as master switches, turning yet other genes on and off at particular points in development.
Some genes suppress cellular activity while others ramp it up, setting the correct balance of chemicals involved in transmitting brain signals.
After birth, different genes begin to nurse connections while others cause cells to die off in a dynamic dance of growth and pruning.
But the growth and elaboration of the nervous system is a continuous process and if something goes seriously wrong early on, all subsequent development may be disturbed.
The question is, how early and where.
Dr. Patricia M.
Rodier, an embryologist at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, believes that the brain glitch in autism occurs between days 20 and 24 of gestation, before a woman knows she is pregnant.
She has evidence that genes involved in laying down basic body and brain structures, called hox genes, are mutated in autism.
Dr. Margaret L.
Bauman, a neurologist at Harvard Medical School, believes that the defect may occur before the middle of the second trimester of pregnancy.
She bases this theory on her extensive knowledge of how and when certain circuits are wired.
Some cells can be ``missing'' only if the defect occurs midway in fetal development, she said.
But Dr.
Eric Courchesne, a neuroscientist at the University of California at San Diego, said that the problem could just as easily occur after a baby is born and as the brain continues to develop.
In October, researchers identified the precise genetic defect in a disorder, Rett's syndrome, that was once commonly misdiagnosed as autism.
Babies are born and develop normally until they are between about 6 months and 24 months old, when a gene that represses other genes fails to shut down as it should.
As a result, the other genes do not swing into action and children stop growing, wring their hands and become mentally retarded.
Courchesne and other researchers believe a similar process may be at work in autism.
Like other brain researchers, scientists who study autism were startled by recent discoveries that the human brain continues to make new brain cells _ not just new connections, as was previously thought _ well into adulthood.
In fact, one scientist has evidence that the number of neurons in the human brain doubles between birth and 6 years.
If this is true, Courchesne said, the child's brain would be undergoing a huge amount of construction created by the interplay of genes and environment.
It might be, he said, that disturbances in this construction give rise to autism.
nn This theory is supported, some researchers say, by the fact that a quarter of autistic children appear normal until age 14-22 months and then experience the sudden onset of autistic symptoms, said Dr.
Nancy J.
Minshew, a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh.
The onset may be caused by a malfunction in one or more genes, she said.
Or it could be set off by something in the environment interacting with a genetically vulnerable child.
Since 1983, Dr.
Bauman and her colleagues have been studying brain tissue obtained in autopsies from autistic children and adults.
While large areas of the 11 brains they studied look normal, she said, the brains are generally bigger and heavier than most.
Most important, there are abnormalities in three major regions that help control social behavior.
Parts of the frontal lobes, which enable decision-making and planning, are thicker than normal.
Cells in the limbic system, where emotions are processed, are a third smaller than normal and are found in excessive numbers.
The cells are also immature, with stunted connections.
Cells in the cerebellum _ a structure that helps in making predictions about what will happen next in terms of movements, thoughts and emotions _ are reduced by 30 percent to 50 percent.
Symptoms of autism can be traced to problems in each of these regions, said Amaral, the neuroscientist at UC-Davis.
For example, neurons in the amygdala respond to faces and the angle of gaze.
Autistic children tend to ignore facial expressions, or at least do not seem to read them well.
Experiments show that autistic children can use their cerebellums to shift attention when they are not paying attention to a particular task.
But when they are asked to make a conscious decision about changing attention, a task that activates their frontal lobes, they can no longer to do the task, presumably because a larger circuit is engaged.
Animal studies also shed light on the biology of social behavior relevant to autism, Amaral said.
For example, monkeys have brain cells that respond to moving hands and faces but not other moving things.
They have cells, called mirror neurons, that fire when the monkey performs an action, like gripping a handle bar, but also when the monkey observes another monkey performing the same action.
They have cells that are activated by sights and sounds generated by others but not by the same sights and sounds when they are self-generated.
Perhaps the human equivalent of these specialized cells are not functioning properly in autism.
Experiments conducted on human autistic children suggest that very specific elements of social behavior are abnormal.
For example, autistic children can use sabotage, but not deception, to prevent another person from attaining a goal.
They can use communicative gestures, like ``come here,'' to affect another person's behavior but not expressive gestures, like ``well done,'' to affect another's mental state.
They can feel the basic pleasure in mastering a task but not the pride, said Dr.
Chris Frith, a neuroscientist at University College London in England.
An emotion like pride requires taking into account other people's expectations, he said.
Another set of recent but not yet published experiments shows that autistic children are bombarded by their own nervous systems, making them more sensitive to stimuli, not less, said Portia Iverson, the founder of Cure Autism Now, a parent group based in Los Angeles, who is an expert on the disorder.
``If you hook a normal person up to a device that measures arousal and make direct eye contact,'' she said, ``you'd see maybe four spikes a minute.
In the same setting, the autistic child has a dozen or more spikes per minute, plus the peaks are extremely high and low, more severe and erratic.
It's like you or I would feel during an earthquake, but they feel that way all day long,'' she said.
In normal learning and memory, Ms.
Iverson said, people encode new information about 30 seconds after getting an arousal peak.
``But what if you have six times too many peaks''? she asked.
``You might encode enormous amounts of highly irrelevant information, focusing on details that don't matter to the rest of us''.
Autism researchers agree that it will take many years before the genetics and neurochemistry of the disorder are understood.
In the meantime, intensive one-on-one therapies that teach children how to control their movements and interact socially succeed in 30 percent to 50 percent of treated children, provided they start early, ideally by age 2 or 3.
The goal is to intercept the miswiring of the autistic brain and, as the brain is developing, help it grow the connections it needs.
Still, for a great many austistic children, the disorder is not diagnosed until age 5 or 6, when they start school, Dr.
Bristol-Power said.
Most pediatricians and family doctors still believe that autism is a relatively rare disorder and are not trained to pick up symptoms, she said.
Any child that is not speaking in short phrases by age 2 should be evaluated.
Ms. Iverson said: ``The fact that children's brains are dynamic and resilient is our greatest hope.
The very essence of a human being is his or her interaction with the environment.
If it's not done right the first time, we can make it up with restorative and regenerative therapies for the brain.
We may not make kids completely normal but we can change the course of the illness.''
A hormone trumpeted in the news media and on the Internet as a potential cure for autism worked no better than saltwater in its first controlled clinical trial, scientists are reporting.
The study, described in the issue of The New England Journal of Medicine that is being published Thursday, is one of a dozen efforts sponsored by the National Institutes of Health to test the hormone, secretin, which gained wide attention after a 3-year-old New Hampshire boy showed rapid improvement after taking the drug in 1996.
``Secretin is in widespread use across the country,'' said Dr.
Marie Bristol-Power, special assistant for autism programs at the Institute of Child Health and Human Development at the NIH.
``Parents need to know if it is promising and should be pursued or if they are being taken advantage of''.
The study was not definitive, Dr.
Bristol-Power said, and researchers will know more by the middle of next year, when other studies are completed.
Defenders of secretin were quick to denounce the new study, saying it did not give the drug a fair test.
``No one has ever claimed that secretin is a miracle cure for autism,'' said Victoria Beck, the mother of the boy who improved after taking it.
Ms. Beck, who has written a book on secretin, called the hormone ``a clue that deserves careful investigation, and not dismissal from autism gurus, who have a vested interest in the way things have been done in the past''.
Autism is a serious brain disorder that begins in infancy and prevents children from developing normally.
Symptoms, which can be mild to severe, include an inability to communicate, a refusal to make eye contact, repetitive behavior like head banging or hand flapping, and a preoccupation with unusual activities or interests.
Half a million Americans have the disorder, which is typically treated with educational and behavioral therapy.
While intensive therapy has proved effective in some patients, two-thirds of adults with autism cannot live independently.
Secretin is a hormone made in the intestine that stimulates the release of digestive fluids.
Ms. Beck's son, Parker, was given an injection to explore the cause of his chronic diarrhea.
Soon afterward, his behavior improved; he could hold still and interact better with adults.
When his story was reported on television, in newspapers and on the Internet last year, parents began clamoring to get the drug.
Dr. Bristol-Power said that the supply of secretin was soon exhausted and that a black market developed involving sham secretin, price gouging and other forms of profiteering; Ms.
Beck said that these stories were exaggerated and that no one today had any problem obtaining secretin at a fair price, which is about $200 an injection.
Anecdotes about secretin are thriving on the Internet.
Some parents report dramatic effects, others see no effect and some report that their child's symptoms have worsened.
Both sides in the secretin controversy estimate that 2,000 to 3,000 children have taken or are taking the drug.
The controlled study of secretin was led by Dr.
James Bodfish of the Western Carolina Center and the University of North Carolina, and by Dr.
Adrian Sandler of the Center for Child Development at Thoms Rehabilitation Hospital in Asheville, N.C.
In all, 56 autistic children 3 to 14 years of age took part in the study.
Half received a single injection of synthetic human secretin, and the rest were injected with saltwater.
Researchers administered a battery of behavioral tests at intervals of one day, one week and four weeks after the treatment.
Statistically, the two groups showed no differences, Sandler said.
A third of the children in both the placebo and treatment groups improved on some of the same measures.
The only explanation, Sandler said, is a ``significant placebo effect''.
``Parents are extremely invested in the possibility of new treatments and have high expectancies,'' he said.
``They are looking for subtle improvements.
Kids with autism show variability in their day-to-day behavior, and it would be easy to attribute normal variations to the secretin''.
Ms. Beck disputes this interpretation, contending that by concentrating on standard behavioral tests the researchers have failed to look at a wide range of physiological responses seen in children given secretin, and that those should be studied.
``It really bothers me that parents are portrayed as this desperate group of people with vacant minds,'' she said.
``They claim we can't tell the difference between an improvement and a mirage.
But when a child stops vomiting, sleeps through the night and makes eye contact, we know something is happening.''
BRICK, N.J.
(AP) -- A federal investigation of a possible autism cluster here found that worried parents who pushed for the study were right: The neurodevelopmental disorder is far more common here than once thought.
But the investigation stopped short of finding an autism cluster, a higher-than-average rate of the disorder in an area.
Officials said there is not enough data on autism nationwide to say that a cluser exists.
The investigation did find that the water was not contaminated.
Still, a father who led the fight for the study said he's not convinced that there's no environmental cause for the high number of autism cases in Brick or the apparent increase in the disorder around the country.
''I'm slightly disappointed that (the federal experts) aren't staying in town long enough to answer the questions in the community this is going to provoke,'' said Billy Gallagher, a commercial fisherman with two autistic children, Alanna, 9, and Austin, 7.
After the most intensive federal study of autism prevalence ever conducted, researchers said Tuesday that they found a rate of 4 in 1,000 children with autism in Brick and 2.7 in 1,000 with autism-like disorders.
The rate is several times higher than past estimates, although the true rate of autism is controversial because there has never been a nationwide study.
Until the early 1990s, autism was thought to afflict 1 in 2,000 children.
Preliminary data from a just-completed federal study of children in the Atlanta area show a rate of 2-3 in 1,000 with autism.
''The major question for me is whether it's just more prevalent (than previously thought) or it's on the rise,'' as some parents and doctors suspect, said Dr.
Eric London, vice president of medical affairs at the National Alliance for Autism Research in Princeton and a consultant for the investigation.
A poorly understood disorder, autism is thought to occur early in pregnancy.
In moderate to severe cases, autism makes it difficult to communicate or relate to the outside world, and drives some to obsessively repeat certain motions, even hurt themselves or others.
Data from California, South Florida and other areas have shown a sharp increase in recent years in children receiving special educational services for autism, and parents in New York's Staten Island and other communities have complained of possible autism clusters, though no autism cluster has ever been documented.
In 1997, a group of worried Brick parents conducted a survey that found a high enough level of autism in this coastal town of 71,000 that state health officials and politicians won federal funding for a comprehensive investigation.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry began investigating in January 1999.
The CDC found 60 children ages 3 to 10 who had autism or autism-related disorders, said Jacquelyn Bertrand, a developmental psychologist at the CDC.
''I think this (study) is going to bring more and more attention to autism and the fact that it's not a rare disorder, that we need more attention to diagnosis,'' so affected children can get treatment earlier and reach a higher level of function, said Dr.
Audrey Mars, an assistant pediatrics professor at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey who examined many of the children.

Autism was believed to be solely a human condition, characterized by a limited ability to communicate and a lack of response to others.
But it seems animals can be autistic too.
Neurologists have bred long-haired albino guinea pigs with the same neurological abnormalities seen in some autistic people.
With these defects in the cerebellum, the part of the brain responsible for coordination, the guinea pigs developed behavioral traits typical of autistic patients.
The team, from the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, the University of Rouen and New York Medical College, placed one altered guinea pig _ known as GS _ in a cage with a normal one and compared their behavior and social interaction, such as sniffing, licking and mating attempts.
They found that the GS guinea pigs were much less inclined to interact with the other animals, and showed a reluctance to explore or respond to their surroundings _ all behavior that can be found in autistic children (European Journal of Neuroscience, vol.
10, p.
2677). Jean Caston, a member of the team, says that an animal model for autism could be useful to understand the condition better.

Gen Xers are looking for something _ or someone _ to nurture and love.
For some, it will be a baby, for others, it will be a pet or even a pet-like toy.
From Main Street to Hollywood, babies are ``in''.
Pregnant Annette Bening was the darling of the Oscars.
Jada Pinkett consistently shows up scantily clad and well rounded.
While in years past, Reese Witherspoon might have lost her star appeal by getting pregnant so young (and, oh my, out of wedlock), today's trendsetters consider her inspirational _ someone who has it all and is able to balance a family and a career.
Indeed, it's another Baby Boom, spurred by a good economy.
Babies are expensive, but Xers say they can afford them.
Also, many women are beginning to think that maybe their most important role is not in the boardroom.
We've been seeing signs of this for a while now.
Much of this trend stems from a return to more traditional values such as mom in the kitchen baking an apple pie for her brood.
One fourth of the respondents in Youth Intelligence's most recent study of 14- to 30-year-olds listed ``staying home to raise children'' as a sign of success.
And according to a recent study by the Families and Work Institute in New York City, high schoolers overwhelmingly said they wanted to land jobs that gave them time for family activities.
Behind this attitude was the fact that the majority were children of working parents and they wanted to make sure their own children came first.
But lest feminists fear that this generation is destroying all of their hard work, understand that this trend is not simply about going back to the values and customs of the '50s.
Rather, it's about Xers recognizing that it's difficult to be a good parent and that raising a teen in today's world may be harder than ever before.
Even though the ``stay-at-home'' parent of choice continues to be the woman, many of the male trendsetters surveyed by Youth Intelligence suggested that if the mother of their children had a better job than they did, they would stay home themselves.
They are just as disenchanted with the workplace as women and are even jealous of the bond a mother has with her baby.
As for women, a recent NBC News poll showed that only 14 percent of women claim to work for ``personal fulfillment'' (the rest work for financial reasons), and a study Youth Intelligence conducted for Cosmopolitan magazine revealed that 68 percent of women stated that they would stay home if they could afford to.
Having several children is also deemed a sign of success.
As a 28-year-old in New York explained, ``People are over the big houses or fancy cars.
These days it's the number of children you have Everyone knows how expensive it is to raise kids, so having more than two means you're well off And I think a woman staying home is a source of pride for a lot of men who feel proud that their wife doesn't have to work if she doesn't want to''.
The pride factor aside, you don't have to be a parent to express your need to nurture.
It's no longer unusual to see a puppy carried around in a baby papoose or brought to the office and tucked happily in the corner.
And is it just me, or is the Aibo Robodog the most endearing character in this season's cast of MTV's ``The Real World''?
From plastic Tamagotchis to puppies galore, everyone wants something to care for.
A 28-year-old in Los Angeles summed it up by saying, ``I think it's just a really hard world.
People have to be tough and on their guard so much, but you need an outlet And finding a person to love is a lot harder than finding a pet to love''.
Indeed, the need to nurture seems to extend to friends as well as canines, with trendsetters citing extreme devotion to their peers.
As one 17-year-old told us, ``I think teenagers today really take care of each other.
Not everyone has good parents, or their parents are working or whatever, so you really take care of your friends and support them''.
So, look for signs of caring all around you.
Maybe we really are becoming a ``kinder, gentler nation''.

STAMFORD, Conn.
(AP) - Rabbi Joshua Hammerman made an uplifting discovery when he started searching for God on the Internet.
Hammerman, who leads Stamford's conservative Jewish congregation, Temple Beth El, tried a search by typing in ''God''.
The search reaped about 2 million hits and was the brainchild for his recently released book, ''thelordismyshepherd.com: Seeking God in Cyberspace''.
Hammerman's book explores the reasons that people are using the Internet to find faith.
He's concluded that younger generations are not rejecting God but understanding him in a different way.
''Most people of Generation X are searching for a way back to religious faith, but the forms and the metaphors some traditions use in their denominations just don't resonate with them,'' Hammerman said.
While many young people don't set foot in a church, synagogue or mosque, they may be more likely to discuss religion in a chat room or surf for Web sites where they can learn about different religions.
''The whole notion of God as the pastor leading the flock of congregations and parishes, most people now can't relate to that,'' Hammerman said.
Instead, people are identifying God with the concept of the World Wide Web, ''that God seems to be within and between us, rather than above us''.
A recent survey found that 75 percent of Internet users have engaged Web searches with religious themes.
The Internet is sometimes viewed as an alienating force, driving surfers into an artificial world and away from real human contact.
Hammerman, unlike many mainstream religious leaders, views the Internet as a vessel for improved communication between people, with the power to ''connect us in ways we've never seen before''.
Some churches and congregations, including Hammerman's, have Web sites.
In the future, prayer services will probably be available online, too, he said.
Hammerman has even married a couple who met on the Internet.
''I think there is something real happening in the virtual world,'' he said.
''The word 'religion,' in Latin, actually means 'reconnect'.
'' The book is supplemented by a Web site, aptly addressed, thelordismyshepherd.com, where surfers can read about the book and discuss it.
Hammerman, 43, has led Temple Beth El for 13 years.
He was formerly the first pulpit rabbi to be president of The Council of Churches &AMP; Synagogues of Southwestern Connecticut.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.
_ Workers decry the loss of loyalty from employers.
Employers bemoan the lack of loyalty from employees.
The truth is like that old ``Is it a breath mint or is it a candy mint''? commercial: Stop.
You're both right.
It's two, two, two truths in one.
No employer guarantees lifetime or even long-term employment.
Businesses downsize, outsource, merge, sell, reorganize, cut costs.
At the same time, workers keep their eyes open and resumes ready _ or suffer shocked self-pity when they're suddenly searching for re-employment.
This two, two, two truths in one job market underlies Carol Kinsey Goman's consultations with corporate clients.
The Berkeley, Calif.-based author and behavioral-change expert considers the loyalty factor when helping employers attract and retain employees.
At a Kansas City Institute for Management Studies seminar, Goman said employers needed to understand that workers have different perceptions of loyalty, depending on their age and experience.
Those perceptions paint different backdrops for accepting and adapting to workplace change.
Her categories and broad characteristics: The veterans: The born-before-1946 crowd has been through at least one world war and possibly a stock market crash and a major economic depression.
They respect military-model authority.
They save for a rainy day and are accustomed to delayed rewards.
They believe you're lucky to have a job at all, so hold on to it and don't complain.
The baby boomers: The postwar population bulge, born from 1946 to 1964, grew up with anti-war protests, quests for equal or civil rights, and experimentation in drugs and sexual freedom.
Their sheer numbers made tough competition for jobs and for promotions.
They question authority but, in the end, believe that in return for hard work and dedicated service, their employer will notice and reward them with boosts up the career ladder.
Generation X: The group born from 1965 to 1979 came of age in a video world where TV brought information to them fast, with fewer words and more images.
They grew up techno-savvy and are prime picks in the computer-reliant job market.
They saw vets and boomers ousted, knew the ``paternal corporation'' was history, and concentrated on building individual skills, expecting to transfer easily from job to job.
Loyalty goes to whatever project they're personally working on at the moment.
The millennials: This Generation Y, or baby boom echo, born after 1979, is the ``multitasking, twitch-speed'' generation.
Comfortable juggling many things at once and moving on quickly if bored or dissatisfied, they expect constant, instant recognition and rewards.
Accustomed to helping their families make decisions about buying computers and such, they expect a place at the corporate table when decisions are made that affect them.
They don't demand handholding career guidance; they ``want the remote control''.
Unless organizations accept the overarching age-related philosophies of their work forces, the two, two, two truths in one head-butting about loyalty will continue, and everyone will profess befuddlement about what's gone wrong.
Generation X _ that youthful, ``slacker'' generation _ is facing a quiet crisis.
The leading edge of that group is turning 30.
Time to grow up, get serious.
Time for a major identity shakeup.
Time to panic.
``We think of ourselves as not really that together and not really very grown up,'' said Kristin Beck, a Bay-area writer who hit the big 3-0 last April.
After reading up on adult development, she and colleague Lauren Dockett interviewed more than 30 women about ``lessons learned and dreams examined'' as they reached their first scary ``decade'' birthday.
The responses are woven into their book, ``Facing 30: Women Talk About Constructing a Real Life and Other Scary Rites of Passage'' (New Harbinger Publications, 163 pages, $12.95).
Beck and Dockett uncovered rampant angst among their peers, who believed they had little to show for themselves as they entered serious adulthood.
Lingering in school, putting off marriage, flitting from job to job, they panicked as they saw their adolescence stretch like cheap pantyhose.
Many worried they were living a kind of ``adulthood lite''.
``Women pretty uniformly said their identity was shaken at the end of their 20s,'' Beck said.
``Love and career and babies: Those are the big things''.
Many women believed self-imposed deadline pressure to have their lives tidily arranged _ right now.
When things didn't gel, they believed the problem lay with them, not their expectations.
``I think the biggest unrealistic expectation,'' Beck said, ``is that you have to achieve everything by 30''.
Graying baby boomers may snort at the thought of Gen-Xers wringing their smooth, unlined hands over the trauma of aging, but Beck says ix-nay on the condescension.
``Especially when you're facing 50, 30 looks pretty good,'' she concedes.
``But like it or not, it is a significant developmental period in a woman's life.
If you don't take a look at stuff in your 30s, you might end up with a big, fat midlife crisis''.
Gen-Xers grew up in a different climate than their elders, so turning 30 feels slightly different for them.
Baby boomers _ who coined the phrase, ``Don't trust anyone over 30'' _ may have suffered some chagrin when age pushed them into the enemy camp.
But their choices in life were fairly straightforward, Beck said.
They could either conform to traditional roles or rebel against them.
Generation X, on the other hand, is coming of age with no clear sense of identity.
Everything is up for grabs.
``Now there aren't even rules to be broken,'' Beck said.
``It's so free-form, it's stultifying''.
She sees Gen-X as a cautious, media-saturated bunch who grew up without illusions.
Stung by their parents' divorces, the women she met are nervous about commitment, even if they see marriage as a desirable goal.
With far less job security than their parents had, they view career choice as something malleable, less defining.
``That's basically our generation in a nutshell _ many, many different kinds of jobs before settling into a career,'' Beck said.
``The idea is grab what you can get.
We have grown up in a pretty screwy economy and nothing seems very secure''.
Although women are having babies later in life, they still feel pressure to get moving on the issue _ at least make up their minds _ by age 30, Beck said.
If they want children, their tendency is to dump lackluster relationships at around this age and start scouting for more promising, long-term partners.
Beck senses a backlash against the mantra that women can have it all _ high-octane career, marriage and family.
``We're really grateful to our mothers for paving the way for us,'' she said, ``but I do think that having it all means you're sacrificing something.
``A lot of women we talked to wanted to stay home with their kids _ wanted to _ and considered themselves feminists''.
Beck, who grew up as a latchkey kid, said she works full time out of economic necessity but would rather be home with her 2-month-old baby.
``I think a lot of women are trying to figure out a way to work half-time and keep themselves in the career loop and pay attention to their kids,'' she said.
The younger women Beck interviewed saw 30 as a great divide between the carefree, adventurous possibilities of youth and the drudgery of maturity.
``People basically thought you'd be set in your ways, you'd be calcified, you'd have to give up facets of your personality you weren't ready to give up,'' Beck said.
In reality, turning 30 seldom lived down to their expectations.
Women who had already passed that milestone said they felt more sure-footed and fully formed.
They also felt less pressure to strive for impossible standards of beauty.
Beck said their philosophy was, ``No one's going to ever buy you as a young person anymore, so you might as well give it up''.
Middle-age women said it's OK to hit 30 without all the answers.
In hindsight, they saw it as a jumping-off point for adulthood _ a time to move forward with greater confidence and really start living.
``You just know yourself better when you turn 30,'' Beck said, adding that she learned to lighten up after talking to these women.
``I don't have to wrap things up right this second,'' she decided.
``If I'm not happy in my career, I have a whole lifetime to figure it out.
I don't feel I have to have everything solved''.
Now, she added, ``30 seems like an exciting possibility instead of a big bummer.''
Slackers and Generation X types, it seems, are hardly slack when it comes to saving for retirement.
According to a recent survey, people between the ages of 18 and 39 began saving for retirement at an average age of 25.
That is a far earlier starting age than for older groups, the survey found: People between the ages of 40 and 64 began saving for retirement at an average age of 35, and those 65 and older waited until they were 46.
Louis Harris &AMP; Associates surveyed 1,000 adults in June for Alliance Capital Management, the money management firm in New York.
But young savers, who can generally afford to invest most aggressively because they don't need the money for many years, are proving oddly conservative in investment choices.
The poll found that only 46 percent of people aged 18 to 29 were using stocks or stock or bond funds in their retirement investing.
And young investors who do own stocks or funds devote only 35 percent of their portfolios to them, on average.
By comparison, 62 percent of those aged 30 to 49 have invested money in stocks or mutual funds.
And these people are putting a greater portion of their money _ 51 percent _ into such investments.
The survey also found that 56 percent of those aged 50 to 64 held stocks or mutual funds; on average, these investors also devoted 51 percent of their portfolios to them.
``We were fascinated that Gen X-ers would start saving regularly for retirement earlier than their elders did but keep less of their assets in more aggressive investments,'' said John Carifa, president of Alliance.
The survey also found that retirement savers didn't think they were stashing away enough money.
In estimating how much money they would need to retire with an income equal to 70 percent of what they now earned, the respondents gave a median answer of $196,000.
But the median amount they actually expected to save was just $143,000, a 27 percent shortfall.
This week, when astronaut John Glenn straps himself into the shuttle Discovery, younger Americans will marvel at the achievements of this 77-year-old hero.
He's been a combat pilot, space pioneer, political leader and family man.
He embodies the best about his gritty generation, the one that triumphed in World War II and then built the world's greatest economy.
But don't let the glowing descriptions you'll hear from young TV reporters lead you to believe that goodwill toward older Americans is universal.
Despite the family ties that bind us, the different generations seem to be growing apart as jealousy and economic conflict drive wedges between the various age groups.
Many members of Glenn's generation believe they are losing ground financially now.
At the same time, their children are getting sick of paying high taxes to support Social Security.
And Generation Xers are afraid the baby boomers ahead of them soon will create such a huge voting bloc of retirees that Congress will be pushed to further boost taxes to support the elderly.
Each generation has some legitimate gripes and fears.
Today's over-65 Americans are frustrated because they are seeing their income decline at a time when younger people are flourishing.
While jobs are plentiful and mortgages cheap for workers in the prime of life, retirees are getting pinched by a meager 1.3 percent cost-of-living increase in Social Security payments and a continuing decline in the interest rates paid on savings.
With their incomes stagnant or shrinking, many older Americans are getting angry with their children.
They resent seeing younger generations buying bigger homes and cars.
``I've never known a more self-indulgent, self-absorbed, self-centered generation as the baby boomers,'' one reader said in a recent letter to me.
A jealous 69-year-old parent wrote: ``My first home had 1,200 square feet.
My daughter's home today is over 3,000, as are most of the homes being built in north Fulton, where I still have a tiny, one-story ranch home with wood siding''.
But while senior citizens are complaining about ``selfish'' children, boomers are getting fed up with the kvetching of their parents, who are getting far more out of Social Security than they put into it.
In the 1950s, the combined payroll tax for Social Security, paid by both workers and their employers, was just 6 percent.
Today, the combined tax is 12.4 percent.
The World War II generation had nowhere near the tax burden that today's workers carry to fund benefits for aging veterans, Social Security, Medicare and other programs for the elderly.
Largely because of that government aid, the elderly are the wealthiest demographic group in America.
But perhaps no generation has more to fear from their elders than Generation X, the people born from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s.
Those young workers are vastly outnumbered by the boomers who were born between 1946 and 1964.
GenXers may find themselves suffocated by much higher taxes to care for long-living boomers.
Economists estimate that to maintain today's level of Social Security benefits, workers in 2020 will have to shoulder a 20 percent payroll tax.
In 1999, Congress is supposed to take up Social Security reform.
The arguments could get very ugly as each generation tries to cut a better deal for itself.
For decades, the most bitter battles in American social and political life were over race.
In coming years, the most hostile debates may be over what one generation owes another.
Discussions around the table at Thanksgiving may get a lot livelier in the next century.

DAYTON, Ohio _ When scores of the state's behind-the-scenes politicos showed up in Columbus last month to schmooze at the annual Ohio Board of Elections Association conference, the Montgomery County contingent stood out like a Brownie troop at a senior citizens ball.
``We would go into these hospitality suites and people would look at us and say, `What's going on in Montgomery County?
These people are so young,' '' said Nan Whaley, who at age 24 is both executive director of the county's Democratic Party and a member of the local Board of Elections.
Joining Whaley at the convention was her mirror image in Montgomery County politics _ 27-year-old John Shaw, the executive director of the local Republican Party _ who, like Whaley, holds a patronage job as a member of the election board.
Supporting the two young party execs is a growing cadre of 20-something and early 30-something political workers who are giving the lie _ at least in the Dayton area _ to the notion that Generation X is a bunch of slackers who would rather whine about societal problems than fix them.
The youth infusion has meant ``more pep and vigor in the party in the last three to four years than in a long time,'' said James E.P.
``Sully'' Sullivan, 79, a longtime local Democratic Party player and a former director of the Montgomery County Board of Elections.
In typical partisan fashion, the two parties each claim to be the Pied Piper of the local youth movement.
``We have about 100 Young Democrats in Montgomery County.
They have three Young Republicans,'' Whaley sniffed.
``There is no organized Young Republicans in Montgomery County''.
Shaw begged to differ.
The Democrats ``may have a stronger organization, but we have just as many strong young people'' in the local Republican ranks.
``Just going to club meetings doesn't mean you're active''.
RECRUITING THE YOUNG Montgomery County Democratic Chairman Dennis Lieberman said he got the ball rolling across the generations here in 1996, soon after the overthrow of former chairman Joe Shump and the old Democratic guard, by resurrecting the College Democrats Club at the University of Dayton.
The club's growing membership was then invited to join the county Young Democrats and put to work within the local party structure.
``Word got out that we cared about young people and that we tried to get them involved in things,'' Lieberman said.
``As a result, we got lucky and ended up with some very good young people''.
The list includes Whaley; Charlie Bowling, 29, who helped rebuild the Young Democrat organization here; Troy Singer, 34, who ran Tony Hill's top vote-getting campaign last fall for the Dayton school board; and Hill himself, 31, who started out as an adviser to U.S.
Rep. Tony Hall, R-Dayton.
Jeff Jacobson, chairman of the Montgomery County Republican Party, says local Republicans have done their own trolling for youth, primarily by changing the way the party recruits and promotes its workers.
It's no longer who you know, or how long you've paid party dues, Jacobson said.
Now it's what you know.
``We started recruiting young people right out of college that we think have talent,'' he said.
The Republican kiddie list now includes Shaw; Chris Heizer, 27, director of the Montgomery County Board of Elections and vice president of the local Republican Party executive committee; Doug Tully, 29, supervisor of the Board of Elections and a member of the local Republican committee; and Jon Husted, 32, who is running for the 41st District seat in the Ohio House of Representatives being vacated by J.
Donald Mottley, R-West Carrollton.
FROM ENVELOPE-STUFFING TO COMPUTER PROGRAMMING Interestingly, while the Democrats tend to talk about the youthful vision and energy that Generation X has brought to party politics, Republicans are more likely to tout their technical and organizational skills.
Menial tasks such as typing addresses, stuffing envelopes and tallying votes used to be the drudgery that greased the political machine, They were often assigned to armies of senior citizens with plenty of time on their hands.
Now it's all done by computer.
``So we get bright young people who can take apart a computer and put it back together again,'' said Susan Finley, co-chair of the Montgomery County Republican Party who also sits on the Board of Elections.
At age 68, Finley calls herself the ``house mother'' of the local election board.
Susan Mitchell, author of ``Generation X: The Young Adult Market'' (New Strategist, $69.95), said it's unusual for Dayton to have so many young people involved in local politics, especially party politics.
``The thing that is most striking about this generation is that they tend not to identify with any political party,'' she said.
The young pols in both parties worry that too many of their peers continue to be alienated from the political process.
``I think it's just immaturity,'' Singer said.
``As we grow older, we become more aware of how people in office can affect our paychecks because of taxes that are taken out, how they can affect the economy and jobs that are available''.
Kate Evans, a 19-year-old member of UD's Young Democrats, says many of her classmates are apathetic about the political scene because they are confident that good jobs are waiting for them after graduation.
``I think a lot of people my age feel very comfortable, almost complacent,'' Evans said.
``But how long is this (prosperity) going to last''?
Whaley says that for many Gen-Xers, the bad times are already here, but younger voters aren't getting the message.
``Most of my generation is underemployed and don't have good (employee) benefits.
But they don't equate that with the ballot box''.
POLITICS OFTEN RUNS IN THE BLOOD The Gen-Xers involved in local politics most often credited their families for their interest in political careers.
Whaley cites the inspiration of her mother, who also was active as a Young Democrat and who later ran for a number of local and state offices in Indiana, including state auditor.
Her mother most recently won election as clerk-treasurer of Mooresville, Ind.
, in 1996.
Singer's uncle, Enos Singer, was a past president of the Ohio Board of Elections Association and a longtime veteran of statehouse politics.
His grandfather, Kenneth Singer, was a trustee for many years in Monroe County in southeastern Ohio.
For others, national leaders provided the inspiration to enter politics.
``My first interest started with Ronald Reagan. . . because he made us proud to be Americans again,'' Shaw said.
``I've been reading presidential biographies ever since''.
Both the Democrat and Republican youth squads concurred that Montgomery County's evenly divided vote, and often hotly contested races, is the challenge that drew them into local party politics.
``Young people have plenty of opportunities to work in Columbus or (Washington) D.C., but Dayton is fun,'' Whaley said.
``It's the number one swing county (for elections) in the state.
Every race is a real fight here.
People can win on 400 votes out of 50,000 cast''.
Shaw agreed.
``It's an exciting county.
Franklin and Hamilton are mostly Republican.
Toledo and Cleveland are mostly Democrat.
But this is just a good 50/50 county with a lot of contested races''.
They may teasingly call each other R's and D's, but the young politicos here insist the rivalry only brings them closer socially.
On election night last year, the kiddie corps from both parties went out to celebrate together.
``Do we argue?
Oh yeah,'' Shaw said.
``But it's all in fun.
Nobody ever gets upset about it because we all know where everybody is coming from before we get there''.
If Gen-Xers shy away from politics, Shaw puts at least part of the blame on the system itself.
``I think, frankly, they want to see more candidates their own age to relate to,'' he said.
`I PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH WAS' So far, most of the young pols here have been content to work behind the scenes as campaign workers, strategists and committee members.
But many are itching to run for office and some, like 31-year-old Tony Hill, already have.
After serving for several years as a campaign worker for other local candidates, Hill ran for Dayton school board last fall and nabbed the most votes in the race.
``I didn't want to be one of those who just complained about things going wrong,'' he said.
``I kind of put my money where my mouth was''.
Too often, the younger generation is blamed for not being engaged in politics ``when the real problem is that the political system has failed to engage them,'' said Gen-X expert Mitchell.
``Older people do things out of a civic obligation _ you vote because you're supposed to,'' she said.
``But younger people aren't going to vote because of that.
You have to give them something to vote for, give them something to get excited about''.
Term limits may help create some of that excitement in the statehouse.
``You don't have to be there for 10 years before getting into a position of standing, because everyone is limited to eight years anyway,'' said Husted, citing one of the reasons he decided to run for Mottley's vacated seat.
Hill said political leaders can't wait too long before unleashing other Gen-X candidates, or they'll lose young voters completely.
``I think it's time to start looking at our generation _ not just on the school board, but to serve downtown on the (city) commission and in the statehouse as well,'' he said.
``I think we have some outstanding young people in the city.
We need to make sure we're growing these people for elections down the road''.

Service &LR; &QC; &QL; SANTA ROSA, Calif.
_ Seven years ago three guys named Sebastiani, Sangiacomo and Bundschu got together over beers at a Sonoma pub to lament the sorry state of wine drinking in America.
The young men, all scions of prominent Sonoma Valley wine families, were particularly disturbed about the wine-drinking habits of their own generation.
The common wisdom was that members of so-called Generation X preferred margaritas to merlot and considered wine to be elitist, boring and passe.
The beers kept flowing and the conversation became more impassioned _ after all, family fortunes and life styles were at stake.
The grape heirs decided they had to do something to make wine cool for the cyber generation or else the party could be over.
The Wine Brats, now a national movement with 16,000 members, was born following that sudsy night of brainstorming.
In the beginning, the Wine Brats was just the three young men armed with an ambitious goal: to knock wine off its lofty pedestal.
The idea was to make wine fun, accessible and relevant to a generation skeptical of glitz, glamour and glad-handing sales pitches.
Their mantra was ``Wine for the People''.
``Our message was, wine doesn't have to be pretentious,'' said Wine Brat Jeff Bundschu, 31, a sixth-generation Sonoma Valley vintner who is now general manager of his family's Gundlach-Bundschu Winery in Vineburg.
``You don't have to drink it out of crystal glasses and it can fit into your lifestyle and, by the way, it goes great with pizza and burgers''.
Bundschu teamed with childhood pals Mike Sangiacomo, 31, of Sangiacomo Vineyards, and Jon Sebastiani, 29, of Viansa Winery, to found the Wine Brats in 1993.
The name fit.
Growing up, they and other privileged children of wealthy winemakers were fondly called wine brats by their families and members of the community.
The trendy group created an energy of its own, spreading like morning glory in a vineyard.
Wine Brats now has 45 chapters throughout the country, with Chicago and New York leading Brat enclaves.
Brats converge at wine raves where cabernet and merlot are savoured in a multimedia blowouts with art, music, food and technology.
They attend seminars on how to pair wine with popcorn, corn chips and salsa while big screen television sets play reruns of ``Happy Days''.
From its humble beginnings in the Sonoma pub, Wine Brats has become an Internet-based collective of young wine enthusiasts, with the organization's core age group 24 to 36.
They have even written a book: ``The Wine Brats' Guide to Living With Wine,'' published by St.
Martin's Griffin of New York.
The original Wine Brats are now older than many of the members who have jumped on their fast-moving wine train.
They also are busier than they were seven years ago when all three were single, footloose and just embarking on careers at family wineries and vineyards.
Today, all three Wine Brats are married, and Bundschu and Sangiacomo each have a child.
All say their family obligations and wine jobs are demanding, limiting the time they have to raid Gen X hangouts to pour pinot noir.
``I'm finding it extremely difficult to juggle my personal life and my professional role at Viansa.
The last few years have been very busy,'' said Sebastiani, who is now president of Viansa Winery, the winery and Italian marketplace owned by his parents, Sam and Vicki Sebastiani.
Mike Sangiacomo is now the ranch manager at his family's Sangiacomo Vineyards, one of Sonoma County's premier grape producers.
Most of the Wine Brats' 16,000 members are young, affluent urban consumers wired to the Web.
They prefer high-energy parties _ rather than sedate sippings _ to sample wine.
``One of the things we've always stressed is that wine is an agricultural product,'' said Bundschu.
``It comes from the earth and is dependent on weather.
It's real, healthy and doesn't have to be complicated''.
That goes hand-in-hand with young peoples' demand for simplicity, intelligence and a healthy nonchalance.
Wine Brats does not want people to increase their alcohol consumption, just their beverage of choice.
The group's motto is: ``Drink less, drink better''.
Although Sebastiani, Sangiacomo and Bundschu remain on the Wine Brats' board of directors, they are not as involved as they were in the early days.
The other two members of the Wine Brats' board of directors are Dawn Dooley, formerly of Duckhorn Vineyards in the Napa Valley and now with Hedges Cellars in Washington, and Mimi Gatens of Vine Cliff Winery in Napa.
The Wine Brats directors hold board meetings via e-mail.
The organization's day-to-day operation is done by a paid staff headed by executive director Joel Quigley, who has held the position since 1995.
Quigley, 38, uses the Internet and his staff's youthful energy to spread the word about wine and build membership.
Working with Quigley out of the Wine Brats' Santa Rosa office are six full-time staff members and seven interns from the wine business program at Sonoma State University.
Wine Brats has become a think tank for the wine industry, he said, evaluating trends and assessing wine's place in changing lifestyles.
``We have no constraints, which allows us to think outside the box and run with our ideas,'' Quigley said.
Technically, Wine Brats is an acronym _ Wine to Benefit Responsible Adults for Tomorrow's Society _ but few people, even the Brats themselves, ever use it.
More than 50 wineries and wine industry groups contribute to the Wine Brats budget, which this year is approaching $1 million.
The Wine Institute, a trade group based in San Francisco, provided $10,000 in seed money to launch the Wine Brats.
``If our mission is to convert the unconverted, then television and mainstream media are where we have to be seen,'' said Sebastiani.
``Young adults who don't drink wine, don't read wine publications.
It's that simple''.
Quigley and the Wine Brats have ambitious plans, dreaming of new venues, bigger crowds and greater influence.
There are still many tequila drinkers to convert to the joys of cabernet and zinfandel, Quigley said.
``We're not stopping,'' said Sebastiani, ``until Dennis Rodman is sucking down chardonnay''.

KANSAS CITY, Mo.
_ ``What could it be this time''?
Kevin Mallot thought when Peter Mallouk sent him e-mail about going out to lunch.
The two Generation X-ers had been buddies for four years, long enough for Mallot to expect the unexpected, like being a model for a book about kissing.
So there they sat at a Westport bagel shop, munching matching turkey sandwiches, when the then-29-year-old Mallouk broached his next scheme.
``I want to start a charity,'' he told Mallot.
Mallot swallowed his food, leaned back and laughed.
After all, they were well-paid businessmen, certainly not millionaires.
Then a few minutes later, Mallot agreed to join the charity's board _ and last summer they joined a burgeoning philanthropic movement.
Charity isn't just for retired folks anymore.
Young professionals are pursuing philanthropy now, and they're taking a different approach to giving than old-line tycoons such as a Rockefeller or even a Kemper.
The new donors give their expertise, not just their money.
They are getting directly involved with a cause, applying the same hands-on management style they brought to their professions.
So instead of putting their names on a building, they want something else: Results.
Dalene Bradford of the Greater Kansas City Community Foundation and Affiliated Trusts calls this phenomenon a ``new style of donor''.
Peter Karoff with a Boston-based philanthropic consulting firm calls it ``a new kind of philanthropy''.
And Paul Schervish, one of the nation's foremost sociologists of the rich, calls it ``a sea change in the dynamics of charitable giving''.
For Mallouk and Mallot, their cause involved rounding up 11 more pals, creating a charitable fund at the community foundation and then acting like venture capitalists in picking an investment.
They decided to create a child-safety program.
Now they're raising $1 million, creating a curriculum and coordinating construction themselves.
Recently the group _ calling itself KC CAN, for Kansas City Children's Assistance Network _ gained its first sizable pledge, $100,000 from a local foundation.
Here and across the country, this new kind of philanthropy is being driven by new wealth.
This is an era of initial public offerings, surging stock portfolios, business buyouts and baby-boomer inheritances.
Each day, it seems, produces more instant millionaires.
Kansas City has become a hotbed for the new philanthropy.
The city's community foundation has led the nation in the amount of new gifts.
That is because the foundation is tailored toward the new style of donor.
Taking a chance It was Christmastime when Peter and Veronica Mallouk had one of those unplanned husband-wife chats that turned their lives in a different direction.
They were driving along Linwood Boulevard, headed back to south Overland Park, Kan.
, from a party.
The gathering had been for New Horizons Assistance Corp.
, which cares for mentally disabled adults.
Veronica had recruited volunteers from her job at Andersen Consulting in Overland Park to serve the food.
Peter had been the deejay.
It had gone well.
So well that New Horizons officials had asked both to join their board.
Should they?
That's what they discussed that December night in 1998.
Veronica had been a volunteer as long as she could remember: March of Dimes walk-a-thons as a kid.
Teaching Sunday school in college.
Organizing charity events at work.
``You already do a lot,'' Peter told his wife.
``I want to do more,'' she replied.
The Mallouks asked 15 friends, such as Mallot, 27.
They included an investment adviser, an architect, a teacher and some technology consultants at Andersen Consulting.
Almost all agreed.
Peter Mallouk then started researching how to put together a charitable board.
By chance, he was steered to the local community foundation.
The organization had spent the past few years reinventing itself.
It had found a niche as a sort of middleman for donors, setting up meetings with financial advisers and with possible beneficiaries.
Donor funds rolled in.
During the 1990s the number of new funds jumped sixfold, to 550.
New contributions jumped tenfold.
Two years ago the foundation reached $120 million _ the most money received by any community foundation in the country that year.
It topped that last year with $142.8 million.
The foundation doesn't track whether funds come from estates or Gen X-ers, but officials estimate that one-fifth of contributions reflect the new style of giving.
There's Kent Humphrey.
He spent 18 months taking care of his wife, who had a brain tumor.
After she died in 1998, he started a fund to pay for things caregivers like him didn't have time for, such as cleaning the house.
Now he's promoting the concept to doctors.
There's Tom Brown.
His mother, Virginia, grew up with crooked teeth, but her parents could not afford braces for her.
Eventually Virginia got them, and late in life she set up a fund to pay for children's orthodontic work.
Now Brown, a local attorney, screens applications and makes doctor appointments.
And there's Cynthia Gunn.
The local television anchor and reporter set up a fund to pay for daylong self-help seminars.
They're geared toward high school freshman girls in Kansas City to coach them about careers, health and relationships.
She organizes the seminars every year.
These new donors have old reasons for giving: passion; prestige; politics; even tax breaks.
But they have new causes, tipping the balance of the community foundation's grants.
The percentage going to the arts has climbed, thanks to funds set aside for Science City at Union Station, while those going toward health have dipped.
Still, the average fund the community foundation manages is $500,000.
Most are under $100,000.
That's not much compared with what some lesser-known instant millionaires are doing elsewhere.
Nicholas Lovejoy of Seattle was the fifth employee in the door at Amazon.com and now, at age 30, he's overseeing a $2.5 million foundation with his wife.
Trish Millines Dziko, who also lives on the West Coast, quit Microsoft after eight years and founded an organization devoted to teaching African-Americans about computers.
And on and on.
Philanthropic networks are popping up all over to deal with this phenomenon.
``Lots of people with modest sums are doing this,'' said Karoff, president of the Philanthropic Initiative in Boston.
``There's a yearning on the part of donors for values and a greater sense of community.
``It's part of a search for meaning in our lives that is going on''.
The right cause Peter Mallouk and his board were searching, too.
For a cause.
They had money going from paychecks toward their fund.
They had a name picked out, focusing on children.
But still no cause.
``We were in a panic at one point,'' Mallouk said.
The community foundation invited him to a meeting at Children's Mercy Hospital.
Mallouk arrived and immediately received a tour.
He was shown different equipment that had been donated.
After the tour Denise Dowd, medical director for the hospital's childhood safety center, made a presentation.
She recited the hospital's commitment to redesigning playground equipment, speaking at schools, creating a mock street where kids learn how to be safe.
They didn't have the time or money for that mock street yet, but...
Hold it right there, Mallouk thought.
That's it.
He took it back to his board.
Members were all for it.
They pledged to build what's called Safety Street, a full-size indoor reproduction of an actual city street, with working traffic lights, cars, buses and bikes.
It's based on an existing program in New York City and teaches children what to do and not do on a street.
Mallouk's board is doing all the planning: John Taylor is hatching the building plan; Mike Keegan is making fund-raising pitches; Kurt Hogan is creating a Web site; Elise Barton is developing the teaching lessons.
``Sometimes, something like the United Way is a little bit frustrating,'' Barton said.
``You have a one-day involvement (in filling out a form), but you don't see where your money is going.
The greater reward is getting to participate''.
The Kansas City Health Department has donated land at 24th and Campbell streets.
Safety Street is scheduled to open there in the fall of 2001.
MEXICO CITY _ While members of Mexico's latest generation of student revolutionaries are known to quote Karl Marx, they also sport dreadlocks and are more likely than not to have some parts of their bodies pierced.
They flaunt hair colors that range from fluorescent marine-green to a bold stripe of spray-paint red.
Yet they see themselves in the tradition of Cuba's Che Guevara or Mexico's Subcomandante Marcos.
If this were a Hollywood script, it might be tagged ``Emilio Zapata meets Generation X''.
Indeed, among the thousands of idealistic students involved in one of the biggest university protests here since the late 1960s, many now believe that what started out as a fight over an increase in tuition can be transformed into a left-wing movement that will reach far beyond the confines of campus politics.
Whether the rest of Mexico will go along is another question.
``For me, this is a social movement,'' said Ana Paula Lira, a 19-year-old dentistry student, as she stood guard at the gate of one of the now-barricaded entrances to the vast Mexico City campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM.
Inside, striking students have turned classrooms into dormitories and kitchens.
Late into the night, they play chess and talk politics.
During the days, they hold protests, teach children's theater and modern dance in their own open university, and try to convince commuters on buses and the city's subway that there is something fundamentally wrong with the direction Mexico is going on the cusp of the 21st century.
``We just don't want to change the university _ what we want is a social movement that will help the people,'' Lira said.
The protest has shut down Latin America's largest university for more than 3 months and forced most of its 276,000 students and 30,000 professors to go off campus for classes.
Frustrated university officials finally canceled the spring semester earlier this month.
But as a social movement, the strike has a particular problem: Nobody, including the strikers, seems to know exactly what they want.
Unlike the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, which initially drew wide sympathy from the left and the country's urban poor, Mexican society has an ambivalent relationship with its new revolutionaries.
Polls suggest that the majority of Mexicans don't approve of the strike.
Talks between university officials and the students have broken down repeatedly.
Officials now say they will no longer even sit down with the strike leaders until the students promise to abandon the campus that they have occupied since April.
``They're only hurting themselves,'' said Maria Isabel Castro, a 76-year-old grandmother, as she tended a market stand in the city's center.
``I say the ones who want to study should study and the rest, throw them out in the street''.
Even so, nearly everyone has been surprised by the determination of the students and a capacity to organize that has repeatedly brought supportive crowds of thousands into the capital's streets and the university's main square.
The strike appears to have tapped the frustration of a generation that has grown up as Mexico has stumbled from one economic crisis to another.
Real wages have dropped dramatically since the early 1980s, analysts say, and the inequality gap that separates rich from poor has grown.
``This is a moment when some sectors of society feel alienated, and the youth are reacting to that,'' said Sergio Aguayo, a political analyst.
``Forty to 50 percent of this country lives in poverty''.
That may explain why the strikers didn't stop June 7, when the university's president gave in to their primary demand and withdrew his proposal for a mandatory increase in fees from the current equivalent of about 2 cents per semester _ effectively free _ to about $150.
The students had won, but they had also captured the public pulpit and seemed unwilling to give it up.
They have added several more demands, including a restructuring of how the university is governed.
But it is also clear from interviews with students and their faculty supporters that many hope the strike can spark a nationwide political movement that can connect with workers, primary and secondary school teachers, and other universities _ invigorating the country's left in a grand, grass-roots coalition.
``One of the engines of democratization in the country over the last 30 years has been the public university.
That's what you're seeing now _ the university moving to recapture this national role,'' said Carola Garcia Calderon, a professor of communication in the faculty of political and social sciences, which has served as the movement's nerve center.
Yet not much agreement has emerged on what this larger movement ought to be about.
Recent protests have lashed out against targets as varied as the World Bank, Mexico's stock market, the country's news media, the United States and university entrance exams.
``They don't have a clear message, and the image that they are projecting of themselves is quite radical,'' Aguayo said.
``In a way, this is a nostalgic moment.
They are trying to appeal to a Mexico that no longer exists''.
Most analysts say confused goals and apparent intransigence will limit the students' capacity to expand their following.
Internal splits are already forming.
After weeks of brewing dissent, a sizable group of students broke ranks July 18 over the issue of whether they should hand over the campus to help restart negotiations.
In the end, the most significant thing about the students' uprising may be that they can shut down a massive university, march in the streets, hand ultimatums to government negotiators and, through it all, give the authorities little choice but to stand by and wait it out.
It's a dramatic contrast to Mexico's leftist student movement of 1968 that ended when federal troops opened fire on the protesters in a square, killing, by one estimate, nearly 200.
Private papers of the general who was Mexico's secretary of defense at the time were made public last month.
The documents show that members of the presidential bodyguard team fired on the students and that the order came directly from the president, Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, something long denied by successive governments.
This time around, such intervention would be hard to imagine in a Mexico obsessed with its international image and securing a role in the global economy.
The army has said it will not intervene.
Authorities have not ruled out police action, but a recent poll in the daily Reforma indicates that while public opinion does not support the strike, it is also overwhelmingly against using force to stop it.
With the most competitive presidential election in the country's modern history shaping up for next year, observers say direct intervention would present too much of a political risk for the government of President Ernesto Zedillo.
``The police aren't entering to retake the campus because no one in the government is prepared to pay the consequences of even a single student dying,'' said Denise Maerker, the host of a TV interview program.
``Nineteen sixty-eight was another Mexico, another society altogether''.

It's the day you've either been dreading or, perhaps, secretly awaiting _ the day your baby graduates from high school and leaves home or maybe comes home again after college.
But whether you're weeping with joy or despair, the gift you give is a great way of showing your grad how well you understand his or her angst and ambitions.
Youth Intelligence recently asked more than 1,000 high school and college seniors what they'd like for graduation.
Not surprisingly, the most common requests were for the newest technology, but there were still a few desired items that don't need a manual.
Here are some of the hottest gifts on the Gen-X hit list.
PORTABLE DVD PLAYER The No.
1 requested gift (other than cash) was a portable DVD player.
Portable DVD players run on batteries and can go anywhere.
I've even seen people in New York City walking down the street watching a movie.
At a list price of approximately $1,000, this is a costly purchase, but one I know your grad will love.
DIGITAL CAMERA When it comes to capturing graduation memories, today's seniors won't settle for old-fashioned photos.
More than 65 percent of the respondents we surveyed wanted a digital camera.
While most adults can't turn one on, the next generations can have a picture cropped, re-colored and e-mailed to their classmates before you say cheese.
Plan to spend between $300 and $1,500 to make your grad happy.
MOBILE PHONE Whether your grad is switching apartments, traveling or just avoiding the prying eyes of parents, Gen X considers the personal phone a necessity.
Although Nokia ruled the roost with ther sleek, silver version, Motorola's V series, just out a few months and priced at around $500, is gaining steam.
Hipsters in Los Angeles and New York carry them, and grads crave the streamlined size and Internet access.
Before you buy any phone, make sure that your grad's phone carrier can use it _ though if a particular model is a ``must have,'' your grad may prefer to switch carriers.
SPORTY KICKS (shoes, that is) Air Prestos are the coolest shoes in town.
When I recently wore a pair to a high school in Los Angeles, I was mobbed by teens who wanted them, and one offered me twice the retail price ($85).
Nike is a trailblazer once again.
These athletic shoes weigh almost nothing (which makes them easy to pack) but provide support and comfort (which suits the adventurous athlete).
It doesn't hurt that they come in a dazzling array of colors.
CHARM BRACELET You might have purchased one of these for your daughter on her fifth birthday and you'd swear she misplaced it by her seventh.
Chances are you'll soon see it emerge from the depths of her dresser.
Charm bracelets are back big time.
Young people hunger for some of the things that previously brought them comfort.
In addition, charms provide ultimate individualization.
Each one tells a story.
PERSONALIZED STATIONERY In a world of technology and gadgets, instant messaging and e-mails, young people are telling me that when it really counts, they'd rather write a letter.
Elaborate papers (translucent, in unique shapes or with pressed flowers,) help them feel that they're sending something special.
SUMMER STUFF Sooner or later your grad will head to the beach and this is a great way to buy a gift that isn't too expensive.
Of course stylish sunners won't settle for plain old beach towels (so pre-senior).
Instead, they have their eyes on a beach mat.
The most coveted are from a company called Inca (I saw some hot versions at Fred Segal in Santa Monica a couple of weeks ago), which also have matching straw bags.
When it comes to sunglasses, you can't go wrong with aviators.
The coolest ones are from Stussy and Chloe, but XOXO offers a less expensive version.
The hippest lenses are burgundy, but make sure they have strong UVA/UVB protection as often the tinted lenses don't provide it.
CYBER MONEY If you still don't know what to get, let your grad decide.
Buy some online money from CyberMoola.com, Flooze.com or Internetcash.com.
Each of these sites has multiple online stores from which the recipient can choose.

FORT WORTH, Texas _ We can assume that the Rev.
Edgar Helms of Boston _ who, in 1910, founded what would become Goodwill Industries _ was not hip.
Neither was the good reverend, most likely, groovy.
He certainly didn't know that gray would become the new black.
Nonetheless, hip is how a new breed of Goodwill shoppers has come to consider the retail stores.
Due in part to Generation X's preternatural nostalgia for all things from the '70s (and '80s and even early '90s, it seems) and thanks to image-building efforts from the organization itself, Goodwill isn't just for people with ``special needs'' anymore.
``I was Goodwill before Goodwill was cool,'' says local twentysomething bohemian Bret McCabe.
``I've been going there for about a decade.
My shopping technique, wherever I've lived, is to find the poorest neighborhood and to go there.
You avoid places where hipsters go because they'll sift through everything and get the good stuff.
They won't go to the poor neighborhood''.
Like most Goodwillers, McCabe speaks lovingly of a favorite find.
``It was an early '70s-era purple, shiny three-piece suit, with, like, huge lapels.
It had a sheen to it,'' he says.
``I paid about $1.50 or $2.
But I gave it to a friend because it looked better on him.
He had an Afro''.
McCabe does admit to having ``special needs,'' but not the sort that Goodwill has strived to meet for almost a century.
The nonprofit organization uses revenues from its stores to fund community-based training and job-placement programs for people who otherwise might slip through the cracks.
Last year, Goodwill Industries served more than 200,000 people through training and job placement and sold nearly $690 million in donated goods.
Erin Quillian, the director of sales for Goodwill Industries of Fort Worth, says her organization got its groove back by focusing on retail display in the stores.
``I think a lot of it really has to do with changing our image and the way we present ourselves,'' she says.
``We're not what people typically think a thrift store is.
It's surprising to a lot of people, when they first come in, that we look just like any other store''.
Quillian says the national trend within Goodwill is to recruit store managers who have retail experience, people who ``really know how to set up a store and really create some excitement in it''.
Quillian herself worked at Ross Dress For Less and Dillard's before coming to Goodwill.
But perhaps the most surprising thing about Goodwill is not that bohemian hipsters snatch up the retro threads hanging on its well-displayed racks, but that the decidedly downscale shop founded by a Methodist minister is actually shaping the future of upscale fashion.
Doubters need look no further than the Dallas-based design firm William Reid.
William Reid's fall line graces such high-end shops as Stanley Korshak, Takashimaya and Saks Fifth Avenue.
Reid is so hip that sources say he knows what the new gray is _ or at least has a good idea.
And, as it turns out, he shops Goodwill for inspiration.
``It's almost like a fashion library,'' Reid says.
``I go in there just looking for things that are very unusual, whether it's details or fabrics or certain silhouettes that you can't explain to someone.
We find a lot of old ties, and we'll take a pattern of that tie and put it in the computer and play with it a little bit and make it into shirts and all sorts of things''.
In fact, Reid has found clothes at Goodwill whose sartorial splendor has stymied the finest craftsmen of Italy.
Only a few weeks ago, he bought a jacket for $15.
``It was a leather jacket that had this braiding stitched around the cuff,'' he remembers fondly.
``It was so unusual.
We immediately sent it over to our manufacturers and said, `How difficult is it to do this'?
They laughed and said they couldn't touch it.
The machinery to do some of those things just isn't around anymore''.

(Undated) Here's a top 10 list of what drives workers crazy.
I picked it up at a seminar for human resource and diversity trainers.
Workers hate: 10.
Tiny raises.
9. Insincere thanks.
8. Being thrown into jobs without the necessary qualifications or training.
7. Disorganized, messy workplaces.
6. Bosses who share the stress of visits from their bosses.
5. ``Do it because I said so'' management.
4. Supervisors who overlook unacceptable behavior.
3. Management that ignores ideas from employees.
2. Failure to give consistent feedback or recognition when it's due.
1. Micromanagement.
Does that hit your button?
How old are you?
According to a training video, ``The X Factor: Managing and Motivating Generation X,'' that's the pet peeve list for Gen X, the work set younger than baby boomers.
Funny, I like that list.
And, judging from other nodding heads at the seminar, so did my fellow boomers.
The older-than-boomer bunch was bobbing in agreement, too.
It seems to me that meeting the needs of Gen X in the workplace is, or at least should be, the same as meeting the needs of everybody else.
The only difference is that Gen Xers have been brave enough to broadcast their demands.
Boomers and boomer-plus workers were too busy keeping their noses clean and being loyal to employers.
Oops. Too late.
Many found that the objects of their devotion didn't return, much less reward, that loyalty when it came time to make important decisions.
The Gen Xers, who grew up watching their parents regroup and rebuild their work lives, are left to insist, ``You need me.
You need my skills.
So here's what I want.
I want you to recognize me _ and pay me well _ for doing it''.
Claire Raines, a consultant who specializes in Gen X research and whose video we viewed, says workers in their 20s and early 30s are blunt about their wants.
They say: - Appreciate me and show it.
My regular paycheck is not enough.
- Give me flexible hours so I can accommodate my outside interests.
Work is not the only important thing in my life.
- Train me.
I need portable, marketable skills to take from job to job.
- Listen to me and involve me in planning and decision-making that affects me.
I will work better if I feel ``ownership''.
- Walk your talk.
I can spot phonies and despise them.
- Lighten up.
Work can be fun, even under pressure.
Once again: Does the list strike a chord?
How old are you?
Pinning labels on groups, be they segmented by age, race, gender or ethnicity, is a convenient but dangerous thing.
Beware of building monoliths.
It's not that easy.
But if Raines, or any other consultant, wants to share basic and sound workplace advice for any group, so be it.
And if the Gen Xers, who are said to be good at handling change, comfortable with technology, not intimidated by authority, and creative, can help create dynamic, rewarding workplaces for themselves, then maybe the rest of us can wade in their ripples.
SMYRNA, Tenn.
(AP) -- Nissan launched its new Xterra sport utility vehicle Monday, but it didn't simply roll off an assembly line.
Covered in mud, a silver Xterra drove out of a smoking 20-foot backpack to the throbbing beat of loud music as hundreds of Smyrna plant workers wearing ``Xterra looks good dirty'' T-shirts cheered.
``That's how a real SUV should look,'' said Jerry Benefield, Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp.
president and chief executive officer.
Company officials hope the Xterra (pronounced ehks-TEH'-ruh), Nissan's first totally new product since the Altima in 1992, will help the troubled carmaker boost sales by attracting active, young outdoor enthusiasts.
The name is intended to link images of Generation X and rugged terrain.
This SUV will not have leather seats, but there is an option for neoprene covers, which could be useful to surfers or scuba divers who climb in while wet.
The Xterra has room in the back for two mountain bikes to be placed in vertically, and mounts to hold them.
The optional roof rack can be fitted to hold snowboards, skis, canoes, kayaks and bikes.
And the Xterra has a ``backpack'' on its rear, accessible with the tailgate lifted, to hold a first-aid kit or other gear.
The Xterra goes on sale in early June, priced between $17,500-$25,000.
Most buyers are expected to take the two-wheel drive version with a V-6 engine, manual transmission and air -- costing about $18,500, Nissan spokesman Jason Vines said.
Nissan plans to make at least 60,000 Xterras the first year, with top production capability at the plant of about 75,000.
In addition to the Xterra, Nissan is also counting on the redesigned Maxima and the Frontier Crew Cab truck to help turn the Japanese automaker around.
Last week, Nissan executives said they expected a $296.6 million loss for the fiscal year ended March 31.
The company, which recently entered a partnership with Renault SA of France in order to get a $5.4 billion cash infusion, plans to drop production and slash 5,000 jobs.
But Nissan North American president Minoru Nakamura said sales on this continent are expected to increase from around 630,000 Nissan and Infiniti vehicles to 700,000 for the 1999 fiscal year.
He said the Xterra should bring ``good showroom traffic'' that helps boost the sale of other Nissan vehicles, similar to what happened when Volkswagen began selling its new Beetle.
DETROIT (AP) -- When G.
Richard Wagoner Jr.
assumes the job of CEO of General Motors Corp.
on June 1, he will be the youngest chief executive ever at GM, running the world's largest automaker at age 47.
But whether he can keep the company in good health will depend in part on improving GM's standing among consumers half his age.
With rivals hustling harder for younger buyers, Wagoner will have to show that GM can compete profitably for those consumers and keep bringing them back as they grow older.
"I think it's critical that we engage that group," Wagoner said Friday.
"History has shown that when you get a buyer into your family and treat them well, it's easier to keep them than to attract someone new.
"We've got to focus on products that meet their needs.
The challenge has been getting something that's eye catching...
at a price point that they want to pay".
The average American car buyer is in their early 50s, the time of life when many Americans are able to afford new vehicles more often.
While GM remains strong with older buyers, research from The Polk Co.
shows that the vehicle lines with the most pull with buyers under the age of 35 are imports -- namely makes such as Isuzu, Honda and Volkswagen.
While Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn sell about one-fifth of their vehicles to customers under 35, the number drops precipitously for other GM vehicle lines, Polk found.
Karen Piurkowski, director of loyalty with Polk, said buyers in the age range from 23 to 35, commonly labeled Generation X, tend to consider foreign manufacturers more than their predecessors.
"GM has a big challenge ahead of them as people move up through these population segments," she said.
"It's not as natural for (Generation X members) to be as loyal to a domestic manufacturer, whereas the baby boomers were always a Ford family or a GM family".
Younger buyers have not always been a major concern of automakers, since they tend to choose cheaper, smaller vehicles that carry slim profits.
In recent years, GM has shifted its attention from small cars to trucks and sport utility vehicles.
The company has said it loses money on every Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire it builds; those models will be 10 years old by the time GM brings out their replacements in 2004.
"Our research on younger buyers says they aren't necessarily interested in small cars," Wagoner said.
"I don't necessarily believe that traditional small cars with more progressive styling are what young buyers are after".
Other automakers have gone after younger buyers with more force.
Among the new vehicles targeted at the market are Chrysler's Neon and upcoming PT Cruiser, the Toyota Echo and Ford's Focus -- all well-equipped models that carry far more options than cars of that size and price had before.
Ford said Friday that one fourth of all Focus buyers so far were under 25 years old -- a higher share of younger buyers than any other vehicle sold in the United States.
To compete with those models, Wagoner said GM would use more expressive vehicles that are a step above the bottom of the market.
He points to the Pontiac Aztek, a new SUV coming out this year and the Pontiac Piranha, a concept car that will be shown for the first time at this week's Chicago Auto Show, as the types of vehicles that eventually will bring younger buyers back into the GM fold.
"Our view is that we're increasingly focused on the kind of things that will attract youthful (buyers) into the family," Wagoner said.
"That's why we're putting so much more emphasis on the Internet, because more people are using it and because of the kind of people that are using it as well".
Analyst Jim Hall with AutoPacific said the Aztek and an upcoming Saturn SUV had the potential to make GM a contender for those consumers.
"The fact that they're developing vehicles like that at all is amazing," Hall said.
"Their attitude for a long time was that they were going to be a fast second to market with a new product.
The irony is that being second to market is a losing proposition."
ATLANTA _ The first automobile to carry the year 2000 on its registration papers is likely to be the redesigned Dodge/Plymouth Neon.
Other manufacturers have announced 2000-model-year products, but with the first 2000 Neons being shipped to retailers this month, the DaimlerChrysler-built compact should go down in the record books as the first 2000 to take to the roads.
Conceived in '94 to target the Generation X market segment, Neon now claims to be ``grown up but not old''.
With a base price of $12,890, Neon boasts about its roominess, affordability, fun and refinement.
Neon has included as standard those options most frequently ordered in the past.
``D'' package buyers will get AM/FM/cassette with six speakers, four cup holders, a 60/40 fold-down split rear seat, intermittent wipers, rear defroster, visor vanity mirror, floor mats and a trunk light.
For an additional $1,760, ``G'' package purchasers get remote keyless entry, theft alarm, tilt steering, cruise control, power windows and door locks, and air conditioning.
Optional four-wheel anti-lock brakes, traction control and alloy wheels are also offered.
Cab-forward design Outside, Neon shares the cab-forward design pioneered by Chrysler.
A new rear-end and taillamp treatment along with more prominent wheel arches add to a more substantial appearance.
Finally, the Neon gets full-framed doors that increase body stiffness, improve window fit and reduce wind noise.
On the performance side, Neon has a 132-horsepower 2.0-liter engine.
A manual gearbox remains standard with an automatic optional.
Complementing the new ``refined'' exterior, taupe has been added as an interior color choice, but gone are the lizard greens, chrome yellows and periwinkle purple exterior colors of the original Neon.
Exterior colors include metallic silvers, garnet and jade.

Everyone seems to have his or her own idea about what ``Generation X'' means.
Is it: A) the name of the so-so punk band Billy Idol led over a decade and a half go?
B) the title of the 1991 ``groundbreaking'' novel by Douglas Coupland?
C) the title of the exploitative Marvel comic book series?
D) the buzzword of the decade (after ``information superhighway'') misused to describe anyone between 20 and 29 years old?
The answer is, of course, all of the above, but the definition we're most concerned with here is ``D''.
In the '90s, ``Generation X'' is a fashionable synonym for twentysomethings like ``baby boomers'' was for thirtysomethings in the '80s.
The problem is ``Gen X'' also comes with plenty of connotational baggage, giving rise to conflicting interpretations and semantic confusion.
Some have taken Generation X to mean the ``jilted generation'' (from the 1995 Prodigy album Music for the Jilted Generation) -- ``jilted'' in the economic sense.
If it were as simple as that, this article would end right here, right now -- but it isn't and this article doesn't.
For a crash course on popular Gen X mythos, rent the Winona Ryder-Ethan Hawke flick Reality Bites and overdose on all the color-by-numbers Gen X cliches.
He's a slacker!
She's an aspiring filmmaker!
He's gay!
Their parents are divorced!
They're dancing to ``My Sharona''!
By the time of its release in 1994, the movie's stereotypical Gen X characters were just that -- stereotypes.
According to Generation Ecch!, the definitive 1994 satirical tome on the Gen X phenom by Jason Cohen and Michael Krugman, it all started with a 1990 Time cover story that christened the post-boomer generation the ``twentysomething'' generation, an echo of thirtysomething, that dreary TV show about angst-ridden boomers who dressed incredibly well.
``Baby buster'' was the catchphrase for a while, as was ``13th generation,'' before stumbling out of vogue and allowing ``Generation X'' to seize the buzzword throne.
If ``Gen X'' is the king of buzzwords, then ``slacker'' is prince, bestowed staying power by Richard Linklater's 1991 cult hit film of that name.
To further complicate matters, according to 13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail, the definitive 1993 non-satirical tome on the Gen X phenom by Neil Howe and Bill Strauss, Gen X is a mere subset of the ``13ers'', the authors' own coinage.
The number comes from Howe and Strauss' thesis that ``Counting back to the peers of Benjamin Franklin, this generation is the 13th to know the American nation, flag, and Constitution''.
If you're born between 1961 and 1981, you're a 13er, say the authors.
Note, however, that by their definition, 13ers -- and by implication, Gen Xers -- are inherently American.
But thanks to the global hegemony of American media and popular culture, certain Gen X affectations engendered by America's particular socioscape have also taken root abroad, infecting the youths as distant and discrete as those in Singapore.
Some quirks travel better than others.
Sexual paranoia, political correctness, and the trauma of having to live with your parents even though you're over 18 remain exotic notions on our happy, shiny island republic.
Other American Gen X idiosyncrasies take on peculiar mutations.
For instance: In America, you're pessimistic about your financial future because you're stuck at a minimum-wage, dead-end job.
In Singapore, you're pessimistic about your financial future because you haven't made your first million by the time you're 25.
Life's a bitch.
The nexus that unites so-called Gen Xers around the world (apart from being born around the same time) is their common pop cultural experience.
A stoner in Austin, Texas, and a yuppie in Zouk, Singapore, may come from different political processes, different educational systems, different social frameworks, different ethnic upbringing, different economic class, different climate zones; yet put the two together and they'll probably bond over an intense discussion whether Madonna is a slut.
But don't let the label define the generation.
Let the generation define itself.
-- Excerpted from Internet article by S.M.
Ong of Singapore
When he catalogs the ups and downs of going to work for Apple Computer at age 14, several elements are missing from Tom Williams' unflinching, self-critical rap: Finger-pointing.
Blame. Limp surrender to the Fates or impersonal forces beyond his control, be they The Man, The System or The Economy.
Instead, the former wunderkind exhibits a headlong acceptance of personal responsibility, a steadfast refusal to play the victim and a firm acknowledgment that his own decisions -- good or bad -- have given him the life he leads.
``I can't stand people who play victim,'' said Williams, now 21 and living in Los Angeles where he screens technological projects for a venture capital firm.
``None of this was anybody's choice but mine.
No matter how impressionable or naive I have been, it has always been my decision''.
For Jacob Leverich, 18, a freshly minted high school graduate who holds down a sophisticated job at a high-end computer graphics company, pragmatic faith in self is a mantra.
``I can't allow someone to be responsible for my success; I can't allow someone to protect me from failure,'' said Leverich, who is headed to the University of Texas this fall.
``If I fail, it's my responsibility to get back up and back in the game''.
Riding the wave of technological innovation and economic expansion is a back-to-the-future ethic that emphasizes individual initiative and accountability, expressed with the hipness and attitude of youth.
In a land where Jerry Springer is a minor deity and the culture of complaint, alibi and blame is so strong that a conservative commentator once dubbed us a Nation of Victims, such unadulterated blasts of personal responsibility are bracingly refreshing.
``We're moving in the direction of putting a greater emphasis on personal responsibility rather than blaming fate or the social structure,'' said Ted Goertzel, a sociology professor at the Camden, N.J., campus of Rutgers University.
``There's been a shift in societal attitude away from blaming the system and looking for blame in the individual.
It's moving in a direction back toward a more positive view of what you can do rather than complaining about how the system is broke and what you can't do''.
The trend is particularly pronounced among the age groups represented by Leverich and Williams, experts say.
And this provides sharp generational contrast with the graying Baby Boomers just ahead of them on the march through life.
Self-reliance is the common thread between kids like Leverich, at the leading edge of what some sociologists call the Millennium Generation, and young adults like Williams, who is at the tail end of Generation X.
Experts note that Xers manifest this cross-generational trait with a decided cynicism and sense of isolation, while Millennials are more optimistic and more likely to band together.
Remember, though, that this is vague and mushy sociological stuff, lacking the absolutes of atomic physics.
Generation X is an exceedingly broad monicker for anyone born after the Baby Boom and before the Class of 2000 just now leaving high school.
But polls back the notion of generational differences in outlook about responsibility, self-reliance and the power of individual effort.
A July 1999 Pew Research Center survey shows that a significantly higher share of those between ages 18 and 29 -- almost 79 percent -- believe individual effort is the key to success.
In contrast, only 71 percent of those between 30 and 49 believe this.
The same survey shows the younger age group also has the strongest belief in the power of the individual: 84 percent of those 18 to 29 think everyone has the inner strength to succeed in life; only 77 percent of those between the ages of 50 and 64 and 70 percent of those age 65 and older believe this.
Xers and Millennials are also linked by matter-of-fact low expectations about politics, government, corporations and other traditional social institutions, the pros say.
To the degree that they look to others for support or commitment, it's to a loose collective of friends, family or like-minded peers, or non-traditional organizations like non-profits.
They believe in action over words, movement toward a goal rather than discussion of an idea.
``Look at it this way -- if the motto of Generation X is `Just Do It,' then the motto of the Millennials is `Let's Do It,' while the motto of the Baby Boomers is `Let's Meditate About It,''' said Neil Howe, co-author of ``Generations: The History of America's Future''.
In a series of books with co-author William Strauss, Howe argues that American history has been strongly influenced by a cycle of generational traits ranging from idealism to alienation.
Boomers were idealistic until Vietnam, Nixon, the assassinations of the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King Jr.
and the economic upheaval of the '70s and '80s made them disillusioned and inward-looking, Howe said.
Xers are alienated and isolated, taking as a given the empty promise of traditional societal institutions like family and government, arming themselves with the cynical belief that they're on their own.
Howe said the most motivated of this generation turn lone-wolf cynicism into individual action that has positioned them to take advantage of the current economic expansion; those who don't are slackers, missing out on the boom's big ride.
``This is a very libertarian generation,'' Howe said of the Xers.
``They believe you take care of yourself, that you rely on yourself and your platoon, your surrogate family.
... The take was: Life can be cruel, you have to deal with it on your own''.
Still a work in progress, the Millennials are just emerging from high school.
They exhibit the most optimism about the future, a by-product of growing up in nothing-but-good economic times, in an era of renewed emphasis on protecting kids from the ravages of broken homes and other societal forces.
Howe said Millenials are just as cynical about traditional institutions and can be just as alienated as Xers, but he also notes a mighty cross-current -- willingness to join cooperative efforts that aren't self-centered, and belief that they can rise above the challenges of the future.
If that combination persists, it's Howe's belief that the Millenials will take on the mantle of the World War II generation and their unstinting belief in duty, honor and country.
Much of this rings true to Jackson Pace.
The teacher and technology coordinator at Lyndon Baines Johnson High School in Austin, Texas, works closely with the teen computer wizards in the school's special science and technology program, including Jacob Leverich.
The Millennials in his program are technologically savvy, confident that their computer skills are a bankable backstop for the future.
They're unburdened by the baggage carried by boomers -- such as the need to be in touch with every emotion, or the financial worries ingrained by the economies of the '70s and '80s and the Great Depression stories passed down by parents and grandparents.
``There's no overriding fear that they can't whip it, they can't overcome it,'' Pace, 43, said of his students.
``These kids have a full toolbelt of skills.
They analyze quicker, they assess need quicker, they pull the tool, get it done and move on''.
Pace, a Baby Boomer, contrasts this with his own approach to issues: ``I have to know that it's OK, know that you think it's OK, and I want to talk to you about it being OK.
We'll justify our point and then do it.
``These kids process it and get it done with no talk''.
(FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) Pace thinks the Millennials have a decided advantage over Xers -- a willingness to cooperate with each other, a sense of something larger than themselves and a fearlessness born from prosperity and comfort with technology.
``The Xers knew the only reason they were in this world was because that yuppie parent had money and they were another possession,'' said Pace.
``And that created a real cynical kid.
... ``Today's kids really are bubbling up in the last quarter-century as renaissance kids.
They're not money grubbers.
They know they can get the money.
And I'm not sure they're basing their human happiness on cash''.
Leverich echoes this last point: ``What will make me happy is not necessarily making more money.
What will make me happy is to set myself apart and not just be another person off the assembly line''.
(FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS) Technology is the key to this confident self-reliance, said Mary Ann Rafoth, professor of educational psychology at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
Computer competence gives adolescents and young adults a taste of success at a crucial stage of life, a boost they are likely to ride into middle age.
``They see technology as a big part of the future and they're comfortable with it,'' Rafoth said.
``They tend to be individualistic and see themselves in control and not the pawns of giant, impersonal forces.
That's because they haven't lived through a Vietnam or World War II.
They see it as getting what they want out of life and nothing stopping them and technology enabling to do that''.
The flip side of this confidence is an uninformed arrogance, an unwillingness to acknowlege the value of life experiences outside the narrow band of technological competence.
It is the thing that drives boomers to crazed distraction when they confront Xers and Millennials.
``They may be more sophisticated and more knowlegeable about one thing -- technology -- and because of that they won't give you credit for the things you've lived through,'' Rafoth said.
(SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) Howe, who runs management seminars, says fixation on technology exacerbates the biggest cultural clash in the modern workplace -- the conflict between boomer-era managers and Xers who discount what their elders have lived through.
``Boomers are into mission statements and corporate culture and creating a sense of community and team play,'' said Howe.
``Xers are much more contractual about work.
`If it's 5 o'clock, I'm outta here'.
They say they bring to the job all they need to bring.
They don't bring all the baggage and expectations that boomers bring''.
Millennials share this transactional attitude about work, but sport it with less of a nasty edge.
``Instead of being the enemy of these corporations, it's just where we go to work,'' said Leverich.
``I don't see them as my enemy, but I don't see them as my savior, either''.
Williams, who sometimes sounds like a world-weary boomer instead of the tail-end Xer he is, buys the notion that his generation believes in self- determination.
But he doesn't see this as something noble.
Deserted by divorcing parents and discredited social institutions, Xers had no choice but to rely on their own devices, he says.
And he doesn't see his generation or the Millennials as any less self- absorbed than the boomers.
As proof he cites the resiliance of conspicuous consumption, wide reliance on the anti-depressant Prozac and the popularity of the public self-confessional.
Still, he wryly notes the grit and high-tech gumption of his peers and the next generation down.
``Maybe it was Steven Spielberg,'' he jokes.
``All of his movies, which we all grew up on, feature kids overcoming problems and saving the adults.
We've grown up with this very surreptitious, but very strong can-do attitude.
``The limitation of my father's generation and his father's generation was to never dare something beyond your station in life.
Today, those self-imposed mental barriers are no longer there.
You can do almost anything and accomplish almost anything you set out to accomplish.''
&UR; &LR; Tom Beaudoin is not your typical theologian engaged in esoteric explications of ancient religious texts.
Instead, he uses MTV as a research lab.
He studies tattoos and body piercing as expressions of spirituality.
And he's also in a rock band made up of other theologians.
Beaudoin, 29, is a self-described Generation Xer, that amorphous population cohort born in the mid-1960s to the late 1970s.
Beaudoin wants to be their theologian.
He believes that Generation X _ contrary to popular perception _ is deeply spiritual, if not necessarily devout.
You just need to look at their taste in music, movies, and dress, says Beaudoin, a PhD candidate at Boston College.
He makes his case in a new book, ``Virtual Faith: The Irreverent Spiritual Quest of Generation X''.
It isn't that Generation X isn't interested in religion, Beaudoin argues.
It's simply that its members are looking for a religion they can believe in.
And what GenXers are after can't easily be found within the four walls and under the steeple of the local church.
To understand the spirituality of Generation X you have to look at popular culture, particularly media culture.
There has never been another generation, Beaudoin says, so intimately linked to media culture _ the Internet, television, film, and music.
``Pop culture is our amniotic fluid; it's where we find meaning in our life,'' says Beaudoin, a Roman Catholic who strayed from the faith for a few years before becoming convinced that the church's tradition and teachings can appeal to people in his generation.
Sitting in his Somerville apartment, overflowing with books and CDs, he ticks off examples of spiritual or religious themes he sees in contemporary youth culture.
There are strong religious or spiritual undercurrents in recent albums by artists ranging from U2 to Sarah McLachlan to Puff Daddy.
Religious messages are also sprinkled more frequently in movies, for example, in ``Contact,'' ``Chasing Amy,'' and even ``Titanic''.
The Dalai Lama has become hugely popular among young people, not just because he is a stirring champion of human rights, but because people are drawn to his Tibetan Buddhist teachings as a way of coping with life's stresses.
Harvey Cox, a renowned professor at Harvard Divinity School where Beaudoin received a master's degree, said at first blush it might seem foolish to suggest that Generation X is interested in spiritual meaning.
But, in a forward to Beaudoin's book, Cox says his former student might be on to something.
``Here is a generation that stays away from most churches in droves but loves songs about God and Jesus, a generation that would score very low on any standard piety scale but at times seems almost obsessed with saints, visions, and icons in all shapes and sizes,'' Cox writes.
``These are the young people who, styrofoam cups of cappuccino in hand, crowd around the shelves of New Age spirituality titles in the local book market and post thousands of religious and quasi-religion notes on the bulletin boards in cyberspace''.
And, Beaudoin and Cox both note that Pope John Paul II enjoys a strong following among people in the Generation X population.
Last summer, even the Vatican was stunned when more than a million young people turned out to help John Paul celebrate World Youth Day in Paris.
Beaudoin, in his book, identifies several themes that underpin the ``theology'' of Generation X.
First is a deep suspicion of institutions, including organized religion.
Second is the importance of having a personal spiritual experience.
Beaudoin says the Catholic Church, in its liturgy, must do a better job of ``giving people a powerful experience of the Holy Spirit, which is the only way people will realize there is something at stake to being Catholic''.
A third theme among Generation Xers is a belief that suffering can be a redemptive, spiritual experience.
Finally, Generation Xers believe ambiguity is a central part of faith.
Rather than fearing uncertainty, Beaudoin says, Generation Xers embrace it.
Beaudoin has started a Catholic ministry aimed at people in Generation X at the Paulist Center in downtown Boston.
``GenXers are hungry for spirituality and the challenge is to find the most effective means of satisfying that hunger,'' he said.
&QL; &QL; Religion Notes &QL; &QL; A Vatican envoy has recently visited Iraq, reportedly to discuss the possibility of adding that nation to a possible millennium tour of the Holy Land by Pope John Paul II.
The Iraqi town of Ur is the traditional home of the prophet Abraham before he set out with his family for the biblical land of Canaan.
Abraham is revered by Christians, Jews, and Muslims.
The tour would include stops in Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Palestinian self-rule territories.

AGOURA HILLS, Calif.
_ Generation X consumers prefer compact and premium midsize vehicles, with their No.
1 choice being the Honda Civic, according to a report released Tuesday by Agoura Hills-based J.D.
Power and Associates.
But that 20- to 34-year-old group is a highly fragmented lot and, thus, a tough bunch to market to _ which is something carmakers are going to have to learn to do, as this group is expected to constitute one-quarter to one-third of the car-buying public by 2005, the study said.
Also, the study found that older Gen-Xers rely on the Internet to obtain information before buying a car much more frequently than do 20- to 24-year-olds, who have less access to the Internet, are first-time buyers and tend to turn to family and friends for input.
``One other interesting finding is that Generation X is more willing to stretch its income to buy a vehicle,'' said Sara Wong Hilton, manager of market analysis at Power's Detroit office, who led the study.
Gen-Xers will pay about 46 percent of their annual household income on a new vehicle, vs.
35 percent for baby boomers.
Lynda Sakamaki-Smith, spokeswoman for American Honda Motor Co.
Inc., said she wasn't surprised to hear that Honda models are among Gen-Xers' favorites.
The company has sold 129,531 1999 Civics through May, and the median age is 28 for the sportier coupe model.
About half the Civic buyers are single; 46.5 percent are male, 53.5 percent are female; and 55 percent are college graduates or higher, spokeswoman Sakamaki-Smith said.
``This Generation X group sees (the Civic's) potential for fun, but it's reliable at the same time,'' she said.
The fairly widespread notion that America's young adults at century's end are navel-gazing, latte-scarfing me-firsters is bogus, says Mark Gearan.
He should know.
As director of the Peace Corps for 3 1/2 years, he's shoveled thousands of Peace Corps volunteers off to the backwaters of the planet.
These are not plush Club Med vacations, but two-year commitments, often in the Back of Beyond, to work with folks at ground level who usually have little in the way of tools but their hands.
``This fall we'll have 7,400 volunteers abroad _ that's the highest number in 25 years.
Right now we have 6,700 in 80 different countries.
We're making a big push to get up to 10,000 volunteers.
So for those who paint the young people of `Gen X' or `Gen Y' as slackers, we don't see that''.
Nor, apparently, does the Congress, which two weeks ago approved money to expand the Peace Corps, a rare show of bipartisan support for a Clinton initiative.
Flying to Boston first thing on the morning after the White House St.
Patrick's Day bash, Gearan, the Gardner native who was deputy chief of staff and White House communications director in Clinton's first term, clicked off his agency's growth rings: ``Four years ago we had 100,000 inquiries a year.
Last year we had 150,000.
Friday night in Symphony Hall, the Handel &AMP; Haydn Society of Boston and New Heritage Music Foundation will present ``Celebrating the Voice of Peace,'' to commemorate the Peace Corps's founding 38 years ago by President Kennedy.
David McCullough, the author and PBS broadcaster, will narrate from writings of JFK and his favorite poets.
``I'm praying the pianist gets sick,'' cracked Gearan, a saloon piano player of some note.
The Handel &AMP; Haydn Society approached him two years ago about celebrating Kennedy's Peace Corps scheme, he said.
The oratorio composed by Dan Welcher is the first work commissioned by the Society in 20 years.
There will be a 3 p.m.
Symphony Hall matinee performance Sunday.
From its creation in 1961, the first year of JFK's 1,000-day presidency, the Peace Corps was a beacon of optimism and neighborliness that has served the country well.
So far 152,000 Americans volunteered for short money and long hours in remote spots which needed a school, a well, a Ground Zero health program.
There are 38 American volunteers who'll rendevous in Symphony Hall and fly out Saturday to Senegal in West Africa.
``There is certainly the same sense of travel and adventure in today's volunteers that we've had since '61,'' said Gearan, ``but now they're getting their experience in the global economy''.
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala is a Peace Corps alum, as are Senator Chris Dodd and five congressmen, three of them Republicans.
Unlike the $30,000 to $50,000 college bonuses the military uses to lure high school-graduating recruits in this almost-full-employment age, the Peace Corps's applicant pool is average age 28, almost all of them recent college graduates.
Once selected, they get a get a modest monthly stipend to live on, plus full health insurance, and deferments on college loans, if any.
On completing their two-year stint, they get a readjustment allowance of $6,000.
Gearan in the past month was in Africa and Latin America with Clinton.
``In Tanzania I sat with Charlie Stith (the Boston minister who is US ambassador there) and the Tanzanian prime minister, who said the first American he ever met was his Peace Corps teacher.
You hear that all over Africa and the Third World''.
But not all idealists are young people.
One volunteer out of 12 is over age 50.
Massachusetts furnishes more volunteers than all but four other states, said Gearan.
Among the top 25 colleges feeding the Peace Corps are UMass, Tufts, Smith, Williams, BU, and Gearan's alma mater, Harvard (he is class of '78).
Gearan started a new Crisis Corps, to recruit former volunteers to go back for short stays to countries hit by natural disaster or humanitarian crises.
``In Honduras on the last trip, we have one guy who's an engineer on the Central Artery project here.
He's taking two months to go back to Honduras to help out after Hurricane Mitch.
He's a perfect example of a guy who's been there; he can go in and literally on Day One be ready to make a difference''.
Elaborate efforts are made to furnish volunteers with training, language skills, and medical precautions.
Not one volunteer has been kidnapped, and ``safety and security are our No.
1 priority''.
In-house surveys show a high level of volunteer satisfaction, Gearan said.
``Nine out of ten would volunteer again, and the same proportion would recommend it to others''.
The Peace Corps remains Kennedy's enduring governmental monument.
It made JFK into a worldwide figure of inspiration, the most popular American abroad before Muhammed Ali, the all-time popularity champ.
``We are in countries today which did not exist when the Peace Corps started,'' said Gearan, ``And we're in countries today where you couldn't get a visa as an American''.

Was TJ Maxx trying to promote a more youthful corporate culture when a young manager at a New Jersey store fired several employees over 40?
Talk to Sherry Lang, spokeswoman for TJX Cos.
in Framingham, Mass.
, and her response is an emphatic ``No''.
``By policy, this company does not discriminate against anyone for any reason,'' says Lang.
``We believe their claims have no merit, none at all''.
A class-action lawsuit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last fall alleges TJX Cos.
, parent of the retail chain, had exposed older employees to unfair discipline since August 1995.
Much of the case centers around 59-year-old Betty Heyner, a former sales clerk who claims she was railroaded out of her job back in 1995 because of her age.
Heyner is alleging that many of the problems she experienced while running the jewelry counter at a suburban New Jersey store stemmed from a young supervisor's brash managerial style and unorthodox work habits.
Heyner's former manager could not be reached by telephone to comment.
But if allegations in the case illustrate anything at all, it is that tensions between Generation Xers and senior employees are not uncommon, and when younger managers are in charge of older workers emotions are apt to heighten.
There are now 45 million Generation Xers, born between 1965 and 1977.
Self-starters who would rather be in the driver's seat than wait their turn, many twentysomethings are now moving into coveted managerial positions, jobs baby boomers waited years to get.
``Generation Xers are really the forerunners of a new career paradigm, and they think of themselves as free agents,'' says Bruce Tulgan, founder of Rainmaker Thinking, a New Haven consulting firm that helps companies better understand this generation.
``They move into positions of power quickly because they don't do things the old way, and many are really trying to be the kind of manager they wanted to have''.
What kind of manager is that?
Managers who sidestep rules that get in the way.
Managers who aren't afraid to take chances.
Not surprising, baby boomer employees often describe these new managers as brash, audacious, arrogant, and, yes, a bit threatening.
``Older workers often feel that companies are looking for younger people, that they can bring in people who are younger on a temporary basis and not pay benefits,'' says psychologist Bruce Cedar, a workplace consultant at CMG Associates in Newton.
``The older worker feels more vulnerable.
When you get younger mangers in, oftentimes I've heard it said that older employees feel even more threatened,'' notes Cedar.
``They feel younger people are simply looking for ways to get rid of older, more expensive workers.
This is coming from what individuals feel, and is certainly not based on any company policy''.
The workplace of the 1990s might seem threatening, even volatile, to baby boomers.
Generation Xers, by contrast, have experienced little else but change, and they thrive on it.
``Generation Xers disdain authority for the sake of authority,'' says Tulgan, author of ``Managing Generation X'' (1995 Merritt Publishing, $19.95).
``So, most of the young people who are moving into positions of power tend to soft pedal their authority because of perceived hostility''.
And that can cause problems in the workplace.
``Sometimes they soft pedal their authority so much that when things go wrong, they go ballistic,'' notes Tulgan ``And there may be awkwardness with authority, which can be manifested by inappropriate behavior''.
Heyner claims her 21-year-old manager had temper tantrums and blew up at her without cause.
``One day I saw her blow up, right at the store,'' says Heyner.
``I was stunned.
She started throwing papers around and yelling.
She didn't like the way (the jewelry) was being displayed.
The whole thing was shocking''.
Experts stress most Generation X managers take their responsibilities seriously.
But they don't want to be held back by policies such as seniority.
``There is a myth out there that these young people, as managers, are slackers,'' said Tulgan.
``That's not true.
These are people who have come of age during the most profound changes in our economy since the Industrial Revolution.
For boomers, downsizing and reorganizing and re-engineering may seem totally revolutionary and frightening.
But to Generation Xers, that's just the way things are.
They grew up with it, and they are taking advantage of the changes and transformations''.
Still, experts say, companies would do well to offer these young managers what they crave most: training, plenty of feedback, clear goals, and monthly rewards for job performance.

NEW YORK (AP) -- It was the first day of school for Macy's new assistant buyers.
The twentysomething recruits had barely signed in when one bustled up to training chief Bernadette Commisa, asking: ``How am I doing''?
``That took me back!
We had only just come in and taken attendance,'' Commisa recalls.
``They see the world a little differently than we did''.
Bold, savvy, confident and often demanding, the 45 million youngsters dubbed Generation X are hard to miss in today's workplace, and the staider side of Corporate America is only just learning -- sometimes with eyebrows raised -- to cope with them.
Companies from Macy's to Deloitte Consulting are revamping their training and recruiting programs, educating managers and streamlining communications to better understand and utilize this sometimes maligned generation.
``All we were exposed to was the (images of the) earring in the nose, snowboards and baggy clothing,'' says Deborah Gatti, senior training specialist for Mervyn's department stores.
``We've had to train our culture about the great things about these folks, and their shortcomings, and how we can support them''.
Sandra Bench, a 24-year-old Mervyn's manager in Okemos, Mich.
, is well aware of her generation's mixed reputation.
``To me, Generation X defines an age group; to others, it defines a work ethic and many other things as well,'' she says.
But wait.
Good young workers have always questioned authority, asked lots of questions and rattled their elders' nerves.
Is today's youth so different?
It seems so.
Just as baby boomers were shaped by Watergate and the Vietnam War, the generation that ranges from their 20s up to mid-30s has been influenced by this era of technology, television, daycare, divorce and downsizing.
As a result of growing up in a fast-paced world, these young adults are said to be even more skeptical and impatient with the status quo than previous generations.
Often reared as latchkey children, they're fiercely independent, yet needy -- working well alone but requiring liberal doses of feedback.
Disgusted by their parents' workaholism, they defend their right to a full life outside of work.
``The GenX age group does come to the workplace with different expectations and experiences,'' says Don Blanton, human resources director at Sandia National Laboratories, a Lockheed Martin subsidiary that has revised key management training programs in the last year to include lessons on what makes Generation X tick.
Just take a look at the many companies this generation has started, in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.
Their offices are freewheeling, egalitarian, fast-paced, surf's-up kind of places, where play is taken as seriously as work.
It's no wonder that many conservative companies, run by aging baby boomers, have begun trying to adapt to this younger crowd.
And adapt they must.
A big reason that companies are bothering to bend to the new generation is they are literally ``hot stuff''.
They get three, four or five offers in this tight job market, and many are confident to the point of arrogance.
Further, they move on quickly.
Americans hold an average of nearly nine different jobs by their 30s, according to the Labor Department.
Today's grads are bold enough to ask a prospective employer uncomfortable questions such as, ```If I don't like what my boss says, can I go to the next level'''? says Debbie Herd, manager of college relations for J.C.
Penney. ``With the strong economy...
they can ask those questions that can push a company close to the edge of not liking them,'' says Herd, adding that young candidates have been so tough that J.C.
Penney tossed its ``fluff'' brochures and now gives out hard-core information, even details on salaries, at job fairs and first meetings.
Generation Xers also are making splashes in the workplace.
Macy's East, a division of Federated Department Stores, had to change its training of managers and of new recruits to keep up.
Buyers had problems keeping the new generation of executives ``motivated, stimulated, challenged and growing in their new careers,'' recalls Lawrence Naishtut, until recently vice president of merchant development and recruitment.
About 18 months ago, Macy's began sending top managers to a class on supervising employees that included lessons on Generation X.
``Some of the older management needed to recognize that life has changed,'' said Naishtut.
``Who cares whether (GenXers) are good or bad?
The bottom line is that they are the future''.
At the same time, Macy's began training assistant buyers on what they could expect at work, since paying dues isn't considered a GenX strong suit.
``They're wondering why they're not at the Giorgio Armani show the minute they get placed,'' says Commisa, the merchant training director.
Deloitte Consulting, whose average worker is 35-years-old, responded to GenX demands for feedback by adding to its evaluation process a primer on how to succeed at the company, says human resources managing director Karen Morrell.
GenXers crave such roadmaps in order to manage in a world where workers get downsized regardless of seniority and skills quickly grow obsolete, says Bruce Tulgan, a Generation X consultant.
To satisfy their strong needs for independence and recognition, they also like to feel they're in the driver's seat.
That's why Mervyn's revamped its recruit training from an ad hoc effort largely based on shadowing managers to a more formal program that includes self-paced written studies and active training.
``They've got the remote control,'' says Gatti.
``It's up to them to get through the program''.
Russ Hamilton, a 23-year-old Mervyn's manager in San Jose, Calif.
, thoroughly approves.
``For me, to read about and then actually do it makes me more comfortable with it,'' he says.
``It allows me to feel confident in that task or job''.
His generation is also comfortable drawing the line at too much work.
They are driving companies to allow employees to make use of work-life programs that were little promoted or honestly supported.
They clearly reject the baby boomers' workaholic ethic.
Karen Morrell recalls one Deloitte consultant who, after two years with the company, asked for a year's paid sabbatical.
He didn't get it, but she says she has to admire the Generation X boldness.
``If they want something, they ask for it, ...
(and) it's good business sense to listen,'' she says.
``Their sense of balance and perspective and self-motivation is very good for our business.''
We Americans love our traditions: baseball, the Fourth of July, hot dogs, apple pie, jeans and voting.
Well, we're not exactly in love with voting, or maybe we are and that's why we ignore it.
Voting continues to be a right that only Americans older than 35 show interest in, and somehow members of that group, now parents and grandparents, aren't passing on the practice to their youth.
Americans who are ages 18 to 35, Generation X, who were once thought of as the slacker generation, indeed slack at one duty _ voting.
No longer a glut of sniveling teens, Gen Xers are graduating with degrees, getting hitched, buying homes, setting up 401(k) plans and investing in the latest Internet company, which they are probably running.
However, even with all that adult responsibility, you can bet that more Xers across the nation stood in lines to see ``The Blair Witch Project'' than those who stood in lines to vote in the September elections.Is it apathy?
``Politicians rant and rave about change, but when they get elected, nothing happens,'' said Michael Growe, 32.
A medical technician at a Scottsdale, Ariz.
, clinic, Growe did not vote in September.
He feels the winds of political change are interest groups' hot air.
``With all the lobbyists pushing their views, a single vote won't count,'' Growe said.
However, he forgets the adage that Heather Locklear made famous in her Faberge Organic Shampoo ad: ``You tell your friends and they'll tell their friends and their friends will tell their friends,'' so on and so forth.
One vote produces many.
Locally, since 1994, all voter turnout in the county's bi-yearly elections has languished below 20 precent, according to the Elections Department.
And Generation X is the most lackluster group in terms of voting.
Nationally, the trend is also daunting.
According to the Census Bureau, in 1996 only 39 percent of people ages 18 to 34 cast ballots for a presidential candidate.
That compares with 60 percent of baby boomers, people ages 35 to 64.
Generation X's professors warn that issues demanding their attention exist now.
They point out that the political system is a back-scratching affair between voters and candidates.
Apathy is a detriment.
``Until younger folks get involved, no attention will get paid to issues that hurt them,'' said Kenneth Goldstein, a political-science professor at Arizona State University.
X-ers need to march up the steps of their capitols and down the D.C.
Beltway, trumpeting issues such as Social Security and Medicare reform, public versus private education, and environmental issues, Goldstein said.
Boomers are spanking X-ers at the polls in regards to those issues being addressed for the future of the younger generation.
So, is the Gen-X cohort too self-involved to care?
Studies indicate that members of Gen-X are more likely to volunteer than to vote.
According to the 1997 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts, among people polled about their volunteer efforts in 1996, 35 percent of Americans ages 18 to 24 participated in ``charity work,'' and 41 percent of those ages 25 to 34 did.
Only 39 percent of people ages 18 to 34 voted that same year, a presidential election year.
Fred Solop, a professor at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff who teaches a course in political participation, said his students are aware of issues, but they feel the odds of achieving anything are insurmountable.
``They are concerned with whether they (people 18 to 34 years old) will have access to training and education programs, insurance, adequate health care, environmental issues,'' Solop said.
``(But) there is a sense of despair, that they can't be effective''.
Bill Klain, a Scottsdale, Ariz.
, attorney, feels that despair.
He is registered to vote but hasn't cast a ballot since the 1996 presidential election.
Klain, 30, still considers himself to be concerned, civically involved.
He pays close attention to a range of issues from education to Supreme Court vacancies to tax and Social Security reform.
However, ``I'm not real big on voting,'' Klain, said.
``I've become disillusioned with the two-party system, and I get a feeling of futility''.
To understand the system and the issues, one must be attentive to it.
Inattentiveness is a sign of a generation reared on entertainment, said Tom &UR; Keating, a political-science professor at ASU.
From television to books, everything is flashy, shocking, bright and exciting.
Keating, a boomer in his 50s, noted the stark difference between the text-only books he read as an undergrad and the books he teaches from.
``Now (books come with) four or five colors, cartoons and all kinds of much more flashy stuff,'' Keating said.
He concedes that some students are cognizant of the issues, but that many lack the attention span to follow them.
``Unless you grab their interest in a class discussion early, they're gone,'' he said.
Keating also attributes the lack of interest to the media's portrayal of election campaigns.
People such as Growe and Klain believe candidates fudge on campaign promises because TV and print reporters focus their coverage on interpreting what the candidates mean, rather than on the simple facts of what the candidates say.
``It's like the new biography of Reagan, where the author injects himself,'' Keating said.
``The reporter judges the validity of the candidate when there is no evidence that the reporter has the authority to do so.
Actually, candidates try to fulfill their campaign promises at a high rate''.
One political campaign that recently grabbed the attention of Gen-X-ers was Jesse Ventura's run for governor of Minnesota.
Ventura, a former World Wrestling Federation character, was ushered into Minnesota's governorship on the backs of ballots cast by young people.
Among the youngest voters casting ballots _ those younger than age 30 _ Ventura got nearly half of those votes, according to an exit poll conducted for the ``Minneapolis'' ``Star Tribune'' by Voter News Service among 1,449 voters statewide.
The point was made: When moved to vote, Gen-X is a force worth reckoning with, but what is daunting is that it takes a former TV personality to arouse them.
The generation's boredom with politics is evident in college political-science classes across the nation.
Freshmen interest in keeping up to date with politics is now less than half of what it was in 1966, then 58 percent, according to the American Political Science Association.
Granted, President Kennedy had been assassinated, the civil-rights movement was burning throughout America, and the country's involvement in Vietnam was escalating.
Still, somehow that politically involved 58 percent has not been able to inspire its offspring into political action.
In the 1990s, freshmen interest in keeping up with political affairs has dropped from 42 percent in 1990 to its present record low of 26 percent, AMPSA statistics indicate.
Ann Kissell, 22, summed up Generation X's disillusionment by saying, ``I don't have a lot of faith in political campaigns, and you don't vote for the lesser of two evils''.
In response to the void of indifference, the National Council of State Legislators has passed a resolution calling for education on representative democracy, and the National Association of Secretaries of State devoted its 1999 meeting to considering ways to encourage young Americans to pay attention to politics and to become voters.
The Arizona Secretary of State Office mails a greeting card to teens on their 18th birthdays, reminding them to register.
The office also provides voter registration over the Internet.
``Young people are used to using the Internet, and they can register through the Internet,'' said Jessica Funkhouser, elections director for the Secretary of State Office.
``We're trying to connote turning 18 with being able to vote''.
Although the Secretary of State's elections department reports that Internet registration is catching on, it hasn't translated into a greater number of voters, especially among the young.
Then again, maybe the Internet informed are too young yet to vote and are fixed in a political eddy waiting for their wind of change at 18.
Zaira Balmaceda, 16, a Phoenix-area high school student, provides a positive outlook for Generation Y, or the millennials, Generation X's younger counterpart.
Balmaceda, who said that politics is not a regular subject in her house, still relishes a desire to back issues and choose a candidate sans singlets.
She also, believe it or not, reads the newspaper to keep up on the issues.
``I'm always reading the newspaper to see what's going on and listening to the news,'' Balmaceda said.
``These (politicians) are the people who are going to be deciding the future in our community''. &QL;
TRENTON, Ohio _ In a time when the nation's public schools are devoid of organized prayer, millions of students, teachers and parents bowed their heads Wednesday morning commemorating the annual ``See You at the Pole''.
In Trenton, more than 30 students, teachers and parents gathered at a flagpole outside of Edgewood High School to pray for spiritual guidance.
Generation X-ers put aside their backpacks and joined hands with their parents and teachers to make a ``visible (religious) stand'' just before the start of the school day.
The group prayed for classmates, faculty and teachers as well as for the well-being of the nation and a ``safe school year''.
Freshman Billy McClure said he attended the event ``to help everybody be a witness for God.`` ``Without prayer you don't get anywhere.
You got to pray everyday to keep you strong,'' McClure said.
Senior Janet Tannreuther said she attended in protest of new legislation that bans open religious expression during extracurricular activities including sporting events.
``(I came) to pray with my fellow students because they took away our right to pray at the football games,'' Tannreuther said.
``I thought that was wrong''.
``This event allows us to keep (children) focused upon God,'' said her brother Chris Tannreuther, standing a few feet away.
``He is the answer to all of our problems''.
Government teacher and parent Mike Mignery said the event allowed him to reflect upon legislative laws and freedom of expression.
``You have the right to freely practice your faith.
That is the foremost amendment in the Bill of Rights.
I think it's important for us to do that here at school.
This is lawful.
This is what the courts say we are allowed to do,'' Mignery said.
``I think the reason we are losing many of our rights is because may of us aren't exercising our rights today''.
According to the ``See You at the Pole'' Website, the event draws more than 3 million participants each year.
The site said the event is student initiated and came out of the desire of `` a small group of teen-agers'' from Burleson, Texas, in 1990.

MONTREAL _ Anywhere he goes in Quebec, from a secluded restaurant on the east side of Montreal to the hardware aisles at the Canadian Tire store in suburban St.
Leonard, Claude Meunier makes heads turn.
But if the wildly popular star of Quebec's most watched television program, and the man who helped make Quebec the only place in Canada where Pepsi outsells Coke, happens to step across the provincial border into Ontario or anywhere else in Canada, Meunier's puckish face elicits not the slightest whisper or buzz of excitement.
Language, of course, divides the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec from most of the rest of Canada _ and the rest of North America, for that matter.
And since Meunier's comedy and commercials are done in French, his audience is basically limited to the province.
But language doesn't completely explain how different this province is from the rest of the United States' largest neighbor, or why at times like these _ when the province is holding critical elections that will determine whether there will be another referendum on separation _ the rest of Canada seems to be so at wit's end trying to understand what is going on here.
Take, for instance, something as trivial as traffic.
Quebec is the only province in Canada that does not allow drivers to make a right turn at a red light.
It never has, in part because transportation officials believe it is not safe, despite the experience of the rest of the country, and most of the United States.
Quebecers stand out in many other ways.
They smoke more, get divorced more and, according to one recent poll by the Southam Newspaper chain, are more stressed out than people in the rest of Canada.
More of them tend to be apartment dwellers, more of them rent their homes rather than own them and more of them rely on electric heat than anywhere else in the country, in part because Quebec produces more hydroelectric power than any other Canadian province.
``For Quebecers, to be different is good, even if it doesn't always make much sense,'' said Ted Nation, an advertising executive who lived and worked in Montreal for many years.
``Being different helps them express who they are''.
But more often than not, the differences are actually reflections of a deep and seemingly unbridgeable abyss that separates the 7 million Quebecers from the 22 million people in the rest of Canada.
``It's not so much a question of character as a perception of history,'' said Lise Bissonnette, a French-Canadian author and former editor of the separatist newspaper Le Devoir.
``It has to do with the way Quebecers see their country and that's the basic difference''.
Keep in mind that this is a province where every automobile license plate bears the fighting words ``Je me souviens'' _ `I remember' _ and where many people have trouble thinking of Quebec as just another province like tiny Prince Edward Island.
Quebec is, they insist, usually invoking the history of New France in North America, a founding partner in the very concept of the nation.
``Basically what makes Quebecers different is that we are trying to help our language and our culture survive, and this keeps us very much alive,'' said Meunier during a lunch-time interview just after he had finished filming the last episode of the season of his series, ``Le Petite Vie'' (which roughly translates to `The Daily Life').
The 47-year-old Montreal comic, whose success allowed him to buy a vacation house in Maine recently, said the tension of sustaining a small island of French in a sea of English speakers in North America gives artists and performers in Quebec a spirit that energizes their work.
That is one reason why the arts flourish in Quebec, even though very little makes its way into the rest of Canada.
According to one recent survey, of 3,500 French books published in Quebec, only 40 were translated into English.
And the record for translating English into French is just as grim.
Quebecers discovered the television program ``Baywatch'' two years later than everyone else in North America, and they still don't know who Ally McBeal is because the show isn't dubbed in French yet.
While most of what the rest of Canada watches on television is produced in the United States, more than 70 percent of prime time programming in Quebec is produced in Canada.
And Meunier's weekly television sitcom is the most popular of all.
The streets are deserted in many French-speaking towns when the show is broadcast Monday evenings at 7:30.
Several episodes this season reached over 3.3 million viewers, out of 4 million people who were watching television at the time, giving the show the equivalent of a weighty 74 share.
By contrast, the recent widely watched interview with Dr.
Jack Kevorkian on ``60 Minutes'' got a 24 market share.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) ``Le Petite Vie'' began as a proposed 15-minute filler sketch before the Saturday night hockey game on the French service of CBC five years ago.
Meunier, who was already a popular comedian _ and instantly recognizable in the province because of the successful soft drink commercials _ insisted that a full situation comedy based on homespun Quebec characters could succeed, just as the soft drink commercials worked because Quebecers recognized themselves in the spots.
His oddball comedy is a cross between All in the Family and The Simpsons, with him as the father of a strange family and his longtime comedic partner Serge Theriault as the mother.
It is impenetrable to viewers outside of Quebec even if they can understand the heavily accented French.
``It's about life, about Quebecois life,'' he says, but it also stresses universal characteristics like jealousy, immodesty, vanity and arrogance.
It also tends to poke fun at the personality faults that Quebecers know well, he said.
In the most recent episode, which aired just a week before the Nov.
30 elections for control of the provincial government, the characters addressed the serious question of independence in a way that Canadians elsewhere in the nation would have trouble understanding.
``Quebec would become a country like Sweden,'' boasts one character, repeating a promise separatist leaders have used to justify their attempts to create a country with only 7 million people.
``Then I wouldn't vote for independence,'' says the family's daft daughter, ``because it would be full of Ikea things''.
She was referring to the Swedish company that sells furniture that has to be assembled.
``That would mean,'' she says, pursuing logic that makes Quebecers howl, but leaves other Canadians shaking their heads, ``I might not be able to put together my own country.''
OTTAWA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Canadians believe that the province of Quebec will face partition if it separates from Canada, according to a poll published today.
A Southam News/Compas poll found that up to 78 percent of Canadians outside the French-speaking province anticipate it to lose land as part of the price of independence.
In addition, about 50 percent of Quebecers agree that if Canada is divisible, so is Quebec, according to the poll, which surveyed 2,450 people across the country from May 1 to 7.
The poll found that 92 percent of Canadians living outside Quebec believe the province's Aboriginal people have the right to stay with Canada in the event of a vote for independence.
This view is shared by an overwhelming 75 percent of Quebecers.
The poll results came as the Quebec issue moves to center stage in the ongoing national election campaign.
Further, the results suggest that if Quebecers believe that voting Yes would mean partition, they would be much less likely to vote Yes.
"The issue of partition benefits the federalist side," said Compas chairman Conrad Winn.
"This may explain the sometimes intense reaction of sovereignists to any discussion of the topic".
Before the 1995 referendum, the partition of Quebec was an idea confined to only a few federalist pundits.
The narrow win of the No side by 50.6 percent of the vote made many people to consider seriously what they would do if the Yes side ever won a majority.
"It's the logical answer: if Canada is divisible, so is Quebec," Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien noted shortly after the referendum.
MONTREAL _ While the results of Quebec's provincial election are muddy enough for both major parties to claim a victory of sorts, and to bear some degree of defeat, the real losers are those who had hoped the election would provide a clear sense of where Quebec, and Canada, are heading.
Although the separatists were returned to power, they could not even muster a plurality of the popular vote.
The election results keep the independence movement alive, but it is wounded.
That means Premier Lucien Bouchard will not call another wrenching referendum on breaking away from Canada any time soon, though he has not ruled out doing so later.
``Quebecers have said that the time is not propitious for a referendum, at least not immediately,'' Bouchard said Tuesday at a news conference in Quebec.
He is clearly disappointed that he had not increased the number of seats his party holds in the provincial assembly.
Nor was he able to maintain the percentage of the overall vote his party had in the last elections in 1994.
In the final results of Monday's election, his separatist Parti Quebecois won 75 seats, two fewer than in 1994, while the Liberal Party, which favors keeping Quebec in Canada, won 48, an increase of one.
A small third party won one seat, and a special election will be held in a few weeks for one district where the incumbent died recently.
That district is expected to go to the separatists.
In the popular vote, which is seen as an indication of probable strength for sovereignty, the separatists got 42.7 percent, while the Liberals won 43.7 percent.
A clear majority would be needed for a referendum to pass.
But Bouchard refused to rule out completely the possibility of holding another vote on separation.
Instead, he reiterated the position he took during the campaign: that he would call a referendum _ which he has the right to do at any time during his term _ when he could be sure it was winnable.
During the campaign Bouchard did not spell out the conditions under which he would consider the vote winnable, and he skirted the issue again Tuesday.
But he has made it clear that several problems must be tackled before conditions are ripe for another referendum.
Of course, the first was to be re-elected, but the separatists' poorer-than-expected showing suggests that Bouchard will need substantially more time than he had thought to lay the groundwork for another referendum.
``I don't see how Bouchard can call a referendum in the near future,'' said Francois Rocher, a professor of political science at Carleton University in Ottawa.
``He was elected on good government and now he will have to govern''.
Bouchard said the first part of his term would be ``devoted to achieving good government'' that would create winning conditions for a referendum.
He is nearing his goal of eliminating the province's budget deficit, after several years of painful cuts.
Achieving that would be a sign of fiscal responsibility that the separatists would use to build confidence in their ability to lead an independent nation.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Beyond the budget, Bouchard will soon have to deal with Quebec's large public employee unions, which have been without a contract since June.
And he is committed to negotiating a new deal with the federal government, along with the leaders of the other nine provinces, for more provincial control over health care and other social programs.
If the negotiations for a new federal relationship break down, Bouchard could blame Ottawa and use resentment toward the federal government to boster support for a referendum.
Bouchard's separatist predecessors as provincial premier committed themselves to holding referendums without taking into account whether conditions were ripe for a victory.
Both previous referendums were defeated, even though support for separation in Quebec has at times risen to around 60 percent.
Tuesday, Bouchard refused to speculate about how long he was willing to wait for his ``winning conditions'' to develop.
He said only that he would ``take the time that it needs''.
During the campaign, some basic assumptions about Quebec were openly questioned for the first time.
The charge by the leader of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest, that 30 years of toying with separation had only hurt Quebec economically resonated with many voters, including some French-speaking Quebecers.
He also called for limits to the provincial government's interference in the economy.
Bouchard will also have to deal with the defection of some soft nationalists _ voters whose support for separation fluctuates _ to the young, third-party candidate, Mario Dumont, leader of the Democratic Action Party.
Dumont, 28, doubled his party's share of the popular vote, although he was the only member who won a seat in the provincial assembly.
He called for a ten-year moratorium on referendums and advocated free market measures, although he did not go as far as Charest.
The extent to which aspects of Quebec life will continue to be overshadowed by politics after the election was made clear early Tuesday.
The Canadian Olympic Committee announced that it had turned down Quebec city in favor of Vancouver's bid to represent Canada in vying for the 2010 winter Olympics.
The vote actually was taken 10 days ago but the announcement of the results was delayed until Tuesday to avoid having any influence on the election.
Quebec politicians wasted no time in calling Tuesday's decision political.
MONTREAL (AP) _ Like ambivalent boxing judges, Quebec voters gave their combative politicians a split decision: the pro-independence government gets another term in power, but with support so tepid that a secession bid is unlikely any time soon.
The separatist Parti Quebecois retained a large legislative majority in Monday's provincial election, winning 75 of the 125 seats to earn a new term of up to five years.
But the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party, though winning only 48 seats, received 44 percent of the popular vote to 43 percent for the Parti Quebecois.
As a result, Liberal leader Jean Charest sounded more buoyant in his remarks to supporters than Premier Lucien Bouchard, the separatist leader, did in his victory speech.
``The result tonight...
reflects the fact that the people of Quebec, like the people of all Canada, want this country of ours to work and be a success,'' said Charest, who will serve as opposition leader in the provincial legislature.
The split decision stems from the geographical distribution of political support in Quebec.
Anti-separatist support is concentrated in about 40 districts, mostly around multiethnic Montreal, where the Liberals can rack up huge victory margins.
The separatists, whose backing comes almost entirely from Quebec's French-speaking majority, are competitive in a much larger number of districts spread across the province.
Bouchard, 59, had campaigned on the pledge that he would _ if returned to power _ call for a referendum on seceding from Canada whenever he felt conditions were right for a separatist victory.
But with only 43-percent support for his party, Bouchard is likely to shelve any immediate push for a referendum and concentrate instead on policies that will build public confidence.
``There is no question that this vote was a vote to elect a government, not a vote to determine the future of Quebec or the future of the country,'' said Brian Tobin, the premier of Newfoundland.
``I wouldn't expect with these results that Mr.
Bouchard will be thinking of a referendum any time soon, if ever''.
Bouchard paid tribute to his opponents' determination and pledged to work with them on policy matters.
But he also promised to work for the ``winning conditions'' that would make independence possible eventually.
``Our first priority is to advance Quebec ...
to push it farther toward its destiny,'' he said.
In Washington, U.S.
State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin reaffirmed U.S. support for an undivided Canada.
``The United States recognizes this is an internal issue for Canadians to resolve within their constitutional, legal and political system,'' he said.
``We have always valued our close and productive relationship with a strong and united Canada''.
Canada's federal government kept a low profile during the 33-day campaign, not wanting to undercut Charest in a province where many francophones are traditionally wary of federal intentions.
Prime Minister Jean Chretien assured Bouchard of cooperation in helping strengthen Quebec's economy and social services.
``But when he talks about bringing together his famous winning conditions, which he refuses to reveal, to hold another referendum on separation, he should know we will defend our country,'' Chretien said.
As a personality, the charismatic Bouchard is by far the most popular politician in Quebec.
But many Quebeckers who voted for his party are not keen on secession; recent polls indicated about 70 percent didn't want another referendum.
One of the most notable results of the election was the strong showing of Democratic Action, the No.
3 party that drew 12 percent of the vote behind its 28-year-old leader, Mario Dumont.
The party, which appeals to many young voters, favors greater autonomy for Quebec but stops short of advocating outright secession.
``Mr. Bouchard's mandate is clear _ to provide good government and represent Quebec's interests,'' Dumont said.
``He was not elected to do a referendum on sovereignty.
Quebeckers want constitutional peace''.
The separatists have lost two previous secession referendums, by a big margin in 1980 and a narrow margin in 1995.
Bouchard is intent on avoiding a third defeat, and won a power struggle with party hard-liners earlier this year by insisting he would call another referendum only if opinion polls showed the separatists would win.
About 80 percent of the 5.2 million eligible voters cast ballots in Monday's election, high by North American standards but down from 93 percent for the 1995 referendum.
About 83 percent of Quebec's 7.4 million people are French speakers.
The rest are divided among English-speakers with long-term roots in Canada and more recently arrived immigrants from southern Europe, Asia and elsewhere.
The long-term crusade for Quebec independence stems from a feeling among many French Quebeckers that their culture is different from the rest of Canada, plus a yearning to manage their own affairs and have their own national symbols .
QUEBEC _ A Quebecer returning home this week after a few years' absence would be thoroughly confused by the campaign posters lining the highways leading to this provincial capital.
Signs that prominently feature the blue and white fleur-de-lis flag, the provocative symbol of the Quebec separatist movement, this time belong to the anti-separation Liberal Party and its leader, Jean Charest.
And neither a fleur-de-lis nor the color blue is on any of the posters for the separatist Parti Quebecois, and the current premier of Quebec, Lucien Bouchard.
Instead, the primary color used is a muddy green, which is supposed to stand for hope.
Both the Liberals and the Parti Quebecois hope that when the vote takes place Monday in all 125 ridings, or districts, around the province, Quebecers will be able to clearly distinguish between the two parties and their positions.
But the reversal of symbols on the campaign posters is just one of many reversals in a campaign that has distracted voters, confounded experts and added a thick layer of ambiguity to one of the continent's most baffling political landscapes.
The campaign itself has lasted only 33 days _ the shortest ever in Quebec _ but in that time Charest and the Liberals have steadily lost support.
Charest, the former leader of the federal Conservative Party, arrived in Quebec this year as the great federalist hope whom the rest of Canada had recruited to banish the separatists.
But he seems to have gone from hero to goat, with the latest polls showing the Liberals headed for a stinging defeat.
``He has failed to become the leading contender for Quebec's champion against Ottawa,'' said Desmond Morton, director of the Institute for the Study of Canada at McGill University in Montreal.
During the campaign, Bouchard attacked Charest relentlessly and raised doubts about how well he really knew Quebec, since Charest had been away from the province for so long, Morton said.
Charest ``often looked hot-tempered and crotchety against the man many Quebecers see as a secular saint,'' he said.
Bouchard, who was practically canonized here after losing a leg to flesh-eating disease in 1994, did not run an unassailable campaign.
In the last four years that his Parti Quebecois has controlled the provincial assembly, it has tried to balance the provincial budget by closing hospitals and making deep cuts in hallowed social spending programs like education.
Those cuts have angered many, presenting the Liberals with ample targets.
``Bouchard had trouble almost every day of the campaign,'' Morton said.
``But he was always able to capitalize on his ability to get out his message through a largely sympathetic media''.
Even when it dealt with the fundamental issue of separation, that message was not always clear.
Bouchard had at first vowed that if he was re-elected, he would hold another referendum.
In the last referendum, in 1995, the separatist question was narrowly defeated, but Quebec law prohibits a government from holding more than one referendum during a term that usually lasts four to five years.
As surveys showed that Quebecers _ for whom Monday's election is the sixth in six years _ were overwhelmingly against holding another referendum, Bouchard's position wavered.
He promised a referendum only when ``winning conditions'' prevailed, but never defined those terms.
Later in the campaign, he said he would negotiate a new arrangement on social spending with Ottawa, a ``renewed federalism'' that seemed the polar opposite of previous separation threats.
Some voters were confused, others angry.
``Ambiguity wins in Quebec,'' a Montreal radio talk show host, Gord Logan, proclaimed during the campaign.
Charest left no doubt that he was against a referendum.
Using the fleur-de-lis on campaign posters was his way of taking back the powerful image from the separatists.
But in the end, Charest's straightforwardness may have cost him support even among people who said they would vote against separation.
After 30 years of the separatist movement, many Quebecers have developed sophisticated positions on independence that at times can puzzle outsiders.
Louis Balthazar, a professor of political science at Laval University, said many Quebec voters hedged their bets.
They do not necessarily want to separate from Canada, but they expect their leaders to use the threat of separation as leverage to bargain with the federal government for more provincial powers.
And so, Balthazar continued, even Quebecers who want to stay in Canada will vote for the Parti Quebecois, which officially embraces separation, to maintain this perceived advantage.
Thus, Bouchard could not necessarily count the support he wins on Monday as support for a referendum.
``Right now, a PQ victory would not translate into a future winning referendum,'' Balthazar said.
He said he believed that Quebecers would vote for Bouchard because of the way he has managed Quebec, not because he will make it an independent nation.
Jean-Marc Leger, president of Le Groupe Leger &AMP; Leger, a Montreal polling company, said that if the Parti Quebecois picks up more seats in the provincial assembly than the 77 it now controls, and exceeds 50 percent of the popular vote, it will be encouraged to call for a referendum in the coming year.
Polls indicate that voters now see Bouchard's separatist government as standing for stability while it is Charest's Liberals who represent radical change.
That is in large part because at the beginning of the campaign, Charest said he would diminish the provincial government's role in Quebec's economy and open it up to market forces.
OTTAWA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada's unity minister Stephane Dion has fired off another volley of words at Quebec's separatist government in an emotional debate over the province's future.
In his latest letter to the Quebec government, Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Stephane Dion warned that Quebec's unilateral secession from Canada would be not only illegal, but impossible.
"Without the support of the Canadian government, a declaration of independence would not be recognized by the international community," Dion wrote in the four-page letter, which was published today.
"Since 1945, no state created by secession has been admitted to the United Nations without the approval of the government of the predecessor state," the minister noted.
In Quebec, Premier Lucien Bouchard countered that Dion "is not allowed to speak for the international community".
"He can speak for himself, maybe for the federal government but surely not for the world," Bouchard told reporters.
The letter was Dion's second within two weeks in an blistering exchange of words between Ottawa and the French-speaking province, which has been threatening to form a country of its own.
The on-going war of words started when Quebec Premier Bouchard sharply rebuked New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna for appearing to support the partition of Quebec if it secedes.
In his first letter to Premier Bouchard, the unity minister warned that if Canada is divisible, so is Quebec.
"Neither you nor I nor anyone else can predict that the borders of an independent Quebec would be those now guaranteed by the Canadian Constitution," Dion wrote.
The Inuit and the Cree natives of northern Quebec, and some English-speaking residents in western Quebec and Montreal has said they want to remain in Canada if Quebec votes to break away from the country.
Dion also asserted that Quebec cannot simply decide unilaterally to separate from the Canadian federation.
He rejected the notion that 50-percent-plus-one majority Yes vote would be suffice for the province to leave Canada.
To this, Quebec deputy premier Bernard Landry shot back with a letter, denouncing Dion's letter as anti-democratic and an attempt to "change the rules of the game".
Analysts here say the latest letter-writings by Dion suggest that Ottawa is warming up for another showdown with Quebec.
Ottawa has already asked the Supreme Court of Canada to declare that a unilateral declaration of independence would be unlawful.
The case is scheduled to begin this fall.
It is widely expected that Quebec will hold a provincial election next year.
If Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois win, the election would be very likely to be followed by another referendum on Quebec's future.
"We are heading towards a new referendum, and there's going to be more heat," predicted Professor Benoit Pelletier of the University of Ottawa.
There is already speculation that Ottawa is toughening its stance on Quebec, focusing less on the so-called "Plan A", which involves reconciliation, and more on "Plan B", which stresses "rules of secession."
OTTAWA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada ruled here Thursday that Quebec can't separate from the country unilaterally.
In its historic ruling on the Quebec issue, the 9-member court said, the mainly French-speaking province cannot separate from Canada under the Constitution of Canada and the international law.
But the top court said, the Canadian government would be obliged to negotiate with Quebec if the mainly French-speaking province won a voter referendum on independence.
OTTAWA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian House of Commons Monday began voting on a bill aimed at making separation attempts more difficult.
Members of the parliament are expected to spend about 30 straight hours in the process of voting 411 amendments to the draft legislation, which was tabled last December by the ruling Liberal government.
The Bloc Quebecois, the only party uniformly opposed to the bill, has proposed 403 amendments while the other three opposition parties added eight more to stall the legislation.
The roll-call voting will last until Wednesday morning as every MP rises in turn for a total of 411 times to signify their vote.
Dubbed Clarity Bill, the Liberal government's Bill C-20 enshrines into law a 1998 Supreme Court decision that found Quebec must win a clear majority from a clearly-worded question before it can separate from Canada.
"We need a clear question and a clear majority," said Prime Minister Jean Chretien last December.
The Clarity Bill immediately met with a counter-attack from Quebec separatists who unveiled legislation in Quebec City reaffirming their right to declare independence in the fashion it sees fit.
OTTAWA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A majority of Canadians support the new national unity initiative proposed in Calgary last month, according to a new poll published today.
However, they don't think the Calgary accord will make much difference in terms of keeping the French-speaking Province of Quebec in Canada.
The accord, reached last month in Calgary by all provincial premiers, excluding Quebec premier, and two territorial leaders, affirmed Quebec's "unique character" while stressing the principles of equality of all Canadians and provinces.
The province has been seeking independence from Canada since a near victory for separatists in a 1995 independence referendum.
The poll showed that 70 percent of those surveyed regard the accord as a step in the right direction, while 24 percent say it was a mistake for the premiers to reopen the national unity issue.
In Quebec, 62 percent of respondents say the accord is a right step, while 32 percent regard it as a mistake.
Meanwhile, 57 percent of Canadians think the efforts by the premiers, backed by Prime Minister Jean Chretien, will have no real impact on the possibility of Quebec's stay or separation.
Within Quebec, a slim majority say the accord does not alter their view on the province's future course.
Chretien, a French-speaking Quebecker who has worked tirelessly to keep Canada united, said the premiers demonstrated responsible leadership.
The poll by Angus Reid Group is the first national poll on attitudes toward the Calgary accord.
The survey of 1,500 Canadians was taken on September 23-30 and is considered accurate within 2.5 percentage points.
OTTAWA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has ruled out the possibility that the French-speaking province of Quebec could declare independence even if a majority of Quebeckers vote for secession in the next referendum.
"We are saying that the laws of Canada must be respected, that there won't be a unilateral declaration of independence and that international law must also be respected," Chretien told the House of Commons Tuesday.
The remarks were among the most aggressive and explicit Chretien has made on how the federal government intends to deal with a third independence referendum in Quebec, according to today's Globe and Mail newspaper.
They also signal a tougher approach toward Quebec separatists following their near-victory in the most recent referendum on October 30, the paper said.
Chretien's statement came amid a row between Ottawa and the separatist government of Quebec over a court case challenging the legality of future referenda on Quebec's independence.
The federal government is arguing that a referendum is a "consultation", not the first legal step out of the confederation.
It also maintains that Canada's constitution would have to be amended to allow Quebec to secede, which would require the consent of all other provinces.
Michel Gauthier, leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, lashed out at Chretien Tuesday, accusing him of subordinating the democratic will of Quebeckers to the approval of Canada's other provinces.
Chretien is creating a climate of "confrontation" similar to that of 1981 and 1982, when the constitution was amended against Quebec's wishes, Gauthier warned.
LONGUEUIL, Quebec _ Chanted slogans flowed, cheers rose, fleur-de-lis flags flapped everywhere.
Although the gathering was just another campaign rally as Quebec roars toward tomorrow's election showdown between separatists and federalists, it seemed more like old home day for the secessionist cause.
Video screens played and replayed images of the triumphs of the Parti Quebecois, which in the three decades since its founding by the late Rene Levesque has grown from a fringe movement to Quebec's most powerful political party.
Levesque's widow was on hand.
So was a living legend, poet-songwriter Gilles Vigneault _ the Woody Guthrie of Quebec nationalism _ whose daughter, Jessica, gave quavering voice to a song with the refrain, ``Tomorrow belongs to us''.
And the crowd roared back, ``We want a country''!
At the center of it all was Lucien Bouchard, Quebec's 59-year-old premier.
He is a passionate articulator of the separatist vision, and the bete noire of English Canada, vowing that the province that already considers itself a nation in spirit will soon become a nation in fact.
Perhaps very soon.
``We are a people, and a people has the right to be a country,'' he said.
``Give me the mandate so that, finally, we can say `Yes' to ourselves once and for all''.
Quebec and Canada face a crucial test tomorrow as Quebecers go to the polls in the first provincewide elections since the separatists narrowly lost a referendum on independence in 1995.
Going head-to-head in the race are Bouchard and the Liberal Party challenger, Jean Charest, 40, the only federalist champion given any chance of unseating the separatists.
But to the shock of Canadians, who only a few weeks ago were gleefully predicting a rout of the secessionist government in Quebec City, Charest has failed to catch fire with voters.
The waning hours of the campaign are looking more like a cakewalk for the separatists.
Quebec is the only Canadian province with a French majority, 80 percent of 7.3 million people, and surveys have shown that about two-thirds of French speakers support either outright secession or some degree of sovereignty from the rest of Canada.
Should the separatists win, as the latest polls suggest, Canada's future as an intact nation will be cast into doubt as Bouchard presses Quebec toward what he calls its ``natural destiny''.
Still, Quebec is notorious for last-minute shifts in the political wind.
If the federalists somehow snatch victory against all odds, Bouchard will almost certainly resign from politics.
With no other separatist leader in sight capable of matching his popularity, the dream of Quebec independence would be smashed, perhaps forever.
That is an outcome that the rest of Canada fervently desires.
Polls showed a dead heat only a few months ago when Charest, cast as a white knight riding to the rescue of embattled federalism, yielded to an unprecedented draft movement, quitting a safe seat in national Parliament to return to his native Quebec to do battle.
Poll after poll found Charest to be the only politician capable of beating Bouchard.
The timing seemed perfect.
For the same polls also showed Quebecers wearying of the ``neverendum referendum,'' as Montreal humorist Josh Freed has dubbed the seemingly endless quest for nationhood.
From the start, Charest hammered the theme of Quebec uselessly dissipating its energies on an impossible scheme.
He rhetorically asked audiences the question that seems to mystify everyone except Quebecers: Why should this bountiful province seek to quit one of the world's most prosperous, successful democracies?
``How long must Quebecers keep pulling this ball and chain''? he said last week as the 33-day official campaign season ticked down toward a ballot box reckoning.
``We must end a political debate that perpetuates uncertainty, which will be paid for by our children''.
But Quebecers, or at least French Quebecers, responded with a yawn.
Despite Charest's charisma and eloquence, the federalist crusade has fizzled _ in large part because the native son, upon returning home, strikes many Quebecers as a stranger.
Or, worse, just a front man for English Canada.
``All the cheering from the rest of Canada when Mr.
Charest went to Quebec did him no good in the province,'' observed Jeffrey Simpson, national affairs columnist for the Globe and Mail, a nationally circulated newspaper.
Indeed, Bouchard won points simply by mocking Charest's notion of Quebec comfortably cradled in the arms of Canada: ``Jean Charest is a man who denies Quebec as it is, in its profound identity.
... Quebec will never resign itself to being a province like the others''.
Charest made a dangerous decision by portraying himself as a political outsider in a province that fears the outside above all else.
The entire history of Quebec might be told as a desperate struggle for the survival of its unique, French-rooted culture against English North America.
After years in Ottawa, preoccupied with national politics, Charest seems to have forgotten that even Quebecers opposed to secession don't carry much love for Canada in their hearts.
``Myself, I am not truly a separatist, but I will vote Parti Quebecois because I trust Mr.
Bouchard to look after the interests of Quebec first and foremost,'' said Marc Trudel, 43, a Quebec City schoolteacher.
``Mr. Charest seems too comfortable with Canada.
We can never trust the English provinces''.
Polls consistently show that Quebecers are sick of referendums on independence.
And to the rest of Canada, and Charest's supporters in Quebec, secession is such a soul-searing issue that it was assumed that weariness with referendums must necessarily translate into a big vote for the federalists.
But to French Quebecers, separatism is one issue among many.
Even those who think secession is a bad idea will support the Parti Quebecois if the party seems to serve the greater good of the province.
And the fact is, Bouchard has done a topnotch job of running Quebec _ unemployment is down, exports to the United States are up, government spending has been curtailed, and Montreal is rocketing back as one of the most dynamic cities in Canada.
``Generally speaking, people feel better economically,'' said Jean-Marc Leger of the Quebec polling firm Leger &AMP; Leger.
Surveys released last week show that Quebecers believe Bouchard is honest, dedicated, hard-working, and, perhaps above all, the one politician capable of forcing Canada to show respect for its most willful and wayward province.
Meanwhile, Charest's federalist campaign was undercut from the start by comments from Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who told a Quebec newspaper, La Presse, that Canada would not seek changes in federal law to give Quebec special political powers and protections.
A new constitutional formula is widely considered the only way to keep Quebec from bolting the 131-year-old Canadian confederation.
Charest is likely to score an impressive victory in Montreal, with its cosmopolitan population of English Quebecers, Jews, and ethnic voters _ such as Chinese and East Indians _ who loathe the French language laws of the separatist government nearly as much as they despise the secessionist impulse.
Similarly, Bouchard is sure to win big in the separatist heartland north of Quebec City.
The real battle for Quebec is being fought in the St.
Lawrence River valley between Montreal and the provincial capital, in faded centers such as Trois Rivieres, Longueuil, and Cap-de-la-Madeline.
And on this vital front, things look bleak for Charest.
``To me, it's not about separation but standing tall against Canada,'' said Valerie Corbeil, a 34-year-old beautician in gritty Trois-Rivieres.
``Mr. Charest seems a nice man.
But I fear he would let Quebecers become like Cajuns in Louisiana _ colorful characters with bad French and no power''.
An impressive separatist win would make it a near certainty that Bouchard will launch another referendum on independence, possibly as early as next year.
He has pledged to put the issue before Quebecers again only in the event of ``winning conditions,'' by which he apparently means a Quebec that is economically sound enough to weather breaking away from Canada.
The election is being closely followed not only in Ottawa but Washington, Paris, London, and other capitals, although many Americans seem generally oblivious to the political drama unfurling north of New England.
``Americans tend to think the absence of bombs and bullets means no crisis,'' said one Canada-based foreign diplomat.
``But Canada is drifting toward a very serious situation.
The federal government has basically lost ability to influence events in Quebec''.
Earlier this year, in a landmark Canadian Supreme Court case that backfired badly on the federal government, the nation's nine high judges ruled that Canada cannot prevent the secession of Quebec if a ``clear majority'' of Quebecers opt for independence.
``We have won so many battles,'' Bouchard told a cheering audience last week.
``We have only one more to win.
Let's win it and give to our children a Quebec that is fully responsible for its own destiny.''
MONTREAL _ With popular support for Quebec's independence in remission, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada made a bold gamble with his country's future last week, introducing legislation that lays out Canada's first road map for national division, but one so littered with obstacles that he bets the separatists will never follow it.
The new legislation, which requires a ``clear majority'' voting on a ``clear question'' on secession, is the direct outgrowth of what many Canadians now call their nation's ``near death experience,'' the 1995 Quebec referendum that unity forces won by a margin of just 1 percent.
Since that high point for separation, polls in Quebec indicated this fall that support for independence receded to a 10-year low, around 40 percent.
At the same time, popular support for the separatists' provincial government, headed by Premier Lucien Bouchard, fell to the lowest point in its five-year history, around 37 percent.
In a new poll commissioned by Actualite magazine, 74 percent of Quebec residents interviewed predicted that their province would remain in Canada ``forever''.
Giving unity a nudge, Bill Clinton and Jacques Chirac, leaders of the two foreign countries that the people of Quebec most care about, the United States and France, came to Quebec this fall and pointedly praised Canada's federal system of government.
Public opinion in Quebec is known to be volatile, as allies reminded Chretien when he prepared his ``clarity'' legislation in recent weeks.
The veteran prime minister, who entered politics when John F.
Kennedy was in the White House, said he knew best.
``Canada is my business, sir,'' Chretien, a Quebec native, snapped at a reporter who asked him about stirring up the separatists.
``And it is the future of Canada that is at stake''.
While the bill introduced by the 65-year-old prime minister might seem innocuous to many Americans, it provoked what one columnist described as ``World War II headlines''.
The bill, intended to carry out a Supreme Court decision from last year, authorizes the House of Commons in Ottawa to rule on the clarity of any secessionist question adopted by a provincial legislature.
It also allows Canada's lower house to decide whether the referendum results constituted a ``clear majority''.
Such seemingly inoffensive language immediately provoked a string of retorts from Parti Quebecois leaders, including ``brutal,'' ``Soviet-style,'' and an old standby: ``straitjacket''.
On one level, Quebecers of many political stripes believe that it is entirely up to their provincial legislature to set the rules for a referendum that would decide the political future of Quebec, Canada's largest province.
Across political lines, the people of Quebec are galled by the idea that legislators from as far away as the Yukon would have veto power over the future of Canada's oldest European society.
In a reflection of broad Quebec opposition to ``outside interference,'' criticism has come from the local leader of Chretien's Liberal Party, Jean Charest, a provincial legislator who leads in public opinion polls in the race to become Quebec's next premier.
Quebec Liberals and Parti Quebecois legislators may adopt a common front against the bill.
But, below the surface, separatists deeply fear being locked into a clear referendum question.
In the two secession referendums, the proposal was deliberately phrased in ambiguous terms.
Vague phrases like ``sovereignty,'' ``partnership'' and ``association'' were used to draw under one tent people known as ``soft secessionists'' interested in the kind of autonomy now enjoyed by Scotland and hard-liners who want to create an independent French-speaking republic on the northern border of New England.
In focus groups, support for breaking away from Canada plummeted when questioners used words like ``secession'' and ``independence''.
Indeed, polls of Quebecers who voted yes to ``sovereignty'' in 1995 indicated that about one-third believed that they would still be able to keep their Canadian passports and to send members of Parliament to Ottawa.
But last year, Jacques Parizeau, who was Quebec's premier in 1995, revealed that he had harbored other plans.
He wrote in his memoirs that he had typed up a unilateral declaration of independence and that he had won from the French government a commitment to recognize an independent Quebec and to exert diplomatic pressure on other French-speaking nations to follow suit.
Such revelations stiffened Chretien's resolve to establish clear rules of the game.
``They ask a crooked question,'' the prime minister told reporters.
``Fine. So what?
There will be no negotiations''.
The ``Clarity Act'' also underlines the need for negotiations over a series of issues that secessionists generally prefer to leave fuzzy, particularly the problem of English-speaking areas' seceding from any newly independent Quebec.
Before a province could say goodbye to Canada, it would have to negotiate with Ottawa and the other nine provinces its share of Canada's $400 billion debt, its borders and its plans to guarantee the rights of Indians and linguistic minorities.
If the results of the 1995 vote were used as a map, an independent Quebec would lose most of its border areas with the United States and Ontario, heavily English-speaking areas that voted no.
In addition, it would lose the top half of the province as Quebec's Indian and Inuit inhabitants overwhelmingly oppose breaking ties with Ottawa.

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn The stage may now be set for a major flare-up of secessionist sentiment.
Last weekend, leaders of Quebec's powerful labor and student movements appealed on provincial television for a ``mobilization'' of the old sovereignty coalition.
Chretien's new bill ``is hateful, a spitting in the face of democracy,'' Marc Laviolette, president of the Confederation of National Trade Unions, said in remarks repeated over and over again on television.
``The best way to defend the interest of the province's workers would be to have our own country''.
But the labor leaders were the same ones who, two months ago, nearly called a provincewide strike against the austerity program of the secessionist Bouchard government.
Contributing to general dissatisfaction with Quebec's government, in the last six months there have been a strike by nurses and official audits showing that the government wasted millions of dollars trying to run a day care program, a manpower training program and a buyout of provincial employees.
And Chretien introduced his bill at a time that was hardly propitious for street demonstrations: students are dispersing for Christmas vacations and workers are visibly obsessed with the shopping countdown to the holiday.
``People just don't care,'' lamented Michel Venne, a columnist for a separatist newspaper here, Le Devoir.
Noting that polls this fall indicated that 70 percent of Quebecers did not want another referendum, he said: ``It is going to be difficult to mobilize people.''
OTTAWA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Quebec's ruling Parti Quebecois (PQ) won enough seats to form a majority government in Monday's general election in the French-speaking province of Canada.
The separatist PQ, led by Lucien Bouchard, won 75 seats in Quebec's 125-seat provincial legislature, according to the latest reports from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).
PQ's main rival, the Liberal Party led by Jean Charest, got 48 seats, while the Action Democratique party secured one seat from a total of 124 seats up for grabs on Monday, CBC reported.
The 125th seat will be decided in a by-election in December because of the recent death of the PQ candidate.
The current election mirrored the results from the 1994 election, when the PQ won 77 seats, the Liberal 47 and the Action Democratique party one seat.
The re-election of the PQ government was widely believed to have much impact on the future of both Quebec and the country of Canada as a whole.
In the 33-day campaign, PQ leader Bouchard maintained that if re-elected, his government would seek another referendum on Quebec independence from Canada when "winning conditions" exist.
But in his speech to cheering supporters Monday night, Bouchard only briefly mentioned the referendum issue, while dwelling on good government and attacks on Canada's federal government.
"We also sought a mandate to get conditions for a winning referendum on Quebec sovereignty," Bouchard said of the referendum issue.
In Ottawa late Monday night, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said his government will cooperate with the re-elected Bouchard government if the latter respected the desire of Quebecers to improve economic conditions.
"But when he (Bouchard) talks about bringing together his famous winning conditions, which he refuses to reveal, to hold another referendum on separation, he should know we will defend our country," Chretien warned.
Recent polls also indicated that more than 60 percent of Quebec people did not want to see another referendum in the near future.
In the previous two referendums in 1980 and 1995, Quebecers twice voted "No" to the province's secession from the Canadian confederation.
While conceding his defeat, Liberal leader Jean Charest said that both Canadians and Quebecers could take heart from the result of the election.
"The result tonight...
reflects the fact that the people of Quebec, like the people of all Canada, want this country of ours to work and be a success," he noted .
OTTAWA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada is set to hear the case of Quebec separation in early December, according to a draft agenda released today.
The court has set aside December 8, 9 and 10 to hear arguments on whether the French-speaking province has the right to break away the country.
The Quebec government said that it will not participate in the case.
Canada's federal government has asked the court to rule on three subjects: -- Can Quebec unilaterally declare independence under domestic law? -- Does International law give the province a right to secede? -- If domestic and international law conflict, which take precedence?
Quebec cannot unilaterally declare independence though it could leave lawfully through a constitutional amendment after discussing with the federal government and other provinces, Ottawa argues.
But Quebec insists that any decision on independence must be made only by the people of Quebec.
The case is viewed here as part of Ottawa's "Plan B" strategy, which stresses "rules of secession".
JONQUIERE, Quebec _ Both men left the confines of Quebec for federal politics years ago.
Both served in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
Both later switched parties and both have come home to fight for the future of Canada's French-speaking province.
But whatever similarities once existed between them have faded.
Lucien Bouchard, the premier of Quebec, and Jean Charest, the leader of the province's Liberal Party, are now locked in a do-or-die election that on Nov.
30 will decide, to a large extent, whether Quebec's long flirtation with secession will succeed at last.
Bouchard has promised that if his Parti Quebecois is re-elected he will hold a third referendum on separation, probably by 2001.
The last referendum, in 1995, fell just 50,000 votes short of authorizing Quebec to negotiate its way out of Canada.
Charest says there will be no referendum if he is premier.
Many political analysts say that could take away the separatists' last opportunity to win, because passion for independence is waning.
The continuing exodus of English speakers is largely offset by the declining local birth rate, and the large influx of immigrants tends to vote against secession.
``If Quebec hasn't solved this problem'' in the next few years, said Alain Dubuc, chief editorial writer for La Presse, a Montreal daily newspaper, ``completely different rules will apply''.
Bouchard, 59, is a passionate separatist.
He is a sometimes hotheaded francophone as independent as is Jonquiere, the rugged area on the fierce Saguenay River that Quebecers proudly consider their frontier.
It is a place of oversized dimensions _ of huge aluminum smelters, prodigious paper mills and uncontainable ambition for Quebec independence _ all reflected in the fiery character of Bouchard.
He is determined to carry Quebec to what he sees as its destiny as an independent, French-speaking nation in North America.
Charest, 40, is a curly-haired federalist who is as comfortably bilingual as is Sherbrooke, his home in the Eastern Townships near the Vermont-New Hampshire border.
It is a place where English- and French-speaking families have long lived side by side, a place so accommodating that English street signs include French footnotes, like Rue Wellington, ``General Britannique, 1769-1852''.
Charest was leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party before being drafted by supporters to take on Bouchard and vanquish the separatist threat.
He has staked his promising political career on the crusade to keep Quebec in Canada.
If Quebec were to vote for secession, a complicated series of negotiations would follow to settle such questions as the province's share of the national debt and compensation for federal properties.
There would also be a bitter fight over what to do with areas of the province that do not want to leave Canada, particularly northern lands that are home to Cree Indians who have voted overwhelmingly against separation.
So far opinion polls have the Liberals and the Parti Quebecois running just about even, with the separatists recently pulling slightly ahead.
Under Quebec's parliamentary system, Bouchard and Charest run in their local districts, but as party leader either automatically becomes premier if his party gains a majority.
English-speaking Quebecers are bunched in Montreal and the Eastern Townships.
If current trends continue, the Liberals will not win the majority of legislative seats that they need to form the next government.
Jean-Marc Leger, president of Leger &AMP; Leger, a Montreal polling company, said a Charest victory would turn demographics against the separatists.
But he expects Bouchard to win, and he said the margin of victory would affect the timetable for a referendum.
``If Bouchard gets 45, 46 percent of the vote, I'm not sure he would try a referendum,'' Leger said.
``But if he gets 48, 49 percent, he would hold one for sure.
If he gets more than 50 percent, and it's possible, he will have a referendum within six months''.
Charest concedes nothing.
``This is a campaign, period,'' he said.
``We're in a battle, period.
And in the best sense of the word, it's democracy at work, and we are going to win''.
Bouchard, bolstered by the polls, has assumed an air of confidence.
``The only true solution for Quebec,'' he said, ``is Quebec sovereignty''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn The disparate outlooks of these two Quebecers can best be understood by looking at the places they call home.
They came from opposite ends of Quebec, where history has shaped destiny and character is formed by memory.
The Saguenay region where Bouchard was reared is in the distant northern hills.
Bouchard, who until he was 46 never saw any other part of Canada except the next-door province of Ontario, is typical of many people here for whom Quebec is already a nation.
``There is an excess of pride in this area, and it's a mixed blessing,'' said Rejeanne Gilbert of Jonquiere, who was having her hair styled at the Coiffures Signature salon on Rue St.
Dominique, which is awash with small shops and countless beauty parlors.
``That pride is why we have the kind of politics we have here, and why there are so many hairdressers''.
Jonquiere is an unassuming town of 56,000, with an average income of $15,300 and 11.7 percent unemployment, higher than the 8.3 percent national average.
Like Mrs.
Gilbert, most here speak only French.
People are used to good jobs in big companies like Alcan Aluminum, which receives subsidized electricity from Quebec's hydroelectric plants.
Lynda Dufour, owner of Coiffures Signature, called the Saguenay socially and culturally cut off not just from the rest of Canada, but also the rest of Quebec.
``If you come from the Saguenay, people in the rest of Quebec think you are from so far away that you still have feathers on your head,'' she said.
This is often called the cradle of the separatist movement, which emerged in the 1960s.
``We here have to fight a little harder than those elsewhere to succeed,'' said Marc Andre Bedard, a minister in the government of the province's first separatist premier, Rene Levesque.
``Mr. Bouchard is very much a son of the area, a man of strong roots, conviction and determination''.
Bouchard, who speaks English with a French accent and is married to an American, is also the leader of a government that has had to reduce a crushing deficit by cutting education and health services that Quebecers take for granted.
He has closed many hospitals, and services at the one in Jonquiere were scheduled to be severely cut back.
But when he returned to Jonquiere earlier this month for his formal nomination, doctors threatened to resign if the cuts went through.
Bouchard offered them enough money to call off the threat, but that angered other communities that saw it as favoritism.
There have been other embarrassing moments for Bouchard, including the disclosure of a study showing that government cuts had caused poor and mentally ill patients to go without medication.
So far, though, the revelations do not seem to have hurt Bouchard.
He is the most popular and respected politician in French-speaking Quebec.
In 1994 he was hospitalized with a flesh-eating infection, to which he eventually lost a leg.
He came out of the hospital to lead separatist forces in the 1995 referendum, and when the premier at the time resigned, he took over.
``Bouchard is a man of pride and honor,'' said Mario Arcette, 21, a nurse in Jonquiere.
``And he wants Quebec to be like himself, proud and honorable''.
Pride and honor persist in the Eastern Townships as well, but it is the pride of coexistence and the honor of accepting differences.
The area was settled by Loyalist families who fled the United States during and after the Revolutionary War.
They were encouraged to live where they could most easily defend Canada from invasion.
Though not without some tensions, English and French have long lived side by side.
Many people in Sherbrooke are fluently bilingual, like Nicole Girard.
``If you are bilingual you tend not to be as extreme,'' she said one morning at a local cafe.
``You don't have as much prejudice, and you can understand the other side a little better''.
Sherbrooke is the biggest city in the Eastern Townships, so named because they lie east of the St.
Lawrence River.
It is a city of 76,700 residents, with an average income of $14,400 and 11 percent unemployment.
Separatists do not find much support here.
``They want to be separatist so nobody makes them do anything,'' said Lina Jacques of nearby Lennoxville.
``But Quebec is too small to just think, `I'm going to live in this province and nowhere else'''.
Charest's own family is a model of coexistence, with an Irish mother and a French-speaking father who was a local businessman and political leader.
The candidate married a local girl and is fluent in French and English.
``If you live here you believe the two communities can live together with respect and humanity,'' said Paul Milliard, assistant director of the local Charest campaign.
``And Jean Charest is proof of that''.
Charest and Bouchard are known to dislike each other, a disaffection that dates back to their days together in the Mulroney Cabinet.
In his campaign, Charest has accused Bouchard of recklessly pursuing another referendum even though opinion polls show that Quebecers overwhelmingly oppose it.
Bouchard has responded with a politically ambiguous promise to hold another referendum _ the priority issue in his party's platform _ only when winning conditions exist.
That essentially allows him to keep the separation option open.
Charest has alienated some Quebecers by ruling out a referendum entirely, thus surrendering Quebec's leverage with Ottawa.
And the Parti Quebcois continues to portray him as an outsider from Ottawa.
In the campaign's only debate, on Tuesday night, Charest testily defended his credentials as a local boy.
``A Quebecer from Sherbrooke is no less a Quebecer than someone from Jonquiere,'' he said.
While the rest of Canada considers this a crucial election, even the staunchest Quebec separatists concede that some passion has gone out of the secession movement.
That was evident at Nephtys Tattos on Rue Wellington in Sherbrooke, where Aline Duquette is manager.
On her forearm Ms.
Duquette, 35, bears a fleur-de-lis _ the very symbol of Quebec independence.
``Very few young people take the fleur-de-lis nowadays,'' Ms.
Duquette said.
``They don't like to represent themselves that way anymore.''
QUEBEC (AP) _ Police fired tear gas at rowdy young people Wednesday after being pelted with rocks and bottles, the second year in a row force was needed to disperse unruly crowds on Quebec's provincial holiday.
Police said 35 people were arrested, many for minor incidents, during a concert and other celebrations to mark Quebec's Fete Nationale, which has been marred over the years by riots and other violent incidents.
Several shop windows were broken late Tuesday and early Wednesday, but the trouble-making was less serious than last year, when Quebec City's downtown businesses suffered millions of dollars of damage.
The holiday is celebrated mainly by Quebec's French-speaking nationalists _ those who support either outright independence from Canada or some form of increased autonomy.
During Wednesday's holiday parade in Montreal, the hard-line leader of a lobby group for the English-speaking minority was pelted with beer, water and a pie as he marched with colleagues at the tail end of the procession despite objections from parade organizers.
The heckling became so bad that police intervened, hustling Alliance Quebec leader William Johnson into a paddy wagon and driving him away.
``We had to stop his walk for his own safety,'' said Jean-Bruno Latour, a Montreal police spokesman.
``Negotiations following such a referendum would undoubtedly be difficult.
While negotiators would have to contemplate the possibility of secession, there would be no absolute entitlement to it and no assumption that an agreement reconciling all relevant rights and obligations would actually be reached.
``It is foreseeable that even negotiations carried out in conformity with the underlying constitutional principles could reach an impasse.
We need not speculate here as to what would then transpire,'' the opinion said.
Questioning the legality of Quebec's 30-year-fight for independence was a risky strategy for the federal government because any backlash against it in Quebec could make the separatist government of Premier Lucien Bouchard even more popular.
But federal officials, shaken by the near victory of the separatists in the October 1995 referendum on separation, had decided it was far more risky to just sit back and do nothing.
Since the separatist movement began in Quebec in the 1960s, the sentiment for breaking up Canada appeared to gain momentum.
In the first referendum on independence, in May 1980, the separatists gained 40 percent of the votes cast in Quebec, the only province where the referendum was held.
In the October 1995 referendum, Quebec's vote in favor of separation had increased to just over 49 percent.
Federal officials claim that separatists who have controlled the Quebec government for most of the last 20 years misled voters into thinking that separation would be quick and relatively easy.
According to published reports, separatist leaders planned to declare independence and gain recognition of the new country from France and the United States within days after the 1995 referendum if they had won, despite promises of a period of negotiation with the rest of Canada.
American officials have said it is unlikely the United States would have recognized an independent Quebec that seceded without the consent of the rest of Canada.
The Ottawa government decided in 1996 to join a suit filed by a federalist in Quebec asking the Supreme Court for an opinion on the constitutional legality of a unilateral Quebec secession.
Such opinions are called references and while not legally binding, they are important because of the moral and legal authority of the court.
The Supreme Court has issued 74 references since 1892.
The court limited its opinion strictly to the questions asked by the federal government and did not touch several other sensitive issues.
For example, it left up to politicians to decide whether ``a clear majority'' meant 51 percent of votes cast or some more rigorous standard.
The court also avoided the question of whether a Quebec that decides to leave Canada could then be partitioned because northern Indian tribes, like the Cree, have said firmly that they want to remain in Canada. &QL;
OTTAWA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said people in the French-speaking province of Quebec are facing reality about the consequences of separation.
Efforts by provincial premiers to solve the unity crisis and his own government's work have opened up communication between Quebec and the rest of Canada, providing a reality check for Quebecers, Chretien said.
"This road to heaven just by voting independent has to be put in a realistic context, and it's what we've been able to do for the last two months," he was quoted as saying by reports today.
The premiers' unity initiative in Calgary and the "war of words" between the federal and Quebec government have helped clarify the issues, he said.
"Before, they (separatists in Quebec) were selling a dream, and now I guess that they have to look at the reality," he noted.
The Quebec issue has been dogging Canada in the past several decades.
People in the province voted to stay in Canada instead of separation in the October referendum two years ago.
The separatist government in Quebec said they would hold another referendum if they are re-elected in a provincial election, which is expected next year.
Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard will have a problem if he promises another referendum in the next election because "people in Quebec don't want any referendum," Chretien said.
"They're fed up.
They don't want us to discuss that any more.
He (Bouchard) is dividing the families, creating economic uncertainty," Chretien added.
QUEBEC _ Premier Lucien Bouchard and the separatist Parti Quebecois have retained control of Canada's largest province, possibly setting the stage for a bitter confrontation with the rest of Canada, and possibly another referendum on independence.
With nearly all 23,000 polling stations reporting late Monday night, the separatist party had 42.8 percent of the vote, compared with 43.6 percent for the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party and 12 percent for a third party, Democratic Action.
The separatists were expected to win 77 of the provincial assembly's 125 seats, the Liberals 46 and Democratic Action 1, with one seat unfilled because of a death during the campaign.
Bouchard appeared to have had more difficulty than expected defeating the provincial Liberal Party leader, Jean Charest, on whom many people in English Canada had pinned their hopes for an end to the French-speaking province's 30 years of threats to separate.
With results still trickling in, the separatists were projected to take roughly the same number of districts in the provincial assembly as in 1994, with roughly the same percentage of the overall vote as in the last election.
Bouchard had been counting on a gain of several seats to solidify his support.
The separatists fell short of the 46 percent they had said they needed to succeed in a third referendum to take Quebec out of Canada and form an independent nation of roughly seven million people on the northern border of the United States.
The separatists have lost two previous referendums, one decisively in 1980, the other narrowly in 1995.
Bouchard's support is strongest among French-speaking voters, who are more evenly spread throughout the province than English speakers, who are concentrated in and around the city of Montreal and who traditionally vote for the Liberals and against separation.
It was the third-party candidate, Mario Dumont, who seemed to have drawn votes from the separatists.
Bouchard told voters during the campaign that he would hold another referendum in the four to five years of his government if ``winning conditions'' existed.
While he never defined those conditions, it was widely believed that one of them was a level of popular support above 46 percent.
Voters sided with Bouchard even though the support for separation has declined.
Recent polls indicate that only 43 percent of Quebecers would vote yes in another referendum on independence, a drop of four percentage points during the course of the campaign.
``For the past few weeks, I have had the feeling that were it not for the issue of sovereignty, a greater number of English speaking Quebeckers would have supported our program,'' Bouchard said in a restrained victory speech before supporters here in Quebec.
He mentioned sovereighnty only once, repeating his pledge to create the ``winning conditions'' under which a referendum could be won.
But he also acknowledged that the lower than expected level of support for his party reflected a disastisfaction among voters that he could not ignore.
``I respect the signal you sent by choosing candidates who reflect their attachnment to Canada,'' he said.
``We have decided to stay the course no matter what political decisions the people of Quebec make for themselves''.
What appeared to be taking place, analysts said, is that Quebecers see this election as a vote on government, not on independence, so separatist emotions are in check.
But voters want Bouchard to keep alive the possibility of another referendum on separation as a way of increasing the province's leverage with Ottawa in upcoming discussions about changes in the shape of Canadian federalism.
Even without a referendum, Bouchard's re-election would increase tensions and uncertainty in Canada.
During the campaign, he said he would demand substantial changes in the Canadian federation, forcing Ottawa to give back more powers over social programs not just to Quebec but to all 10 provinces.
In one stroke, he silenced the critics in his own party who suspected his commitment to changing relations with the central government, and he undercut the position of Charest, who equated a vote for the Parti Quebecois with a vote for separation.
``We don't want, and Quebecers don't want, to be divided during the next four years,'' Charest said in a concession speech in his home district of Sherbrooke, where he narrowly regained his seat in the provincial assembly.
He said he would not resign, but would fight as leader of the opposition to bring Quebec together.
``The people of Quebec, like the people of all of Canada, want this country of ours to work and be a success whatever government it has,'' Charest said.
When Charest announced last spring that he would challenge Bouchard in the election, analysts gave the Parti Quebecois little chance of retaining power.
Many in English Canada believed that if Charest, a popular federal politician, could win and impose a moratorium on referendums for the next four to five years, he could end or severely impede the separatist movement, whose strength has been diluted by immigration and demographic change.
But Charest's campaign never caught on.
It is expected that there will now be calls for his resignation, and that of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who is against changes to the Canadian federation.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS).
nn The failure of Charest to win support in his home province was just one surprise among many in this election that seemed to settle very little except Bouchard's reputation as one of Quebec's most popular and adept political leaders.
``It's been the strangest election I have ever seen in my life,'' said Pierre Roy, 61, a retired businessman from Lac Beauport, near Quebec city.
``Bouchard's posters said `Have confidence,' but people are afraid about what's going to happen''.
Roy voted just after polls opened at 10 a.m. on a gray day marked with freezing rain and snow in many parts of the province.
While Quebec's future is still uncertain, the outcome of the election was predicted by public opinion polls weeks ago.
Unlike past developments on Quebec separation, which sent financial markets spiraling downward, the projected results appeared to have been discounted already.
The Canadian dollar actually strengthened slightly, closing at a value of 65 U.S. cents.
The Toronto Stock Exchange declined just under 2 percent on a day when most markets around the world were also down for reasons that had nothing to do with the election here.
The modern separatist movement began about 30 years ago and is based on deeply rooted feelings that Quebec has not been treated fairly by English speaking Canada.
Most popular among young voters, the movement seeks to preserve and strengthen Quebecois culture.
The most radical wing of the party pushes for outright independence, but more moderate members say they want to negotiate something less than a separate nation, perhaps an economic relationship with the rest of Canada that allows them to keep their Canadian passports and their Canadian currency but have control over language, culture and many other social considerations.
Separatists have often tried to portray the process of secession as straightforward and relatively painless.
But that does not take into account such issues as dividing the national debt, compensation for federal property and Quebec's place in international accords like the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The rest of Canada would not vote in a referendum, but would have to negotiate the terms of secession, a difficult process at best.
In addition, the Cree Indians who live in northern Quebec and roughly 700,000 English speakers in the Montreal area who want to stay in Canada would be likely to insist on the partition of the province.
The 33-day election campaign _ the shortest in Quebec history _ was marked by a frantic pace of speeches and rallies, and one debate on Nov.
17 that was seen by many viewers as a virtual tie between Bouchard and Charest.
Dumont, of the Democratic Action Party, also appeared in the debate, and his strong performance was believed to have hurt Charest.
Overall, the campaign generated little real emotion, despite expectations that it would be a clash of titans.
However, the results indicate that Quebec voters drew a sharp distinction between Bouchard's ability to govern and his party's commitment to holding a third referendum on separation.
Polls indicate that most Quebecers do not want to be put through another referendum, but that they believe the threat of separation is useful to bringing about changes in Canada.
``There were no people yelling slogans in the street or things like that,'' said Gilles Paquet, director of the Center on Governance at the University of Ottawa.
``Instead, what you saw today is the rational vote by a group that feels it can do better in the Canadian federation by electing a separatist government''.
What appears certain is that the results of Monday's election will set all of Canada on another painful round of introspection and soul-searching about the identity and nature of the country.
This period could be different, however, because Bouchard _ an experienced negotiator _ has introduced a new element that substantially changes the picture.
In one of the many major shifts in the positions that he took during the campaign, he hinted that before calling a referendum on independence, he would push Ottawa for a freer hand in spending on social issues, especially health.
Under Canada's national medical system, delivering health care is the responsibility of each of the 10 provinces.
But the federal government provides about 70 percent of the money that the provinces spend on health care and imposes many standards and restrictions on how the money can be spent.
Bouchard and the premiers of the other nine provinces signed an agreement at a meeting last summer to explore a new arrangement that would give the provinces more flexibility, including the chance to get money from Ottawa without participating in the federal system.
For Bouchard, it appears to be a strategy that cannot lose.
If Ottawa gives in to the demands, Bouchard can tell the people of Quebec that he wrested an important concession from Prime Minister Chretien, who has strongly opposed giving any more powers to the provinces.
If Ottawa refuses, Bouchard can say that he had tried to negotiate in good faith but was rejected.
That could represent one of the ``winning conditions'' that he said must be apparent before he calls for another referendum on separation.
What is uncertain, analysts say, is how much resentment would be generated by Ottawa's rebuff of the new federalism, and how that resentment would affect a vote on separation.
Since Bouchard signed the agreement with the other premiers last summer, little attention has been paid to the issue in Quebec.
But polls indicate that a majority of Quebecers want Bouchard to negotiate a new federal union.
By imposing the requirement of ``winning conditions'' on another referendum, and by raising the question of negotiating changes in Canadian federalism with Ottawa, Bouchard has left himself so many options that there is no way to know his exact plans.
MONCTON, New Brunswick (AP) -- The land known as Acadia disappeared from maps nearly 300 years ago, when the French colonial settlement was lost to the British after years of war for what are now Canada's maritime provinces.
But Acadians and their culture are alive and well in French-speaking New Brunswick, perfectly happy to remain part of Canada and deeply distrustful of the independence aspirations of their fellow Francophones in nearby Quebec.
It's no coincidence that Canada chose to highlight the Acadians at a Francophone summit here this weekend -- to show that not all French Canadians support Quebec's sovereignty and actually fear what an independent Quebec might mean for their own well-being.
``We can live together in harmony.
We're a good example to Quebec,'' said Roger Gaudet, a father of four who can trace his family history back to an original French settlement in Nova Scotia.
The 300,000 people of Acadian descent in Canada's Atlantic provinces -- New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland - worry most that an independent Quebec will only make it harder for them to preserve the French culture they have fought for 300 years to retain.
``The balance of power between Anglos and Francophones rests on a strong Quebec presence at the federal level,'' said Maurice Basque, director of Acadian studies at the University of Moncton, the largest Francophone university in the region.
``Without Quebec, the question will become: `Will Canada remain bilingual'''?
Quebec's sovereignty has been put on the back page for the time being, after voters rejected sovereignty in successive referendums in recent years.
Secessionists are vowing to try again in a few years.
Quebec legislator Francine Lalonde said the province will one day be its own country -- with or without support from Acadians.
``The fact that Quebec will be a French country in association with Canada would be a plus for them in all sorts of ways,'' she said.
Quebec would continue to agitate for better French schools and services for the rest of French-speaking Canada, she said.
At the core of the Acadian argument against separation for Quebec is their own history and the event that defined them -- the deportation of 10,000 Acadians from Nova Scotia by Britain beginning in 1755 for refusing to swear allegiance to the queen.
Many resettled in Louisiana, where they are now called Cajuns, but others returned to the provinces to reclaim the land of their ancestors and rekindle their French identity with Canada's blessing.
Today, Acadians make up about a third of the population of New Brunswick -- too small a minority to challenge Ottawa for independence, but large enough to have successfully lobbied for public schools that teach entirely in French.
On Saturday, French President Jacques Chirac paid tribute to their courage, telling a crowd of several hundred people how honored he was to be among so many people loyal to France.
``I know the immense road your people have traveled since the tragic ordeals that have marked your identity for centuries,'' he said.
That recognition is enough to keep Acadians content with the status quo, said Acadian student Eric Larocque.
``Acadia was erased from the maps in the 1700s,'' he said.
``It doesn't exist but in the hearts of those who fought to save our language and culture.''
QUEBEC CITY _ Five years ago, Canada seemed a country about to rip itself apart.
In a 1995 referendum on independence, the restive province of Quebec came within a few thousand votes of secession, plunging Canada into its darkest political hour in decades.
And when Quebec's premier, Lucien Bouchard, vowed that within a few years Quebecers would vote to break away from the nine other provinces, no one could dismiss the vision.
The drive to create a French republic north of New England seemed all but irresistible.
Today, Quebec's separatist movement lies in tatters.
Not dead, certainly, but in disarray.
There seems little possibility Bouchard will risk humiliation by calling for another independence vote next year, as he had pledged.
But if the separatist cause suddenly bounces back _ and that also remains a possibility in this most unpredictable of provinces where French language, customs, and civil law reign supreme _ federalist folly will be mostly to blame.
Recent days have seen officials in Ottawa, Canada's capital, insistent on wagging the red Maple Leaf in the face of the Quebec bull.
And that's always risky.
Many observers warn that a new ``tough love'' campaign by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a French Quebecer deeply opposed to separatism, represents a monumental political blunder _ one that risks giving Bouchard and his secessionist supporters the lift they need.
Even the usual Quebec-baiting voices of English Canada are cautioning Chretien against imposing a law that would spell out, for the first time, the conditions under which Quebec would be allowed to quit Canada's 133-year-old confederation.
``Why get tough with Quebec now''? asked the Toronto Star in an editorial.
``Bouchard's demoralized troops crave nothing more than a move that could rekindle nationalist passions''.
Chretien's efforts _ which have divided his Cabinet, with some ministers quietly warning that the current course makes no political sense _ have mostly succeeded in appalling Quebecers of all ideological stripes.
Only Bouchard's separatists seemed to relish the prospect of renewed confrontation, with the fiery premier railing against ``attacks on Quebec democracy''.
To Americans, Chretien's determination to impose strict ``rules of secession'' might seem sensible enough, a worthy precaution against the day when Quebec might rise again.
But French Quebecers, even ardent federalists, have bridled at any suggestion that the rest of Canada deserves a say over their destiny.
``Myself, I don't like separatists; I'm OK in Canada,'' said Denis Cote, a lawyer in the southwestern Quebec city of Hull.
``But I also think Canada has no damn business setting rules for Quebec.
Whether to stay or go should be our decision, and ours alone.
Every Quebecer feels that''.
Chretien's sudden determination to formalize the rules of divorce seem especially strange given that the Quebec-Canada marriage seems stronger than it has in decades.
In Montreal, Quebec's largest city and its economic engine _ and the only center with a large population of English speakers _ businesses and professionals are no longer fleeing in droves to Ontario to escape political uncertainty.
The language laws so despised by anglophones are being less rigorously applied, high-tech sectors are booming, and relations between French and English are noticeably friendlier and more relaxed.
Into this new bonhomie wades Chretien.
``Canada is my business, sir, and it's the future of Canada we are dealing with,'' the prime minister snapped during a recent news conference, vexed by reporters who questioned Ottawa's timing.
``This has to be done''.
Bouchard characterized Ottawa's hard line as a ``brutal and demented attack,'' and said his province does not need the permission of anyone except its voters to break away.
``After a `Yes' vote,. . . the doors will be wide open to a unilateral declaration of independence,'' he told reporters, barely concealing his glee that journalists were again asking about Quebec's future.
For Canada is getting tough on Quebec just as polls show the sovereignty movement going nowhere.
A survey released last month found 41 percent of Quebecers would vote ``Yes'' in a vote on separation.
That's a long way from the ``winning conditions'' that Bouchard has said must exist before he will call for another referendum.
The reason for the decline of support for separatism is difficult to pinpoint.
There has been no scandal, Bouchard remains a basically popular figure, and French Quebecers, according to polls, feel as distant from the rest of Canada as ever and still want some sort of new deal.
At the same time, familiarity with Bouchard and his governing Parti Quebecois has bred a certain cynicism, if not contempt.
Right now, Quebecers are steamed at hospital closures, slashed school spending, public service strikes, and an economy that is lagging behind that of other parts of Canada.
Quebec is the country's second most populous province, after Ontario.
``People are unhappy with the basic services that the government is supposed to provide them, whether it's health care, education, job training,'' said political analyst Jean-Marc Leger of the Quebec polling firm Groupe Leger &AMP; Leger.
``You can't be trying to talk sovereignty when people aren't happy with the basic services''.
In 1994, when the separatist Parti Quebecois regained control of Quebec's National Assembly, the provincial Legislature, after more than a decade on the political sidelines, Quebecers were bitter about Canada's refusal to grant the province special political status as a ``distinct society'' under an amended federal constitution.
Six years later, no one talks much about ``distinct society'' and the Parti Quebecois seems just another political party _ one that has done an adequate job of running Quebec, but not much more _ while Bouchard, although still respected and personally popular, increasingly seems just another Quebec premier, not the larger-than-life personification of heady nationalist dreams.
``When you govern, you hurt yourself,'' said Alain Gagnon, director of the Quebec studies program at Montreal's McGill University.
But some analysts say separatist fortunes could revive if Canada is perceived as trying to bully Quebec.
What Chretien is seeking is a federal law that would not forbid Quebec or any other province from seceding, but would lay down formal rules, including that the process take place ``in consultation'' with the rest of Canada and only after a vote in which a ``clear majority'' of Quebecers choose independence.
These seem risky demands, but federal hard-liners are adamant.
``We must stop being inhibited by the dual fear of backlash and self-fulfilling prophecy,'' said Stephane Dion, a Cabinet minister and point man for the tougher line on Quebec.
The federal government has refused to specify what it means by a ``clear majority,'' although the National Post newspaper, quoting unnamed Chretien government sources, reported recently that Ottawa would not accept Quebec's secession unless the separatists win 60 percent of the vote.
Bouchard calls this hypocrisy, noting that in 1949 Newfoundland was able to quit the United Kingdom and join Canada with a simple majority vote of 50 percent plus one vote.
The big difference was Canada and Britain wanted Newfoundland to switch allegiances.
``The rule has always been 50 percent plus one; that's democracy,'' Bouchard said.
``Making it any different means a federalist vote counts for more than a separatist vote.
That's the sort of rule Ottawa wants.''
OTTAWA, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada began a landmark hearing Monday on whether the French-speaking province of Quebec has the right to secede unilaterally.
The week-long hearing is expected to let the court rule, months from now, on whether unilateral secession is legal under either domestic or international law, and if the two conflicts, which law prevails.
Canada's federal government initiated the court case 18 months ago in a bid to lay down legal rules for the political battle over Quebec separation.
The move is seen as a key part of Ottawa's strategy of challenging separatists arguments that Quebec has a right to separate regardless of the views of the rest of Canada.
The Quebec government is officially boycotting the case, saying that separation is a political issue rather than a legal issue and that the court should not hear the case.
Premier Jean Chretien's government is using a biased court to try to rob Quebecers of their democratic right to determine their own future, it argued.
"The last word belongs not to one man, not to one government, not to one text imposed from on high....
The last word belongs to Quebec democracy, to the Quebec people," declared Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard.
SAINT-JEAN-SUR-RICHELIEU, Quebec (AP) _ It is a paradox that keeps all of Canada in limbo: Most Quebeckers aren't eager for another referendum on secession, yet they seem on the verge of re-electing a government committed to independence.
Barring a surprise in the campaign's final week, separatist Premier Lucien Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois are expected to win another term in provincial elections Nov.
30 and begin laying the groundwork for Quebec's third referendum on leaving Canada.
If Bouchard is to be stopped, the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party must win in places like Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Montreal.
It is a district with a history of voting on the winning side, and the separatists narrowly won here in 1994.
Even the local Liberal candidate is perplexed by the Quebec paradox.
``The polls show most people don't want any more referendums, and yet Bouchard is still popular,'' Gilles Dolbec said in an interview at his headquarters.
``We can we do''?
In 1994, the Liberals finished just barely behind the Parti Quebecois in the provincewide popular vote yet won only 47 of the 125 legislative seats, compared to 77 for the Parti Quebecois.
That gap exists because anti-separatist support is heavily concentrated in Montreal and a few other pockets with large numbers of English-speakers.
The Parti Quebecois has strong support in the majority of districts dominated by French-speakers, who make up about 82 percent of Quebec's 7 million population.
Saint-Jean is overwhelmingly French-speaking.
But, because of its bellwether reputation and the close 1994 result, it is one of 18 districts now held by the separatists that the Liberals are targeting in hopes of eking out a slim legislative majority.
Dolbec insists he is optimistic, but interviews with local journalists, politicians, college students and one of their political science teachers gave little indication of any enthusiasm for the Liberals' provincial leader, Jean Charest, who wants to replace Bouchard.
``Charest's not a bad person,'' said Pierre Bergeron, a student at the local junior college.
``He speaks well, but he doesn't develop the issues''.
Bergeron's classmate, Chantal Girard, said Charest _ a native Quebecker who spent more than a decade in federal politics _ is ``too Canadian''.
That can be a damaging image in a province where voters expect their politicians to be Quebeckers first.
Both students agreed with political science professor Michel Barrette that many young Quebeckers are apathetic about the campaign.
But they predicted Bouchard would win the bulk of the votes cast by young people, even though Charest, at 40, is 19 years younger than the popular premier.
Charest has stressed two themes in his campaign _ that the threat of another secession referendum is undermining Quebec's economy and that Bouchard's budget-cutting to erase a deficit has ravaged the public health care system.
Yet at the Saint-Jean hospital, the director of medical services said his staff accepted the need for spending cuts and has adjusted to reforms meant to shorten patients' stays.
``Mr. Charest is ringing empty bells,'' said Dr.
Stephen Morgan.
``He says what Bouchard has done is awful, but he doesn't say what he'd do instead''.
Morgan, a native French-speaker despite his Anglo-sounding name, said he hadn't decided whether to vote for the Parti Quebecois or a long-shot third party headed by 28-year-old Mario Dumont.
His decision, he said, will be based on prospects for providing effective government, not on the issue of separation.
``I would vote `No' in a referendum'' on secession, he said.
``But I could vote for Bouchard''.
That meshes with the line coming from the local Parti Quebecois candidate, Roger Paquin.
``We're still a separatist party.
What we want to do is clear,'' he said.
``But we're also a provincial government, and we have to work for the people now.
This election is about a quality government for Quebec''.
Opinion polls indicate two-thirds of Quebeckers don't want a referendum during the next government's term in power.
Yet Bouchard appears to be attracting support from some of those voters with his somewhat ambiguous promise to hold a referendum only when ``winning conditions'' exist.
Commentators suggest this enables Bouchard to win backing both from hard-line separatists and from francophones who don't want independence but like having a feisty pro-Quebec government that is willing to battle federal officials.
``It's not clear that Quebeckers really want to get rid of ambiguity,'' wrote Lysiane Gagnon, a columnist for the Montreal daily La Presse.
``Most francophones have grown used to living with sovereignty's sword of Damocles hanging over their heads.
... It's been talked about for 30 years and it never happens, so what's the problem?''
OTTAWA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Lucien Bouchard is expected to become Parti Quebecois leader and Quebec premier at the end of this month, reviving a crusade for Quebec independence from Canada.
Bouchard secured his leadership in Quebec on the midnight Thursday when be became the only candidate to seek the posts.
He will be proclaimed the leader of Party Quebecois at a special party meeting in Montreal on January 27 and will probably be sworn in as premier two days later.
He will resign as leader of Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition party in the Federal Parliament.
Bouchard decided to take over the job last November from Parti Quebecois and Quebec Premier Jacquese Parizeau who announced his resignation after the October-30 referendum on Quebec independence was defeated.
He took over the leadership from Parizeau in the referendum campaign and he was credited with his role in the final campaign which brought separatists to a near victory from the hopeless mood.
Bouchard's moving into the Quebec politics will keep the independence movement in the province alive.
Bouchard has promised to tackle the province's deficit crisis and to create a climate for economic growth.
Opinions show that most quebeckers want the provincial government to focus its attention to the economy rather than independence after the referendum.
Quebec has serious financial problems with one of the biggest debt and tax burdens in Canada.
In an editorial, the Montreal daily Gazette today urges Bouchard to devote his energy to governing and tackling the "very serious social, economic and fiscal problems" facing Quebeckers.
But Bouchard never hid his goal of Quebec independence.
He told quebeckers on the referendum night, last November that next referendum could come sooner than they think.
News reports said earlier that Bouchard will consider a fall election in Quebec.
The election, assuming that he would win, would position him to hold another referendum on independence next year.
MONTREAL (AP) _ It was a judgment worthy of Solomon.
Canada's Supreme Court managed to rule on the question of Quebec secession without infuriating leaders on either side of a bitter ideological divide.
In its unanimous opinion Thursday, the court stated clearly _ as the federal government had hoped _ that Quebec had no right to secede from Canada unilaterally.
The ruling was widely considered the most important ever by Canada's high court.
But instead of the expected anger from separatists, there was satisfaction over another part of the court's declaration: that federal officials would be obligated to negotiate if a clear majority of Quebeckers voted for secession in a fair referendum.
``We've always said that negotiations would follow a vote for secession,'' said Jacques Brassard, a Cabinet minister in Quebec's pro-independence government.
``Now what the court has said is that these negotiations will be obligatory''.
Hard-line anti-separatists also were pleased, because for the first time, the high court said the separatists' longstanding claim that Quebec could decide for itself whether to secede has no legal basis.
``If I were a dancing man, I'd be dancing in the street,'' said William Johnson, president of a Montreal-based group called Alliance Quebec that promotes the rights of the province's English-speaking minority.
``Secessionists have always said that they alone could impose the question (in a referendum), interpret the results as they like and then impose all the conditions of the secession,'' Johnson said.
``It has always been false''.
Secession by Quebec _ where more than 80 percent of the 7 million residents are French-speaking _ would deprive Canada of a quarter of its population and split the four Atlantic provinces from the rest of the country.
The ruling is likely to play a pivotal role in Quebec's upcoming provincial election.
Premier Lucien Bouchard, the separatists' charismatic leader, is expected to hold the vote either late this year or next spring, and he plans to call another referendum on secession if he wins re-election.
The latest polls show Bouchard's Parti Quebecois running neck-and-neck with the anti-separatist Liberal Party.
The leader of the Quebec Liberals, Jean Charest, said the election would offer a clear choice to voters in the mostly French-speaking province.
``Do we want a government that's going to hold another referendum...
or do we want to get down to the business of building Quebec''? he asked.
Montrealers espoused virtually every possible viewpoint after the ruling.
Some were pleased by the balanced nature of the decision; others complained that the court was intruding on a matter that concerned only Quebeckers.
``It isn't up to the courts,'' said Martin Pare, 26.
``When people want to be free, they make that choice themselves''.
Clyde Jennings, a 29-year-old graphic artist, said the ruling sends a message to the Quebec government that secession would involve bargaining and possible compromise.
``It takes the pressure off the separation issue and puts the emphasis on people's rights,'' he said.
``It sends a strong signal that Canada is one country''.
The high court decided to leave some of the thorniest issues to the politicians.
It did not specify what victory margin would constitute a ``clear majority'' in a secession referendum, and it did not grapple with the possibility that negotiations over secession might reach an impasse .
FLORENCE, Ky.
_ Since dedicating himself to creationism 20 years ago when he was a disillusioned science teacher in Australia, Ken Ham has found that progress generally can be slow, but hardly as slow as his evolutionist adversaries would have the world believe.
After moving to America five years ago, Ham, a dedicated Christian fundamentalist with an Abe Lincoln gaze to his musings about the origin of life, now directs a $5-million-a-year enterprise and claims to have 110 ``creation clubs'' in schools across the country.
He expects more as he spreads the literal word according to Genesis _ that creation was a divine accomplishment in six days _ and tries to debunk the teaching of evolution.
This would seem an uphill struggle, but Ham takes comfort that the phones and Web site of his nonprofit organization, Answers in Genesis Inc.
, are still busy with the stir created by creationism's biggest victory to date _ the Kansas Board of Education's decision last August to yield to growing pressure and delete virtually any mention of evolution from the state's science curriculum.
This was followed last month by the decision of state education officials here in Kentucky to eliminate the word ``evolution'' but not the scientific theory of evolution from the school curriculum and to substitute the phrase ``change over time''.
In Oklahoma, officials recently ordered that textbooks must bear a disclaimer about the certainty of evolution.
On the other hand, New Mexico's Board of Education voted last month to bar creationism and overwhelmingly endorse evolution in the science curriculum.
``This whole battle is hotting up,'' Ham summarized amid some glaring, gaping full-sized dinosaur models scattered about his headquarters like an oddly dissenting chorus on the phylogenetic scale.
Ham uses the mystery about the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from creation as an argument against evolution.
He is planning to build a creationist museum north of here near Cincinnati, full of naturalist displays presenting ``creation science'' arguments that creation was accomplished 6,000 years ago.
Under the theory of evolution, rooted in a myriad of fossil, anatomic and genetic evidence, the scientific consensus is that life began on earth around 3.9 billion years ago, with humans and other species evolving from a common ancestor.
Ham has his own staff of scientists arguing to the contrary in heavily foot-noted monographs challenging the reliability of carbon-dating and other underpinnings of modern science.
``I see a culture war hotting up in America between Christian morality and relative morality, which is really the difference between a creation-based philosophy and an evolution-based one,'' said Ham, who argues that if the word ``day'' in Genesis' account of creation is allowed to be taken metaphorically to encompass eons and to blur divinity's role, then the Bible is made fallible and morality reduced to human whim.
Whether or not America is ready for such a culture war of words, Ham is.
His group claims 140,000 on its mailing list and more than 3,000 visitors a day to its Web site at www.answersingenesis.org.
H says the organization is growing as political leaders are more tempted to tinker with accepted notions about evolution.
Supported by donations and fees on a wide array of handsomely produced recordings and publications, Answers in Genesis holds seminars across the country, offering counterarguments to evolution.
It offers not outright Christian fundamentalism, but ``a supplement to the church,'' in Ham's view.
Teachers who sponsor the creation clubs must sign a commitment to ``the inerrant word of God''.
As a nonprofit group, his organization does not lobby government.
But it presents information to anyone who asks, and Ham happily claims that some Kansas officials involved in the curriculum decision are quite familiar with his publications.
``I'm very encouraged,'' said Ham, the director of one of the nation's two dominant creationist groups.
The other is the Institute for Creation Research in San Diego, where Ham once worked.
He decided to strike out on his own into what he says is a growing field of intellectual challenge, but what his critics say is a fundamentalist protest niche far more lucrative than enlightening.
``We're having a rash of statewide problems,'' said Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education, the main grass-roots science group active against creationism, with 4,000 members.
While creation clubs are entitled to free speech, Ms.
Scott said, they prepare adherents with flurries of classroom challenges that ``tend to discourage the teaching of evolution''.
In reaction to creationist assaults, the National Science Teachers Association, with 53,000 teachers, has begun holding information sessions at its state conventions this fall to prepare teachers to lead their communities in defending evolution as vital to a proper education.
Ken Rosenbaum, a Kentucky science teacher, rankles at ``change over time'' as the state's official new euphemism for evolution.
He expects his state Science Teachers Association, of which he is executive director, will soon come out firmly behind evolution.
``Put a nail outside and it will rust,'' Rosenbaum commented, teacherlike.
``That's change over time.
But is it evolution''?
Ham is only further encouraged by the evolutionists' rallying to their cause as his own speaking engagements grow.
``I was trained in a Christian home by a father always prepared to defend his faith in a logical way,'' he said.
``I saw him do that over and over against liberal theology,'' said Ham, confidently patting the synthetic hide of a large dinosaur being prepared for the future museum of creationism.
The information card of the extinct creature offered the standard natural history pedigree, with an added notation: ``Created Day Six.''
Someone made the pen she writes with.
Someone made the keyboard she types on.
All complex systems are designed by someone, so it follows that life, the most complex system of all, has a designer, too, said Johnson, of Prairie Village, Kan.
``No one's saying who that intelligent designer is,'' she said.
To Johnson, evolution simply makes no sense.
She rejects the evidence most scientists say supports the theory that all living things share common ancestors.
She firmly believes in the biblical account of creation.
Early this year she mounted a campaign to turn the Kansas science community on its ear.
Judging from the agitation in the state over evolution, there is evidence she has succeeded: - In the beginning, the Kansas Board of Education and the state education commissioner appointed a 27-member committee of science teachers and professors to write new science standards for public schools.
The committee's version described the theory of evolution as a ``unifying concept'' for all science disciplines.
It drew objections from those who do not believe in evolution.
Late last winter, Johnson pulled together a loosely knit group of creationists from Kansas and Missouri who drafted an alternate version of the standards.
The alternate draft, presented to the state board, defined both evolution and creation in its glossary.
It also defined the battle that would occupy the state board for months.
- Johnson visited the Kansas board again and again, urging members to reject the committee's science standards in favor of her group's standards.
- She also formed the National Committee for Excellence in Science Education, which helps people in other states who want to question evolution.
The group intends to offer the alternate science standards written by Johnson and others to people in other states.
Steve Abrams, a conservative Kansas Board of Education member from Arkansas City, Kan.
, presented the alternate standards Johnson helped write.
``She was very dedicated and wants to see good science in Kansas,'' said Abrams, a veterinarian.
Val DeFever, a moderate board member from Independence, Kan.
, said Johnson was determined to sway board members to her point of view.
``I just explained to her we weren't on the same wavelength,'' said DeFever, who supported the standards written by the science teachers.
``We were both committed to our viewpoints, and it really would be a waste of time''.
Johnson says she wanted scientists to explain why, as she sees it, evolution is immune from question and why other explanations for the origins of life cannot be considered in science classes.
``I admire her dedication,'' said Ken Ham, executive director of the creationist organization Answers in Genesis, based in Kentucky.
``I admire her trying to do these things''.
Johnson's critics say that, under the guise of science, she is trying to inject into the public schools her religious belief that God created the universe.
John van Keppel of Leawood, Kan.
, an evolution supporter, says Johnson does not understand science well enough to dispute the facts of evolution.
The evidence against evolution that Johnson and other creationists say is being censored by mainstream science is a cut-and-paste job, said Charlotte McDonald, the Blue Valley School District's science coordinator.
``She is not presenting the whole scientific information,'' McDonald said.
``If you're going to take things out of context, you can refute anything you want to refute''.
&LR; brk:Fliers at malls Johnson, a 43-year-old mother of four, shares her beliefs with most people she meets.
She begins many conversations with creation naysayers by asking, ``What do you know about evolution to be true''?
In 1995 she and her brother asked the Shawnee Mission School District to use Of Pandas and People, a science textbook that puts forth intelligent design _ the idea that an intelligent being created Earth and everything in it.
District officials said they considered the text but rejected it.
Johnson and her husband began visiting shopping malls on weekends to place homemade creationist fliers on cars.
The fliers contained passages such as this: ``The theory of evolution is just a theory, yet our public school's texts do not mention the significant amount of scientific evidence against it.
Why the censorship''?
For Johnson and her husband, Eric, 37, the truth about how the universe came to be is readily available and has been for centuries.
``You have to believe the Bible is true,'' said Eric Johnson, a stockbroker.
``If it's not true, it's just a paperweight''.
Celtie Johnson said she was not completely against evolution being taught.
She said she just wanted teachers to feel comfortable presenting the pros and cons of Charles Darwin's theory.
Many feel pressured to teach evolution as a fact, she said.
She has been told, subtly and not, to sit down and shut up.
She has not.
``I feel confident that most humans have common sense, that they can critically think,'' Johnson said.
``I don't want them to be plagued with believing evolution, because it's not true''.
&LR; brk:Macro vs.
micro Some on the 10-member Kansas Board of Education agreed with Johnson, and in August the board approved science standards that contained references to microevolution, or adaptation, but no mention of macroevolution, or change from one species to another.
The revised version no longer lists evolution as one of science's unifying concepts.
The revised standards also omit many references to the age of Earth.
There is no longer any mention of the big-bang theory _ the idea that the universe was born in an explosion of matter and radiation between 12 billion and 20 billion years ago.
Those deletions are significant to ``young Earth creationists'' such as Johnson who believe that the Earth was created in six 24-hour days sometime in the last 7,000 years.
Creationists say they have evidence that supports this belief: - It takes about 300 to 1,000 years to form an inch of topsoil, but the worldwide average depth is about 7 to 8 inches, which means the Earth is only a few thousand years old, creationists say.
Evolutionists respond that that argument does not take erosion into account.
- The eruption of Mount St.
Helens in 1980 produced 25 feet of finely layered sediment and gouged canyons in one afternoon, which shows that millions of years are not required to form rock layers.
This lends credence to the global flood and other catastrophic events in the Bible, creationists say.
Evolutionists say erosion happens at variable rates all over the world.
Catastrophes explain some geologic formations but not all.
- Earth's magnetic field has been decaying rapidly, which creationists say points to an age younger than 10,000 years.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court refused to let a public school district require that the teaching of evolution be accompanied by a disclaimer mentioning ''the biblical version of creation'' and other teachings on life's origin.
The justices, by a 6-3 vote Monday, let stand rulings that struck down a Louisiana school board's disclaimer policy as a violation of the constitutionally required separation of government and religion.
Monday's action was not a precedent-setting decision but only a denial of review.
Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas voted to hear arguments in the case.
The Tangipahoa Parish school board in 1994 voted to require teachers to tell students about to study the theory of evolution that is ''presented to inform students of the scientific concept and not intended to influence or dissuade the biblical version of creation or any other concept''.
The disclaimer drafted by the school board also said: ''It is the basic right and privilege of each student to form his-her own opinion or maintain beliefs taught by parents on this very important matter.
... Students are urged to exercise critical thinking and gather all information possible and closely examine each alternative toward forming an opinion''.
Three parents of students sued in federal court to challenge the policy, and a federal judge blocked its enforcement.
The judge said the disclaimer was unconstitutional because it had a religious purpose.
A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the disclaimer had to be struck down but cited a different reason -- it had the effect of promoting religion.
The panel did not rule out the possibility that a school board could require some type of disclaimer stating that evolution was not the only accepted explanation of the origin of life.
But it said the Tangipahoa Parish disclaimer ''under the facts and circumstances of this case...
is not sufficiently neutral'' to be constitutionally permissible.
In the appeal acted on Monday, lawyers for the school board argued that ''the mere mention of the biblical version of creation by way of illustration does not present a significant risk of perceived endorsement of Bible-based religion''.
The appeal said reasonable high school or elementary students would not interpret the disclaimer as a pro-religion message.
''The central message of the disclaimer resolution is that there are no outsiders or insiders, no one who is favored or disfavored, on the issue of life's origin but persons of all viewpoints are full members in the school community''.
Lawyers for those who challenged the disclaimer disagreed.
''By disclaiming only evolution -- the one element of the school curriculum that generates religious controversy -- the school board has violated both the constitutional mandate of neutrality toward religion and its obligation to provide its students with secular educations free from religious indoctrination or partisanship,'' they said.
They noted that the disclaimer was drafted shortly after the school board voted 5-4 to reject a proposal to teach ''creation-science'' in the district's schools.
Creation-science teaches that Earth and most life forms came into existence suddenly about 6,000 years ago.
Critics have attacked it as a disguise for a literal translation of the Book of Genesis.
Evolution, first propounded by Charles Darwin, states that Earth is billions of years old, and that life forms developed gradually several million years ago.
The Supreme Court in 1987 barred states from requiring the teaching of creationism in public schools where evolution is taught, calling such a Louisiana law a thinly veiled attempt to promote religion.
The teaching of evolution has been controversial since the famous 1925 ''monkey law'' trial in which teacher John Scopes was convicted and fined $100 for teaching evolution when Tennessee law made it a crime to teach anything but the Biblical version of creation.
Scopes' conviction later was overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court on a procedural matter, and never reached the nation's highest court.
The case is Tangipahoa Parish Board of Education vs.
Freiler, 99-1625.
Writing for the court's three dissenters Monday, Scalia criticized the court for standing by while an appeals court ''bars a school district from even suggesting to students that other theories besides evolution -- including but not limited to, the biblical theory of creation -- are worthy of their consideration''.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nineteen states got D's or F's in a report that evaluated how public schools teach evolution, raising a new issue in a continuing dispute between science and religion.
The report graded 49 states and the District of Columbia and gave the highest rankings to California, Connecticut, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina and Rhode Island.
Kansas, whose standards were described as ''disgraceful,'' got the lowest grade.
The report was commissioned by the Thomas B.
Fordham Foundation and released Tuesday at the American Association for the Advancement of Science national headquarters.
Following the six top-ranked states, four states got numerical grades in the 90s and were also given A's in the report.
Fourteen states were graded at B, seven got C, six were given D's and 13 flunked.
Iowa was not included because it has no statewide education standards, leaving that up to each local district.
Linda Holloway, former chairman of the Kansas State Board of Education, said the report was deceptive and ''very unfair''.
''Clearly they have an ax to grind about evolution,'' she said in a telephone interview.
Kansas last year rekindled the issue of teaching evolution in public schools when the state board of education, led by Holloway, approved science teaching standards that minimized the importance of evolution and omitted the big-bang theory of the origin of the universe.
Other states have considered similar curriculum changes and some state legislatures have proposed laws that would forbid completely the teaching of evolution in public schools.
Evolution, a theory developed by Charles Darwin and others, holds that the Earth is billions of years old and that all creatures, including humans, evolved from simpler forms through a process of natural selection.
Related to biological evolution is the concept that the universe began with a ''big bang'' and that only later were the sun and the planets formed.
Teaching of evolution has been opposed by those who believe that the universe, the Earth and its creatures were created abruptly by God.
Some proponents of divine creation have organized a concept, called creationism, that they proposed be taught along with evolution.
In 1987, the Supreme Court barred states from requiring the teaching of creationism.
Now some of the same proponents support other concepts, such as ''abrupt appearance'' or ''intelligent design,'' that are linked to divine creation.
Lawrence S.
Lerner, who compiled the report, said the conflict ''is not really about science, but about religion and politics''.
He calls creationism ''a pseudoscientific rival to evolution that the courts have repeatedly held to be thinly veiled religion''.
Lerner, a former professor at California State University, Long Beach, said Kansas got such a poor grade because its guidelines forbid teaching anything about the age of the Earth or the universe.
''There is not a reference to the age of the universe because it changes all the time,'' explained Holloway.
''Within a month after we adopted the standards, I heard three different ages of the Earth.
That is kind of ludicrous to get them (teachers) to stick to one age when it changes all the time''.
Lerner called the Kansas science education standards ''a disgraceful paean to antiscience''.
Holloway, however, said the report was part of ''a campaign of deception'' and that all districts in Kansas are still teaching evolution.
''All we did was allow local groups to decide how they wanted to teach evolution,'' she said.
''That is a reasonable thing to do''.
Warren Nord, a member of a panel assembled by AAAS to comment on the report, spoke in favor of education standards that would include religious concepts of creation along with concepts of evolution.
But Nord, director of the Program on Humanities and Human Values at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the report failed to evaluate the completeness of science education.
''A good science education should not limit itself to what scientists think, but should also explore the cultural context in which scientific claims are made,'' said Nord, noting that the report ''doesn't address that''.

KANSAS _ In the days after the Kansas Board of Education voted to play down evolution in the state's science standards, chairwoman Linda Holloway joked that evolution supporters were acting as if the sky was falling.
More than two weeks have passed since the Aug.
11 decision, and the sky is still where it's supposed to be, but there has been fallout on many fronts: The American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and Western Missouri sent a letter to the superintendents of each of the state's 304 school districts.
It reviewed recent U.S.
Supreme Court decisions that outlawed teaching biblical creationism in science classes.
State Rep.
David Adkins of Leawood said he would sponsor legislation requiring high school students entering state universities to have studied evolution, the theory that living things have common ancestors and change over time.
Two national science organizations _ the National Academy of Sciences and the American Chemical Society _ condemned the board's action as a setback for science education in Kansas.
Evolution proponents formed a group, Kansas Citizens for Science, to support teachers and districts that want to teach the theory.
The publisher of a new textbook on Kansas history has decided to drop a chapter on the state's prehistory.
The chapter focused on the prehistoric inland sea and 150 million-year-old fossils found in western Kansas.
After hearing national reports about the new science standards, the board of the foundation publishing the book thought some Kansans might take issue with those topics.
``If we talk about (things that old), then it's beyond a creation date that most religions use,'' said Jim Bean, director of the Grace Dangberg Foundation in Carson City, Nev.
, which promotes the study of history by young people.
Kansas State University Professor Gary Conrad said he's having difficulty recruiting candidates for two openings within the biology department.
Last week, Conrad said, the president of an out-of-state research institution told him she would discourage her students from considering Kansas for employment because their children would be subjected to a public school education that might not include evolution.
School board members in Pratt, Kan.
, west of Wichita, listened to a presentation on a science textbook that espouses the theory of intelligent design _ the idea that a superior being designed the universe and everything in it.
During the media frenzy after the vote of the 10-member board, confusion abounded about the science standards' purpose.
The standards are guidelines for school districts to use as they determine what students should learn.
The document written by a 27-member committee of science educators listed evolution as a major concept, but earlier this month six board members _ five conservatives and one moderate _ voted to remove the emphasis.
The tests used as part of the state's accreditation program are based on the standards, and observers say most districts teach to the test.
New science tests to be given in the 2000-2001 school year will not include questions on macro-evolution, the idea that different species can share common ancestors.
That's fine with Mary Douglass Brown of Wichita, one of the board members who favored de-emphasizing evolution.
The board's intent was not to force creationism or any other theory on the origins of life into science classrooms, but to allow school districts to decide for themselves, Brown said.
She said she checked with officials of the Wichita School District before the vote and was told students would continue to learn about evolution.
That's the district's prerogative, Brown said.
``People don't seem to want to trust their local people to make this decision, and that's all we've done,'' Brown said.
``If Yoder (Kan).
wants creationism and their people want it, that's their business.
And I'm not going to stand in the way of it''.
Brown dismisses the idea that the board's decision could harm Kansas students.
But it's a real worry for Bill Wagnon, a board member from Topeka who supported the standards written by the science teachers.
Wagnon said he feared Kansas would lose its position as a leader and innovator in education.
The K-State professor's troubles attracting faculty members are just a start, Wagnon said.
``Reputations are hard to earn and easy to shatter,'' Wagnon said.
The science standards have yet to reach school districts.
The board's attorney still is ironing out copyright questions over parts of the standards based on materials from the National Academy of Sciences.
The standards written by the teachers committee relied heavily on the academy's National Science Education Standards, but the changed version might not meet with the academy's approval.
The standards will be sent to school districts as soon as those questions are answered, said Kathy Toelkes, the board's spokeswoman.
Dick Kurtenbach, executive director of the ACLU of Kansas and Western Missouri, said his organization had recruited a Kansas City law firm to determine what legal recourse the ACLU has.
He disputed Brown's claim of a return to local control.
``Why have standards at all''?
Kurtenbach said.
``Why select one aspect of it but pass on pages and pages and pages of other mandated issues?
If it was about local control, the state board would eliminate all standards and go out of business.''
BOSTON (AP) -- Fearing a growing assault on the teaching of Darwin's theories, a group of textbook authors has launched a campaign in defense of evolution education.
A joint statement, to be released today at the National Science Teachers Association, a convention of 20,000 science teachers, comes as some public school districts consider softening their evolution curricula.
``As scientists and teachers, we find it unacceptable that school districts considering our books for adoption would be encouraged to choose one book over another based on the perception that teachers should avoid the topic of evolution,'' the statement by 23 authors reads.
Backed by the California-based National Center for Science Education, the signers include Bruce Alberts, president of the National Academy of Sciences and an author of a cell biology book.
Evolution education continues to raise passions in American schools more than 70 years after teacher John Scopes was convicted of violating a Tennessee law against teaching it.
And the debate rages a decade after the Supreme Court ruled that public schools can't teach that God created the universe.
Over the last five years, the National Center for Science Education has logged scores of complaints from parents and educators worried about attacks on evolution education.
Some school districts have pushed for textbooks that are considered ``soft'' on evolution teaching, said Molleen Matsumura of the NCSE.
Others have advocated disclaimer stickers on texts, such as one approved by the Alabama Board of Education in 1995.
The Alabama label explains that evolution is a theory and that text statements about the origins of life should be considered as such.
Last month, the Melvindale-Northern Allen Park School Board in Michigan decided to supply some of its libraries with books that raise questions about the validity of evolutionary theory.
And in Texas last year, school districts across the state were urged to adopt textbooks that didn't ``harp on'' evolution, Matsumura said.
A Christian publisher's textbook, ``Of Pandas and People,'' has grown in popularity.
It, and others like it, subscribe to the theory that the world and its living creatures came about by ``intelligent design''.
The evolution scientists say that's just code for creationism.
The evolutionists are ``vastly overreacting to what we're trying to accomplish,'' said Raymond G.
Bohlin, who has a doctorate in molecular biology and heads the Probe Ministries, based in Richardson, Texas.
What he and others want, he said, is for evolution to be fairly represented and juxtaposed with other theories of life.
But there are no other theories, the scientists who signed the statement say.
Teaching biology without evolution is like teaching physics while ignoring gravity, they say.
``It's academically and intellectually dishonest to teach biology any other way,'' said Eric Strauss, author of a popular introductory biology textbook and a biology professor at Boston College.
WACO, Texas _ They are the new breed of creationists.
Atomic creationists, you might say.
And their official harboring at Baylor University has caused many in the faculty to go nuclear.
The launching of a center to promote ``theistic science'' or ``intelligent design'' is proving to be one of the biggest controversies of the Robert Sloan presidency.
If not the biggest controversy, possibly it is the most emblematic.
The issue is the Michael Polanyi Center.
Created supposedly to build a bridge between science and religion, it shares a hangar with Baylor's Institute for Faith and Learning.
Problem: Baylor didn't consult anyone in its science departments.
To much of the faculty, this is no bridge.
It's a detour.
The chairman of the faculty senate, Robert Baird, calls Polanyi ``one of the most divisive issues'' in his 32 years at Baylor and bemoans that a center focused on what it calls the ``growing dialogue between science and religion'' was created without a word sought from Baylor's scientists.
While much of the concern is over process, such as the science faculty's perceived snubbing, the overriding issue is substance _ what Polanyi is about.
What it's about is not an alliance with science but the refuting of it, or at least refuting the science of evolution and its Darwinist underpinnings.
That was clear within the first few words of a conference called ``The Nature of Nature'' hosted by Baylor and the center last week.
University of Texas philosophy Professor Robert Koons told the audience that with the whole of evidence examined, scientists (evolutionists) ``have no authority to dictate to us''.
Dialogue, anyone?
``Nature is comprehensible only'' if an outside force _ God _ has set in motion all the inner complexity, he said.
Koons among others, including Polanyi director William Dembski, adheres to the ``intelligent design'' theory _ the new creationism.
Essentially it grants to science certain facts: that the world is billions of years old rather than a few thousand, that evolution is a fact as it pertains to plants and animals, right up to the doorstep of man.
However, the essence of intelligent design is that man is in God's image, as the Bible says.
As Christians, Baylor science faculty members who so vehemently denounce Polanyi may not disagree with that bottom line.
They just see the ``intelligent design'' crowd as seeking to put a tourniquet on inquiry.
Baylor associate psychology Professor Charles Weaver derides it as the ``God card'' characterized by the bumper sticker meant to annoy any scientist: ``God says it; I believe it; that settles it''.
Whatever God might say, science is the process of studying that which can be examined and tested empirically.
In a feisty and somewhat quixotic way, the intelligent design crowd is like a kickboxer challenging a microscope to a fight.
The microscope is not there to fight.
It is there to examine.
That doesn't mean that the scientists won't fight.
Baylor associate biology Professor Richard Duhrkopf, a bitter critic of Polanyi, said the center's quest is to ``change the philosophy of science''.
More ominously, it is advocated by creationists as a wedge to get religion into science class in public schools, as reported recently by ``CNN Newsstand''.
``Darwin is dead, Darwinism is getting sicker by the day,'' wrote creationist Hal Ostrander in a recent commentary in SBC Life extolling the work of Dembski and Co.
Ostrander gushes about the potential of intelligent design to transform science class in public schools.
Critics in the Baylor faculty see the Polanyi Center as undermining the university's reputation in the sciences.
If Baylor thinks Polanyi is worth risking its reputation, maybe that empirical stuff isn't what it wants to be known for.

TOPEKA, Kan.
_ Sitting at their students' desks two days before the start of the new school year, four high school biology teachers here were hashing over the vote of the Kansas Board of Education, earlier this month, to delete virtually any mention of evolution from the state's recommended science curriculum and its standardized tests.
The teachers' reaction was as swift as it was unanimous: They would continue to teach science as they have been, with the support of their superintendent.
``They'll get evolution here,'' said Elaine Pardee, who teaches at Washburn Rural High, where the science classroom walls are lined with various animal skeletons that, by their very appearance, testify to the evolutionary theory of a common ancestor among mammals.
``We're not going to cheat our kids''.
About 200 miles away in Pratt, a small town west of Wichita, the local school board president, Willa Beth Mills, had a very different reaction to the state board's action.
She applauded it, and said she hoped that it would lead to elements of creationism _ or at least a heavy dose of skepticism about the theory of evolution _ being injected into her district's schools.
``I don't think it's relegated to Sunday school,'' Mrs.
Mills said.
``If you present the material to students with critical thinking, and they come to you with a paper supporting creationism, or arguing against evolutionary theory from a creationist point of view, you should accept that''.
These are emotionally volatile and exceptionally confusing days for the teachers, principals and parents of Kansas' public school children.
Two weeks after the board's vote, which was widely interpreted as establishing an important national beachhead for creationists, the theater of battle has shifted to the state's 304 public school districts.
Because the adoption of standards in science or any other subject cannot be dictated under state law, it will be up to each district to decide whether to follow the lead of the state board, which periodically issues guidelines suggesting what should be taught in the state's classrooms.
What the state board can control is the content of its standardized tests.
Beginning in the 2000-2001 school year, the state tests in 7th- and 10th-grade science will not ask students questions about the theories that multiple species have evolved from a common ancestor and that the universe originated in an explosion, or big bang _ two ideas that have come under sharp attack from those who have found more persuasive evidence of the world's origins in religion.
Questions about ``micro-evolution,'' defined in the state guidelines as changes in an organism's ``structure, function or behavior,'' will remain.
At issue for Kansans is nothing less than reconciling two central explanations of life: the Darwinian theory that man and monkey gradually branched off from the same family tree millions of years ago as they adjusted to a changing environment, a contention heavily rooted in scientific evidence, and the creationist belief that a divine being has been pulling the biological levers of the universe, including the origin of man as described in the Bible.
The debate concerns more than what public school students should learn about each point of view, more than a decade after the Supreme Court said states could not compel the teaching of creationism.
For science teachers, the state board's characterization of evolution as a theory shrouded in doubt _ no matter the supporting testimony of fossils and genetic codes _ has raised worries about whether other theories at the heart of science, like those concerning atoms or even gravity, will come under attack next.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) ``If you take away evolution because it's a theory, you can't teach science,'' said Steve Angel, a chemistry professor who is the president of the Auburn-Washburn school board in Topeka and a member of the committee of experts whose standards were rewritten by the state board.
``All of science is theory''.
Gov. Bill Graves, a moderate Republican, has been among the most vocal critics of the state board, whose 10 members are elected and are outside of his control.
He argues that the six-member majority that rewrote the standards in just a few hours, ripping out whole pages of a document that had been drafted over nearly two years by a committee of 27 scientists and science teachers, did so to make a rhetorical splash at the behest of the conservative wing of the state Republican Party.
``There are 304 locally elected school boards who have the option to tell the state board to go jump in the lake,'' said Mike Matson, a spokesman for the governor.
``The governor is confident the overwhelming number will''.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) At the urging of a group of parents, the school board in Pratt, a town of about 7,000, arranged a presentation earlier this month from a local wildlife biologist about a controversial book titled ``Of Pandas and People: The Central Question of Biological Origins''.
The book _ first printed in 1989 by Haughton Publishing of Dallas and since sold to public schools in more than a dozen states, including Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Texas _ suggests that ``intelligent design,'' as engineered by an ``intelligent agent,'' may be a more compelling explanation than biological evolution for the wide variety found in nature.
While the book stops well short of identifying God as the designer, as creationists might, critics, including those affiliated with the National Association of Biology Teachers, have condemned the book as little more than an artfully worded end-run around the constitutional separation of church and state in the classroom.
But to Chris Mammoliti, a biologist with the state Department of Wildlife and Parks who presented the book to the Pratt board, ``Of Pandas and People'' and its theory of intelligent design provides the perfect antidote to those teachers who might be tempted to teach evolution as an undisputed fact.
``I see the theory as saying, `It is legitimate to have, as part of the tool kit for science education, the option to say that the things we see in nature may be designed or could have been designed,''' he said.
``It doesn't speculate or presuppose that there is a creator or miracles involved''.
Mrs. Mills, the board president in Pratt, said the book is now under consideration for inclusion as a supplement to the district science curriculum, which was already being rewritten at the time of the state board vote.
nn Administrators in Pratt said that Mrs.
Mills' position on the standards has not prompted anyone to tell district officials they would pull their children out of the school system.
In Auburn-Washburn, one of five school districts in Topeka, the board president, Steve Angel, and the superintendent, Howard Shuler, have pledged that there will be no change in the district science standards in response to the state board vote.
Shuler said that only one parent of the district's 5,000 students had written to criticize the district stance, and that none had threatened to pull children out of district schools).
Ninth-grade biology students at Washburn Rural will be introduced to Darwin and the theory of evolution over three to five days in the spring semester, after they have gone through rites of high school biology like dissecting a rat and a sheep's heart.
The textbook used in the ninth grade, ``Biology: Visualizing Life,'' published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston of Austin, Texas, explains that ``monkeys, apes and humans are examples of primates'' and argues that ``primates most likely evolved from small, insect-eating rodentlike mammals that lived about 60 millions years ago''.
Ms. Pardee, who has taught biology at Washburn Rural for nine years, tells her students that the theory of evolution ``is the most currently acceptable scientific explanation that we have,'' but adds that her students ``don't have to believe it''.
What she insists is that her students ``know what the facts of the theory are''.
Though they might be able to pass the new state science test without such knowledge, she says, the material is covered in the standardized science test for the district and the advanced placement test in biology.
When the inevitable question from a student arises about creationism, usually couched in a biblical reference, Kevin Bordewick, another biology teacher at Washburn Rural, said he cuts off such discussions, believing they are better suited to a humanities class or the home.
``It's between them, their parents and whatever God they believe in, if any,'' Bordewick said.
Though Bordewick and his colleagues at Washburn said they would never introduce their personal beliefs into the classroom, other teachers said drawing such a thick line was nearly impossible.
Joyce Depenbusch, who teaches 7th- and 8th-grade science in Skyline, in Pratt County, says she believes that ``evolution and creation don't have to be mutually exclusive,'' and that ``God's plan of creation can include evolution''.
While Mrs.
Depenbusch says she does not ``present the science of creationism in my classroom,'' she says she was not opposed to telling her students about her beliefs, as long as she prefaced her comments ``very heavily'' with a warning that the ideas were her own.
``Evolution is a theory,'' she said.
``We can present several different theories to help them think.
Let them do some thinking with the help of their families.
Then let them make up their own minds.''
SANTA FE, N.M.
_ Bucking recent changes in Kansas and other states that allow public schools to teach alternative views of human development, the New Mexico Board of Education voted overwhelmingly on Friday to limit the statewide science curriculum to the teaching of evolution.
The vote effectively made New Mexico the first state in recent years to take a firm stand against the teaching of creationism, which generally recognizes the Bible as the ultimate authority on how the world was formed.
Creationism holds that a divine being created humans and other species a mere 10,000 years ago, while evolutionists say scientific evidence shows that life began almost 4 billion years ago with simple organisms, from which humans and all other forms of life evolved.
Until now, teachers had been required to give equal weight to alternative theories _ which in practical terms meant creationism _ in their science classroom discussions.
``This gives teachers the political cover they need to teach evolution,'' said Marshall Berman, the board member who led a three-year campaign to change the policy.
The board voted 14-1 in favor of the change, which will affect the 100,000 children who attend New Mexico's 725 public schools.
The lone dissenter, Van W.
Witt, objected by arguing that students should be allowed to consider all sides of the debate and then ``make up their minds with their parents''.
In the brief debate among board members that preceded the vote, Berman refuted that position, insisting that creationism _ or ``intelligent design,'' as some evolution opponents call it _ is not a comparable theory for teaching in public schools.
``If the assumption is there are two sides, I question the assumption,'' Berman told Witt.
``The sense is of creationism as a scientific theory, that it exists as a reliable principle.
But it is not based on science''.
While the often emotional debate between proponents of creationism and evolution is not new, it was rekindled this summer when the Kansas Board of Education voted to delete almost any mention of evolution from the state's science curriculum.
In a similar action, the Education Department of Kentucky deleted the word ``evolution'' from the state science curriculum, replacing it with the phrase ``change over time,'' which some state teachers interpreted as an attack on widely-accepted scientific principles.
Other states, including Alabama and Nebraska, have made other changes that allow for discussion of theories that challenge evolution.
Creationists hailed each of those changes as major victories during a time when the teaching of evolution has enjoyed pre-eminence in most public school districts as a result of a 1987 Supreme Court decision that said states could not compel the teaching of creationism in public schools.
In their battles to chip away at the dominance of evolution as the unchallenged explanation of life, creationists have run headstrong into teachers and scientists who have effectively lobbied their state and local school boards, as they have here in New Mexico, to keep evolution at the forefront of classroom discourse.
Flora M.
Sanchez, the president of the New Mexico Board, said that since the Kansas decision she had received ``a lot of negative input'' from scientists and teachers around the state who were uncomfortable with performance standards that required teachers to entertain alternative theories to evolution.
Many of the board members felt uneasy with comparisons with Kansas, she said, adding, ``So we decided we had to clarify our standards''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Some of that pressure was evident Friday, during the public comment period that preceded the vote.
Eight proponents of the changes, most of them scientists and teachers, urged the board to vote in favor, while three people appeared to raise objections.
Bruce Miller, a high school biology teacher who testified before the board, said that he feels more comfortable with a regulation that narrows teaching to theories based on science.
``I need it spelled out that I don't have to address a string of silly alternative theories,'' he said.
``With 175 class room days, I don't have time for that''.
Another proponent of the change, David E.
Thomas, editor of the Newsletter of the New Mexicans for Science and Reason, said that if public schools allowed unscientific theories to be taught, ``pretty soon we'll have Holocaust deniers insisting there were no gas chambers''.
Cindy Chapman, who teaches first- and second-graders, said the new regulations would even help teachers of the youngest children in public schools whose early knowledge of human development is often shaped by religion and is learned at home.
She said she was recently approached by a little boy in class who told her why dinosaurs no longer roam the earth.
``He said, `Because there was no room in the ark,''' Ms.
Chapman said.
``I don't think he made that up himself''.
Among those protesting the new standards was Paul Gammill, a retired engineer and the father of three children who attended Albuquerque public schools.
He echoed the concerns of many creationists, telling the board that evolution is ``arbitrary and dogmatic''.
He insisted that his view has nothing to do with religion, but in an interview before his testimony he said a belief in God is not compatible with acceptance of evolution.
While it appeared that most board members had their minds made up before the vote, they listened with rapt attention to Tom Manaster, a retired cab driver from Chicago now living in New Mexico who urged the board to reject any teaching standards beyond what can be proven.
``I wouldn't be here if it weren't for good science,'' he said.
``Five years ago I survived a brain tumor.
Those doctors had all kinds of religions and beliefs, but they also had some pretty good science''. &QL;
Just as historical debates are revisited from time to time, so is the seemingly age-old debate about how the origin of man should be taught in the classroom.
On the one hand, groups like the National Academy of Sciences say that evolution should be taught with no mention of the biblical version of creation.
On the other hand, some church leaders say they want creation science offered as an alternative to the cut-and-dried theory of natural selection, which holds that species emerge over time.
The National Academy of Sciences published a book this year reiterating its 15-year-old position that the theory of evolution _ and not religious beliefs _ should be taught in every public school biology classroom.
Yet this time, the academy provided examples of how a person can believe in God and still believe in evolution _ a position many religious scholars would agree with.
``I don't think in any way that science is at odds with the Bible,'' said Jeb Airey, pastor of the North Arlington Christian Center in Arlington, Texas.
``I think that science is a complement to the Bible''.
Further, there is a false belief by some that religious people can't be scientific, said Scott Youngblood, president of the Arlington Ministerial Association and pastor of St.
Barnabas United Methodist Church in Arlington.
``There's this misinterpretation that somehow you can't be smart and religious at the same time, and I think that not to be the case,'' Youngblood said.
``Every theory has holes; many scientists acknowledge the mystery in it to be God''.
Considered the nation's pre-eminent scientific organization, the National Academy of Sciences was chartered by Congress in 1863 to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters.
The academy's new book, designed for ministers, parents and anyone interested in the issue of teaching evolution, follows last year's release of another National Academy of Sciences publication specifically designed to show teachers how to explain evolution and how to answer questions about creation _ complete with mock conversations.
``It's kind of a one-two punch,'' said Eugenie Scott, executive director of the El Cerrito, Calif.-based National Center for Science Education, who sat on the steering committee for both publications.
Several local biology teachers say the issue has never been contentious in their classrooms.
Jim Davis has taught biology at Lamar High School in Arlington for 10 years and has spent about 24 years in the classroom.
He describes himself as a Christian and believes the Bible is a work written by men but inspired by God.
``I do believe in Jesus Christ,'' Davis said.
``The first thing I think about at the beginning of the day is to try to pattern my life after Christ''.
Yet, he said he can't deny the scientific evidence from carbon dating and fossils that humans existed several million years ago.
Davis said the discussions about evolution have come up often in his classroom through the years.
He occasionally finds himself answering the question: ``If man really came from apes, then why are apes still here''?
He said he patiently explains that scientists have found evidence not that humans came from apes but that apes and humans evolved from a common ancestor.
Surprisingly, he said, the students rarely get upset.
``I try to always present the information and let the kids make their own choice.
If they ask my opinion, I tell them,'' he said.
``As a science teacher and a Christian, I never belittle anyone or make them feel bad when we talk about evolution.
It's too important of a topic''.
Youngblood, however, said it's not that easy for many Christian teachers.
``The majority of our teachers are Christians,'' he said.
``They are following as best they can the guidelines they've been given not to teach religion.
For most of our teachers, that puts them from time to time in a bit of a conflict''.
_ ``It is the first week of classes at Central High School.
As the bell rings for third period, Karen, the newest teacher on the faculty, walks into the teachers' lounge.
She greets her colleagues, Barbara and Doug...
``By the way, Barbara, thanks for letting me see your syllabus for Bio I.
But I wanted to ask you about teaching evolution.
I didn't see it there''.
``You didn't see it on my syllabus because it's not a separate topic,'' Barbara said.
``I use evolution as a theme to tie the course together, so it comes into just about every unit.
You'll see a section called `History of Life' on the second page, and there's a section called `Natural Selection'.
But I don't treat evolution separately because it is related to almost every other topic in biology''.
``Wait a minute, Barbara,'' Doug says.
``Is that good advice for a new teacher?
I mean, evolution is a controversial subject, and a lot of us don't get around to teaching it.
I don't.
You do, but you're braver than most of us''.
``It's not a matter of bravery, Doug,'' Barbara replies.
``It's a matter of what needs to be taught if we want students to understand biology.
Teaching biology without evolution would be like teaching civics and never mentioning the United States Constitution ''''...
_ Excerpt from Teaching About Evolution and the Nature of Science.
National Academy of Sciences, 1998 _ (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on the World Wide Web: www.star-telegram.com) nn
It's not quite the Scopes trial, but a raucous Republican state school board primary election in Kansas this month sent a signal about the place of science in 21st century America, and about how quickly the relationship between science and religion is changing.
In the election, voters defeated those candidates who last year supported removing the mention of evolution from the state science curriculum.
The word is expected to be restored after the November school board elections, a significant setback for creationists.
Evolution won out in Kansas not because people in this conservative, deeply religious state have grown agnostic.
Rather, they believe that science, more than ever, is critical to their children's future and the future of their state.
These dot-com times demand scientific knowledge and technical expertise, parents believe, and to lack it is to be left behind.
``There is a realization that we can't have an informed generation if they don't know basic science,'' said Robert Russell, a physicist and minister who is executive director of the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences, which is affiliated with the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California.
``It's their right, it's their inheritance.
Instead of seeing science as an enemy, you see it as a tool''.
The idea that Kansas would fall behind academically and economically was one of the principal arguments used by evolution proponents in Kansas.
Scientists and school board candidates _ even the governor _ said Kansas would seem embarrassingly backward if the new science standards stayed in place.
Lt. Gov.
Gary Sherrer said that businesses considering relocating to Kansas had been ``scared off'' out of concern that their employees' children would not be getting a good education and that the work force would not be competitive.
Sue Gamble, who won the primary in a district that includes affluent Kansas City suburbs, said during the campaign that she worried the new science standards could ``put students at a disadvantage on a national level'' and that ``students from out of state won't want to come here and study because they feel the standards won't be up to snuff''.
Pro-evolution forces also made overtures of inclusiveness to those who wanted to embrace religion and scientific reasoning.
Steve Case, a biologist at the University of Kansas and a leader of the drive to restore evolution to the curriculum, said that he and others brought in speakers like Dr.
Kenneth R.
Miller, a Brown University microbiologist and author of ``Finding Darwin's God: A Scientist's Search for Common Ground between God and Evolution''.
In his talks, Miller quoted St.
Thomas Aquinas, ``who says it's wrong for the religious community to misdescribe how nature works because what it will do is drive people away from religion,'' Case said.
``That helped clarify for a person in the middle how they could hold a religious view and not have that conflict with science''.
Accommodation, national polls suggest, is smart politics.
A 1999 Gallup poll found that 68 percent of American adults favored teaching both creationism and evolution in public schools.
Another poll, released this year by the People for the American Way Foundation, found that while 83 percent supported teaching evolution in schools, almost half of the respondents said that evolution ``is far from being proven scientifically''.
And 68 percent said it was possible to believe in evolution and that God created humans and guided their development.
``Maybe voters in Kansas didn't see it as an either-or thing,'' said Dr.
James F.
Moore, a professor of theology at Valparaiso University, who also directs the science and religion workshop at the Zygon Center for Science and Religion in Chicago.
``I really do sense that there's a growing trend among common folk to search for how the two areas that are so important to our life can work compatibly together''.
Moore sees that desire in the way that major hospitals and research projects like the human genome project now have ethics panels with religious representatives.
And ``in religious communities there is an awareness of how important scientific developments have become,'' Moore said.
``If we don't know what's going on, and we don't know how to interpret what's going on, how can any religious voices really play a role?
We will be left behind and not know what we need to know''.
That is not to say that the battle between evolution and creationism is over.
But the language in which it is fought, especially on the religious right, has changed.
Proponents of ``intelligent design,'' for example, assert that the earth is too complex to have been created by random processes.
Only some sort of an intelligence could have done it, they say, and they seek to debunk evolution by, for instance, pointing to gaps in the fossil record.
Such arguments, which scientists find specious, have been well received in some quarters.
Alabama and Oklahoma, for example, have included disclaimers in biology textbooks that raise questions about the certainty of evolution.
Kentucky recently eliminated the word ``evolution'' from its curriculum, substituting the phrase ``change over time''.
&QL; &QL; &UR; BC-KANSAS-CREATIONISM-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR; &QL; &UR; UNDATED: over time''.
&LR; &QL; &QL; Several other states are debating similar moves.
In Arizona and Ohio, bills have been introduced that would require teachers to present evidence for and against evolution, and Case said he has been contacted by people in Minnesota looking to fend off such a challenge.
And dozens of local school boards across the country are considering teaching some form of creationism.
Phillip E.
Johnson, a law professor at the University of California who supports intelligent design, said the Kansas episode would only stiffen the spines of evolution opponents to show ``that the neo-Darwinian sensibility is intellectually vulnerable''.
Yet, as science continues its inexorable progress, some believe that religion must, ultimately, embrace it.
``I don't think the church has been good at this,'' said the Rev.
Christopher Carlisle, an Episcopal priest who co-directs the God and Science Project at Amherst College.
``I think it has been self-preservationist, and I think the result of that has been we have been losing people and we have less and less to preserve.
An awful lot of the future of the church depends upon the church's welcoming these questions and these conversations''.
Dick Teresi, a science writer and co-leader of the God and Science Project, says that the fanaticism of creationists has made scientists so defensive that they have lost the critical perspective that is the basis of scientific inquiry.
``Now, you have to believe in evolution as if it were a religion,'' Teresi said.
``You see evolution being taught in a very teleological way _ this organism is built this way because.
This would never happen in physics, where the whole thing is to poke holes in other people's theories.
I would teach evolution with all its flaws, and emphasize the randomness.
We have to live with the idea that humans are random creatures.''
TOPEKA, Kan.
_ Struggling to avoid a deadlock, the 10 Kansas Board of Education members on Wednesday left hanging the question of whether to accept science standards designating evolution as the foundation of biology.
The standards, written by a state committee of science teachers and university professors, would determine what Kansas schoolchildren learn and are tested on.
They list evolution as one of five unifying concepts linking all science disciplines.
A competing set of standards presented by conservative board member Steve Abrams on Wednesday would remove the emphasis on evolution and insert ``the idea that the design and complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent designer''.
Those standards were written by ``various citizens,'' including members of a local creation-science group.
For two hours the board questioned the state committee and Abrams.
Some board members questioned why the committee based its work on standards written by a national science group.
Others asked Abrams, of Arkansas City, why he did not include the names of the people who wrote his proposal; the only names on the document were those of the science committee members.
As the discussion ended, board Chairwoman Linda Holloway of Shawnee said she was unwilling to put the matter to a vote when it was clear that board opinions were split.
``The decision rests with this board, and this is where the wrestling will have to come,'' Holloway said.
``The responsibility ultimately rests with these 10 members''.
According to the board's schedule, the board is to vote on the standards in June.
But Holloway said she was sure the board would not be ready to vote that soon.
The debate stems from a 1997 vote by the board for new standards in all subject areas.
The science standards committee, appointed in part by board members, has met 12 times since last June, co-chairman Loren Lutes of Elkhart told the board.
Lutes, superintendent of the Elkhart School District, told the board that the committee used guidelines from the National Academy of Sciences to frame the Kansas standards.
Lutes said those guidelines ``represent, in our opinion, a consensus of what is right for science education''.
Before arriving at the state board for discussion, the proposed Kansas standards had been through eight public hearings and were reviewed by the Council for Basic Education, based in Washington.
The fourth draft reflected the group's criticisms and public comments, Lutes said.
Lutes said his committee had reviewed the Abrams version and found a fundamental difference in how the two documents defined science.
Board member Scott Hill of Abilene, a conservative, said the differences were unclear.
Committee member Brad Williamson said the difference lay in how the two sets of standards treated scientific theory.
The committee's version says a theory such as evolution paints a big picture of how the natural world works.
Abrams' proposal casts theory as conjecture, placing applied science above understanding how things work, said Williamson, an Olathe East High School science teacher.
``Science tries to figure out what's out there,'' Williamson said.
``That's the point I'd like to share with my kids, and that's taken away from me in (Abrams') document''.
Abrams, a veterinarian, said later in the discussion that he pushed for alternate standards because the committee's work did not reflect his view of good science.
He said he did not find in the document his understanding that all scientific theories must be observable, measurable, testable and falsifiable.
To him, evolution is none of these things.
Abrams denied the accusations of several speakers who on Tuesday called his proposal an attempt to push religion into the schools.
He said the proposal's intent in mentioning intelligent design was to acknowledge that more than one theory existed on life's origins.
Some members suggested that Abrams and the science committee work out a compromise.
Lutes, the committee co-chairman, said he was unwilling to integrate the Abrams proposal into the committee's standards.
If the board asks him to, he will resign, and so will many committee members, Lutes said.
The committee meets Monday in Salina to discuss its next step, Lutes said after the board meeting.
``As long as the board continues to let us do our work, we're going to do it,'' Lutes said.
``When the board takes over our job, we're going to give it to them''.
The board members said repeatedly they wanted consensus on the standards.
In the last two years the board has deadlocked along conservative-moderate lines over state tests, math standards and some federal programs.
The 5-5 split continued after November's elections, but the board agreed in January to find common ground.
In March, for example, members unanimously approved new math standards almost a year after they appeared before the previous board.
As the discussion Wednesday ended, Holloway spoke.
She said one aspect of the Abrams proposal that touched her was a statement that ``the cause of science or education (cannot) be served well by censoring, ridiculing or in any other way discouraging students from proposing and defending alternate theories''.
In the board's open forum Tuesday, some speakers accused Holloway, a Christian conservative, of attempting to impose her religious beliefs on public education.
``My faith was personally attacked yesterday,'' Holloway said, her voice breaking.
``I don't want that for any child in the state of Kansas.
``We see what ridicule can lead to in Littleton.
I don't want any child or staff member to be ridiculed because they have a faith that might be different from a prevailing theory.''
SHAWNEE, Kan.
_ When it comes to teaching evolution, Al Frisby won't compromise.
Frisby, a biology teacher at Shawnee Mission Northwest High School, starts each school year by explaining to parents what their children will learn: the habits, physical characteristics and life processes of plants and animals, and evolution, to explain how those processes developed.
``Without evolution, the building will fall down,'' Frisby said.
``It's the cornerstone of biology''.
Frisby is adamant that the Christian belief in a universe created by God has no place in his science classroom.
But one of Frisby's brightest students, 14-year-old Heather Ellsworth, sees evolutionary theory as so much hogwash.
She believes God alone created the earth and everything on it, just as the Bible says.
Some teachers take a low-key approach to teaching evolution, the scientific theory that living things share common ancestors but change over time.
Others, such as Frisby, emphasize it.
At the forefront of this discussion are Kansas' new science curriculum standards.
The version written by a state committee would declare evolution one of five concepts that unite all scientific disciplines.
A competing proposal presented by a conservative state school board member would remove the emphasis on evolutionary theory and question its validity.
The 10-member Kansas Board of Education, split evenly down conservative-moderate lines, is struggling to find consensus between the two ideas.
The courts and many in the science community, including Frisby, say those ideas are mutually exclusive inside science classrooms.
On Heather's first day in freshman biology, Frisby told his class that evolution holds the underpinnings for the life sciences.
After class, Heather approached him.
``I said, `Mr.
Frisby, I don't agree with evolution,' '' Heather remembered.
``He said, `Let's agree to disagree'.
'' And they've been disagreeing agreeably all year long.
Frisby hasn't changed his lessons to accommodate Heather's beliefs, although last fall he did attend a creation science workshop at the invitation of Heather's father.
Heather hasn't changed her mind, either, but she answers test questions on evolution by the book.
``We can live with that,'' said the Rev.
Phil Ellsworth, Heather's father and pastor of the evangelical Grace Christian Fellowship Church in Shawnee.
Could this truce be the kind of middle ground that Kansas Board of Education members are looking for?
Larry Scharmann thinks it might be.
As an education professor at Kansas State University, Scharmann tells future teachers they should not present theories such as evolution in ways that polarize their students.
Teachers needs to realize that students, like everyone else, value the beliefs they've learned from their families and churches.
``You're not trying to beat that out of them,'' Scharmann said.
Understanding doesn't mandate belief, Scharmann said.
Science teachers taking a realistic view of their students know this, he said.
``(Students) don't have to believe these theories, just know how to use them,'' Scharmann said.
``Evolution, like all good scientific theories, is an excellent problem-solving tool''.
The science standards that have revived the debate determine what Kansas students will learn and be tested on.
The standards, written by a state committee appointed in part by the state board, are based on guidelines from national science associations.
Evolution takes a leading role, and that's what led to the alternate proposal put forth by conservative board member Steve Abrams of Arkansas City.
Abrams' version would change the definition of science, eliminate all but one reference to evolution and add to the glossary a definition of creation as ``the idea that the design and complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent designer''.
Abrams has said the intent of his proposal is partly to allow school districts the freedom to decide how to handle teaching evolution.
That's similar to the way the Missouri curriculum standards work, said Orlo Shroyer, Missouri's assistant commissioner of education.
The controversy over evolution is nothing new for members of the Shawnee Mission Northwest science department.
Several years ago, the school's science test scores dipped because teachers were avoiding evolutionary theory, said Robert Siemens, the department chairman.
So the department beefed up its approach to evolution, Siemens said.
Last year, a few students and parents objected to a mural in the science hall depicting the evolution of humans from an apelike creature to modern man.
The mural remains, but the teachers wonder for how long.
And this year, the science standards are causing much discussion, at least among the science faculty.
The teachers know that some students don't believe evolution occurred.
Although most of Siemens' students realize the theory has a place in science classrooms, there always are a few who ask to be excused from learning about evolution, saying it goes against their religious belief in creation.
``A lot of them have been taught that they have to believe one or the other,'' Siemens said.
``And that's so sad''.
Siemens and Frisby always end their units on evolution by assigning students a paper on the origin of life.
The assignment gives students the chance to defend their beliefs, and some always choose to write on creation.
Frisby said that this year he has more students _ about 40 percent _ who don't accept evolution.
One parent has offered nm &LR; bate Frisby on the subject.
Heather Ellsworth said she understands that Frisby has to teac(AIY &QC; 1ution as the theory accepted by the majority of scientists.
Her father, Phil Ellsworth, said he's confident his daughter won't be swayed from her basic religious belief that God created the world.
Both Ellsworths believe there's room in the science classroom for more than one theory on the origin of life.
But Frisby adamantly disagrees.
``I feel like I'm putting my face up against a brick wall,'' Frisby said.
``If there's no evolution, I can't teach.
I can't compromise.''
PRATT, Kan.
_ Despite controversy and confusion swirling around her like dust devils in the wheat fields, Lu Bitter, a science teacher at Pratt High School, is clear about one thing: She will continue teaching the theory of evolution, as she has for 27 years, until she is ordered to stop.
And if she was a betting woman, she would wager that across the state, science and biology teachers will do the same, despite the recent decision by the Kansas State Board of Education to remove any mention of evolution from the state's new science curriculum.
Anything beyond that is, well, evolving.
Two weeks after the state board threw science education in this state into turmoil and reignited a perennial debate about whether evolutionary theory or creationism has a place in American classrooms, teachers and administrators in 304 school districts across Kansas still are trying to determine what effect the decision will have on them.
Rather than banning outright the teaching of evolution and anything related to it, such as the origin of the universe, the board, in what was described as a compromise, opted to leave it it up to local school districts to decide if those subjects would be included in their curricula.
It also ruled that no questions on evolution will be included in standardized tests.
In some school districts, this is a problem to face down the road when they get around to revising their science curricula.
But in some, such as Pratt, which was in the process of doing so when the state board acted, it has become a volatile, potentially divisive issue.
``I honestly can't tell you what is going to happen here, mostly because we haven't seen anything from the state yet,'' said Bitter.
``When we get the standards from the state, we might have some other theories mentioned more, but I don't think we are going to have to teach creationism''.
Maybe not.
But the teachers in Pratt may have to teach something closely akin to it.
Ten days before the state board's controversial vote, a small group of parents in Pratt appeared before the local school board and requested that a book titled ``Of Pandas and People: The Central Question of Biological Origins'' be included in the list of science textbooks to be considered for the proposed new curriculum.
On one level, it was a legitimate request by parents seeking input into what books should be used in the classrooms of their schools.
But coming, as it did, so close to the state board's decision, the request raised questions about whether Pratt, a town of about 7,000, will become one of the newest battlegrounds in a war that began nearly three-quarters of a century ago when a teacher in Tennessee by the name of John Scopes was convicted of the crime of teaching evolution.
That conviction was overturned and eventually led to a ruling by the U.S.
Supreme Court that teaching creationism violated the constitutional separation of church and state.
``Of Pandas and People'' does not posit God as the creator.
It is ostensibly a textbook that promotes the theory of ``intelligent design,'' or the idea that life is so complex and miraculous that it could not have come about without the guidance of a master architect, or some intelligent force.
But it also is widely believed to be the textbook of the creationists who have tried, unsuccessfully, to introduce it to schoolbook lists in Idaho, Alabama and Texas and who have sold it to local school districts in several states.
The book is considered by the National Association of Biology Teachers, among others, to be little more than creation theory minus the ``creator''.
Chris Mammoliti, a biologist with the state Department of Wildlife and Parks who presented ``Of Pandas and People'' to the Pratt school board early this month, insisted that there is no hidden agenda in his attempts to get the book on the textbook lists.
He also insisted that the timing of his presentation was coincidental to the action by the state board.
``We recommended `Of Pandas and People' be used as a supplemental textbook because it provides another interpretation of the same scientific evidence,'' Mammoliti said.
``We made it clear that we did not want evolution taken out of the curriculum and that we thought it important that evolution continue to be taught.
We just think it should be taught in a less dogmatic way''.
There are seven people on the Pratt school district board.
Two, including board President Willa Beth Mills, who reportedly hopes to see elements of creationism included in the district's science curriculum, supported including ``Of Pandas and People''.
The other five have not revealed their thinking.
Which, inevitably, in a small town like Pratt, has led to much speculation.
``We simply don't know what they (the board) are going to do,'' said Bitter, whose husband was a former president of the board.
Andy Koenigs, the assistant superintendent for Pratt schools, sought to downplay any suggestion that the creationism vs.
evolution issue was causing divisions within the community.
However he acknowledged that the state board's actions two weeks ago had compromised the district's efforts to write a new science curriculum.
``Our curriculum is on pause until we get the standards from the state,'' Koenigs said.
``I know that one side of this issue (those opposed to the teaching of evolution) is claiming a big victory, but my prediction is that many of the school districts will continue to teach evolution''.
Koenigs also downplayed the importance of the theoretical creationism/evolution debate to the practicalities of teaching, pointing out that in Pratt evolution takes up no more than three days out of the school year.
``It's much ado about nothing,'' he said.
Before retiring, Janell Mead spent 20 years teaching evolution at Pratt High School without community objection.
In fact, she said, the only real controversy to hit the campus before the last few weeks was when ``secular humanism'' was debated.
And even that was dropped before it became a divisive issue.
Mead, who studied genetics and evolution in college, said she was concerned that those in the community, like herself, who argued against creationism would be branded as un-Christian.
``We are not anti-Christian,'' she said.
``I teach Sunday school.
I know I'm not an atheist.
In fact I don't think I know any atheists.
I would like to think that they (the creationists in the community) are a vocal minority, but I don't know''.
Many school districts across Kansas have gone on the record that despite the action by the state board, they will continue to include the teaching of evolution and related subjects in their curricula.
But Mead and Bitter, both veteran teachers with standing in their community, and other pro-evolutionists expressed concern about the effect of the board's action in smaller, more fundamentally religious communities.
``Eighty percent of the biology teachers in this state are in small towns,'' said Steve Case, the coordinator for the Kansas Collaborative Research Network, an Internet research resource, and one of the members of the team that wrote the original state science standards.
``Are we going to expect a teacher in a particularly religious, pro-creationist community to stand up and say that evolution is science and should be taught?
I think a lot of teachers are going to take the path of least resistance and bow to the local pressure''.
&QL; XXXX END OF STORY &QL;
Don Johanson, director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University, doesn't believe in evolution.
He doesn't (beginitalic)believe(enditalic) in gravity either.
If that sounds heretical for a man of science, Johanson says that evolution is ``not a matter of belief.
It's a matter of fact''.
Evolution, which explains how plant and animal species arise and why we have diversity among species, is the keystone of modern biology.
It is one of the most widely accepted notions in science, ranking alongside gravity, the heliocentric view of the solar system (planets revolve around the sun) and the roundness of Earth.
Yet some doubters, mostly in America, reject the principles proposed by British naturalist Charles Darwin and detailed in his 1859 treatise (beginitalic)On the Origin of Species.
(enditalic) Darwin said that life on Earth began with simple organisms and evolved into more sophisticated species over many thousands of years through a process called natural selection.
Species adapt to their environment and pass on genetic characteristics to their offspring.
To proponents of creationism, the universe was created by God through a process set forth in the first book of the Bible, Genesis.
God created all species simultaneously, the world was completed in six days and humans descended from Adam and Eve - not earlier primates.
This month marks the 75th anniversary of the most celebrated debate between those theories - the Scopes ``monkey'' trial, in which a young Tennessee science teacher was prosecuted for violating the state's prohibition against teaching evolution.
He was convicted but fined only $100, and the law was eventually repealed.
The controversy did not end there.
Scientists before Darwin had speculated about the diversity of life.
But it wasn't until such publications as (beginitalic)Origin of Species (enditalic)defined the concept of natural selection that the process was made clear.
Darwin's book sold out in one day.
Almost immediately, scientists and then the public applauded his principles as sound though incomplete.
Over the past century and a half, those principles have been even more solidly established, says Jane Maienschein, professor of biology and philosophy at ASU.
``It's becoming more strongly confirmed as basic to science,'' she says.
In some ways, it is even better understood than gravity.
``Evolution explains everything about life,'' says ASU genetics professor Elliott Goldstein.
By the turn of the century, evolution was generally accepted and had found its way into America's classrooms.
Then religious leaders began a crusade.
Accepted for the most part overseas, evolution has had a roller coaster ride in the United States.
Last year the Kansas Board of Education voted to delete virtually any mention of evolution from the state's science curriculum.
In Arizona schools, teaching evolution is allowed, but some teachers who fear protests decline.
Legislators from time to time try to ban evolution or include creationism.
Why the battle?
``We've done a poor job of explaining it,'' says Goldstein.
``That's it in a nutshell''.
Maienschein agrees.
Anti-evolutionists insist the term ``theory of evolution'' suggests scientists are uncertain of the facts.
But the word ``theory'' does not mean ``guess,'' she says.
Scientists define theory as a series of provable facts, an organizing framework that has predictions and is testable.
Darwin was not the first scientist to shake the faithful.
In the 16th century, Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus put forth the startling notion that the Earth revolved around the sun, instead of the reverse.
Alarmed citizens of the Earth feared that God would not be able to find them if their planet were constantly moving.
To remove Earth from the center of the solar system was disturbing enough, but then Darwin removed humans from the center of the animal kingdom.
The Bible taught that man was given dominion over the creatures of the Earth.
Darwin's ideas instead put man on a par with every creature from gnats to whales.
Darwin, who followed the tenets of the Church of England as well as Unitarianism, was a reluctant prophet.
Knowing his findings would be unsettling, he published his research only at the urging of his wife.
At the same time, Austrian monk Gregor Mendel was developing rudimentary theories of genetics, though they would largely be ignored until scientists rediscovered his work around 1900.
The field of genetics took root in the 1930s, building on Darwin's studies and reinforcing evidence seen but not yet explained.
While some people find belief in a divine creator easier than understanding genes and chromosomes, Goldstein sees science and faith as compatible.
He equates God's work with the forces of nature and sees the Bible not as a scientific textbook but as a metaphor.
``I believe the Bible is God-inspired,'' Goldstein says.
``To believe in God doesn't mean you have to believe in creationism''.
To endorse creationism, he says, is to deny nearly all scientific fields, including geology, astronomy, biology, physics and chemistry.
And to deny the elegant workings of evolution is to miss the beauty of such a grand mechanism.
``I feel sorry for them,'' he says of creationists.
``They're missing God's wonders because they're misinterpreting God's words''.
Save the pity, says Dale Langmade, president of the Arizona Origin Science Association.
``He doesn't need to feel sorry for me, because I can see the same beauty in intelligent design''.
Fundamental Christians like Langmade take the Bible literally in its explanation of the creation of the universe, he says, though some agree the Earth is older than 6,000 years.
Some support the notion of natural selection as one of God's tools.
Langmade, who attended ASU and the University of Alaska, takes exception to the idea that creationists cannot embrace the panorama of science if they reject evolution.
``That's a cheap shot,'' he says, noting that such legendary scientists as Copernicus, Galileo, Isaac Newton and Francis Crick were men of faith.
Langmade has spent time admiring the strata in the walls of the Grand Canyon, which he calls evidence of the Biblical account of the Great Flood.
God put humans in charge of the animal kingdom, he says, because they were created in God's image: ``Man is the image of God, not flies''.
But what most disturbs anti-evolutionists is that the theory appears to remove God from life's equation.
Larry Kisner, a retired physicist in the aerospace industry and editor of the Arizona Origin Science Association newsletter, believes a secular explanation of the origin of the universe negates moral absolutes.
He points out that evolution has been used to justify eugenics and racism.
``Evolution is also a religion,'' Kisner says.
``It's paganism''.
And there's a reason that America more than Europe champions the crusade against what has been dubbed ``evil-ution''.
``America has been the moral agent of the world for many generations,'' Kisner says.
``We were founded that way.
{hellip} That's why the battle is fiercer here''.
Scientists are waging their own battle, fearing America suffers if evolution is not taught in schools.
The public must be informed on such issues as genetic research, the overuse of antibiotics, the human genome project - all of which are built upon evolutionary principles, Maienschein says.
Yet a poll commissioned by the liberal civil rights group People for the American Way found that while 83percent of Americans favor teaching evolution in public schools, 79percent think creationism also has a place in the classroom.
Such reports are ``good news and bad news,'' says science writer Jonathan Weiner, whose book, (beginitalic)The Beak of the Finch: A Story of Evolution in Our Time(enditalic), won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction.
Weiner takes heart that a majority of respondents support the teaching of evolution, and he does believe students should learn that some religious beliefs dispute those teachings.
But, he says, ``Every educated person should know and understand the theory of evolution.
It's such a beautiful theory''.
Weiner understands why this is a sometimes frightening period in scientific history.
Cloning, gene therapy, genetic engineering - where does it stop?
Will scientists some day construct human beings not just with a choice of hair and eye color but with specific behavioral and personality traits as well?
Evolution is sometimes taken as a symbol of science run amok.
In times of uncertainty, Weiner says, people embrace the familiar and reject notions that appear too revolutionary.
Creationists want to halt the revolution.
``What's at stake here is the future of our children, our society and our world if our children are taught that there is no God or that they must compartmentalize their faith from school,'' Kisner says.
Maienschein argues that evolution will be the savior of a fragile world.
``We can screw up the environment and then save it,'' she says.
``That's a source of hope''.
Tim Koors/The Arizona RepublicIs a 3 million-year-old male skull on display at the Institute of Human Origins in Tempe an ancestor of modern man?
It was both tragedy and triumph that when ``On the Origin of Species'' was published in 1859, Charles Darwin's name became a synonym for evolution.
Though Darwin studiously avoided mentioning humans in his book, religious leaders immediately saw ``Darwinism'' as a dangerous anti-religion, a godless belief system that removed the Creator from creation and made his greatest idea, man, the grandchild of mere apes.
Over time, Darwin's ideas have prevailed.
Most mainstream religions have come to an accommodation with them, though a vocal minority still rejects evolution and propounds biblically-derived creationist theories.
The triumph of Darwin was the brilliant way the former ministry student distilled and explained the mechanism of life.
His thesis of descent with modification via natural selection immediately clicked with people who took the time to consider it.
So obvious was it to zoologist Thomas Henry Huxley that he exclaimed, ``How extremely stupid not to have thought of that''.
But Darwin did not just cause readers to smack their heads and utter, ``Duh''.
He fundamentally changed the way all of us _ including every rejectionist, whether he admits it or not _ see the world.
In ``Darwin's Ghost,'' a fascinating and witty book that tours the same intellectual territory as Darwin, Steve Jones, a British geneticist, shows how extensively Darwin's theory explains the natural world.
At heart, his is an argument with both the remaining skeptics of evolution and those who persist in misapplying Darwin's theory in realms such as sociology.
Natural selection, Jones neatly observes, is a dumb but relentless machine that works with the materials at hand.
Most of its products do not last.
``Who could ever have designed a tree kangaroo''?
But ``clumsy as the animal may seem, it is infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life, and plainly bears the stamp of far higher workmanship, than anything achieved by man''.
Which is why engineers of recent years have been studying natural forms to tease out design ideas.
The more sophisticated school of creationism, of course, may see in the word ``workmanship'' a hint of ``intelligent design'' and thus of a deus in the machina of natural selection.
Empty logic, says Jones.
Natural selection is the ``plodding accumulation of error''.
Given enough time to work through enough mistakes, anything _ velociraptor, tree kangaroo, homo sapien _ will turn up.
So why get caught up in a material-world argument, asks Jones.
``The birth of Adam, whether real or metaphorical, marked the insertion into an animal body of a post-biological soul that leaves no fossils and needs no genes''.
The flesh, he wisely notes, is not a good place to go hunting for the things of spirit.
A big part of Jones's book is devoted to human, as opposed to natural, selection _ the breeding programs and hybridization campaigns that humans have conducted with cattle, dogs, wheat, and a thousand more species for the past 13,000 years.
Domesticated life forms, he says, are ``silent witnesses to the malleability of nature''.
That very malleability, combined with human technological prowess, is why we have arrived at a portentious moment.
Though he doesn't spend much time on the subject, it is clear that Jones believes human cloning and increasingly bizarre forms of hybridization are, if not now underway somewhere, certainly imminent and probably dangerous.
Jones does not wave the chicken-little banner of ``Frankenfood'' in this book, but here is a geneticist clearly alarmed at the dangers of genetic manipulation.
Already, he points out, beneficial genes inserted into oilseed rape to promote herbicide resistance have seeped into wild mustards and radishes.
``Industry's optimism about the nature and stability of species is unfounded,'' he says.
``Those who cast down the barriers to hybridism will soon be reminded of what evolution can do''.
``Darwin's Ghost'' is written with great authority and a fluid style, and it is refreshing not to have footnotes littering the text.
But Jones fails to include substantial back-of-the-book chapter notes to anchor disembodied quotes and expand upon interesting facts.
It is true that light or nonexistent footnotes are more the British than the American style, but combined with breezy writing the effect on a reader is an unnecessary wobbliness about facts.
Then there's the conceit of this book _ the ``Darwin's ghost'' theme.
It is a little misleading.
Happily, Jones does not walk in Darwin's footsteps or retrace the voyage of the Beagle.
That would get old fast.
He properly honors Darwin throughout the book, but his republication of Darwin's chapter summaries and recapitulation seem contrived.
``Origin'' is readily available (even on the Net).
Unannotated chunks of it do little good in this book.
Where Jones is especially good is in a quick putdown of some of the wilder claims of sociobiology.
``Evolution is a political sofa that molds itself into the buttocks of the last to sit upon it,'' he notes.
Marxists and ultra-capitalists have both seized on it at times.
So, too, have agenda-driven scientists and journalists.
In a whack at the all-in-our-genes school, he says, ``Sexual fidelity or promiscuity seems, according to taste, the natural thing to do; families are often a joy, and patriotism arouses some, but we do not need natural selection to tell us why''.
If Darwin had a ghost _ a free-floating post-biological soul _ it would enjoy that defense of his theory against the latest crop of misusers.
BOSTON _ What a contradictory country this is.
More than any other, it has always been open to new ideas, to change.
Looking to the future instead of the past, it has made itself a great force, not just in world markets but in the world of ideas.
Yet there is also an America locked in rigid certainties and shibboleths.
That other part of our divided national character, the second America, is displayed in the effort to put the Bible ahead of science in schools.
The advocates speak of ``creation science,'' replacing the Darwinian theory that life forms evolved over millions of years with the biblical account that God created the earth and its creatures in six days.
Most of us thought the attempt to stifle the teaching of evolution was a fringe phenomenon.
Hadn't it been effectively disabled by the Scopes trial three-quarters of a century ago?
Then, in August, the Kansas Board of Education voted to downgrade the teaching of evolution in public schools.
A new curriculum it approved removed evolution from the state tests that students have to take.
The Kansas board also took aim at the science of the cosmos, voting to delete from its standards the Big Bang theory of how the universe originated around 15 billion years ago.
James Glanz of The New York Times, in an article this week, called attention to the even more sweeping effects of that aspect of the board's action.
Creationists argue that the earth is only a few thousand years old.
That view calls into question many fundamentals of science today, such as radiocarbon dating _ which shows that rocks on our planet are millions of years old.
Indeed, the whole scientific understanding of the universe would have to be discarded.
The creationist position is certainly not a fringe belief nowadays.
A Gallup poll taken in June for CNN and USA Today found that 68 percent of those surveyed favored teaching creationism along with evolution in public schools; 40 percent favored dropping evolution altogether and teaching children only the biblical version of creation.
High-ranking American politicians have taken to condemning the idea of evolution.
After the massacre in Columbine High School in Colorado in April, Rep.
Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, put the blame on the teaching of children ``that they are nothing but glorified apes who are evolutionized out of some primordial soup of mud''.
The argument made against teaching evolution, in Kansas and elsewhere, is that no one was there to see how life began _ and students should be given only firsthand evidence.
In Alabama, consistent with that view, all students are warned: ``No one was present when life first appeared on earth.
Therefore, any statement about life's origins should be considered as theory, not fact''.
Of course evolution is a theory.
The whole ethos of science is that any explanation for the myriad mysteries in our universe is a theory, subject to challenge and experiment.
That is the scientific method.
Those who take the biblical account of creation literally reject the scientific method, offering instead a doctrine of faith.
There are ``creation scientists'' who argue that the Bible can be squared with scientific observations of, for example, the age of the universe.
But they are not taken seriously by most scientists.
The interesting question is why a large body of opinion in the United States supports a view at such odds with contemporary scientific understanding.
No other Western country has anything like it.
Religious fundamentalists have played an important part in America from the earliest settlements.
And religious belief is much stronger in the United States today than in other Western societies.
But belief does not usually, elsewhere, lead to opposing the teaching of evolution.
Perhaps rejection of the scientific method reflects a turning away from unhappy aspects of our contemporary society _ greed, vulgarity and the like.
Some Americans think we are, as the title of Robert Bork's book puts it, ``Slouching Towards Gomorrah''.
Concern about aspects of American life is fair enough.
But depriving children of the great ideas of science cannot make things better.
We thought we had advanced since Galileo was silenced for advancing the theory that the earth revolves around the sun. &QL;
By KATE BEEM Knight Ridder Newspapers KANSAS CITY, Mo.
_ Someone created every thing in the universe, Celtie Johnson believes.
Someone made the pen she writes with.
Someone made the keyboard she types on.
All complex systems are designed by someone, so it follows that life, the most complex system of all, has a designer, too, said Johnson, of Prairie Village, Kan.
``No one's saying who that intelligent designer is,'' she said.
To Johnson, evolution simply makes no sense.
She rejects the evidence most scientists say supports the theory that all living things share common ancestors.
She firmly believes in the biblical account of creation.
Early this year she mounted a campaign to turn the Kansas science community on its ear.
Judging from the agitation in the state over evolution, there is evidence she has succeeded: - In the beginning, the Kansas Board of Education and the state education commissioner appointed a 27-member committee of science teachers and professors to write new science standards for public schools.
The committee's version described the theory of evolution as a ``unifying concept'' for all science disciplines.
It drew objections from those who do not believe in evolution.
Late last winter, Johnson pulled together a loosely knit group of creationists from Kansas and Missouri who drafted an alternate version of the standards.
The alternate draft, presented to the state board, defined both evolution and creation in its glossary.
It also defined the battle that would occupy the state board for months.
- Johnson visited the Kansas board again and again, urging members to reject the committee's science standards in favor of her group's standards.
- She also formed the National Committee for Excellence in Science Education, which helps people in other states who want to question evolution.
The group intends to offer the alternate science standards written by Johnson and others to people in other states.
Steve Abrams, a conservative Kansas Board of Education member from Arkansas City, Kan.
, presented the alternate standards Johnson helped write.
``She was very dedicated and wants to see good science in Kansas,'' said Abrams, a veterinarian.
Val DeFever, a moderate board member from Independence, Kan.
, said Johnson was determined to sway board members to her point of view.
``I just explained to her we weren't on the same wavelength,'' said DeFever, who supported the standards written by the science teachers.
``We were both committed to our viewpoints, and it really would be a waste of time''.
Johnson says she wanted scientists to explain why, as she sees it, evolution is immune from question and why other explanations for the origins of life cannot be considered in science classes.
``I admire her dedication,'' said Ken Ham, executive director of the creationist organization Answers in Genesis, based in Kentucky.
``I admire her trying to do these things''.
Johnson's critics say that, under the guise of science, she is trying to inject into the public schools her religious belief that God created the universe.
John van Keppel of Leawood, Kan.
, an evolution supporter, says Johnson does not understand science well enough to dispute the facts of evolution.
The evidence against evolution that Johnson and other creationists say is being censored by mainstream science is a cut-and-paste job, said Charlotte McDonald, the Blue Valley School District's science coordinator.
``She is not presenting the whole scientific information,'' McDonald said.
``If you're going to take things out of context, you can refute anything you want to refute''.
Fliers at malls Johnson, a 43-year-old mother of four, shares her beliefs with most people she meets.
She begins many conversations with creation naysayers by asking, ``What do you know about evolution to be true''?
In 1995 she and her brother asked the Shawnee Mission School District to use Of Pandas and People, a science textbook that puts forth intelligent design _ the idea that an intelligent being created Earth and everything in it.
District officials said they considered the text but rejected it.
Johnson and her husband began visiting shopping malls on weekends to place homemade creationist fliers on cars.
The fliers contained passages such as this: ``The theory of evolution is just a theory, yet our public school's texts do not mention the significant amount of scientific evidence against it.
Why the censorship''?
For Johnson and her husband, Eric, 37, the truth about how the universe came to be is readily available and has been for centuries.
``You have to believe the Bible is true,'' said Eric Johnson, a stockbroker.
``If it's not true, it's just a paperweight''.
Celtie Johnson said she was not completely against evolution being taught.
She said she just wanted teachers to feel comfortable presenting the pros and cons of Charles Darwin's theory.
Many feel pressured to teach evolution as a fact, she said.
She has been told, subtly and not, to sit down and shut up.
She has not.
``I feel confident that most humans have common sense, that they can critically think,'' Johnson said.
``I don't want them to be plagued with believing evolution, because it's not true''.
&LR; brk:Macro vs.
micro Some on the 10-member Kansas Board of Education agreed with Johnson, and in August the board approved science standards that contained references to microevolution, or adaptation, but no mention of macroevolution, or change from one species to another.
The revised version no longer lists evolution as one of science's unifying concepts.
The revised standards also omit many references to the age of Earth.
There is no longer any mention of the big-bang theory _ the idea that the universe was born in an explosion of matter and radiation between 12 billion and 20 billion years ago.
Those deletions are significant to ``young Earth creationists'' such as Johnson who believe that the Earth was created in six 24-hour days sometime in the last 7,000 years.
Creationists say they have evidence that supports this belief: - It takes about 300 to 1,000 years to form an inch of topsoil, but the worldwide average depth is about 7 to 8 inches, which means the Earth is only a few thousand years old, creationists say.
Evolutionists respond that that argument does not take erosion into account.
- The eruption of Mount St.
Helens in 1980 produced 25 feet of finely layered sediment and gouged canyons in one afternoon, which shows that millions of years are not required to form rock layers.
This lends credence to the global flood and other catastrophic events in the Bible, creationists say.
Evolutionists say erosion happens at variable rates all over the world.
Catastrophes explain some geologic formations but not all.
- Earth's magnetic field has been decaying rapidly, which creationists say points to an age younger than 10,000 years.
Evolutionists counter that the decay is not steady and that much evidence exists for several reversals of the decay rate.
Most creationists say that scientific theories must be observable.
Although it is true that monkey blood and human blood are similar, that is not evidence the two species are related, said Glen Kailer of Perry, Kan.
, a researcher with the Creation Science Association for Mid-America.
Creationists view that similarity as more proof of design, Kailer said.
``A Chevy and a Ford are not descended from a common ancestor,'' Kailer said.
Neither evolution nor creation can be tested or has been observed, but creationists say their theory has a witness: the Bible.
Evolutionists, on the other hand, believe that some science works in the comparative mode, said Ed Wiley, a University of Kansas evolutionary biologist.
Something that is true for one life form will be true for another.
One particular point of contention is transitional life forms.
Creationists say that scientists have not found any fossils of transitional animals and that no transitional animals exist today.
They do not believe that animals such as the archaeopteryx, a bird with reptile characteristics that some scientists think links birds and dinosaurs, are transitional.
Indeed, the archaeopteryx is not a true intermediate form between birds and reptiles, Wiley said.
But it had transitional characteristics between the two species, such as wings and reptilian attributes, he said.
Wiley said creationists would not ever accept the archaeopteryx as a transitional animal, because it was too dangerous to their faith in a God so powerful he could create everything just as it is today.
More specifically, believing that Earth is older than described in the first chapter of Genesis threatens some creationists' understanding of the basis of their faith, said Keith Miller, an evangelical Christian and a geologist at Kansas State University.
Most Christians, Miller said, find no conflict with believing that God could have used evolution to create the universe.
Biblical literalists cannot accept that, he said.
If the days in Genesis actually were millions or billions of years, dinosaurs would have lived and died long before humans.
That would mean death and dying came long before Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden of Eden in what Christians know as the Fall of Man, Miller said.
That is in direct conflict with a literal reading of the Bible.
``They view their interpretation of Scripture as being primary,'' Miller said.
``They don't accept the validity of nonbiblical sources of truth.
Everything comes through a scriptural lens''.
For Miller and Wiley, evolution is a fact of nature with many theories of how it works.
But for people such as Johnson and Ham, evolution is a philosophical belief system just like creation.
Ham said both groups agreed on observable facts such as natural selection and mutation.
Those things are ``what we observe in the present,'' Ham said.
``In trying to connect to the past, you have to use faith''.
&LR; brk:`Days in shock' Celtie and Eric Johnson think many scientists overlook evolution's missing details, such as transitional fossils, and teach the scientific theory as proven fact to unsuspecting science students.
Celtie Johnson said she spent decades believing that humans evolved from lower forms and that species could change into other species over millions of years.
A former premedicine major, she faults a belief in evolution for leading her to make bad decisions as she struggled through more than one divorce and a life she saw as purposeless and random.
``It's dog eat dog,'' Johnson said.
``That's what I was living.
It was survival of the fittest''.
Then one day about five years ago she was talking to her brother, a mechanical engineer, and he brought up intelligent design.
Johnson said she did not have a clue as to what he was talking about.
She knew only about evolution.
But her brother told her there was overwhelming evidence against evolution.
Something clicked.
Johnson began to research creation.
Soon Eric Johnson joined in.
They began to feel more and more duped by their science classes, Celtie Johnson said.
``We spent days in shock,'' she said.
When the shock wore off, Johnson said, she decided she had to spread the word.
She joined the Creation Science Association, seeking more information.
It was Johnson's insistence that the Kansas science standards were flawed that drew together the band of writers who drafted the alternate standards, said Kailer, one of the writers.
Johnson's motivation was good science, he said.
``Celtie is not at all alone,'' he said.
``Celtie is one of the thousands who recognize the absurdity of evolution as science''.
But she is one of the few willing to speak out, said Linda Highland of Olathe, who first met Johnson at a legislative forum some years back.
Highland said the state board made the right decision in August, and she credited Johnson for helping board members find the strength to take a stand.
``I think that maybe she builds courage in others by showing that she isn't afraid to take this issue on,'' Highland said.
Johnson said she was motivated by the search for truth.
``I don't know what it is.
Maybe some people have the ability to see the proof,'' she said.
``I think the majority of people believe in evolution because they don't have the facts.''
RENO, Nev.
_ Cissy Bennett, a high school biology teacher in Birmingham, Ala.
, has to use a textbook with a disclaimer in it.
``Evolution,'' says the message from the Alabama State Board of Education, ``is a controversial theory some scientists present as scientific explanation for the origin of living things, such as plants, animals and humans.
No one was present when life first appeared on earth.
Therefore, any statement about life's origins should be considered as theory, not fact''.
That does not deter Ms.
Bennett from teaching her students that humans and all other species developed from common ancestors under the influence of natural selection.
``I tell them on the first day, `We are going to learn about evolution,' '' she said.
`` `I do not care if you believe what I am saying, but you will learn'.
'' But some teachers are more intimidated by the disclaimer.
One colleague, Ms.
Bennett said, once told her that she thought teaching evolution was against the law.
It has been 73 years since another high school biology teacher, John Scopes, was found guilty under Tennessee law for teaching that humans and apes descended from a common ancestor, and 30 years since the United States Supreme Court essentially overturned the Scopes ruling and declared that states could not prohibit teachers from discussing evolution.
But Charles Darwin's theory still faces challenges in the nation's classrooms from increasingly sophisticated creationists, state and local school boards that leave evolution out of science education, and many biology teachers who themselves reject evolution.
``The evolution-creation controversy is as charged today as it was when Scopes was tried,'' said Randy Moore, a professor of biology at Louisville University in Kentucky and the editor of The American Biology Teacher, a magazine published by the National Association of Biology Teachers.
``Creationists are more powerful than ever.
They're winning, not in terms of courts cases, but what happens in classrooms.
I get three to five phone calls a week from teachers with problems''.
A recent caller, Moore said, told him that a high school principal in Louisville had used the public address system in his school to announce that evolution had been overthrown and no longer needed to be taught.
Faced with incidents like these, teachers of evolution have been in ``a defensive mode,'' said Wayne Carley, executive director of the 7,500-member biology teachers association.
The association and other groups like the National Academy of Sciences and the largest professional group of evolutionists, the Society for the Study of Evolution, are embarking on a concerted effort to change the way Americans view evolution.
Evolution was at the center of the biology teachers' annual convention, which brought Moore and Ms.
Bennett and about 1,500 other teachers to Reno this month.
Teachers heard about the latest challenges in the classroom, received a copy of a book published earlier this year by the National Academy of Sciences about teaching evolution, and crowded into more than a dozen workshops on teaching the theory.
``When you combine the lack of emphasis on evolution in kindergarten through 12th grade, with the immense popularity of creationism among the public, and the industry of discrediting evolution,'' Moore said, ``it's easy to see why half of the population believes humans were created 10,000 years ago and lived with dinosaurs.
It is by far the biggest failure of science education from top to bottom''.
The challenges to teaching evolution have changed, said Dr.
Eugenie C.
Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education, which monitors the teaching of creationism in schools and communities nationwide.
The latest wrinkle, Scott said, is to try to introduce into the classroom other theories like ``intelligent design'' _ the idea that the universe is so impossibly complex that it must have been designed on purpose by an omniscient creator.
Creationism ranges from literal interpretations of Genesis in the Bible to the belief that God created and set in motion the process of evolution itself, a view shared by up to 40 percent of scientists according to national surveys.
Phillip E.
Johnson, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who has written four books attacking ``the dogmatic teaching of Darwinian evolution,'' advocates that students be taught to be distrustful of the evolution theory.
Johnson is affiliated with Access Research Network, a group in Colorado Springs, Colo.
, that promotes intelligent design in the biology textbook ``Of Pandas and People''.
At the convention, some sessions featured well-established lessons like comparing early hominid skulls and fossil footprints to the heads and feet of students in classes.
But other workshops discussed current research in evolutionary biology and how the latest findings could be used to add new life to lessons.
&QL; nn The Human Genome Project, for example, is finding an increasing number of genes that are shared by different species, from worms to mice to humans.
The ability of bacteria that cause infections to become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, and the resistance insects develop to pesticides offer real life examples of evolution.
Teachers were even shown a case where HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, developed a resistance to different drugs within a patient suffering from the disease.
The association honored two high school science teachers who served on the front lines in the legal fight to teach evolution.
Susan Epperson of Arkansas and Don Aguillard of Louisiana both took legal cases to the United States Supreme Court.
Epperson vs.
Arkansas outlawed state bans on teaching evolution in 1968, and in Edwards vs.
Aguillard, the Court ruled in 1987 that states could not require that ``creation science'' be taught along with evolution.
The two teachers, who volunteered to serve in these test cases, have become folk heroes to some biology teachers.
They have been stopped in the halls to autograph programs and have their pictures taken.
But despite their legal victories, Ms.
Epperson and Aguillard warned that the battle goes on.
``The fight has shifted from people like Susan and myself to you,'' Aguillard told the teachers.
``The task has shifted from constitutional challenges to grass roots efforts''.
In a recent survey of 387 Louisiana biology teachers, Aguillard found that 24 percent believed in creationism and 29 percent believed it was appropriate for high school biology classes.
Some teachers he interviewed said they ignored evolution, and one told Aguillard, ``I try to poke as many holes in it as I can''.
To Aguillard and others in the biology teachers association those findings, which echo previous studies in other states, indicate that creationism is not fading away, but is itself evolving.
The center for science education is involved in a court case challenging a school board resolution in Tangipahoa, La.
, that instructs teachers to read a disclaimer recommending that students consider ``other concepts'' than evolution.
The center is also mulling a legal challenge to the Alabama disclaimer, but that may be tough, said Scott, because the warning is written with finesse.
``This is bad science, and the First Amendment doesn't protect us from bad science,'' she said.
``We would have to convince a judge that it is a disguised sectarian religious view''.
Cissy Bennett, for one, is not sure that a legal challenge is the way to go.
People are tired of the controversy, she said.
Biology teachers in Alabama won a fight to get decent textbooks that include evolution.
The disclaimer ``seemed like a good compromise,'' she said, adding: ``We're able to get around it.
Most teachers just teach their stuff and ignore it''.
At their annual meeting, biology teachers shared strategies for dealing with problems in class.
Most start their classes by discussing the differences between science and religion, and talk about the limits of science and the fact that theories are always subject to correction and change.
Some teachers acknowledge their own faiths and offer to talk with students outside class.
Most have found ways to go on teaching evolution.
``You don't change very many minds,'' said Greg Wickett, a 10th grade biology teacher in Oregon.
``When a kid is 15 years old, of course his minister and parents are influencing him more than his teachers.
That's how it should be.
I've had students who called me the devil.
I told them I wasn't trying to convert them.
I'm not trying to teach them religion''.
Dr. Irene Eckstrand, who heads a new education committee of the Society for the Study of Evolution, says she believes it is almost inevitable that teachers will be defensive.
``They're held accountable to so many people,'' said Dr.
Eckstrand, whose group is working with the teachers association to integrate new research into classes.
``Teachers are on the front line.
But I'd like to see us not be so defensive.
We have a wonderful story to tell.''
KANSAS CITY, Mo.
_ Think of it as an educational tug of war.
On the one side, the establishment that has run the nation's public school systems for years.
On the other, social conservatives who say liberalized public education is destroying the country's moral fabric.
In the middle, millions of children.
It is a national phenomenon, but nowhere are the two sides pulling harder than in Kansas.
The state's 10-member elected Board of Education is split evenly along ideological lines.
Five members are moderate Republicans or Democrats, and five, all Republicans, are Christian conservatives.
The struggle is likely to intensify this week, as the board takes up new science standards and an old question: How did life and the universe begin?
Evolution would be taught as a cornerstone of science in revised standards the board will consider Wednesday.
The standards spell out what children would learn and be tested on, and they do not mention creationism.
A conservative board member is expected to introduce a competing proposal that questions the validity of evolutionary theory.
It also describes creation as being the result of ``intelligent design''.
Although they lack a majority, the conservatives have had an effect since they first gained control of half the seats in 1996.
Through a series of 5-5 votes and the compromises that followed, the conservatives have forced new curriculum standards and testing methods, and they have stalled implementation of some federal programs.
Bill Meek, a moderate Republican who lost a bid for the state board in 1996, says the frequent gridlock has hurt Kansas.
``If we stand still, people really do pass us by,'' said Meek, a member of the Spring Hill, Kan.
, Board of Education.
``I don't think there's such a thing as standing still anymore.
You either go forward, or you regress''.
He pointed to the board's 5-5 deadlock last year on accepting federal money through the Workforce Investment Act, which provides aid to states that develop career programs.
Meek says such programs help students make choices about the future.
Christian conservatives object to such programs because, they say, they steer students toward jobs that businesses say are in demand instead of leaving those decisions to the students and their families.
Last summer state board members deadlocked on a plan that was intended to give students more advanced, real-world math skills.
Conservatives objected because the plan would have allowed the use of calculators _ considered a crutch _ instead of requiring math by hand only.
The moderates compromised.
The standards, approved in March almost a year after first reaching the board, now focus on basic mathematics and prohibit elementary students from using calculators on state tests.
Kevin Gilmore, a conservative from Olathe, Kan.
, who was chairman of the Kansas state board for two years, views the deadlocks as the democratic process at work.
If the conservatives don't always get their way, he said, that is the democratic process, as well.
His colleagues are not the strident radicals they are sometimes painted to be by political foes, Gilmore said.
``I don't view any of them as extremists,'' he said.
``I don't think extremists get elected''.
Kansas is not the only place where Christian conservatives are making their voices heard: - In Texas conservative members of the state school board pushed through a biology textbook with few references to evolution.
In Alabama a conservative group persuaded state legislators to have a disclaimer about evolution pasted inside every biology text, a move that the National Center for Science Education said intimidated teachers from introducing the subject.
Other national groups support creationism and ``creation science,'' the theory that the Earth is just a few thousand years old and that the dinosaurs died out in the Great Flood, recorded in Genesis.
Courts repeatedly have struck down efforts to teach such theories in science classes.
- Like their Kansas counterparts, Christian conservatives in Ohio and Michigan have opposed the federal Workforce Investment Act and its School-to-Work program.
- ``Parental rights'' initiatives have cropped up in recent years in Congress and in more than 20 states, including Kansas, Indiana, Michigan and Colorado.
Conservatives say the bills would guarantee parents' rights to raise their children.
Liberals and moderates say the bills would make it easier for parents to challenge school teachings on religious grounds.
About half of the members of the Texas school board are Christian conservatives.
Additional states in which Christian conservatives have significant representation on local and state boards include California, Ohio and Virginia.
In Missouri state school board members are appointed by the governor.
Wide-ranging power The Kansas Board of Education dictates much of what is taught in the state's public schools.
The board has sweeping authority over the state's 304 public school districts, as well as its vocational schools, community colleges and schools for the deaf and the blind, but not the state universities.
It can require any program it wishes without seeking the approval of the governor or the Legislature.
The deadlocked votes have upset some state lawmakers.
Feeling pressure, board members have split the board's two-year chairmanship, which controls the board agenda.
Linda Holloway, a conservative from Shawnee, Kan.
, is chairwoman this year; Harold Roth, a moderate from Haven, Kan.
, will be chairman in 2000.
The board hoped to send voters a message that it would try to avoid deadlock.
Indeed, in March, the board unanimously approved the compromise math standards.
But a state audit of the board's performance in the last two years said the deadlocks had frustrated teachers and school administrators across Kansas.
``The tie votes are seen by some as a lack of decision-making,'' said the report, released in March.
Some lawmakers have worried that conservative members would try to reverse reform efforts such as Quality Performance Accreditation, the state's moderate-supported school improvement program.
Under the program, schools are accredited based on how well students learn specific subjects rather than on standards such as the numbers of books the schools have.
The accreditation effort developed alongside the state's new school-finance formula, and both took effect in the early 1990s.
The Legislature saw the new accreditation system as a way to link accountability and school funding.
Quality Performance Accreditation has remained intact, but conservatives have slowed the programs that the previous board was enacting.
The accreditation testing program, for example, almost died after conservatives voted not to renew it in 1997.
A compromise was reached later when moderates, in part, agreed to scrap subjective tests, which the conservatives disliked.
Finding a voice Christian conservatives think public schools have turned away from the country's educational foundation: Schools run by churches that taught right and wrong from one basic text, the Bible.
Now, Christian conservatives are just trying to have a voice, said Sam Blumenfeld, a conservative scholar in Boston who writes for the online news service WorldNet Daily.
Blumenfeld said public schools ``undermine Christians' ability to influence their children''.
Christian conservatives want to return to a time when public schools worked, he said.
America's founders, he said, were Calvinists who believed that man is, by nature, a depraved creature who needs fear of a higher power to do the right thing.
Public schools at one time were based on this philosophy, Blumenfeld said, but in recent decades the schools have been shaped by secular humanism, which holds that humans control their destinies.
Christian conservatives, he said, ``have no influence over what the public schools do.
Whatever policies they have are made by liberals''.
Christian conservatives say ``A Nation at Risk'' gave voice to their fears.
The report, released in the early 1980s by a presidential panel, sharply criticized American education.
That criticism was taken by Christian conservatives as an explanation of why society's bedrock _ the family _ was crumbling.
In a sense it validated social conservatives' opinions about higher rates of divorce, teen-age pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease.
America's children spend much of their time in school.
What were they learning there?
In recent years, several Christian conservative leaders, including ministers Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, have publicly stated their disdain for the nation's public education system.
In a speech at last fall's Christian Coalition national convention, Robertson said that 19th-century reformer John Dewey trained teachers to spread the ``poison'' of secular humanism into public schools.
Falwell has said public schools are a place of darkness.
Conservatives have decried tests that they say often contain open-ended questions to which students choose the best answer, not the right answer.
That's a form of moral relativism, in which there are no rights or wrongs, Christian conservatives say.
Comprehensive sex education in schools often presents abstinence as a choice, along with the use of contraception.
The context of marriage is not necessarily part of the lesson.
That undermines the Christian belief that sex outside marriage is wrong, conservatives said.
And in outcomes-based education, which grew out of the reforms of the 1980s, conservatives saw a trend toward focusing on children's social well-being and teaching political correctness at the cost of rigorous academics.
Education is a top priority of many national conservative organizations, such as Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum and James Dobson's Focus on the Family.
These groups often have state chapters that can mobilize members for intense grass-roots campaigning, said Martha McCarthy, an Indiana University education professor who has studied the religious right.
Political action The conservatives' power stems from that political support, said Rob Boston, assistant director of communications for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.
The group publishes a monthly newsletter that details the activities of the Christian right.
In recent years conservative leaders have mobilized their followers to vote for school board members and legislators who share their beliefs, and low voter turnout in many elections has ensured their success, Boston said.
Along with their claims that public schools are destroying America, many conservatives advocate publicly financed charter schools, homeschooling and aid, such as vouchers or tax credits, for parents who send their children to private schools.
``If they don't want to abolish the public schools, then they want to Christianize them,'' Boston said.
Similarities between conservatives' efforts across the country have caused groups such as the liberal People for the American Way and the Mainstream Coalition in Johnson County, Kan.
, to suggest that there is a concerted effort to discredit public schools.
Caroline McKnight, executive director of the Mainstream Coalition, a nonpartisan group that has been critical of the conservative movement, points to conservative literature criticizing school reform efforts by a handful of states.
Many of the publications use the same catch phrases, such as ``fuzzy standards'' and ``secular humanism''.
When the Christian conservatives won five of the 10 seats on the Kansas state board, some moderate and liberal groups warned that the conservative agendas showing up in other states would show up in Kansas.
The conservative board members ``have been elected to a position that's supposed to look out for the best interest of public schools,'' McKnight said.
``But the argument can be made that they don't like public education''.
Gilmore, the former board chairman, said he did not run for office out of any dislike for schools, but because for many years social conservatives had no voice in public education.
Holding office, he said, is the American way to ``have a voice in government to push conservative views''.
New standards The flap over evolution is heightening public interest in the new Kansas science standards, which the board will take up Wednesday.
The standards, which were written by a committee appointed by education Commissioner Andy Tompkins, list evolution as one of five unifying concepts that cut across the scientific disciplines.
Since January, when the standards first appeared before the board, Christian conservatives have urged board members to reject the document because evolution goes against their beliefs.
They want equal time for the belief that God alone created Earth and its creatures.
Many scientists and teachers have asked the board to focus on the consensus among scientists that biology, and other aspects of science, cannot be mastered without first understanding evolution.
Evolution _ the theory that life on Earth has mutated and adapted over millions of years _ is the accepted theory in the biological sciences, said Mary Blythe, an elementary science specialist in the Kansas City, Kan.
, School District and a member of the science standards committee.
Students need to be aware of all of the scientific theories to understand science, Blythe said.
That some conservatives continue to push for creationist ideas to be taught in science classes is a concern, she said.
Not for Kansas board member Steve Abrams, a conservative from Arkansas City, who rejects evolution.
On Wednesday he will give the other board members a different draft of the science standards written by a group of people who don't believe in evolution.
The document includes evolution and ``intelligent design'' _ the theory that life happened intentionally, not by chance _ under the heading ``historical science''.
``I just didn't like the standards that were proposed,'' Abrams said.
``And instead of sitting there complaining, I thought I would propose something I liked''.
Blythe and the other members of the science committee knew that weaving evolution through the standards would be controversial, but she said she was puzzled all the same.
``I've never had a conflict with evolution,'' she said.
``I felt like it was a mechanism that God started to make everything work.''
TOPEKA _ Conservatives won a major victory in Kansas on Wednesday when the state Board of Education approved new science standards that dilute the teaching of evolution.
In a 6-4 vote, the board ignored the recommendations of a 27-member state committee of scientists that spent a year drafting new standards.
The board adopted a modified version of the standards that leaves the question of teaching evolution to the state's 304 school districts.
Conservatives hailed the decision as a step forward.
But John Staver, co-chairman of the committee of scientists that drafted the standards, called it a ``travesty to science education'' and added: ``Kansas just embarrassed itself on the national stage''.
Indeed, the battle over science standards in Kansas has attracted attention across the nation.
Staver said all of the members of the science writing committee he had talked to _ more than half the total _ wanted their names removed from the standards.
They also want the board to remove the committee's dedication at the top of the standards, which said: ``Our children are the future of Kansas.
With this document, we pass on the legacy of our own teachers, who helped us to know that as lifelong learners of science, we can live more productive, responsible and fulfilling lives''.
The compromise version approved Wednesday was put together by conservative board members Scott Hill and Steven Abrams, and by Harold Voth, who had been considered a moderate.
Joining in the vote to adopt it were Linda Holloway, John Bacon and Mary Douglass Brown.
The version deletes references to macroevolution, the process of change from one species to another, but leaves references to microevolution, or changes within species.
It does not prohibit the teaching of evolution.
But some fear that teachers will drop the teaching because macroevolution will not be included on state tests.
There also are concerns that groups could bring pressure on teachers to drop evolution from the curriculum.
During the meeting, board member Janet Waugh complained that she did not have enough time to study the compromise version.
She wanted to delay the vote a month, she said, but was told before the meeting that the vote would go forward.
After the meeting, Hill said that 95 percent of the material in the compromise version was picked up from the writing committee's fifth draft, which the board never voted on.
``I didn't see (the other 5 percent) as that huge of a change that we had to start the process over again,'' he said, commenting on Waugh's request for a delay.
The new standards simply give more latitude to local school districts in deciding what to teach about the origin of life, conservatives said.
Most teachers probably will continue to teach evolution, Hill predicted.
``Where are you going to get a textbook that doesn't have evolution in it''? he said.
Staver, however, said he believed the changes approved remove evolution as a unifying concept tying the sciences together.
Also, he said, they open the door for the teaching of creation science and the theory of intelligent design, which essentially says a higher power created the universe.
A science specialist in the Kansas City, Kan.
, School District who was on the writing committee said she fears the changes also could open the door to the teaching of concepts that the conservatives don't want, such as New Age philosophies or ``occult-type things''.
``There could be a teacher somewhere or a group somewhere who would try to force that in,'' said Mary Blythe, district science specialist for K-5.
``It's a sad day for science in Kansas''.
Students who do not learn about evolution will be at a disadvantage when they take college entrance exams, she and others said.
The conservatives, however, dispute that.
National groups that monitor the teaching of evolution had predictable reactions to the board vote.
John Morris, president of the Institute for Creation Research, a California think tank of scientists that deals with issues of origin, applauded the action.
Fossil records and other facts ``seem to fit the creationism version of history better than the evolutionist version,'' Morris said.
``I think what the Kansas school board has done is a strong step forward for producing good students, good thinkers and good scientists''.
But Molleen Matsumura of the National Center for Science Education, a Berkeley, Calif.
, group that supports the teaching of evolution, said no one should downplay the changes made by the board.
``These are some of the most extensive changes I have seen,'' she said.
``There were paragraphs and paragraphs that were just removed''.
Some of the most important underlying concepts of evolution were removed, she said, and whether they will be taught will now be the option of local school districts.
``Trying to make it optional is like trying to make it optional to talk about gravity in a physics class,'' she said.
``The real losers are the children of Kansas''.
Evolution has been tested in enough states now to grab the attention of the national media, Matsumura said.
The media probably got interested in Kansas because the debate has dragged on for months, she said, and because even the governor came out in the foray, expressing opposition to the compromise.
The new standards could face a legal challenge from either the American Civil Liberties Union or Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a Washington group.
Both expressed their concerns to the board before the vote.
Also, the national science organizations that supported the writing committee's drafts want to take a close look at the changes the board has adopted, Staver said.
They want to make sure the standards don't attribute anything to them that they disagree with.
Holloway, the board chairman, said the board planned to consult with its attorney to see if the new standards would meet a legal challenge.
In the meantime, she said, the board will move forward with implementation.
The standards will be sent to all school districts, she said, and teachers will be trained in them.
At the same time, she said, assessments will be built for testing the new standards.
The standards are expected to take effect in the 2000-2001 school year.
Drawing on the deep resources of ``creation science'' advocacy groups, American fundamentalists are arming themselves with the latest books challenging details of Darwinian theory, getting elected to majority positions on school boards and learning ways to word curriculums so that creationism and evolution get equal respect.
While they have gotten very good at making a case for teaching alternative theories, a small group of scientists and educators stands in their way.
Most of America's children are not being taught that the world might have come into existence only 10,000 years ago, versus the nearly 4.5 billion years advocated by scientists, and this is largely because of the SWAT-like efforts of the National Center for Science Education.
The center, based in Berkeley, Calif.
, has four full-time employees and 4,000 members.
Within 24 hours of a call for help, Eugenie C.
Scott, the executive director, jumps into action.
Operating on a ``frayed, shoestring budget,'' the center can help mount a counterattack on creationism in public schools.
The center supplies concise articles and pamphlets refuting the claims of creation science, legal advice and summaries of court cases involving creationism, tips on writing letters to the editors of local newspapers, advice on how to explain issues to reporters, phone numbers of national experts on evolution, links to dozens of organizations that can offer help, and the phone numbers of other people in their state who are willing to get involved.
``They're the only group providing this kind of information for people who need it,'' said Dr.
Ronald Numbers, a professor of medical history and ethics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and an expert on the creationist movement.
Since the center was founded in 1981, to provide a grass-roots response to creationist challenges, it has been active in all 50 states, Scott said.
Most fights over creationism vs.
evolution happen at the local level, in small towns in rural states where populations are fairly homogeneous.
``You don't see it in large cities where people come from diverse backgrounds,'' she said.
Dr. Ken Miller, a professor of biology at Brown University in Providence, R.I., likened the center to ``a national fire department''.
``Whenever the scientific integrity of biology teaching is under fire or compromised,'' he said, ``the center goes there to provide support and lend resources to people who are actually fighting the fire''.
Sometimes a creationist challenge can be ``nipped in the bud'' with just a few well-chosen maneuvers, Scott said.
For example, last year the school board in Post Falls, Idaho, at the behest of creationists in the community, wrote a policy statement that would have allowed creation scientists considerable latitude in making their views known in public schools.
The Center for Science Education, contacted by a member of the community, reviewed the statement and discovered that the school district was opening itself to a violation of the laws of church and state.
The suggestions made by the center kept the school district from running afoul of those laws, and the school curriculum did not change.
In other situations, creationists prevail.
A year ago a committee of educators in Kansas began a routine update of the state's science standards and called on the center for help on what they knew would be a delicate task.
The statewide committee of 27 science teachers, which submitted the new standards to the Kansas Board of Education, was stunned two weeks ago when the Board decided to drop evolution from the required state curriculum.
The battle to keep evolution in the classroom is a David vs.
Goliath struggle.
The Center for Science Education has an annual budget of $250,000, collected from members, compared with the $3 million of the Institute of Creation Research in Santee, Calif.
, one of several fundamentalist groups trying to discredit the teaching of evolution.
But Scott has a powerful slingshot in the form of clergy members who believe in evolution and scientists who believe in God.
When a local resident steps up before the microphone at a public hearing, says he a faithful Christian and also believes in evolution, people are mightily impressed.
According to several polls, including one reported recently in Scientific American, about 40 percent of scientists believe in God.
In local school board battles, members of the center will find such scientists in the community to testify.
Miller, for example, is both a scientist and Roman Catholic who has testified before numerous school boards on behalf of evolution.
``The fact that I'm a practicing Christian takes away their unspoken fear that everyone in science is either an atheist or agnostic,'' he said.
``I tell them why I believe evolution doesn't threaten the faith of young people''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Certainly, the Center for Science nettles advocates of creationism.
Duane Gish, senior vice president of the Institute for Creation Research, accused the center of intimidation and of ``always threatening to sue''.
``They are censors and bookburners,'' he said in a telephone interview.
``They were organized for the sole purpose of fighting creationists and to keep any evidence for creation science out of public schools''.
But, he acknowledged, ``They're effective''.
The face-offs have changed over the years as creationists have adjusted their tactics.
Early in this century, Scott said, creationists tried to ban the teaching of evolution and lost.
In 1987 the U.S.
Supreme Court struck down laws giving equal time to the teaching of creationism alongside evolution.
``Instead of fighting for equal time, they've decided to teach the evidence against evolution to balance it out,'' Scott said.
``If nothing else evolves, creationism does''.
These days, creationists have turned their attention to gaps in the fossil records and an older argument that life is so intricate and complex it could not have evolved by chance.
Their rubrics are intelligent-design theory, abrupt-appearance theory and irreducible complexity theory.
These new challenges against evolution are being made by conservative Christians at secular universities who are upset over the secularization of American society, Scott said.
They are not trying to ban evolution so much as to undermine it.
The Supreme Court ruled that teachers could teach secular and scientific alternatives to evolution, Scott said.
So the new battles in Kansas and elsewhere pit theory against theory _ intelligent design versus Darwin.
John Richard Schrock, director of biology education at Emporia State University in Kansas and a member of the committee that worked on the state's science standards, said the center had helped them be aware of how their choice of wording could open doors for intelligent-design theorists and other creationists.
``We had to remove ambiguity,'' he said.
``They helped us with our definition of evolution as theory,'' Schrock said.
They also helped change wording in a tolerance statement _ promoting respect for alternative views _ that would not open the door to teaching religious creationism in history classes.
In the end, the School Board ignored the committee's work and voted in its own viewpoints, Schrock said.
But Scott and her staff are continuing to fight back.
The American Civil Liberties Union may decide to bring a lawsuit against the Kansas School Board, Scott said, even as other pressures are put to bear on the state.
For example, one leading software company that is looking to expand took Topeka off its list.
``That gets peoples' attention,'' she said. &QL;
KANSAS CITY, Mo.
_ When Kansas Board of Education member Steve Abrams called John Staver to Topeka two weeks ago, Staver thought they were going to iron out some problems with proposed science standards.
Instead, Abrams gave Staver, who helped write the standards, a 91-page revision.
And although Abrams' version was written by ``various citizens,'' including the Missouri president of a creation science group, the only names on the revision are those of Staver and the 26 other members of the state committee that wrote the original document.
Abrams sees his revision as one of many since the committee began writing the standards more than a year ago.
But science committee members say Abrams' revision substantially changed a document that was based on guidelines from national science associations.
Abrams' version would change the definition of science, eliminate all but one reference to evolution and add a definition of creation as ``the idea that the design and complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent designer''.
``It bothers me that my name is on it,'' said Steve Case, a member of the standards committee who sits on the faculty at the University of Kansas.
The committee's standards list evolution as a cornerstone of science.
Without an understanding of evolution, students cannot succeed in the life sciences, the standards writers said.
But Abrams didn't agree, and on Wednesday he'll present his revision to the other board members.
Today, the board will hear public comment on the science standards.
The proposed standards are the result of a state board order in 1997 to spell out what students should learn at various grade levels.
The board and the state education commissioner appointed the 27-member committee to write the standards.
Staver, director of the Center for Science Education at Kansas State University, said the committee decided at its first meeting to base the new standards on national guidelines from the National Academy of Sciences.
Those national standards, developed over four years, were reviewed and critiqued by 22 science organizations.
About 18,000 persons signed off on the national standards before they were accepted, Staver said.
Those standards present evolution as a major component of science.
``That national consensus gives the national standards a very special kind of credibility,'' Staver said.
At least that's what the science committee thought.
But Abrams wasn't satisfied that the new state science standards represented the best kind of science.
Abrams, a veterinarian from Arkansas City, said science is something that is ``observable, measurable, repeatable and falsifiable''.
``It's been a standard for theories of science for hundreds of years,'' Abrams said.
``If it's not repeatable, it doesn't do any good''.
For Abrams, macro-evolution _ one species of animal changing into another as it adapts to its environment _ can't be observed, measured, repeated or falsified.
(Something that can be falsified can be proved or disproved by scientific experiment).
So when Cass County resident Tom Willis approached Abrams with a revision of the state standards, Abrams took a look.
Willis, president of the Creation Science Association for Mid-America, said he and about two dozen other people evaluated the proposed state science standards and found them lacking.
He declined to name his co-authors.
Willis said he and his co-authors couldn't present new standards to the state board; that's where Abrams came in.
When Abrams saw Willis' document, it was in its second draft.
Abrams said he helped the writers edit and present the document in the proper format.
Willis said the state committee's version and Abrams' revision are quite different, but Abrams describes the changes as slight.
Among the differences: - The committee's version lists five ``unifying concepts'' of science: systems, order and organization; evidence, models and explanation; constancy, change and measurement; form and function; and evolution and equilibrium.
Abrams' revision removed the unifying concepts and added three areas of science: technology, theoretical science and historical science.
- The committee's version defines science as ``the human activity of seeking natural explanations for what we observe in the world around us''.
In Abrams' revision, science is defined as something that can be repeated in the laboratory.
- The glossary of the committee's version defines evolution, in part, as ``a scientific theory that accounts for present day similarity and diversity among living organisms and changes in non-living entities over time''.
The glossary of Abrams' version describes evolution as permutations that occur within a species, with the caveat that some evolutionary changes can be demonstrated and some cannot.
The board that will take up the standards on Wednesday is divided along ideological lines, with five moderate members and five conservatives.
The two sides have deadlocked on several issues in the last few years.
Moderate member Janet Waugh of Kansas City, Kan.
, said she had no idea Abrams was working on a revision.
Neither did Bill Wagnon, a moderate from Topeka.
Wagnon said that after he received Abrams' version of the standards, the two talked.
Wagnon said he was trying to persuade Abrams to uphold the commitment he made two years ago when the science committee was appointed.
At that time, board members each chose a committee member to represent their views, with the rest appointed by the education commissioner.
If the board can't trust its own committees, the process fails, Wagnon said.
``Abrams is searching for a sixth vote,'' Wagnon said.
``I hope, if he can't find it, he will encourage others to vote for the committee's standards''.
Linda Holloway, a Shawnee conservative who is chairwoman of the state board, said she was unsure what would happen if state board members voted to accept Abrams' version over the science committee's standards.
The board is scheduled to vote in June on the new standards.
Scientific lessons about the origins of life have long been challenged in public schools, but some Bible literalists are now adding the reigning theory about the origin of the universe to their list of targets.
Nearly overlooked in the furor over the Kansas Board of Education's decision in August to remove evolution from its education standards was a decision on the much wider realm governed by the science of the cosmos.
Influenced by a handful of scientists whose literal faith in the Bible has helped persuade them that the universe is only a few thousand years old, the board deleted from its standards a description of the Big Bang theory of cosmic origins, the central organizing principle of modern astronomy and cosmology.
The Big Bang theory, based on decades of astronomical observations and physics research, suggests that the universe originated in a colossal explosion of matter and radiation some 15 billion years ago.
But ``young Earth creationists,'' as they are generally known, have come up with their own theories to explain how cosmic history could be condensed into mere thousands of years.
They are making this case in books, pamphlets and lectures, as well as on a number of Web sites.
Mainstream scientists consider their theories to be wildly out of line with reality, even though books describing them are often liberally sprinkled with references to authorities like Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking.
As a result, physical scientists now find themselves in a fight in which they have seldom played a public role.
They have responded with a mixture of disdain, disbelief and consternation, and the reactions have not been limited to physicists and cosmologists in Kansas.
``It's the denial of what understanding we have of the origin of the universe in terms of modern science,'' said Jerome Friedman, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1990 for collaborating in the discovery of the subatomic particles called quarks and is the president of the American Physical Society.
``That's a terrible loss,'' Friedman said.
Hume A.
Feldman, a cosmologist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence who has worked at Princeton University and the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, called the matter ``frightening''.
``When I went into cosmology, I never thought I would get involved in anything like that,'' he said.
Feldman said that developments in his state bore a distant resemblance to the difficulties of political scientists under communist regimes in Eastern Europe, and that he feared that such pressures could impair the educational system.
But advocates of the creationist view say alarm over their theories is overblown.
Steve Abrams, a member of the Kansas board and veterinarian in Arkansas City who was among the leaders of the push to make the changes, said there are legitimate scientific doubts about whether the universe is more than several thousand years old.
``There is sufficient data to lend credibility to the idea that we do not have all the answers for teaching the origin of our universe,'' he said.
That sentiment was echoed by John W.
Bacon, a board member from Olathe who also voted with a narrow 6-4 majority for the changes.
``I can't understand what they're squealing about,'' Bacon said of scientists who oppose the board's action.
Millions or billions of years ago, Bacon said, ``I wasn't here, and neither were they.
Based on that, whatever explanation they may arrive at is a theory and it should be taught that way''.
Those objections closely mirror criticisms leveled at evolution by its opponents.
Alabama biology textbooks, for example, must carry a warning that reads in part: ``No one was present when life first appeared on earth.
Therefore, any statement about life's origins should be considered as theory, not fact''.
The Kansas challenge to the teaching of the Big Bang is not the first public objection to the theory on religious or political grounds.
Three years ago, the school superintendent of a conservative county in western Kentucky ordered two pages that explained the Big Bang in grade-school textbooks to be glued together.
The superintendent said that the Big Bang should not have been explained without including the Biblical version of creation as well.
The change in the Kansas standards does not preclude the teaching of mainstream biology, physics or cosmology, allowing teachers to present alternative viewpoints if they choose to do so.
But because the standards are used as the basis for state tests, the changes will probably have a practical effect on what is taught, said Dr.
Bill Wagnon, a professor of history at Washburn University in Topeka and a board member who voted in the minority.
Students' scores on those tests help determine whether a school receives accreditation from the state.
``The curriculum standards describe that process of what needs to be covered,'' Wagnon said.
So radical were the Kansas board's recommendations that it has been unable to publish its own standards, or even to display them on its Web site.
That is because the standards include long extracts from a book on education standards that was published by the National Research Council.
Because of its disapproval of the board's revised standards, the council has refused permission for them to be reprinted.
Beyond the expunging of evolution, the board also took out references to the hundreds of millions of years of Earth's geologic ages and modified sections on using the slow decay of radioactive elements to measure the ages of fossils and other rocks.
Among the most striking changes, however, was the removal of passages in the original standards dealing with the Big Bang.
Cosmologists see ample evidence for that explosion in the present expansion of the universe, in a diffuse afterglow in space called the cosmic background radiation, and in the precise abundances of light elements like hydrogen and helium that were left over from the cataclysm.
Cosmologists have also calculated the way in which stars, galaxies and clusters of galaxies coalesced from slight ripples in the primordial soup that emerged from the Big Bang.
To date, the results of those calculations match the increasingly precise observations of such structures in the heavens.
Of course, for all its success in accounting for observations, the Big Bang is indeed just a theory, although it is one with few scientific dissenters.
The biggest problem for the Young Earth Creationists is explaining the time that has apparently passed since the light we see from distant galaxies was emitted.
Given the constancy of the speed of light and estimates of the distance between Earth and faraway galaxies it is difficult to explain how Earth and the cosmos could be young.
But D.
Russell Humphreys, a nuclear weapons engineer at Sandia National Laboratory who is also an adjunct professor at the Institute for Creation Research near San Diego, thinks he has an answer.
In an interview, he said that Einstein's equations of relativity, the basis of the Big Bang theory, could be used to construct a universe in which the Earth is only a few thousand years old.
Abrams said that in thinking about the Kansas standards he had been struck by Humphreys' book, ``Starlight and Time: Solving the Puzzle of Distant Starlight in a Young Universe'' (Master Books, fifth printing in 1998).
Humphreys' ideas ``seem to be right there on the cutting edge, so to speak,'' Abrams said.
But most cosmologists say they are simply out of left field.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn The theory relies on a peculiar feature of Einstein's equations, which predict that powerful gravitational fields can speed the progress of time and, in effect, make clocks run at different rates in different places.
So Humphreys assumes that the Earth is close to the center of a structure related to a black hole, in which gravity is especially intense, that billions of years could pass in deep space while only a few thousand years went by on Earth.
Such a universe ``has clocks clicking at drastically different rates in different parts,'' Humphreys said in an interview.
Dr. Edward L.
Wright, vice chairman for astronomy at UCLA, said that there is no evidence the Earth is at the center of the universe, nor that such tremendous gravitational fields exist outside of ordinary black holes.
Moreover, said Wright, the acceleration of time would alter the vibrations of waves of light, shortening its wave length and turning it into deadly gamma rays.
Bombarded by such radiation, he said, ``the Earth would be sterilized''.
Humphreys, whose research in cosmology is unrelated to his work at the lab, said other features of his model would prevent the frequency increase.
Abrams also appealed to a theory that the speed of light was almost infinitely fast in the past, meaning that the light from extremely distant galaxies could have reached Earth quickly and would not be billions of years old.
He referred to writings on this subject by Dr.
Danny Faulkner, a professor of astronomy on the University of South Carolina's Lancaster campus and an adjunct professor at the Institute for Creation Science.
In a telephone interview, Faulkner cautioned that he had merely been describing ideas put forth by other scientists in the creationist movement and was not certain that the changing speed of light was correct.
Indeed, high-precision measurements of the speed of light and other crucial physical constants have revealed no detectable change in their values over recent time.
The debate over the age of the universe has exposed intense disagreements not just in schools but also among evangelical Christian.
``Often young-universe and old-universe creationists focus more energy on defending their respective positions than on reaching out to nonbelievers,'' wrote Dr.
Hugh Ross, a former radioastronomer who is an evangelical Christian, in ``Creation and Time: A Biblical and Scientific Perspective on the Creation-Date Controversy'' (NavPress, 1994).
Ross thinks that a literal reading of the Bible can be reconciled with the Big Bang, but says that his views are distinctly in the minority among evangelical Christians.
The six days of Genesis could stand for ``six consecutive long periods of time,'' Ross said.
The importance of the issue for many Bible literalists means that cosmologists could face the pressures that biologists have dealt with since John Scopes was convicted of violating a Tennessee law against the teaching of evolution in 1925, said Dr.
Eugenie C.
Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education, Inc.
, in El Cerrito, Calif.
``I don't think physical scientists are going to be immune to this,'' Dr.
Scott said.
``It would be very unwise for them to brush this off''. &QL;
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a new chapter of a dispute that pits science against religion, a national organization of scientists gives schools in 19 states unsatisfactory grades for teaching evolution.
The report, commissioned by the Thomas B.
Fordham Foundation and released Tuesday at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, grades 49 states and the District of Columbia on the basis of how well evolution is included in the state science education standards.
California, Connecticut, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina and Rhode Island received the highest rank.
Kansas, whose standards were described as ''disgraceful,'' got the lowest grade.
Following the six states graded at 100 were four states graded in the 90s and given A's in the report.
Fourteen states were graded at B, 7 got C, 6 were given D's and 13 flunked.
Iowa was not included because it has no statewide education standards, leaving that up to each local district.
Linda Holloway, former chairman of the Kansas State Board of Education, said the report was deceptive and ''very unfair''.
''Clearly they have an ax to grind about evolution,'' she said in a telephone interview.
Kansas last year rekindled the issue of teaching evolution in public schools when the state board of education, lead by Holloway, approved science teaching standards that minimized the importance of evolution and omitted the big-bang theory of the origin of the universe.
Other states have considered similar curriculum changes and some state legislatures have proposed laws that would forbid completely the teaching of evolution in public schools.
Evolution, a theory developed by Charles Darwin and others, holds that the Earth is billions of years old and that all life, including humans, evolved from simple forms through a process of natural selection.
Related to biological evolution is the concept that the universe began with a ''big bang'' and that only later were the sun and the planets formed.
Teaching of evolution has been opposed by people who believe that the universe, the Earth and its creatures were created abruptly by God.
Some proponents of divine creation have organized a concept, called creationism, that they proposed be taught along with evolution.
In 1987, the U.S.
Supreme Court barred states from requiring the teaching of creationism.
Now some of the same proponents support other concepts, such as ''abrupt appearance'' or ''intelligent design,'' that are linked to divine creation.
Lawrence S.
Lerner, who compiled the report for the Thomas B.
Fordham Foundation, said that the conflict ''is not really about science, but about religion and politics''.
He calls creationism ''a pseudoscientific rival to evolution that the courts have repeatedly held to be thinly veiled religion''.
Lerner, a former professor at California State University, Long Beach, said that Kansas got such a poor grade because its guidelines forbid teaching anything about the age of the Earth or the universe.
''There is not a reference to the age of the universe because it changes all the time,'' explained Holloway.
''Within a month after we adopted the standards, I heard three different ages of the Earth.
That is kind of ludicrous to get them (teachers) to stick to one age when it changes all the time''.
Lerner called the Kansas science education standards ''a disgraceful paean to antiscience''.
Holloway, however, said that the report was part of ''a campaign of deception'' and that all districts in Kansas are still teaching evolution.
''All we did was allow local groups to decide how they wanted to teach evolution,'' she said.
''That is a reasonable thing to do''.
Warren Nord, a member of a panel assembled by AAAS to comment on the report, spoke in favor of education standards that would include religious concepts of creation along with concepts of evolution.
But Nord, director of the Program on Humanities and Human Values at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the report failed to evaluate the completeness of science education.
''A good science education should not limit itself to what scientists think, but should also explore the cultural context in which scientific claims are made,'' said Nord, noting that the report ''doesn't address that''.

NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- The war in Chechnya has simmered down to isolated clashes, but rebels said Monday they were regrouping for a new offensive and top Russian commanders warned that violence will flare up again.
Also Monday, in a sign of growing concern among Russians about the war, a group of lawmakers said they were setting up an independent commission to investigate the situation in Chechnya, including human rights.
Russia has been under strong criticism from the West over the eight-month war and United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights Mary Robinson this month urged formation of an independent commission.
Pavel Krasheninnikov, a member of parliament and commission initiator, told a news conference that the Chechen offensive has reached a deadlock and ''a military settlement is unlikely to succeed''.
Chechen fighters have kept up their hit-and-run attacks on Russian forces in recent weeks, but the fierce battles that laid waste to the rebel republic have abated.
''They can no longer fight the way they did three or four months ago, but they have carried out, are carrying out and will carry out terrorist acts,'' said a top Russian commander in Chechnya, Col.
Gen. Gennady Troshev.
A rebel fighter, who only identified himself as Shirvani, said Monday the insurgents needed time to recover and regroup after the rough and bloody winter.
Shirvani came to Nazran in neighboring Ingushetia with 11 wounded militants for medical treatment.
He said the militants were planning ''a number of terrorist acts on the territory of Chechnya'' at the end of the month, but for the moment were concentrating on ''quick attacks'' on Russian checkpoints.
In the town of Gudermes, two Russian policemen were killed and three wounded Sunday when unknown gunmen opened fire on them as they raided an apartment where rebels were suspected of hiding out, the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies reported.
The Russian military claimed that nearly a dozen rebels were killed and several taken prisoner during another battle in the southern Itum-Kale region, Interfax reported.
After moving into Chechnya in September, Russian troops seized about two-thirds of the republic in steady advances across the northern flatlands.
But the Russians have bogged down in the southern mountains, the last major area still under rebel control.
Moscow has indicated in recent weeks that it may be looking for a way out of the conflict.
The independent commission whose formation was announced Monday will investigate the events of the current war and of the 1994-6 Chechnya war, initiators said.
Putin, on a visit to London on Monday, said he only learned about the commission from media reports, but that he welcomed its creation.
MOSCOW, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia is determined to liberate the entire breakaway republic of Chechnya and to restore normal life of the Chechen civilians, said Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev on Wednesday.
"The liberation of Chechnya is the goal set for the federal armed forces.
President Boris Yeltsin is giving his whole-hearted backing to the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya," Sergeyev said in Fergana, Uzbekistan.
According to the Interfax news agency, Sergeyev arrived in Uzbekistan Wednesday to analyze the performance of the Southern Commonwealth Shield-99 exercise, aimed at fighting large terrorist units with Russian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik and Uzbek forces involved.
Sergeyev said that the Russian Eastern Army has surrounded Gudermes, Chechnya's second largest city, and there are very few militants remaining.
He believes that local volunteers will make the greatest contribution to the liberation of Gudermes.
Naurskaya, Shelkovskaya and Nadterechnaya districts are completely controlled by the federal troops, who have also taken control of seven of the 22 villages in the Gudermes district and nine of the 31 villages in the Grozny district, while the separatists are short of weaponry, munitions and medical supplies.
Sergeyev said the federal troops will soon surround the populated areas where the rebels congregate.
The rebels are retreating from the Gudermes and Sunzha districts to mountainous areas in Chechnya under attacks from the federal troops, said a source from the Russian Defense Ministry.
The source said foreign extremists and weaponry are arriving from abroad to aid the Chechen militants, with more than 300 terrorists coming from the Middle East in October, and by orders of field commander Shamil Basayev and Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov.
They have moved to the villages in the Itum-Kale, Nozhai-Yurt and Vedeno districts.
MOSCOW _ Russia's campaign against Islamic rebels in Chechnya moved closer to full-scale war Thursday as federal forces entered the breakaway Caucasus region where Moscow suffered a humiliating and costly defeat three years ago.
With Russian warplanes hammering targets in Chechnya for an eighth day, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said an unspecified number of the estimated 20,000 to 30,000 Russian troops in the area had moved into positions inside Chechnya.
``Combat operations in Chechnya are already under &UR; &LR; way,'' Putin said in St.
Petersburg. Chechen leaders vowed to retaliate with attacks against Russian targets, and Russian military analysts predicted a new disaster along the lines of the 1994-96 war, which cost tens of thousands of lives.
Putin did not say exactly where the soldiers crossed into Chechnya and there were no reports of ground fighting, but tensions were running high.
Russian and Chechen sources said federal troops and tanks had advanced six to nine miles in the steppe north of Chechnya's capital of Grozny, then pulled back to about three miles inside the border.
Chechnya's Defense Minister Magomed Khambiyev said specially trained troops would retaliate for any Russian attack, news agencies here reported.
``Combat action will start on the territory of Russia,'' Khambiyev said.
``Russian citizens (will) feel the gruesome nature of the war, the bitterness of losing relatives and friends''.
Russia says it wants to wipe out Islamic militants who invaded neighboring Dagestan in August and September, inflicting heavy casualties on Russian troops before retreating back into Chechnya.
The militants also have been blamed for four recent bomb blasts in Russia that killed nearly 300 people.
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov has been calling for talks to avert war but has been rebuffed by the Kremlin, which is demanding he turn over suspected terrorists.
Thursday, Maskhadov appealed to Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze to help set up talks with President Boris N.
Yeltsin. Russian generals have hinted that they plan to partition Chechnya and slowly push the rebel fighters into the mountains south of Grozny.
Colonel General Valery Manilov, seen as one of the main planners of the operation, said the fighting could be concluded by winter.
Military analysts questioned the wisdom of beginning a ground campaign so late in the year _ especially one that appears to have been hastily improvised.
``Military strategy says that you should never, ever, initiate a ground operation with winter approaching,'' said Alexander Zhilin, military analyst for the newspaper Moskovskiye Novosti.
``From a military point of view it makes no sense.
I am afraid that there are going to be massive casualties''.
Putin tried to play down the meaning of the Russian move into Chechnya, which Moscow sees as a part of Russia.
Since federal troops withdrew from the region in 1996, Chechnya has run its own affairs, although no country has acknowledged its claim to independence.
Putin and other Russian leaders now say that only by restoring control over the whole region can Russia prevent Chechnya from being a base for terrorist attacks.
``We have no border with Chechnya _ that is the Russian Federation and troop movements can take place there whenever necessary,'' Putin said.
``This is a very important question we must answer: Where do we want to create the security zone if we create one?
On our own territory?
And wait for them to come again to our villages. . . so that we would bomb our own people?
I don't think that's very useful''.
Putin, named by Yeltsin as the Kremlin's favored candidate in next year's presidential vote, has vowed to crush the rebels but avoid the mistakes of the last war.
Then, green Russian draftees were often thrown into battle situations where hardened Chechen guerrillas had nearly every advantage.
Federal warplanes and artillery bombed indiscriminately, turning even pro-Moscow Chechens into enemies.
The current campaign already shows similarities.
The Russian military says its warplanes are targeting rebel bases, but Chechnya's government accuses the Russians of indiscrimately hitting civilian targets.
The Chechens say 550 civilians have died in the raids, including 17 civilians Thursday.
Terrified civilians continue to pour out of Chechnya, and a line of vehicles stretched for miles outside of Grozny Thursday.
Already, 78,000 refugees have fled to Ingushetia, a tiny and impoverished Russian region west of Chechnya.
Some analysts said the Russian plan appears to be based on Putin's political goals, rather than military expediency.
``This is mass idiocy,'' said Pavel Felgenhauer, a Moscow-based defense analyst.
``I don't understand Russia's military strategy.
I am afraid that Russia is headed for a total military disaster.
I am really afraid.''
MOSCOW, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops continued aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions Friday in the breakaway republic of Chechnya as Moscow declared victory in the first stage of offensives against Islamic militants there.
Rebel command headquarters, bases and storage facilities near the villages of Zebir-yurt, Pervomaiskoye, Raduzhnoye and Dolinsky were targeted in the latest raids, the Interfax news agency reported, citing the press service of the Russian Defense Ministry.
In addition, a radio station of the Severny airport and a bridge near the village of Chishki were also destroyed, the press service said.
Federal troops "blocked off 23 villages in the Chechen districts of Shelkovsky, Naursky and Nadterechny," the service said.
The military campaign was launched following armed Chechen intrusions into the Daghestan republic and bomb blasts in four apartment buildings that killed some 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
Authorities believe Chechen rebels masterminded the terrorist attacks.
Viktor Kazantsev, the commander of federal troops in Chechnya, said Friday that the first stage of the counter-terrorist operation has been successfully completed and that federal troops have assumed control over one third of the Chechen territory.
"We created such circumstances that (militants) should expect us anywhere, any time.
This is what's happening now," he said.
The federal forces have fully seized the military initiative, Kazantsev said.
As the federal campaign against rebels continues, more refugees are flowing from Chechnya to other Russian regions nearby.
The Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations put the total number of Chechen refugees at over 156,000, Interfax said.
The situation is especially difficult in the tiny republic of Ingushetia where over 147,000 refugees are concentrated.
The Federal Migration Service says the number of refugees may eventually rise to 300,000.
Authorities are rushing tents, clothes, food, medicines and other humanitarian aid supplies to the refugees.
GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russia opened several border crossings today with Chechnya, officials said, allowing terrified refugees to flee Russian air and rocket attacks after they had been blocked from leaving for days.
Officials opened border crossings at Stavropol, to the north of Chechnya, and at Dagestan, to the east of the breakaway republic, Russian news reports said.
At a third border crossing in the west, three bus loads of refugees, including children and some injured people, crossed from Chechnya into the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia, which has already taken some 170,000 refugees.
But no other vehicles were let through, and a line of cars and trucks crammed with refugees stretched for several miles on the Chechen side.
It was not clear why the Ingush border was not fully open.
``We are ready to let the refugees pass, but it is necessary to keep order,'' Col.
Arkady Krimsky said.
He said the border would be opened to refugees for six days and border-crossers would undergo several document checks.
All borders were closed last week, trapping up to 20,000 refugees trying to flee Chechnya.
Only six miles away from the Ingushetia border crossing, Russian artillery today heavily shelled the Chechen town of Bamut.
The town has been a prime target for weeks.
Russian jets and artillery also targeted the Chechen capital Grozny and several villages to the south today.
Russia used Grad rocket launchers and howitzers to hit some targets, said Igor Melnikov, a spokesman with the Russian armed forces.
Russian jets bombed a spring overnight near the village of Chernorechiye, killing 10 civilians, said Ruslan Magomedov, an aide to Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov.
Magomedov said civilians had come to the spring for drinking water since supplies were cut shortly after the fighting began.
Up to 200,000 people are thought to have fled Chechnya since Russia began its offensive in September.
Chechen leaders claim some 3,600 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Russian attacks.
No independent confirmation is available, although medical workers have reported hundreds of civilian deaths.
Russian officials have said repeatedly that Chechen claims of civilian casualties are exaggerated.
Moscow has said it sent troops into Chechnya to crush the militants, who are also blamed for a series of deadly apartment explosions in September.
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said today that Russia did not intend to retake control of Chechnya by force, but wouldn't bargain with the militants either.
``We have no intention of conquering the republic and bringing its people to their knees,'' he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
Russia's goal is ``to destroy the terrorist stronghold in Chechnya and make (the republic's) revival possible''.
``We will never sit at a negotiating table with gangsters who have blood on their hands,'' Putin said.
Putin said Islamic militants, who twice invaded neighboring Dagestan from Chechnya this summer, were planning new attacks on chemical and nuclear power plants in Russia, as well as on Russia's transportation network.
Chechen Deputy Prime Minister Kazbek Makhashev said today that if Russia doesn't stop shelling Chechnya, the republic may be forced to launch ``retaliatory strikes'' in surrounding Russian regions.
Makhashev said he wasn't making a threat ``but a belated warning,'' according to Interfax.
GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russia's air force pumped up the pressure on breakaway Chechnya on Saturday, knocking local television and radio off the air and sending tens of thousands of civilians fleeing toward neighboring regions.
It was the third day of punishing airstrikes on the capital, Grozny.
Russia's air campaign had been focused on bombing suspected rebel bases, but now it is targeting economic installations and civilian communications facilities as well.
Warplanes bombed the republic's television station in Grozny on Friday and early Saturday and damaged the equipment beyond repair, Russian media reported.
Chechen officials said seven people were killed and 24 wounded in the overnight air raid on the television station, the Interfax news agency reported.
The Russian military says it is trying to prevent incursions of Islamic militants from Chechnya into neighboring Dagestan.
The militants, who want to establish an independent Islamic state in southern Russia, entered Dagestan and fought Russian forces in August and September.
They have been linked to terrorist bombings that have killed 300 people in Moscow and other Russian cities this month.
Saturday's airstrikes also knocked out a radio tower in the village of Goyskoye, 12 miles southwest of Grozny, Chechen officials said.
Interfax reported that Chechnya's cellular communications station was also destroyed, but that report was not officially confirmed.
The air raids took out Grozny's oil refinery on Friday, and energy officials told Interfax that all refinery operations had come to a standstill Saturday.
The refinery was burning out of control, said Bekhan Islamov, head of the Grozny fire department, and a thick pall of smoke hung over the city.
``There are no means to stop the fire,'' Islamov said.
As Russia has shifted its air attacks from outlying villages to Grozny, tens of thousands of civilians have tried to leave the republic.
An estimated 100,000 Chechens crowded the border crossing between Chechnya and the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia on Saturday.
The line of cars and trucks waiting at the border stretched for miles.
Russian border guards only occasionally opened the crossing.
Ingush authorities said some 20,000 Chechens had sought refuge there by Saturday -- most of them arriving by foot, crossing the border away from official checkpoints -- and that Ingushetia could not cope with the huge number.
``We are on the verge of a humanitarian disaster,'' said Akhmed Malsagov, the acting head of the Ingush government.
Russia's Air Force commander, Col.
Gen. Anatoly Kornukov, told reporters Saturday that Russian airstrikes beginning in early August had killed more than 2,000 militants and destroyed some 250 rebel strongholds and training centers in Chechnya and Dagestan.
Russia has put an estimated 13,000 troops along the breakaway republic's border with Dagestan.
The air raids and the concentration of Russian troops have fanned fears of a full-scale war in Chechnya.
Chechnya has run its own affairs since winning de facto independence in a war with Russia that ended in 1996.
But Moscow still claims it is a part of Russia and has struggled to keep violence from spreading to the rest of the Caucasus region.
Russian police have tried to seal the borders of Chechnya.
They detained two Russian converts to Islam who allegedly searched for sites for future terrorist bombings in Russia and were trying to re-enter Chechnya, Russian media reported Saturday.
The two admitted that they had been trained for sabotage at a camp run by Khattab, an Arab warlord based in Chechnya, the reports said.
They did not say when the men were detained.
Elsewhere, Georgian authorities denied Russian accusations that Chechen and Dagestani militants had used Georgian territory to cross into Chechnya.
MOSCOW, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Federal fighter jets continued their bombing raids over the breakaway republic of Chechnya Friday, hitting oil tanks, refineries and radio and television transmission facilities near Grozny, the regional capital, Russian medial reports said.
Air force commander Anatoly Kornukov said federal aircraft will strike at Chechen guerrillas wherever they may be.
"The actions of Russia's air force are in compliance with a program approved by the General Staff of the Russian armed forces," the Interfax news agency quoted Kornukov as saying.
"Our main task is to rule out the possibility of new provocations on the (Chechnya's) administrative border with Daghestan, Ingushetia, and the Stavropol and Krasnodar territories.
We must not allow aggression to repeat," he said.
Islamic militants from Chechnya launched two waves of assaults on Daghestan since August.
Federal troops drove out the rebels at both times.
The rebel incursions and several terrorist explosions that claimed the lives of more than 300 people in several major Russian cities, including Moscow, have steeled the authorities' resolve to deal heavy blows to the militants in Chechnya.
"Strikes were inflicted on several oil refineries to disrupt the separatists' oil supplies and hamper their maneuvers in and outside Chechnya," Kornukov said.
Federal aircraft destroyed an An-2 plane and a radar station near Grozny's airport on Thursday.
The station "controlled airspace over Chechnya and was a source of increased danger for federal aviation," Kornukov said.
"We are resolutely minded and will be fulfilling the tasks facing us until we eliminate the guerrillas," he said.
Meanwhile, Aslan Maskhadov, president of the Chechen republic, has urged Moscow to stop the bombing raids and go to the negotiating table.
"A pending catastrophe in the North Caucasus can be averted and thousands of Russians and Chechens can be saved if Russia's leadership consents to resolve problems at the negotiating table by political methods," Interfax quoted Maskhadov as saying Friday.
He said the intensified air strikes against Chechnya are "a waste of effort, means and time" and that "it will all boil down to negotiations anyway".
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who was visiting Kazakhstan, said the federal bomb attacks would be made solely on terrorist bases.
"We will be after them everywhere.
If we track them in a lavatory, forgive me for saying so, we will do them in there," Interfax quoted Putin as saying.
MOSCOW, March 31 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin today announced that Russian forces would halt their offensive in rebel Chechnya from midnight (2000 GMT) today and start a partial withdrawal from some areas, but warned that Chechen separatist fighters would be hit hard if they stage "terrorist" attacks.
Yeltsin said in a nationwide televised address that the federal forces will withdraw stage-by-stage from "peaceful areas" to the Chechen border areas.
The initiative, approved by the Russian Security Council on March 15, is intended to end the 15-month fighting in the mountainous region of Chechnya and boost Yeltsin's chances of re-election in June.
He also made clear that some Russian forces would stay in Chechnya and respond to any attacks from the rebels.
"Of course we will not tolerate terrorist actions.
Responses to them will be adequate.
The security of Russian citizens must be strictly maintained," he said.
Free and democratic elections of parliamentary members will be held in Chechnya, Yeltsin said in the speech.
He said the main problem remaining is the status of the rebel republic and stressed that Chechnya must stay within the Russian Federation.
Yeltsin offered to resume talks with the separatist fighters through intermediaries.
Negotiations broke down amid mutual recriminations last December after a shaky ceasefire collapsed.
"The main condition under which negotiations on the status in Chechnya could be started is normalizing the situation in the republic and establishing peace, calm and stability there," Yeltsin said.
Meanwhile, the president said Russia may grant amnesty to combatants of Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, but said it would exclude those who have committed grave war crimes.
Russia sent troops to the Caucasus region in December 1994 in a bid to crush the separatist drive led by Dudayev.
MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops Tuesday continued air and artillery attacks on rebel positions in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, destroying some rebel bases and a communications relay station, the Defense Ministry said.
Meanwhile, federal forces continued to prepare weapons and equipment for combat use and were taking measures to improve coordination between units, the Interfax news agency quoted the ministry's press service as saying.
The Defense Ministry believes that Chechen rebels intend to let federal troops into Chechnya and then launch "large-scale retribution actions" while staging subversive and terrorist acts in the three Russian border regions of Daghestan, Stavropol and Krasnodar.
It said 60 rebels, among them people speaking Russian, have formed a unit to carry out terrorist acts in Russia.
The rebels, avoiding direct clashes with federal troops, have resorted to "guerrilla tactics".
Russian federal troops have so far secured control of one- third of Chechnya, with law and order being restored in the retaken areas, the ministry said.
Interfax reported that on Tuesday Moscow's envoy to Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman, and representatives of the Chechen community and of the 1996 Chechen parliament arrived in Mozdok to set up local governing bodies.
Russia launched the massive assault on the rebels following two waves of armed incursions into Daghestan led by Chechen warlords Shamil Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian native known only by his last name.
The two have been accused of masterminding a series of terrorist explosions that killed about 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
In Grozny, capital city of the rebel province, a commander said Chechnya is ready to name the organizers of those terrorist acts and produce material and documented evidence to international organizations and the press, Interfax reported.
While urging Chechen authorities to hand over Basayev, Khattab and other suspected terrorists, Moscow has all along rejected any mediation from outside, saying the Chechen issue is its internal affair.
GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces pounded Chechen positions with an artillery barrage on several fronts today, and Russian authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to launch terrorist attacks.
Both the Russians and the Chechens have been fortifying fixed positions in recent days, but neither side has launched any major offensives.
The Russians have been relying mostly on their big artillery guns.
They were hammering two areas north of Chechnya's capital, Grozny, this morning.
The echo of the exploding shells could be heard throughout the city.
The Russians were also methodically shelling near the western town of Bamut, which has been under attack for several days.
The Russian Defense Ministry cited five regions in central, eastern and western Chechnya that were hit in artillery and air raids in the previous 24 hours.
The shelling was the latest development in a conflict that began this summer, when Chechnya-based Islamic militants invaded neighboring Dagestan twice with the aim of setting up an Islamic state.
They also are suspected in four Russian apartment bombings in September that killed about 300 people.
Russia responded to the attacks by sending troops into Chechnya two weeks ago, raising fears of another all-out war there.
During the first conflict in 1994-96, Chechnya fought Russian troops to a humiliating standstill.
It won effective independence for itself, but was left devastated and lawless.
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said today that the Russian aim of establishing a security zone in Chechnya ``is close to completion''.
``The ultimate objective is not only to form the security zone, but to destroy armed gangs,'' he said while on a visit to Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported.
Government forces ``will not stop, but will carry on tasks to eliminate gangs and terrorist groups''.
Although Russian troops have held off mounting a ground attack on the capital, Russia has shown little inclination to negotiate an end to the fighting.
For now, the front line is largely defined by the Terek River, which flows across the northern third of Chechnya, forming a natural defense barrier.
The Russians control the sparsely populated plains to the north of the river, though the Chechens still hold a few positions.
The Chechens have most of the territory in the more heavily populated regions south of the river, though the Russians have made inroads in western Chechnya and have been massing forces along Chechnya's eastern border.
The Defense Ministry said that two of Chechnya's most prominent warlords, Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev, were both planning terrorist attacks inside Russia.
Raduyev intended to target Russian nuclear facilities, while Basayev was training women militants to carry out attacks in southern Russia, the ministry claimed, without citing any evidence.
More than 155,000 Chechens have fled since the fighting began, with most heading to Ingushetia, an impoverished region on Chechnya's western border.
Humanitarian aid has been slow in arriving, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Moscow said the next convoy of assistance was being delayed due to ``the very slow distribution of aid already delivered,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
The Emergency Situations Ministry said it was flying 52 tons of baby food, canned meat, sugar and other supplies into the region on Tuesday.
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels have been shooting at Russian federal military and police posts in Chechnya and at local polling stations set up for Sunday's presidential elections, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
On Friday, seven guerrillas attacked an Interior Ministry forces post in the Chechen capital Grozny, using rifles and grenade launchers, Interfax quoted military sources as saying.
There were no casualties among the Russians.
According to an unconfirmed report, a military post in the Argun district came under fire on Saturday, Interfax said.
"The clash went on for quite a long time," a military source was quoted as saying.
Another unconfirmed report said a Chechen vehicle had tried to break into Chechnya's second largest city, Gudermes.
The governor of the Russian-controlled Nadterechnaya district said Russian security and police forces carried out a special operation on Saturday and detained 11 suspects.
The governor, Akhmed Zavgayev, told Interfax he could not confirm a report that a bomb had been found in Znamenskoye, a district center.
Russian federal troops beefed up security in the breakaway republic in the run-up to Sunday's elections.
A travel ban was imposed from Friday through Monday to ward off possible rebel threats to stage terrorist attacks and sabotage.
The checking regime has been tightened; the protection of ballot stations strengthened and block stations at the entrances to villages reinforced, Interfax quoted military headquarters in the North Caucasus as saying on Friday.
Some 460,000 registered voters are expected to cast their ballots in 340 polling stations in 12 of Chechnya's districts.
Moscow launched a massive anti-terrorist military campaign in Chechnya in August last year after separatists invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan and allegedly carried out a series of apartment blasts in Moscow and two other Russian cities which claimed over 300 lives.
MOSCOW, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia vowed Thursday to pursue the mopping-up operation in the volatile republic of Chechnya to an end and destroy all Chechen rebels refusing to lay down their weapons.
Russia's anti-terrorist operation in the North Caucasus "will be carried out to the end, and the hotbed of international terrorism will be wiped out.
Normal, peaceful life for this part of the Russian population... will be restored," Col.
Gen. Valery Manilov, deputy chief of Russia's general staff, told a news conference in Moscow Thursday, hours after President Vladimir Putin reprimanded officials for lax security in the war-torn region.
"There will be no parallels with the 1994-1996 Chechen war, there will be no repeat of that tragedy," Manilov said.
He noted that the most recent terrorist bomb attacks in a number of Chechen communities did not produce the results expected by their organizers.
The general said certain responsible individuals will be brought to court for not providing proper security, making the terrorist acts possible and leading to many deaths.
Putin had earlier made an unscheduled stop on his way back from a summit in Central Asia to hold late night talks Wednesday at a military base in Mozdok, just outside Chechnya.
The president issued televised warnings to contrite-looking officials and ministers who took turns to stand up as he spoke to them from behind a desk about the need to tighten security.
Manilov said there were fewer than 2,000 bandits remaining in parts of Chechnya's southern mountains not held by Moscow.
They used nighttime attacks to give the appearance that they exist throughout the war-ravaged republic.
Meanwhile, security measures have been indefinitely tightened up in some key Chechen cities and districts, such as in Chechnya's temporary capital city of Gudermes, Argun and the district center of Shali, 40 kilometers south of Grozny, he said.

MOSCOW, July 5 (Xinhua) -- By Wednesday, Russia have detained more than 200 people in Chechnya and its neighboring republic of Dagestan on suspicions of involving in the terrorist blasts Sunday night, which caused over 100 person casualties to Russian troops.
About 50 persons have been detained in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, eight of whom may have taken part in the suicide bombing in the city of Argun, 10 kilometers southeast of the Chechen capital of Grozny, Russian presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky on Chechnya told an interview in Moscow Wednesday.
He confirmed that the federal forces had possessed information that rebels were preparing more terrorist attacks.
Meanwhile, 168 Chechens were detained in a large-scale police operation in the town of Khasavyurt in Dagestan Tuesday, the Interfax news agency cited the Dagestani Interior Ministry press service as saying Wednesday.
The center said the suspects' identities and affiliation with rebel units are being verified.
Yastrzhembsky said he does not expect any end to federal operations in Chechnya in one or two months, since "the long survival and resistance of the bands' leaders exert a moral, psychological and political influence on part of the Chechen population".
"As long as those men, such as Basayev, Khattab, Barayev, remain at large, we can expect a stealthy attack at any time," he said, adding that neutralizing these men is the main purpose of the current federal special operations.
According to the military's data, the rebels continue to recruit replacements from local populations and still have some 1, 500-2000 fighters, said Yastrzhembsky.
MOSCOW, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia imposed a curfew in Chechnya Tuesday night and is conducting a full-scale manhunt throughout the breakaway republic after several terrorist blasts shocking the country Sunday night.
All the federal units stationed in Chechnya have been put on red alert.
Additional checkpoints have been set up and control over motor transport has been intensified, as rebels conducted suicide attacks by using trucks filled with explosives, Interfax cited the headquarters of Russian forces in the North Caucasus as saying Tuesday.
Meanwhile, about 30 people have been detained in Chechnya on the suspicion of involving in the terrorist act in Argun, which killed more than 20 Russian servicemen, Itar-Tass quoted Russian prosecutor in Chechnya Vladimir Kravchenko as saying Tuesday.
"Sufficient evidence has been collected against some of the suspects," he said.
"After the names of those who carried out the terrorist acts are established, the organizers of the crime will be found," he said.
He believed that the terrorist acts were organized by the same well-known rebel warlords -- Khattab, Basayev and others.
The curfew will be tightened up on the whole territory of the roily republic from 21:00 to 7:00.
Residents were warned not to go out and motor transport is prohibited during curfew.
"Moving cars will be fired at without any warning," the headquarters said in an announcement.
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said Sunday that federal troops would try to avoid unnecessary loss of life in its campaign to root out Islamic gunmen from the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
"We will not undertake the tactics of a large-scale military action with tank attacks and the storming of towns,'' Putin told RTR state television.
Despite reports of fire exchanges near the village of Bamut, about 70 kilometers southwest of Grozny, the Chechen capital, Russian authorities have kept tight-lipped about the clashes.
Military officials denied their troops had moved any closer to Grozny.
They also declined to comment on an Interfax news agency report that troops had bombed a cement plant 25 kilometers south of Grozny.
At the completion of the first stage of its campaign against Chechen rebels, federal forces have now taken control a third of Chechnya, mostly low-lying areas north of the Terek River.
They have also secured key points in western and eastern parts of Chechnya in their drive to form a "security zone" around the rebel republic.
Speaking in the southern Russian town of Vladikavkaz, Viktor Kazantsev, commander of Russian forces in North Caucasus region that includes Chechnya, said there was no order to take Grozny.
Russian leaders have not ruled out storming the capital, although they say they want to avoid a repeat of the ill-fated war in 1994-96 in which tens of thousands were killed.
Kazantsev said the Interior Ministry is to play the key role in the second phase of the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya, Interfax reported.
He said that the federal grouping "has not carried out a single strike against peaceful villages".
Rather, the rebels carried out strikes on villages for provocative purposes, picturing them as federal strikes.
"All of these cases are being tackled by the military prosecutor's office," Kazantsev said.
Kazantsev said he believed talks with Chechnya's relatively moderate leader Aslan Maskhadov were possible, but not in the coming days.
Maskhadov has repeatedly called for talks with Moscow, but Putin says he must first hand over guerrilla leaders like Shamil Basayev and Arab-born Khattab.
Putin blames the fighters for a series of terrorist bomb blasts in Russia that killed some 300 people.
As they suffer major losses following the federal offensive, Chechen rebels are planning more terrorist acts in Russia, Interfax quoted the Interior Ministry and the Federal Security Service as saying Sunday in a communique.
The document said that the Russian law-enforcement bodies "are taking every measure to prevent such terrorist operations".
In Grozny, Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov claimed Sunday that the Russian military conceal their losses in Chechnya.
He told a news conference that more than 1,500 soldiers and officers had been killed, four planes and 10 helicopters had been downed, and 62 armored vehicles had been put out of action so far, Interfax reported.
The Chechen side only lost 32 men, Maskhadov said.
Russian commanders claim that the Chechen rebels' casualties, by most conservative estimates, are at least 1,500.
Moscow has denied such claims and Colonel General Ilya Panin, chief of the Defense Ministry's Main Personnel Department, said that since the start of fighting on the territory of Chechnya, federal forces have lost 47 servicemen.
MOSCOW, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces continued air raids on rebel positions in Chechnya Wednesday as restrictions were imposed in the breakaway republic to prevent rebel attacks during the May holidays.
Su-24 assault planes and Su-24 bombers flew 10 sorties over the past 24 hours, targeting mountain trails in southern Chechnya to block rebel routes and rebel positions in mountain forests in the south and southeast regions.
Meanwhile, Mi-24 helicopter gunships took off 30 times to provide air support for ground troops.
Amid mounting incidence of rebel attacks, the federal command has restricted the movement of citizens across the republic during the May holidays to prevent subversive and terrorist acts, Interfax reported.
The movement of motor columns has been banned from May 1 to 11, the headquarters of the combined federal grouping said.
The situation in Chechnya remains complicated and federal checkpoints have come under attacks for five to eight times over the past 24 hours.
"The rebels operate in mobile groups consisting of five to 15 members, and carry out sorties to populated areas and to the flatland," Interfax quoted the headquarters as saying.
In another development, three policemen were killed Tuesday when their car came under fire on the Argun-Kizlyar motorway.
The three were sent to Chechnya from Novorossiisk, Interfax said, quoting the Interior Ministry's Department for Chechnya.
MOSCOW, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The Russian combined federal force in the breakaway republic of Chechnya has seen 25 people killed and 74 wounded in the past week, a top defense official said Thursday.
The casualties included eight Defense Ministry servicemen and 17 policemen from the Interior Ministry, according to Col.
General Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the General Staff.
As of July 20, the federal troops have lost 2,518 killed with 7, 956 wounded since the start of the anti-terrorist operation in the North Caucasus on August 2, 1999, the Interfax news agency reported.
In the course of the combat actions in Chechnya that began on October 1, 1999, the federal force have registered 2,240 people killed and 6,372 wounded.
Amid reports of mounting attacks on federal positions, Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo and Chechnya's civil administration chief Akhmad Kadyrov have agreed to increase the number of Interior servicemen from 1,900 to 8,000 in the near future, Interfax reported.
"This is a necessary measure," said Col.
General Ivan Golubev, Russian deputy interior minister and commander of the Interior Ministry's force in the North Caucasus.
MOSCOW, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov said Friday the government is tightening security on the border with Chechnya, to guard against possible terrorist attacks.
Kulikov told Interfax news agency that the interior ministry had put important targets under heavy guard in light of statements from the rebel commanders that they would continue the war against Moscow.
He said the eastern border would be closed to bandits but the ministry would not send more troops to reinforce the region.
Chechen rebel commanders, Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev, Thursday threatened to attack Russian targets.
They said they would launch terrorist activities, involving 5,000 people, against Russia until Moscow recognized the independence of Chechnya.
The Chechen interior ministry has set up a special department to investigate kidnappings, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Friday.
Newly elected President of Chechnya, Aslan Maskhadov, ordered that kidnappers be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.
Armed Chechen rebels have detained hundreds of Russian hostages in return for heavy ransoms or the release of imprisoned Chechen criminals.
MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia began military exercises in the Caucasus region on Monday in an effort to ease increasing violence in its restive southern republics of Chechnya and Dagestan, a news agency reported.
The exercises follow President Boris Yeltsin's recent overtures of support for Chechnya's government and his decision to have Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko resume negotiations with the president of the secessionist republic.
The military maneuvers, which run until Friday, are designed to tighten coordination between various forces to fight terrorist attacks, free hostages, and combat smuggling _ exactly the sort of incidents on the rise in Russia's fringe republics.
``Measures aiming to maintain law and public order in the region should be comprehensive and carried out according to a single plan,'' said Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
Stepashin said the exercises ``do not mean that somebody is preparing for some massive combat action''.
Chechnya and Dagestan have been plagued by a rise in kidnappings, killings, and theft.
Maskhadov, who declared a state of emergency in Chechnya last month, narrowly escaped a car bomb on Thursday that killed two of his bodyguards.
Forces taking part in the exercises include the Interior Ministry, the Border Guard Service, the Federal Security Service, and troops stationed around Stavropol, 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) south of Moscow.
Yeltsin ordered Kiriyenko to meet this week with Maskhadov to demonstrate support for his government, even though the Chechen president led a 1994-96 war for independence from Russia that ended in political deadlock.
``The simple fact of this meeting is very important,'' Ivan Rybkin, Russia's top negotiator with the Chechens, told the Interfax news agency.
``After a long break, negotiations between Moscow and Grozny will occur at a high level.
In that period, many bitter problems have accumulated that can be destroyed only by the leaders of Russia and Chechnya''.
Four top Russian politicians demanded on Monday that Russia clarify its stance on Chechnya in light of increased violence in the region, including the hostage-taking of Russia's presidential envoy to Chechnya, Valentin Vlasov, almost three months ago.
Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, former national security chief Alexander Lebed, Tatarstan region President Mintimer Shaimiyev and Boris Berezovsky, executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent States, demanded in a statement that the Russian government ``immediately formulate a position on the Chechen republic and the North Caucuses...
and consistently implement it,'' news agencies said.
Though Maskhadov said he favored new negotiations, he blamed Russia for Chechnya's present situation.
Maskhadov also ruled out any compromise on the republic's independence, repeating that Chechnya would never sign a document ``which might limit Chechnya's independence even by one percent,'' he told the Interfax news agency.
Six people have been arrested so far in connection with the car bomb attack on Maskhadov, but by Monday afternoon three were released, the Interfax news agency said.
One of the people being held is an elderly man whose apartment was used by gunmen during the attack, Interfax said. (nw/mr/ls)
MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The latest report shows that the casualties of the Russian joint troops in Chechnya in a series of terrorist blasts made by Chechen rebels Sunday night have reached over 100, said the Russian Interior Ministry on Monday.
Up till now, 38 soldiers were killed, 76 wounded and 25 missing in the blasts, the Itar-Tass quoted the ministry's interior agency in the troubled republic as saying.
At least 31 people died in a military hostel explosion in the city of Argun overnight.
Rescuers have recovered 26 bodies of the Russian special policemen (OMON units) from the rubble of the police dormitory Monday afternoon, said the agency.
The blast in Argun also killed three civilians who were staying near the building.
Now ruins-clearing work is still underway and more corpses will be found, it said.
Chechen rebels have staged a fresh wave of terrorists acts since Russian troops launched a large-scale mopping-up campaign against the militants in late June, especially after federal units annihilated a 200-250 strong gang of Arab mercenaries near central Chechen village of Serzhen-Yurt last week.
Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky told journalists Monday that separatists had become more active in the turbulent republic and the number of terrorist acts had considerably risen.
He noted that 100-more militants had been recently killed in a five-day battle near Serzhen-Yurt, where the rebels had been rallying to deal strikes at Argun and the second largest Chechen city of Gudermes.
The terrorists aim to make strikes at important populated localities in Chechnya in a bid to show their combat potential, and they also planned to kill some prominent representatives of the federal authorities and military command, said the Kremlin senior official.
He believes that the terrorist acts are also designed to intimidate the Chechen population and to challenge the newly appointed head of interim federal administration in Chechnya, Akhmad Kadyrov.
Moscow says it has eliminated most rebels in Chechnya after a nine-month bloody war and now it is fighting remnant terrorists, responsible for a series of bomb blasts in the capital and other Russian cities among other acts of violence.
The rebels have vowed to fight a guerrilla-style war against the Russians and have launched an increasing number of hit-and-run attacks -- a tactic which helped drive Russian troops from the province in the 1994-1996 Chechen war.
In recent weeks, Russian forces have suffered increasing losses from rebel ambushes and booby traps planted on highways.
Russian official figures put total federal losses at more than 2,300 since troops repelled an incursion by Chechen rebels into the neighboring republic of Dagestan last August, ahead of the full-scale military campaign.
In early June, Kremlin said that despite decades of thousands of rebels were wiped out, there were still 2,000-2,500 remnants staying in Chechnya and engaged in guerrilla warfare, ambushes and terrorist acts.
MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels committed five terrorist blasts in several key cities of the war-torn republic Sunday night, killing at least 36 Russian servicemen and wounding 74, Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky announced.
According to Interfax, Russian federal forces have blocked roads leading to the city of Argun and prepared for a "mopping up" operation after a violent apartment bloc explosion by the terrorists killed at least 25 and wounded 81 there overnight.
Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the Chechen separatists, issued Monday a tough statement to Russian authorities and the military, but Yastrzhembsky said it's "nothing new".
Maskhadov demands that "airstrikes and artillery attacks be stopped," and that "the troops subsequently be completely withdrawn from Chechnya" and "the military commanders, who have been directing operations in Chechnya, be put on international trial".
The separatist leader also said that if the Russian authorities present evidence showing that Chechen people have something to do with the bombings of apartment houses in Moscow, Volgodonsk, and Buynaksk, he is prepared to hand over the suspects to the courts " under the control of international organizations".
Maskhadov's address does not contain anything new, Yastrzhembsky reiterated.
"I can only repeat that any negotiations with Maskhadov are possible only on the issues of surrender and stopping resistance."
MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary reports indicate that 36 Russian servicemen were killed and another 74 injured in five terrorist attacks in Chechnya on Sunday, Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky announced here Monday.
All the attacks "had one and the same signature, one and the same scheme, with heavy 'Ural' trucks and suicide bomber drivers," he said.
All were targeted at military commandant buildings, Russian forces positions, "landmark houses on territory of Chechnya".
Three explosions hit Gudermes, the fourth in Urus-Martan while Argun saw the worst attack, Yastrzhembsky said.
There was no final information as to the death toll available as of 12:30 p.m., Moscow time (0930 GMT) Monday.
Rescue work continues, and the picture may become clear by the end of the day, he said.
Yastrzhembsky refused to confirm the report of the Chechen prosecutors about the death of 50 people in Argun.
MOSCOW, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and 18 others injured in a bus explosion near the Chechen village of Dzhaglarbi on Friday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
The blast occurred at 9:35 a.m.
Moscow time (0535 GMT) when an apparently radio-controlled land mine went off on the bus full of passengers, Tass quoted a Russian government representative in Chechnya as saying.
The wounded have been sent to local hospitals while the bodies of the dead have been taken to the village of Kurchalloi.
The official said rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya planned such blasts against armored personnel carriers of federal troops.
Also on Friday, assailants bombed a federal police car, wounding two officers sent to Chechnya from Kirov.
The Russian military said two men who bombed a Gudermes-Kadi- Yurt train and four people suspected of killing police officers in the Shelkovskaya district earlier in May have been caught.
Meanwhile, it warned of more possible terrorist attacks by Chechen rebels, saying that the rebels have changed their tactics and are planning a series of bombing operations in the republic.
MOSCOW, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia plans to end its anti- terrorist operations in the breakaway republic of Chechnya by the end of February next year, said a top Russian military official Wednesday.
It will "take another two to three months" to eliminate the militants in Chechnya, said General Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff, at a meeting with foreign military attaches at the General Staff Academy.
He said about 12,000 to 15,000 militants have remained in Chechnya, including some 2000 terrorists and bandits backed by foreign extremists, adding that "this terrorist army will have to be eliminated unless the bandits surrender and lay down their arms.
" Manilov said the federal troops would liberate Grozny, capital of Chechnya, and he promised that "no massive attacks or storming of Grozny will be launched while even one civilian remains".
Now the Russian troops control over 60 percent of Chechnya's territory in which about 90 percent of the Chechen population were living.
"A total of 120 Chechen villages have been cleared of militant formations.
Particularly the flat territory of Chechnya has been completely freed of bandits and terrorists," Manilov said.
The militants are fortifying their positions in sparsely populated mountainous and semi-mountainous areas, he said.
Earlier, the Russian troops freed the second biggest Chechen city of Gudermes and three other key Chechen towns of Argun, Urus- Martan and Shali, completing the surrounding of Grozny.
Russia began its military operations in Chechnya in late September after Chechen rebels' armed incursions into the neighboring republic of Dagestan and a spate of apartment building blasts that claimed over 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
The Russian authorities blamed Chechen extremists for planning and carrying out terrorist acts.
NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I.
_ The EgyptAir flight that crashed on Oct.
31 went into an extreme dive, making the passengers weightless and pitching the nose down at a 40-degree angle, before the nose pulled back up and subjected the plane and its passengers to two and a half times the normal force of gravity, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday night.
Experts said many of the details released Friday might reflect an airplane that was in an emergency, but still under control.
But the chairman, James E.
Hall, said that the information from the flight data recorder also showed that both engines had been switched off from the cockpit.
Pilots experienced with the Boeing 767, the type of plane that crashed, said they could not understand why the engines had been turned off, with the information now in hand.
Hall also said that the elevators, the adjustable surfaces on the horizontal tail that are used to raise or lower the nose, moved to uneven positions.
It is not possible for the crew to command such a movement on the 767, according to pilots, and the fact that the elevators moved out of unison indicates a major malfunction.
But it was not clear from the information released so far whether this was a cause of the accident or a malfunction along the way.
The crash, about 60 miles from Nantucket, Mass.
, killed all 217 people on board.
Other than a small quantity of debris and human remains, searchers have not recovered anything except one of the two ``black boxes,'' the flight data recorder, which they are still analyzing.
``Obviously, these data raise many questions,'' Hall said.
``I can assure you they have raised questions in the minds of the NTSB and the investigators.
We cannot at this time explain the circumstances that were occurring on Flight 990 that resulted in the flight profile I have just described, and we will not attempt to speculate about it''.
But, he added, the second ``black box,'' the cockpit voice recorder, might explain the circumstances.
The Navy believes it has located that device on the sea floor, within a pile of wreckage from the plane, but a robot submarine was still trying to retrieve it Friday.
For law enforcement authorities, Friday's information raised questions that deepened the mystery of EgyptAir even as it yielded few clues to guide the inquiry into whether anyone might intentionally have interfered with the flight or tried to bring down the aircraft.
The officials said that in the course of their investigation they had examined the recent activities, background, medical history and emotional stability of the crew members and passengers.
But so far, the officials said, those inquiries had not provided useful information.
Overall, the officials said that while the FBI inquiry was far from over, investigators were faced with dwindling leads and, increasingly frustrated over their inability to help explain the crash, were anxiously awaiting recovery of the cockpit voice recorder.

WASHINGTON _ Saying that the EgyptAir crash may never be fully understood from the black boxes and the wreckage, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday evening that all planes should have cockpit video recorders, and that the power switches for the cameras, as well as the voice and data recorders, should be moved to where the crews cannot reach them.
The board voted unanimously to recommend to the Federal Aviation Administration that recorders holding two hours of video be required in all new planes beginning in 2003, and be installed in older planes by 2005.
It said the planes should have enough cameras in each cockpit to see all the cockpit screens and other displays, and all actions by the crews in working the controls Pilot unions oppose cameras as a violation of their workplace privacy.
The Safety Board said, though, that it would treat the video images just as it treats the cockpit voice recorder tapes, playing them only for investigators.
The board cited several crashes where cockpit images would have been helpful, including two brought down by smoke or fire, Valujet 592, a DC-9 that crashed in the Everglades on May 11, 1996, and Swissair Flight 111, an MD-11 that crashed off Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Sept.
2, 1998.
But in Egyptair 990, which crashed on Oct.
31, 1999, as the board delicately put it, ``questions still remain as to the exact environment in the cockpit prior to the upset''.
Publicly, the board has said only that investigators believe that the crash may have been a deliberate act, but its own investigators, and those of other Federal agencies, believe that the plunge from an uneventful cruise fight, which killed all 217 people aboard the Boeing 767, may have been a suicide by the relief co-pilot.
WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the United States is taking over the investigation of the crash of EgyptAir 990 from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), officials said Tuesday.
Investigators doubt that the plane crash, which resulted in the death of all 217 aboard, may have been caused by a criminal act.
Preliminary investigation found that someone in the cockpit uttered a prayer before the jet's autopilot disengaged and the plane started its fatal plunge.
Under the U.S. rules, the NTSB is in charge of the investigation of air transportation accidents while the FBI has jurisdiction over destruction of an aircraft and crimes committed aboard an aircraft.
If investigators conclude the plane was brought down by foul play, they will try to determine whether the perpetrator was assisted by a terrorist group in a suicide plot or acted alone because of a personal problem, the source close to the probe said.
The Cairo-bound passenger plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the Massachusettes coast 40 minutes after takeoff from the Kennedy International Airport in New York on October 31.
The cockpit voice recorder was recovered from the ocean floor by a remote-operated robot Saturday after a two-week search.
Speculation about a possible hijacking, crew fight or pilot suicide has lingered because the flight data recorder shows that the plane's autopilot was turned off, the aircraft put into a dive, the throttles cut back and the engines shut off.
NEWPORT NAVAL STATION, R.I.
_ A submarine operated by remote control retrieved a flight data recorder from the depths of the ocean south of Nantucket on Tuesday, bringing to the surface a crucial piece of evidence that investigators hope will reveal why EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the sea.
The container that held the recorder, known as a black box, showed signs of damage when it was recovered, but the flight recorder inside seemed to have survived the jetliner's catastrophic impact and nine days of submersion in salt water, investigators said.
``The magnetic tape was removed from its protective casing, cleaned and dried,'' James E.
Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said Tuesday night after investigators in Washington began evaluating the recorder's condition.
``The tape has data on it, and NTSB engineers are currently working to extract information''.
The recovery of the box, and the condition of its contents, appears to have provided the first breaks in what has been a frustrating case.
For much of the past week, investigators and mourning families have waited as foul weather and winds caused delays in the search for the recorders.
Preliminary radar data has shown that the plane fell precipitously, and three lobstermen reported hearing a strange rumble where the plane slammed into the ocean's surface.
But until the recovery of the data recorder on Tuesday, virtually no other information had been available.
EgyptAir's pilots reported no trouble over their radios before or during the dive, and the wreckage recovered to date has revealed little more than that the great airplane _ a Boeing 767 with a wingspan of 156 feet and a length of 176 feet _ was reduced to bits when it struck the sea.
The crash killed all 217 passengers and crewmen.
Hall said the retrieval of the first recorder _ another, the cockpit voice recorder, remains missing on the sea floor _ could provide key insights into the crash.
``In any investigation, the most important information comes from the recorders,'' Hall said.
``They can save several steps in the investigatory process''.
The cockpit voice recorder is designed to preserve conversations among the pilots and ambient sound in the cockpit, including the noise from plane alarms, its two engines, or any obvious mechanical problems.
The flight data recorder is designed to record more than 150 categories of information that shows how the plane was flying, how the pilots were handling it and how the aircraft's systems were operating.
Hall said he hopes the recorder ``will paint a picture of what this airplane was doing in its last minutes, and seconds, before this tragedy occurred''.
The black box was discovered before dawn in 245 feet of water by the Deep Drone, a robot submarine that was deployed and controlled from the Grapple, a Navy salvage ship.
The Deep Drone had resumed searching after a more capable robot, known as Magnum and deployed from the submarine support vessel Carolyn Chouest, damaged its fiber optic cable on undersea wreckage.
Within hours of lifting the black box aboard the Grapple, the Navy flew it by helicopter to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, where it was transferred to Washington.
Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who are treating all debris recovered from the aircraft as potential criminal evidence even though the investigation has turned up no indication that the plane was brought down by a crime or terrorism, accompanied the recorder on its trip.
The Navy, working in moderate seas of 5 to 7 feet, planned to continue searching for the remaining black box through the night and into Wednesday morning.
Retrieving the second recorder is important because in some past jetliner accidents, information from the two flight recorders, together, has provided a level of detail that has enabled investigators to pinpoint causes.
For example, when an Aeroperu Boeing 757 crashed soon after takeoff from Lima in 1996, the cockpit voice recorder captured the desperate conversation of the two pilots.
``Everything has gone, all the instruments went to (expletive),'' the captain said, as the plane dropped into the Pacific.
The flight data recorder later revealed that the instrumentation problem was with three small vents on the side of the plane, known as static ports, which are used to measure air pressure and determine air speed.
The static ports are crucial because speed cannot be determined visually from a jet flying at high altitude at night, and if a plane flies too fast or too slow, it will crash.
Investigators, zeroing in on the static ports after reviewing the two flight recorders, eventually found that maintenance workers had covered the 757's static ports with protective masking tape when they washed the plane, and had neglected to remove it _ an oversight that meant the pilots could not read their airspeed from the instruments and flew the plane to its doom.
In some cases, however, flight recorders have proved insufficient.
In the crash of SwissAir Flight 111 off the coast of Nova Scotia last year, the recorders have provided no insight into the source of smoke in the cockpit that the pilots described to air traffic controllers on the ground.
WASHINGTON _ Investigators, aided by several Arabic interpreters, pored over the cockpit voice recorder of EgyptAir Flight 990 Monday to try to determine whether a criminal act caused the plane to crash two weeks ago killing all 217 people on board.
``We are concentrating our efforts on determining from the evidence whether this investigation is to remain under the leadership of the National Transportation Safety Board,'' James E.
Hall, the board's chairman, said in a briefing here.
A high-ranking government source said Monday that Hall and FBI director Louis Freeh had been talking with White House officials in recent days about which agency should head the investigation.
The NTSB would remain the lead agency in the investigation if the cause of the Oct.
31 crash of the Boeing 767-300ER is found to be mechanical or pilot error.
But if a criminal act _ either terrorism or a willful decision by one or more members of the flight crew _ brought down the plane then the FBI would take over.
The source said a decision on whether the FBI should assume control of the investigation could come within days.
The crash, which occurred about 60 miles south of Nantucket, has quickly become one of the most mysterious accidents in aviation history.
Everything seemed normal 30 minutes into the flight from New York's John F.
Kennedy International Airport to Cairo when the plane's autopilot was switched off and it suddenly went into a ``controlled descent'': a controlled steep dive from 33,000 feet to about 16,700 feet.
At that point electrical power to the plane apparently ceased because the transponder, which sends information to radar, and the flight data recorder, which monitors some 155 functions as well as the plane's performace, stopped working.
The plane's two engines _ the source of much of the electrical power on board the aircraft _ were turned off from the cockpit shutdown, a scenario that puzzled commercial airline pilots and aviation specialists.
When this type of aircraft is in flight it can continue to generate electricity even if the engines stop working, said a veteran Boeing 767 pilot, who said he was mystified as to a possible cause.
After descending to 16,700 feet, the plane climbed to about 24,000 feet then went into a final dive and started breaking up before slamming into the Altantic Ocean.
Despite the puzzling final minutes of the flight and the lack of any clear-cut cause emerging from the first analyses of the two black boxes _ the flight data and cockpit voice recorders _ Hall was optimistic that the cause would eventually be pinpointed.
``Because of the quality of the cockpit voice recorder and extensive information on the flight data recorder, I am confident many of the questions that we have, that you have and that the world has, will be answered,'' Hall said.
He said the cockpit voice recorder is ``almost entirely in a foreign language'' and the NTSB has added translators to assist in interpreting the phrases, noise, even the grunts from crew members as the plane went on a terrifying roller coaster ride.
``As painstaking a process as it is to read out cockpit voice recorders, this one is made more difficult,'' Hall said.
Because investigators were translating the conversations and synchronizing information on the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder to help determine a possible cause, Hall said he was ``not prepared to answer questions on the contents of the cockpit voice recorder''.
One aviation specialist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the NTSB _ which was asked by the Egyptian government shortly after the crash to overseee the investigation _ is likely under pressure not to blame the airline or its employees.
``The only things that I can think of at this point are a criminal act or massive flight crew error,'' the specialist said.
``And this crew was the best that EgyptAir has.
I am sure the airline does not want to hear that it was a massive error on their part''.
Another aviation specialist, familiar with major accident investigations, agreed, saying Hall's comment about which agency should lead the inquiry ``was a politically required statement''.
Some investigators are expected to visit Boeing headquarters in Seattle this week to use information from the flight data recorder on Boeing's 767 simulator to try to find out what happened on board the 10-year-old airplane.
On Sunday, Hall said he would meet with Navy officials and family members this week to discuss how to proceed with the recovery of the remains of crash victims and wreckage from the plane.
Hall, who knew two people who perished in the 1996 ValuJet crash in the Florida Everglades, said he has advised relatives of Flight 990's victims to be prepared for the news that no remains would ever be found.
``That is something that may or may not happen, but they need to be aware of my previous experience in an accident of this force and magnitude,'' Hall said.
Meanwhile, a Rhode Island judge Monday cleared the way for death certificates to be issued to relatives of those who died in the crash.
The certificates will state that each victim is presumed dead, even if their remains have not been found and identified.

CAIRO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of Egyptian aviation officials and experts, and family members of the Egyptian victims of an EgyptAir plane crash flew Tuesday to the United States.
The delegation, led by EgyptAir Chairman Mohamed Fahim Rayan, included representatives of the Egyptian national carrier and the Civil Aviation Authority, the country's Middle East News Agency reported.
Aboard the same plane were 73 family members of the Egyptian victims of the EgyptAir flight 990, a Boeing 767, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the northeastern coast of the U.S. shortly after taking off from John F.
Kennedy International Airport on the way to Cairo early Sunday.
The 217 people on board, including 15 crew members and 62 Egyptian passengers, are all feared dead.
The Egyptian family members will later fly from Yew York to the Rhode Island to identify the bodies of their kins provided that they are recovered from the sea, the news agency said.
The rescue operations for survivors black box and debris within the next 15 hours, said the chairman.
The Egyptian officials and experts, who will follow up the U.S. investigations, carries files pertaining to the history of the Boeing 767 ever since its purchase in 1989 and its maintenance records, Rayan said.
He expected the investigations to take time, pending the recovery of various parts of the plane, reassembly of them and the determination of the cause of the crash.
So far, Egyptian and U.S. leaders and officials have ruled out the possibility that a terrorist act led to the tragedy.
But they, however, also cautioned that it is premature to jump to conclusions.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- An EgyptAir pilot seeking asylum in England who says he has information about October's deadly crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 will be interviewed by U.S. accident investigators.
National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall, whose agency is investigating the crash that killed 217 people off the coast of Massachusetts, announced the decision Tuesday to send two staffers to London.
He did not elaborate.
EgyptAir pilot Hamdi Hanafi Taha sought asylum last week after landing a plane at London's Heathrow Airport.
Airline officials say Taha has no special knowledge about the cause of the Oct.
31 crash near the island of Nantucket.
Neither American nor Egyptian investigators have released any official findings on the cause of the crash of the Boeing 767.
Some U.S. sources have speculated the plane's co-pilot, who died in the crash, deliberately brought the jet down.
Egyptian authorities hotly dispute that theory.
They say the most likely cause is an unexplained problem in the plane's tail section.
Hitchcock would have had a field day with this one.
The demise of EgyptAir 990 is shaping up as one of the great whodunits in the annals of aviation disasters.
That is why Americans have plunged into this terrifying tale, discussing it last week as they gathered around fax machines and dinner tables at a pitch not seen after the TWS and Swissair crashes.
Why the intensity?
Primarily because authorities have introduced the possibility that a human _ not some mechanical failure _ caused the crash.
But the story also generates such heat because supporters and opponents of this view offer equally compelling arguments defending their respective cases.
Tension forged from competing versions of events crackle through the story.
Either the National Transportation Safety Board or the Egyptian government is utterly wrong about what happened in the skies off of Nantucket early in the morning of October 31.
The stakes are high.
Egypt is America's best friend in the Mideast.
Its reputation is at stake.
So is ours.
As dramas go, you can't do much better than that.
Neither the TWA nor Swissair crash carried this kind of torque, notwithstanding the early charges of a missile attack on the TWA plane that have been long since discredited.
Here, in contrast, the NTSB raises the specter of a villain lurking in the cockpit _ malignant flesh and blood prepared to commit suicide and kill 217 souls with malice aforethought.
This macabre vision is further infused by the rampant fears in the West of terrorists committing horrific acts in the name of Islam.
And terrorism is indeed another possible explanation for the crash.
There were over 30 Egyptian military officers on the flight, including three brigadier generals.
According to one NTRB source quoted early in the investigation, the presence of this critical mass of military elite immediately raised questions of foul play.
Under that theoretical line of reasoning, if co-pilot Gamil El Batouty really did cause the crash, he could have done so for political rather than personal reasons.
The EgyptAir 990 story is also personal in a way that TWA and Swissair were not.
We know the name of the man who may _ and it's only ``may;'' we don't know anything for sure yet _ have intentionally put the Boeing 767 into its fatal dive.
There has been massive media coverage of his family.
We have learned that a daughter has lupus and, according to a son, the father was bringing automobile tires he purchased in the U.S back to Egypt with him.
We have even seen his Cairo apartment, and heard his wife describe their close relationship.
If he is the culprit, al-Batouti will be an infamous one _ not another shadowy killer who goes down with the plane or somehow slips into Afghanistan.
The ``criminal act'' scenario is the worst nightmare of every flier who has ever harbored doubts about the guys in the cockpit, any cockpit.
How many of us will stare long and hard at our flight crew the next time we board the New York shuttle?
Is the pilot having a bad day, we wonder?
If nothing else, this plane crash has buttressed the notion that just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you.
United States diplomats have been concerned about the speed with which the NTSB has floated the idea that El Batouty or another pilot may have sent the plane into a suicide plunge.
So has Frank Wisner, Jr.
, a former ambassador to Egypt and luminary of our foreign policy establishment, who cautions against the suicide theory.
The NTSB is couching its statements with conditional verbs as the case becomes increasingly sensitive.
Still, we don't know how to assess the significance of what El-Batouty said _ or is believed to have said _ in Arabic before the plane began its precipitous dive.
Dueling experts fight over meaning, and authorities dutifuly nod to ``cultural differences''.
Are our experts right or did they miss subleties that Egyptian experts will detect?
Americans who care about US relations with Egypt in particular, and the Arab world in general, know that our government has to get this right.
The rest of us must probe the Egyptian charge that the American media has rushed to judgment in condemning a senior pilot of their national airline.
Are the Cairenes right here, or are they experiencing a national case of denial?
Their cause was not helped by an Eyptian government official who told CNN that there is a ``triangle of death'' over the Atlantic that swallowed TWA, Swissair, JFK Jr.
and now EgyptAir.
Such fantasies rob this investigation of the objectivity it deserves.
For now, Americans lean toward the NTSB suicide theory because we find the NTSB investigators credible.
They are, after all, our investigators.
Besides, there appears to be no hint of mechanical error.
Given the stunning developments that have already appeared, though, we are prepared for more precipitous plot changes in this yarn.
They could materialize in the findings of an exhaustive US-Egyptian review of the voice recorder to be completed this weekend.
In the meantime, we remain glued to this story that gnaws at us.
&QL; (Sam Allis is the Globe's Sunday writer.)
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation Ibrahim el-Demiri said on Saturday that he did not rule out the possibility that EgyptAir Flight 990 was downed last year by electromagnetic interference.
Electromagnetic waves could have confused the computer of the Boeing 767, leading to the crash of the plane, el-Demiri said.
EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic off the United States coast shortly after taking off from New York airport on October 31, killing all 217 people on board.
Egyptian and U.S. investigators released a factual report last month without giving the cause of the incident.
The Egyptian minister, who was commenting on a report in the New York Review of Books magazine, said, however, the theory was speculative, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
The U.S. magazine's report said that electromagnetic interferences by military radars in the area, over which the EgyptAir plane was flying, could have caused the sudden shutdown of its computerized auto pilot, the elevators and engines.
El-Demiri said Egypt is still demanding the U.S. to release additional information on the plane's elevators, which controls the nose up or down, and to publish radar images, which the U.S. withheld for reasons of classified military data and might give clues to the tragic incident.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public release of reports compiling the facts in the EgyptAir Flight 990 crash is a routine step, but one likely to fan the international dispute over what caused the tragedy last fall off the New England coast.
U.S. investigators have suggested that a co-pilot of the jetliner may have deliberately plunged the plane into the sea, killing all 217 people aboard on Oct.
31. That idea has been vehemently rejected by Egyptian officials, who contend that mechanical failure is the probable cause, or possibly even a bomb or missile.
The new reports from the National Transportation Safety Board, being released Friday, compile the findings of investigators in such areas as human performance, aircraft structure, power plants, maintenance, air traffic control and so forth.
But they do not single out a particular cause of the crash and do not include any analysis.
The probable result will be each side finding evidence to support its contention as the investigation continues into the reason the Boeing 767 plunged into the sea off the coast of the Massachusetts island of Nantucket.
Investigators have said that the cockpit voice recorder contained words that may have been a prayer just before the plane went into its plunge.
That led to speculation that co-pilot Gameel El-Batouty may have deliberately crashed the plane.
El-Batouty had been investigated by a New York hotel's security staff for a number of incidents that allegedly included exposing himself, USA Today reported in its Friday editions, quoting sources it did not name.
The allegations were contained in FBI investigative reports into the backgrounds of the plane's crew members, and some of the reports were expected to be released Friday, the sources told the newspaper.
However, investigators could not determine whether El-Batouty's behavior at the hotel had any connection with the crash, the newspaper said.
In Cairo, El-Batouty's family angrily denounced the published allegations.
''They are running out of things to say, so they are ruining the guy's reputation,'' Walid El-Batouty, the co-pilot's nephew, told The Associated Press.
''They are trying to raise anything to divert people from the real reason (for the crash)''.
An air traffic control recording released earlier showed no radio transmissions from Flight 990 to controllers or other aircraft in the final minutes before the plane crashed.
The last word was a routine ''good morning'' signoff.
NTSB Chairman Jim Hall has testified before Congress that the movements of the plane were ''consistent with a deliberate action on the part of one of the crew members''.
Also, information from the flight data recorder released early in the investigation showed the plane's autopilot was switched off before it was put into a steep dive.
Both engines on the Boeing 767 were also turned off.
Rejecting that theory, families of the crew members have filed suit against the plane's manufacturer, Boeing.
Egyptian officials have focused on possible problems with the plane's elevators, a pair of small wing-like surfaces at the tail of the jet that control the up-or-down angle of the nose.
The flight data show the plane's elevators were uneven during the rapid descent, indicating a major problem.
The elevators are designed to operate in unison.
Investigators are trying to determine if the split was caused by the plane's breakup, a jamming problem in one of the elevators, crew panic or even a struggle for control by two people in the cockpit.
The last contact with the flight came at 1:47 a.m.
EST. The pilot's last words after being asked to switch to another radio frequency: ''One-two-five-nine-two, good day,'' followed by an unintelligible utterance, then, ''Nine-nine-zero heavy, good morning''.
The heavy referred to his big aircraft, a Boeing 767.
The first indication that something was wrong came seven minutes later.
The New York air traffic controller said, ''EgyptAir 990, radar contact lost, recycle transponder squawk one-seven-one-two''.
It was a declaration that the plane no longer appeared on radar screens and a request for it to send out a signal.
But that and several other efforts failed to get a response.
The FAA estimates that the plane hit the water at about 1:51 a.m., four minutes after its last transmission.
The investigation also prompted a dispute over who is responsible for paying for the costly investigation, which has included recovering most of the crash plane from the seafloor.
Egypt gave the United States $5 million in June to help pay for the search and rescue efforts.
That country's share of the cost was expected to be $10.6 million and officials promised to pay the balance expeditiously.

NEW YORK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. investigators on Wednesday are continuing the search for the cockpit voice recorder from the ocean depths where the Boeing 767-300 on EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed October 31.
The plane's flight data recorder, one of the two "Black Boxes", was retrieved early Tuesday and now is under analysis by experts of U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in Washington.
The recorder's tape contains parameters measuring air speed, altitude, settings of engines and many other data, valuable to investigators to determine the cause of the accident which killed all 217 on Board.
The Cairo-bound plane plunged some 60 miles south off Nantucket Island, Massachusetts soon after it took off from New York.
Investigators still wonder whether it was a result of mechanical defects, operational errors or human sabotage.
Two remotely operated vehicles containing sophisticated robots were used to catch the data recoder from depths of more than 70 meters.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall said Friday that additional studies must be completed before his agency can determine the cause of the EgyptAir 990 crash, and he disputed an Associated Press report that investigators are increasingly convinced the jet was crashed deliberately.
Three government officials close to the investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity, said examinations of the jet's remains have revealed no signs of a mechanical failure that would have caused the plane to crash, AP reported Thursday.
``No hypothesis for the cause of this accident has been accepted,'' Hall said Friday in a statement.
``There is much that still needs to be done before a determination of cause can be reached''.
The AP story did not report that any hypothesis had been officially adopted by the safety agency.
One official told AP that the Boeing 767 showed no signs of mechanical problems and that ``it was doing what it was supposed to,'' before the crash.
Asked about Hall's statement, the official said Friday night that he stood by his original account.
Two other officials said the working theory remains the plane was sent into a dive shortly after takeoff from New York's Kennedy Airport.
Attempts to contact those two officials Friday night for comment on Hall's statement were not successful.
Hall said the NTSB and the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority had agreed this week to continue studying the accident, including the voice and data recorders.
The investigators will be examining the plane's elevator system, hydraulic components and engine pylons, he said.
They also plan to conduct flight simulations at Boeing facilities in Seattle.
``No decision has been reached at this point as to whether further wreckage recovery will ultimately be necessary,'' Hall said.
``Both agencies agree that additional work needs to be accomplished before a final decision can be made''.
About 70 percent of the plane's wreckage was recovered from the ocean floor, following the jet's plunge off the Massachusetts island of Nantucket on Oct.
31. The jet crashed 40 minutes into its 11-hour flight, killing all 217 aboard.
Cruising at 33,000 feet, EgyptAir Flight 990 was ``uneventful'' until the plane's autopilot disconnected about 8 seconds before the jetliner, with 217 people aboard, began to drop down toward the Atlantic Ocean, crash investigators said Wednesday.
It is not yet clear whether the autopilot disconnected by itself or was turned off by the crew of the Cairo-bound jet that was some 40 minutes out of New York's Kennedy Airport at the time.
National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall, releasing the first tidbits of information that his investigators have gleaned from examining one of the jet's two black boxes, said the Boeing 767 made what appears to be a ``controlled descent'' from 33,000 feet down to 19,000 feet.
The flight data recorder stopped shortly afterward and the final five to 10 seconds of information on its tape are still being analyzed, Hall told a news conference at the safety board's headquarters in Washington, D.C.
All aboard the jet died when it crashed into the Atlantic less than two minutes after the autopilot disconnected..
Although the information made public so far raises still more questions about what could have gone wrong on Flight 990, Hall did say investigators do not believe the jet's thrust reversers deployed in flight.
One of the thrust reversers on the twin-engine 767, which are used to slow a jet after landing, had been deactivated because of a problem before the jet left Cairo for New York, and there has been speculation that perhaps a thrust reverser deployed during flight.
That speculation was fueled because another 767 crashed in Thailand in 1991 when a thrust reverser deployed in flight.
The Lauda Air crash killed all 223 people on board.
``There is no evidence of thrust reverser deployment in the data we have,'' Hall said of EgyptAir Flight 990.
The safety board is expected to release more information from the flight data recorder over the coming days.
The Navy is still trying to recover the second black box _ the cockpit voice recorder.
It would have recorded crew conversations in the jet's cockpit during the final 30 minutes of flight, and could prove to be even more important than the flight data recorder in helping investigators determine the cause of the crash.
A former 767 pilot told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer last night the jet may have experienced an in-flight electrical or computer problem, based on the limited amount of information made public so far by the safety board.
The autopilot on a 767 would disconnect from flying the airplane if there there were a problem with the cockpit computers or the plane's electrical system, said Dan Gellert of Sequim, a former pilot with Eastern Airlines who later trained 767 pilots.
A light would flash and an alarm would sound to let the crew know immediately that the autopilot was off, he said.
The 767 has a modern ``glass cockpit,'' and information about the plane, including its altitude and attitude (or angle of flight), are displayed on screens in front of the crew.
An electrical or computer problem would cause those screens to go blank, or could even result in erroneous flight data to be displayed, Gellert said.
The pilots, believing they were still in level flight, could have put the big jet into a dive, he theorized.
An electrical problem would also explain why the plane's transponder stopped working, he said.
The transponder sends out an electronic signal that tells air traffic controllers the plane's altitude.
Until Wednesday, the only information about what happened to EgyptAir Flight 990 had come from an analysis of radar data by the NTSB and the Air Force.
Safety board investigators said last week the radar analysis showed the jet, flying at 33,000 feet, suddenly entered a steep but straight dive down to 16,700 feet.
At that point, air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane's transponder.
But Air Force radar continued to plot the plane's course and altitude down to 16,000 feet.
The jet climbed back to 24,000 feet before making a rapid descent to 10,000 feet.
At that point, radar showed multiple targets, indicating the plane broke up before it hit the ocean.
The transponder operates on a separate electrical buss, or pathway, from the plane's computers and autopilot, Gellert said.
That would explain why it kept working longer, assuming an electrical problem caused the autopilot to disconnect.
Based on preliminary analysis, investigators had said last week that early in its 17,000-foot dive, the plane may have exceeded the speed of sound, though it began to slow as it neared 16,000 feet.
But Hall said Wednesday the flight data recorder indicates the plane did not reach such speeds.
Even so, the 767 did dive much faster than it would have in an emergency.
Based on the radar analysis, the jet took 40 second to reach 16,700 feet, which would have meant it was going down at more than 24,000 feet per minute.
A Boeing spokesman said the recommended emergency descent rate for the 767 is 8,000 feet per minute.
An emergency descent, for example, might be used if the plane suddenly lost cabin pressure and pilots needed to get to a lower altitude as fast as possible.
Gellert said pilots are trained to bank a commercial jetliner about 30 degree before making an emergency descent.
That is to keep the passengers from flying out of their seats in a steep dive.
Centrifugal force during the turn presses passengers into their seats.
Investigators have said the radar data shows the plane did not turn in its initial dive.
Neither the pilot nor co-pilot of EgyptAir Flight 990 radioed any kind of distress call to air traffic controllers.
Their last contact with controllers a few minutes before the plane began its descent did not indicate any problem.
Gellert said an electrical problem could have knocked out communications, or the crew might have been preoccupied trying to regain control of their airplane.
Hall did not comment Wednesday on how the airplane behaved after the brief climb shown by radar data, or in its final plunge to the ocean.
That subsequent climb is consistent with a loss of the computers, Gellert said.
``Somewhere along the way you realize you are diving, then you try and recover,'' he said.
``Perhaps the crew overcorrected.
Now they are zooming back up, putting the plane on its tail.
Then they lose control again and head down and start shedding parts.''
NEWPORT, R.I.
_ The mystery of what happened to EgyptAir Flight deepened Wednesday with the stunning word from investigators that new radar data shows the plane climbed 8,000 feet back into the night sky after it had plunged more than three miles from its cruising altitude at near supersonic speeds.
The bizarre roller-coaster flight path would suggest the crew was attempting to control the plane as it climbed, though investigators refused to speculate on that.
The Boeing 767 climbed back to 24,000 feet, only to dive again rapidly toward the Atlantic, this time breaking up when it reached about 10,000 feet.
Radar showed what were probably pieces of the airplane drifting down in the direction of the wind for another 2 minutes and 40 seconds before dropping off radar scopes.
All 217 people aboard the plane were killed.
At a late-night news briefing here Wednesday, investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board said they need to study data from the jet's two black boxes to try and piece together the mystery.
But it could be next week before those boxes are recovered from nearly 300 feet on the bottom of the Atlantic off Nantucket Island.
A storm that is churning up 22-foot waves in the crash area has halted most of the recovery operations, though a few pieces of surface debris was collected Wednesday, including spoiler panels on the wing, seat cushions, a main wheel, the nose tire and five passenger emergency slides.
High winds and rough seas are expected to continue through the weekend, said Navy Capt.
Burt March.
The Navy has said it needs seas of no more than about eight feet before they can send out the USS Grapple.
That ship is the same one that used its highly specialized equipment to recover the recover wreckage of TWA Flight 800 in 1996 and Swiss Air Flight 111 last year.
Until they have the black boxes, the lack of information will continue to frustrate investigators.
Veteran aerospace journalists who have covered many crashes said they could not recall a commercial airliner acting as strangely as Flight 990 as it made its final wayward journey up and down over the Atlantic some 30 minutes after taking off from Kennedy Airport in New York on a flight to Cairo.
The new radar data came from the Air Force.
Earlier, using tracking information from civilian radar facilities in Boston, New York and on Nantucket Island, investigators believed the jet never climbed after its sudden dive from cruising altitude.
John Clark, deputy director of the NTSB's office of Research and Engineering, gave this account Wednesday night of what investigators now believe happened in the final minutes of Flight 990.
A half hour out of Kennedy, flying at 33,000 feet, the Boeing jet suddenly entered a steep but straight dive, down to 16,700 feet.
At that point, information was lost from the plane's transponder, which provides information to air traffic controllers about a plane's altitude.
The Air Force radar, though, continued to track the plane down to 16,000 feet.
Early in its 17,000-foot dive, the plane may have exceeded the speed of sound, though it began to slow as it neared 16,000 feet.
Then the plane, its transponder still out, climbed back to 24,000 feet, when it began a rapid descent to 10,000 feet where radar showed multiple targets, indicating it had broken up.
``It stopped being a flying airplane,'' Clark said.
Clark would not speculate on what kind of event could have triggered the initial dive, or whether the sudden climb indicated the pilots were struggling to regain control of the huge jet.
In addition to the new radar data, investigators also provided more detail Wednesday night about the deactivated thrust reverser on the twin-engine plane.
It was deactivated before the plane left Cairo on the first leg of its trip to Newark.
It then flew to Los Angeles and then to Kennedy before leaving on its last and fatal leg.
Greg Phillips, the NTSB's chief crash investigator, said the NTSB is sending someone to Cairo to check the plane's maintenance records and better understand what prompted maintenance crews to deactivate the thruster on the plane's left engine.
Information from the plane's flight data recorder, one of the two black boxes, should tell investigators if a thruster deployed in flight, he said.
Because another 767 crashed in Thailand in 1991 when a thrust reverser deployed, there has been speculation that may have been what happened on Flight 990.
But Jim Hall, chairman of the safety board, stressed again at Wednesday night's briefing, ``We have no evidence at this time that the thrust reverser system played any role in this accident''.
While the black boxes can provide important clues to the crash, it could takes many months or even years before the safety board issues a final report on the probable cause of the accident.
The safety board is still investigating the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 in these same waters.
A final report is not expected until at least the spring of next year.
NEW YORK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- One of the "black boxes" of the plane on the EgyptAir Flight 990 has been recovered, U.S. searchers announced Tuesday.
"Black Boxes" are the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, two vital instruments to help determine the cause of a plane accident.
A U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board spokesman confirmed the find, without identifying which recorder was recovered.
The U.S Navy waged a round-the-clock search on Monday for the boxes, eight days after the Boeing 767 plane crashed some 60 miles off Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, shortly after it took off from John F.
Kennedy International Airport in New York.
All 217 people on board were killed.
Two robots have been used during the operation in an effort to find and catch the boxes amid the wreckage at the Atlantic seabed 80 meter deep.
Following is a transcript, translated from the Arabic, of the final two minutes of the taped cockpit conversation of EgyptAir Flight 990 before it crashed on Oct.
31, 1999, as released Friday by the National Transportation Safety Board.

PROVIDENCE, R.I.
(AP) -- The remains of the first victims of EgyptAir Flight 990 have been identified, four months after the plane plunged into the ocean.
Medical, dental and fingerprint records were used to determine the identities of the 14 victims -- all U.S. residents -- paving the way for families to bury their relatives.
The EgyptAir flight crashed Oct.
31 off the Massachusetts island of Nantucket, killing the 217 people on board.
A salvage ship worked for a week in December, raising the wreckage and remains off the ocean floor.
The Rhode Island medical examiner's office has been overseeing the identification process.
It has been working with 6,000 tissue fragments and a smaller number of body parts.
Only 1,300 fragments are suitable for DNA testing, and results may not be ready for 10 months.
A memorial service was held in November in Newport for all the relatives and many already held private funerals.
The National Transportation Safety Board estimated that 70 percent of the aircraft, including one engine, and sections of the wings, tail and body, was recovered.
On Friday, NTSB Chairman James Hall said the second engine would be raised.
A civilian ship with an underwater robot is scheduled to begin the task March 18.
''They did a good job on videotaping and taking pictures underwater, but it can also help if we have it out of the water to get a closer look at it,'' NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said.
After an examination of the flight data recorder, the cockpit voice recorder, radar data and small amounts of wreckage, Hall said in November that there was no sign of mechanical failure that could have caused the crash.
Hall has disputed reports that investigators are increasingly convinced the jet was crashed deliberately, saying his agency must conduct more studies before they settle on a cause.
CAIRO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Pilots Association chief Walid Murad demanded on Sunday that U.S. investigators probing last October's EgyptAir Flight 990 crash interview pilots who said they saw a shooting fireball near the crash site.
The testimony of the German and Jordanian pilots must be heard regarding their sighting of missile-like bodies in the same place the Egyptian plane went down, Murad told reporters.
According to documents released on Friday by the U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), a Royal Jordanian co-pilot saw a fireball in the sky on the same day after leaving the same airport as the doomed EgyptAir flight.
The pilot of Flight RJ262 from New York's John F.
Kennedy airport on October 31 last year reported that his co-pilot made the sighting shortly after the takeoff while he had his head down.
The co-pilot said that he saw a fireball like a shooting star passing ahead at the Jordanian plane very close from right to left going down, the pilot wrote, as cited by Egyptian investigators in the NTSB documents.
The captain, who submitted his report to the airlines two weeks after the EgyptAir crash, said his plane had the same flight path clearance as the EgyptAir plane.
The head of the Egyptian Pilots Association asked for the pilots to be interviewed again and accused U.S. investigators of deliberately ignoring problems that hold the key to explaining the crash.
Murad joined Egyptian investigators in demanding the release of classified data regarding three high-speed radar images passing near EgyptAir Flight 990 just before it began its dive into the Atlantic.
"The absence of this information removes the credibility of the American investigators," he said.
Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority chief Abdel Fattah Kato has complained the withholding by the U.S. side the radar information for reasons of classified military data.
It was difficult to understand why data concerning the characteristics of radar used in connection with the U.S. civil aviation was classified and why it was unavailable for the analysis of apparent targets that were in the vicinity of the plane, he wrote in a letter to the U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration in June.
The letter was included in the investigation documents.
All 217 people on board died in the EgyptAir flight crash.
CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian aviation officials have demanded that the United States provide detailed radar information on last October's EgyptAir Flight 990 crash to explain high-speed radar images near the plane in its final moments.
A review of the 1,665 pages of documents about relevant investigations revealed a letter from Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority chief Abdel Fattah Kato, who complained the withholding by the U.S. side of the radar information, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported on Saturday.
In the documents, which were made public on Friday in the U.S. and presented on the website of the U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Kato did not give credence to a theory that the plane was downed by a missile, but stressed the need to investigate fully what the Flight 990 crew might have seen.
The EgyptAir flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly after taking off from the New York International Airport on October 31, 1999, on its way to Cairo, killing 217 people on board.
The probe into this tragedy has produced radar data showing three high-speed returns in the area of, and along the path of, the Flight 990.
The data shows these returns crossing the plane's path just before it began its dive, Kato wrote to U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on June 18.
He said that air traffic controllers had cleared the Flight 990 to pass through military "Warning Areas 506 and 105A" just prior to the accident.
It was difficult to understand why data concerning the characteristics of radar used in connection with the U.S. civil aviation was classified and why it was unavailable for the analysis of apparent targets that were in the vicinity of the plane, he wrote.
Kato added that it was apparent from the air traffic control transcript that no FAA controller was actually watching the Flight 990 at the time of the accident and for several minutes after.
The continuing Egyptian concerns appeared to question why NTSB staff had concluded that "there were no unresolved safety issues," as asserted Friday by NTSB chairman Jim Hall, who released the documents at a news conference.
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official raised the possibility Monday of handing over the probe leadership of the EgyptAir Flight 990 to another agency, hinting that the plane was possibly downed by a criminal act.
"We are concentrating our efforts on determining from the evidence, including the cockpit voice recorder, whether or not this investigation is to remain under the leadership of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)," said NTSB Chairman Jim Hall at a press conference here.
Hall acknowledged there have been "many rumors, theories and stories" circulating about whether the crash was caused by mechanical failure or a criminal act such as a hijacking, crew fight or pilot suicide.
If there is evidence of a crime in the plane crash, the investigation authority will be shifted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) under U.S. rules.
The EgyptAir passenger plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the Massachusetts coast on October 31, killing all 217 aboard.
Hall met with FBI Director Louis J.
Freeh and other officials Monday to discuss whether there was enough evidence to open a criminal investigation, an Associated Press report quoted a law enforcement official as saying.
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- EgyptAir Chairman Mohamed Fahim Rayan said on Thursday he is "99 percent sure" that a technical problem rather than a suicidal pilot brought down an EgyptAir plane last October.
Rayan told a news conference that he is almost certain that there is something wrong in the elevator control system, citing as evidence a Boeing service bulletin earlier this week.
The elevators are movable panels on the horizontal tail surface which direct the aircraft's nose up or down.
The plane's manufacturer, Boeing Co.
, urged on Tuesday all airlines flying the Boeing 767s to perform a special inspection to ensure the integrity of parts that help move elevators, but said the stepped-up inspection is not connected to the crash probe.
The U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said last week it had been unable to conclude what caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, which was heading for Cairo from New York on October 31, 1999, when it suddenly plunged into the ocean, killing all 217 people on board.
U.S. investigators hinted the relief co-pilot, Gameel el- Batouti, "brought down the plane in a suicidal act".
The Egyptian side has strongly opposed the speculations, stressing technical failure might cause the tragedy.
Egyptian and U.S. investigators "were seeking to know exactly what happened to the EgyptAir plane," Rayan said.
The U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) "has given credence to the Egyptian theory" that a prevalent malfunction in the elevator control system could result in a fatal accident, referring to FAA's decision to intensify inspection of Boeing 767s' elevator system.
Investigators from the United States and Egypt will review part of the flight control system in the tail of Boeing's 767 airplane as part of the investigation into the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday.
The disclosure comes just a couple days after the chairman of EgyptAir told a news conference in Cairo that ``something happened'' to the tail of the Boeing 767 that caused it to go into a near supersonic dive before the plane broke up and crashed into the sea.
Safety board chairman Jim Hall said investigators from his agency and the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority will examine the 767's elevator system, as well as perform a metallurgic examination of the plane's engine pylon components.
The elevators are flat panels on the horizontal stabalizer of the tail that control up and down movements of the plane when the pilot pushes or pulls on the control stick.
Hall's statement did not suggest that investigators suspect the elevator system played a role in the crash, and a Boeing spokesman said such a review is typical in airline crash investigations.
``The safety board is going through a deliberate and methodical process as they do on all their investigations, and Boeing continues to support the investigation,'' said Boeing safety spokesman John Dern.
There have been no reports of problems with the 767's elevator system or the engine pylons, Dern said.
All 217 people aboard the Boeing 767-300 died when it plunged into the Atlantic off the Massachusetts coast on Oct.
31, about 30 minutes out of New York's Kennedy Airport on a night flight to Cairo.
Investigators have found nothing in an analysis of the cockpit voice recorder that would point toward a bomb or a mechanical problem as the cause of its crash.
Radio communication between the flight crew and air traffic controllers was routine, and at no time did a member of the crew advise controllers of either an emergency or a mechanical problem or concern.
In addition, the plane's other black box, the flight data recorder, does not indicate there was an explosion or mechanical problem.
That points to another cause, and the leading theory is that the plane was brought down by a deliberate act of the backup copilot.
In his statement Friday, Hall blasted as ``wrong'' a published report this week that quoted unnamed government officials as saying a mechanical problem has all but been ruled out as the cause of the crash.
``NTSB is disturbed to see that again this week unidentified sources were used as the basis of a news report purporting to have informed knowledge of our work,'' Hall said in a statement released late Friday afternoon.
``As is often the case in these matters, the story was wrong.
No hypothesis for the cause of this accident has been accepted, and the activities that I have outlined indicate that there is much that still needs to be done before a determination of cause can be reached''.
In November, with no evidence the crash was an accident, Hall was prepared to turn the investigation over to the FBI _ further fueling the theory of pilot suicide _ when the Egyptian government strenuously objected.
Since then, the safety board has said little about how the investigation is going.
Hall said substantial portions of the wings, tail, fuselage and an engine had been recovered.
Hall said Friday that ``no decision has been reached at this point whether further wreckage recovery will ultimately be necessary, and both agencies (the safety board and the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority) agree that additional work needs to be be accomplished before a final decision can be made''.
Hall said both agencies also believe that ``aircraft and operational system issues'' must be investigated further.

WASHINGTON, October 31 (Xinhua) -- Radar tapes continued to show contact with an EgyptAir plane for about 90 seconds after it had begun a dramatic dive towards the Atlantic Ocean, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said Sunday.
The information provided by Jim Hall, chairman of the NTSB, indicated the plane plummeted from its cruise altitude of 9,900 meters down to 5,730 meters in 36 seconds, and then at least some part of it remained visible on radar for a much longer period of time.
"We do not know at this point what caused the crash," Hall said at a press conference.
"We are beginning what may be a long investigation".
All the 217 people on board are feared dead as the EgyptAir Boeing 767 passenger plane crashed early Sunday off Nantucket, Massachusetts State in the United States.
The U.S.
Coast Guard said there were no reports of survivors from the crash.
Flight 990 of EgyptAir, Egypt's national carrier, took off from John F.
Kennedy International Airport in New York at 1:19 a.m. local time (0519 GMT) en route to Cairo and disappeared from radar screen at 2 a.m.
(0600 GMT).
Hall said the government of Egypt has asked the U.S. government to take the lead in the crash investigation.
EgyptAir and Egyptian government officials were heading to the United States to assist in the investigation, he added.
CAIRO, August 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian pilots have demanded the U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) hand over the probe into the 1999 EgyptAir plane crash to a third party if it fails to release key evidence, Egypt's Al-Ahram daily reported on Tuesday.
The Egyptian Pilots Association wanted U.S. authorities to provide radar images for the investigations and NTSB to question an air traffic controller on duty at the time of the crash, Walid Murad, head of the association, told reporters on Monday.
EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic shortly after takeoff October 31 from New York airport, killing 217 people on board.
After over nine months of investigations, NTSB issued a factual report last Friday.
While NTSB said "there are no unresolved safety issues," Egyptians have accused the U.S. of denying their access to the radar images on the pretext that they contained military secrets.
Murad further demanded that Egypt receive the plane's wreck and the two black boxes, recording flight and voice data, for re- examination, the pro-government newspaper said.
If the Egyptian demands are rejected, the investigation documents should be withdrawn from NTSB and given to a third party to reopen the inquiry, he said.
KUNMING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of malaria has declined from 249 people per 10,000 in 1953 to 3 per 10,000 in 1996 in southwest China's Yunnan Province, statistics showed.
Doctors in Yunnan, a notorious malaria-prevalent region before 1949, have worked hard to discover the characteristics and mechanism concerning the spreading of malaria under the special conditions which exist in the province.
The Yunnan Institute of Malaria Prevention, China's only malaria research organ of its kind, established in 1957, has been running classes in the past 40 years and has trained more than 2,000 personnel in malaria prevention and treatment.
Doctors also popularize knowledge on malaria prevention among people of various minority groups which are numerous in the province.
Since the 1990s, the institute has received 56 experts and researchers from 11 countries on academic exchanges and cooperation projects.
The research of the institute has been aided for seven consecutive years by the World Health Organization.
JOHANNESBURG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Five Southern African Development Community (SADC) health ministers reached an agreement here on Saturday on coordinating their efforts to combat malaria in the region.
The ministers from South Africa, Botswana, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe said in a statement that an coordinated approach was essential to contain the spread of malaria.
They established a working group to investigate how to secure funds for malaria control plans and made recommendations on key areas in malaria prevention, treatment and control, according to the statement.
The statement said the working group was charged to investigate: -- the prediction of unexpected climatic conditions that may adversely influence the incidence of malaria; -- the harmonization of treatment and prophylaxis protocols, vector control and the use of insecticides, taking into account the national scientific evidence and prevailing circumstances; -- developing clear guidelines on the rational use of malaria prophylaxis and treatment during pregnancy; -- examining and developing strategies to manage the effect of cross- border movements; -- the impact of the movement of people on the spread, management and reporting of the disease, and -- examining the extent of private sector influence on drug resistance.
The working group sub-committee would report on the progress of the investigations at the annual ministers' meeting next month.
The region has been hit by a recent spate of malaria caused by floods sweeping through a number of regional countries.
DAR ES SALAAM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye Monday called on people to use insecticide treated nets to prevent mosquito from spreading malaria.
Sumaye made the appeal while opening the Second International Conference on Insecticide Treated Nets in Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam.
He said in Tanzania, malaria is the leading cause of outpatient services and the number one cause of child mortality.
Statistics indicated that 25- 42 percent of outpatient visits and 25 percent of deaths reported in Tanzanian health facilities are due to the disease.
Malaria is also a major impediment to social and economic development throughout Africa, he said, adding that it is estimated that by the year 2000 the annual direct economic cost of malaria across Africa will exceed 3.
5 billion U.S. dollars, twice what it was in 1995.
He said many governments in Sub-Saharan Africa overstretched their resources to provide prevention and treatment services on malaria related illness.
For example, outpatient treatment of malaria accounts for up to 40 percent of Africa's public health expenditure.
The recent emergence and spread of malaria resistant to chloroquine, a drug that has saved millions of lives for over five decades, further highlights the need to promote new strategies to protect vulnerable populations from infection and put our emphasis on preventative measures, he noted.
The use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) is one of the key components of prevention, he said.
He said based on field trials in Tanzania, Kenya and Ghana, it has been established that when properly used ITNs could reduce mortality by more than 30 percent, and hospitalization by more than 40 percent.
"We learnt also that malaria could be prevented, and more than 500,000 lives could be saved each year (C if ITNs were widely available to many households in Africa," he said.
Meanwhile, the Tanzanian Prime Minister said that the fight against malaria by destroying habitat of mosquitoes has to continue, adding that people need to clean their surroundings by cutting grass and shrubs around houses and destroying stationary water ponds.
The conference, sponsored by the London-based Malaria Consortium, has attracted more than 230 delegates from some 40 countries across the world.
The first conference was held in Washington in 1997.
WASHINGTON(AP) -- Americans won a new drug Friday to prevent malaria when they travel to countries ravaged by the mosquito-borne infection.
The Food and Drug Administration approved Malarone, the first new anti-malaria option in 11 years.
Malaria is a parasitic infection that is one of the world's worst scourges.
It sickens at least 300 million people every year and kills up to 2.7 million.
Drugs and insecticides have made it rare in developed countries, but it is almost impossible to escape in tropical, developing nations.
Worse, it is evolving to resist many treatments.
Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle ache and malaise.
Without prompt treatment, kidney failure and other problems can cause death.
People who become ill with a fever during or after tropical travel should see a doctor and make sure to mention the trip, the FDA advised.
Also, people planning travel to a malaria-endemic country should see a doctor first about prevention.
Glaxo Wellcome Inc.'s Malarone was approved to prevent and treat malaria in adults and children.
It combines two medications: atovaquone, used to treat lung infections in immune-compromised patients, and proguanil, an old malaria therapy.
In four clinical trials in Africa, two out of 279 people who used Malarone for three months developed malaria.
In comparison, 92 out of another 297 people who took a placebo developed malaria.
Another eight clinical trials in countries in Africa, Asia, South America and Europe concluded Malarone is an effective malaria treatment, too.
The main side effects were headache and abdominal pain; children also reported vomiting and itching.
Glaxo said the prescription drug will be available in mid-August but would not reveal a price.

HARARE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO) regional office for Africa said here Monday it was preparing for a program that would progressively reduce illnesses and deaths due to malaria to a minimum in Africa over the next 25 years.
The program, called African Initiative for Malaria Control in the 21st century (AIM), will be launched next year and will cover all the 46 countries in Africa.
In a statement, the WHO said the initiative will be implemented in phases and was expected to reduce malaria illnesses and deaths in the region by 50 percent by the year 2010.
"The ultimate goal, according to WHO, is that by the year 2030, malaria will neither be the major contributor to mortality and morbidity nor significant socio-economic consequence," said the statement.
Malaria is one of the leading health problems in Africa, especially in sub-Sahara region.
About 550 million people in the African region risk the disease.
The disease attacks between 270 and 480 million people and kills between 1.5 and 2.7 million each year.
The malaria problem is increasing because the malaria parasite has developed resistance to some of the anti-malaria drugs and insecticides.
"The economic consequences of malaria-related diseases are enormous.
The direct and indirect losses due to malaria in the region rose from 800 million U.S.
Dollars in 1987 to more than 2,000 million U.S.
Dollars in 1997," the statement said.
The key features of the implementation of the initiative will be early treatment of malaria cases, promotion of the use of insecticide-impregnated nets, prevention and strengthening of the capacities of countries and communities to combat the disease, according to the statement.
ADDIS ABABA, October 25 (Xinhua) -- Medicine spraying activities are being undertaken in Rift Valley of the central Ethiopia to halt the malaria epidemic in the area, a report from the Ethiopian News Agency said today.
The report quoted local official Kemal Morke as saying that medicines have so far been sprayed at over 24,000 residential houses in Rift Valley and over 83,000 residents in the area have been protected from being infected by malaria.
Kemal said that the malaria prevention activities are being undertaken in a series of campaigns because of the occurence of the epidemic in the area in a larger scale than that of last year.
Meanwhile, blood test services have been given to 24,500 persons and those who are found infected are being treated, Kemal added.
According to the report, most of the victims of the epidemic are expectant mothers and children.
NAIROBI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaria is resurging in many countries where it has been sharply reduced or even eradicated and more than a third of the world's total population now live in malaria endemic areas, experts say Wednesday.
It is estimated that 300 to 500 million clinical cases and 1.5 to 2.7 million deaths occur due to malaria each year, about twice as many as 20 years ago, according to papers presented at the third Pan-African Conference on Malaria which ended here Wednesday.
About 100 experts and senior health officials from 34 African countries attended the continent's top-level anti-malaria meeting which started Sunday.
Currently the number of countries and regions suffering from the disease reaches 100, said a press release issued by the conference.
Annual number of deaths of children under five years of age attributed to malaria hits one million, the experts said, "During the last 10 years, malaria has killed 10 times more children than all the wars that have raged over the same period".
Rapidly increased drug resistance is leaving populations with no effective drug for prevention against or treatment of the eighth lethal killer in the world -- the top one in Africa -- the experts noted.
"Malaria is thus much more lethal in 1998 than in 1968," they claimed.
"There is urgent need for research into new malaria compounds" and more urgent need for enhanced joint efforts especially by African countries to fight the disease, they said.
Sub-Saharan Africa hosts more than 90 percent of Malaria victims.
"At present, the only organized effort, in the continent, addressing this issue (malaria) systematically is the African Malaria Vaccine Testing Network," said Assistant Executive Secretary Robert Mshana of the Organization of African Unity.
The conference is aimed at enabling experts to exchange scientific findings on epidemiology, therapeutic strategies and the implementation of national anti-malaria programs.
The participants also studied the possibilities for the establishment of a multi-national South-South cooperation on researches and training in the field.
UNITED NATIONS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations system launched a campaign here Friday to combat malaria which kills about 1 million children every year.
In his message welcoming the campaign, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the fight against malaria enables the U.N. to focus its efforts on an issue "which has caused so much suffering in Africa and other developing regions for all too long".
Malaria causes an estimated 300 to 300 million acute cases per year, with most deaths occurring among children in Africa.
Studies have found that poor health via disability from diseases such as malaria reduces incomes by as much as 12 percent in affected developing countries, according to U.N. information.
The use of simple prevention and control methods has shown starting results, the U.N. said.
For instance, in trials conducted in Gambia, Burkina Faso, Kenya and Ghana, the use of insecticide-treated bed nets was shown to effectively protect sleeping children from malarial mosquitoes, resulting in dramatic reductions in deaths.
Based on satellite mapping and climatic information, the distribution of malaria can now be determined at the community level and the information will benefit national and international efforts for malaria control.
New discoveries have led to a variety of approaches to a malaria vaccine, with many of the possibilities already undergoing human trials.
However, scientists estimate that it will take seven to 15 years before an effective malaria vaccine is ready.
HARARE, November 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will spend 1.3 million U.S.
Dollars on insecticides this season to control the malaria-causing parasite,Zimbabwean Health and Child Welfare Secretary Paulinas Sikosana said today.
Sikosana made the statements at a meeting at which the 1996/97 malaria prevention and control campaign was launched.
He told the participants that an additional 600,000 U.S.
Dollars would be spent on anti-malarial drugs.
The money was not enough to eliminate the disease and it is up to the provincial medical officers to mobilise additional resources to support the programme in their areas, he added.
More than 6,000 people are estimated to have died from malaria this year, with most of the deaths occurring between January and May.
Sikosana said health officials should educate the community on how malaria is contracted and how it can be prevented.
The World Health Organisation resident representative Levon Arevshatian said more than 90 percent of all malaria cases in the world were in sub-Saharan Africa.
Arevshatian said 1.5 to 2.7 million people died from the disease each year, especially among children below five years.
GENEVA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will host the first major summit on accelerating action against malaria in Africa on April 25,the World Health Organization (WHO) announced here Wednesday.
More than 50 African heads of state, G8 heads of state, the heads of 10 international development agencies and a dozen development and health ministers have been invited to the summit, said WHO.
Leaders whose countries are most seriously affected have already accepted.
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo will chair the summit which is being co-organized by WHO.
Malaria causes more than one million deaths each year, according to WHO which coordinates the global partnership Roll Back Malaria initiative that aims to halve the numbers of malaria deaths by the year 2020.
The majority who die are African children and deaths linked to malaria in Africa overall are increasing, WHO said.
At the end of the summit, heads of state will issue a declaration on tackling malaria in Africa and new statistics on the crippling effect malaria has on economic development in African countries will also be launched.
One week before the summit, on April 18, the world's largest bednet will be unveiled with hundreds of African school children.
The Guinness Book of Records will be present to record the event.
WHO hopes that the event will draw attention to the urgent need to provide more insecticide treated bednets in Africa, adding that insecticide treated nets are one of the most effective tools for the prevention and control of malaria.
PARIS _ Malaria hurts African economies more than has been recognized but could be better controlled for relatively little money, according to a new study to be released Tuesday.
The study, by the Harvard Center for International Development and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, will be presented in Nigeria at the first conference at which African heads of state will meet to discuss malaria, which kills more than 1 million people a year, most of them children.
Analyzing the effects of malaria on 27 African economies between 1965 and 1990, the study concluded that the disease cut one percentage point a year from the annual growth rates of those economies.
If malaria had been eliminated in 1965, the annual gross domestic product of Africa would now be $400 billion rather than $300 billion, the study estimated.
The study's economic models, according to Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard center, took into account more than the costs of treatment and losses associated with death.
They also estimated the losses from tourists and foreign investors who avoid malaria-prone countries, the damage done by large numbers of sick children missing school and the increase in population and impoverishment when parents have extra children because they know some will die.
In most affected countries, the disease crosses class lines.
``It doesn't matter if you are rich or poor _ your chances of catching it are high,'' said Nils Delaire, president of the Global Health Council, a participant in the conference.
The conference this week in Abuja, Nigeria, is sponsored by the World Health Organization and will draw together U.N. agencies, the World Bank, Western donors and the heads of 20 African countries in a Roll Back Malaria campaign that hopes to halve deaths from malaria, a mosquito-borne disease, within 10 years.
The chief weapon the sponsors endorse is a simple one: bed nets treated with insecticide.
After that, they favor more spraying to kill mosquito larvae, education of rural people in the use of simple blood tests and cheap drugs to keep patients alive until they can reach doctors.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Nets alone could cut the disease by half, but only 2 percent of all African children sleep under them.
Each $8 spent on prevention adds about a year of healthy life to an African, according to Ann Mills, one of the London School analysts who worked on the study.
``World spending on malaria control and research for Africa is maybe 10 cents per case per year,'' said Sachs.
``It's quite dreadful.
World Bank lending for malaria is de minimus.
The big pharmaceutical companies see it as a disease of the very poor, so they never view it as much of an investment priority''.
Meanwhile, he said, many malaria-prone countries have per capita incomes of less than $300 and health budgets too small for ``these very reasonable interventions''.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) Sachs suggested that Western nations could significantly cut the disease by spending $1 billion a year on malaria.
The U.S. share of that, he said, would be 75 cents per American.
``In a world where we're enjoying riches beyond what was imagined 20 years ago, we can afford to do more than we do,'' Sachs said.
He might even, he said, dare to also suggest $1 billion for AIDS and $1 billion for tuberculosis, for a total of $2.25 per American.
``I think Americans would readily come up with $10 per person if they believed it was cost-effective,'' he said.
``And bed nets aren't going to end up in a bank account in Switzerland''.
The Clinton administration is offering tax breaks of up to $1 billion for any company that invents a malaria vaccine, and the Gates Foundation, created by the founder of Microsoft, is investing $250 million in the research.
HARARE, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organisation (WHO) in collaboration with the southern African countries will hold a consultation and planning meeting on accelerated support for malaria prevention and control in the region between November 17 to 21 in Harare.
WHO said today in a statement the meeting was aimed at strengthening the consultation, planning, monitoring and evaluation of malaria control programmes in southern Aafrica.
It would also prepare annual work plans for 1998, establish systems for implementation and monitoring of integrated annual malaria work plans, develop a format for this year's annual reports and review the status and follow up on forecasting and epidemic preparedness in the region.
The development of a consensus for malaria survelliance, information systems and monitoring trends would also come under the spotlight as well as reviewing the report of the first southern Africa malaria conference and recommending strategies and methods for implementation and follow up.
At least 30 participants from Angola, Botswana, South Africa, Swaziland, Mozambique, Malawi, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Tanzania are expected to attend the meeting.
Malaria continues to be one of the most serious public health problems and a major obstacle to social and economic development in southern Africa.
LAGOS, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaria is spreading quickly in sub-Saharan Africa as a result of deforestation, global warming, creation of dams, irrigation schemes and commercial tree cropping, said a fact sheet released by the World Health Organization.
Malaria affects 40 percent of the world's population in more than 90 countries while over 90 percent of the cases are in Africa where there are increasing levels of chloroquine resistance, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Sunday quoted the recently-released WHO fact sheet as saying.
Malaria kills one million people every year in the world and the vast majority of deaths occur among young children and pregnant women in Africa, said the WHO's fact sheet.
It stated that the costs for the treatment of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa exceeded 2.1 billion U.S.
Dollars last year alone.
"In spite of drug resistance, malaria is a curable disease," it said, adding that research and development in malaria prevention and treatment have made advances.
Drug combinations for multi-drug resistance malaria and vaccines against malaria are being developed at the global level while insecticide-treated mosqui nets and curtains have emerged in recent years as a promising tool to prevent malaria disease.
The WHO, the World Bank and other U.N. organizations this year have joined forces to launch a new campaign called "Roll Back Malaria" to fight the disease.
Malaria was in its usual top spot on the agenda when 1,800 experts in travelers' health met in Montreal last month.
Malaria protozoa, which move in parasites spread by mosquito bites, have evolved strains resistant to drugs faster than human research can catch up.
There is no vaccine, and the disease causes the deaths of a million people annually in Africa alone.
There is considerable risk for American travelers.
Government figures show that from 1980 to 1995, it got reports of 3,513 civilian cases, of which the vast majority, 2,907, were contracted in sub-Saharan Africa.
All but 185 of the others were from Asia, the Caribbean and South America.
There were 59 deaths among these cases, 43 of which were contracted in sub-Saharan Africa.
This year, the conference of the International Society of Travel Medicine had a major new malaria drug to discuss, Malarone.
In the weeks just after, the computer exchanges of the society spun with talk of where the drug could be bought legally and, whether for prevention or treatment, what the cost would be.
Glaxo Wellcome is expecting approval of Malarone _ its name for pills combining atovaquone and proguanil _ by the Food and Drug Administration for sale in the United States as a preventive drug and as a treatment for malaria.
The company submitted its application in December.
So far, Malarone has been approved for both prevention and treatment in Denmark only, and is approved solely for treatment in Britain, although physicians there report giving it to travelers as a protective measure, too.
As a preventive, Malarone must be taken daily while mefloquine, which is now the most-prescribed drug in the United States for prevention of malaria, is taken weekly.
Physicians worry about travelers' compliance when drugs must be taken daily.
But mefloquine, sold under the trade name Lariam by Roche Holdings, is not recommended for people subject to seizures or psychiatric disorders.
News reports of nightmares and more serious side effects have caused apprehension, particularly in Britain.
These concerns mean that a new drug to ward off malaria is welcome.
Testing supervisors said the the possible side effects of Malarone were headache, abdominal pain, upper respiratory infection, pain, nausea or vomiting.
In Britain, Malarone costs (PS)2 a pill, or about $3.15.
It is expected to cost $2.50 to $3 or more in the United States _ a weekly cost of $17.50 to $21, against the $10 weekly for one Lariam pill.
Lariam is started one or two weeks before a traveler leaves to evaluate side effects, and is continued for four weeks after return.
Malarone, a Glaxo Wellcome spokesman said, is started one to two days before entering the malarious area, and is continued only seven days after return.
Mefloquine was developed when malaria evolved into a form that resisted the drug chloroquine.
Now resistance to mefloquine is reported in areas of Thailand and western Cambodia.
There are other drugs in the laboratory that may be developed for use when resistance to Malarone develops, which one expert estimated might be in about 10 years.
In any case, no malaria prophylaxis is 100 percent sure, and travelers should take careful precautions against night-biting mosquitoes in malarious areas, and should be aware of the symptoms _ fever and chills, muscle aches and headache, a situation often mistaken for influenza by physicians not aware that a patient may have traveled to a malarious area.
Prompt treatment is vital.
Physicians say that properly treated, malaria is not fatal.
Chickenpox was also on the agenda at the Montreal meeting.
Chickenpox is easily communicable _ for instance, one can catch it from a fellow passenger on a bus or plane.
In the United States, according to Dr.
Mary Wilson's reference work, ``A World Guide to Infections'' (Oxford), 90 percent of the cases occur in children under age 10, who are then usually immune for life.
Overseas, the disease is more common among adults, who may suffer serious consequences, including pneumonia and encephalitis.
It is important for adult Americans who are going to work among young people overseas or refugees, or who are traveling the backpack-and-hostel route to be immune to chickenpox.
That means travelers must know they have had it, or have been vaccinated against the varicella zoster virus with a vaccine that was licensed only in 1995.
In Montreal, Dr.
Elaine C.
Jong of the University of Washington School of Medicine presented a paper, ``Varicella Vaccine: Is It a Travel Immunization''? in which she concluded it probably was.
Others concurred.
``The pretravel clinic visit,'' Dr.
Jong said, ``is an opportunity to immunize susceptible healthy travelers against chickenpox, which could cause illness and exclusion from travel before, during or after the trip, and protects the residents in receiving countries against imported infection''.
For adults, the vaccine requires two injections.
At Travelers Medical Service in New York, the director, Rebecca W.
Acosta, said her questionnaire for pretravel visits asks clients whether they have had chickenpox.
If they are in doubt, she said, the clinic performs blood tests because they are cheaper than the course of two vaccinations, which costs a total of $150.
Most clients are found to be immune, she said.
Ms. Acosta said that some states and many school districts are now requiring chickenpox vaccinations because fewer Americans are getting the disease in childhood than formerly.
One problem is that the chickenpox vaccine is so new no one is sure how long it confers immunity.
Lyme vaccine is also on the list of recommended vaccines at the Acosta's clinic.
This is recommended for domestic travelers over 15 who are going climbing or camping in areas where Lyme disease has occurred.
Three shots, at $75 each, are recommended.
The schedule now recommends the second shot after 30 days and the third after a year, but this is likely to be modified to quicken full immunity.
The vaccine is not approved for children under 15.
A paper presented at the conference by Dr.
Martin Cetron of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and associates reported on research, not yet complete, into the deaths of three people _ aged 63, 67 and 79 _ who had received yellow fever vaccine.
The paper implies that the vaccine may be more dangerous to older people than to others.
The yellow fever vaccine is the only one for which the World Health Organization still condones requiring a certificate.
But, the WHO says, many countries require this certificate when the vaccination is not really needed.
Both the organization's book ``International Travel and Health; Vaccination Requirements and Health Advice'' and the CDC's ``Health Information for International Travel'' list the countries requiring the certificate, but those requirements are based on whether a traveler has recently been in a yellow fever area.
Some doctors say that colleagues may administer the yellow fever vaccine even when a traveler is going directly from the United States to a country requiring a certificate only for those arriving from infected areas.
Cetron said that a great deal more research into the specifics of the three cases was ahead, but that one thing was clear: Physicians and clinics should be sure that the traveler's itinerary requires yellow fever vaccine.
Mrs. Acosta said that requirements were often misinterpreted; for India, for example, it depends where the traveler will be only in the six days preceding arrival.
Another health warning emerged as summer began: A flu epidemic in Alaska and the Yukon Territory of Canada.
According to the Centers for Disease Control, 428 acute respiratory infections among tourists and 104 among tourism workers from May 22 to June 29.
Four tourists were hospitalized with pneumonia, and the centers said that laboratory analysis indicated that the illnesses were influenza A, a viral infection.
Last year, almost 5,000 people on land and sea tours in the area fell ill and four died of flu.
The CDC suggested that travelers at risk for flu, including people over 65, speak to their doctors before leaving and ask about taking along prescription antiviral pills, either amantadine or rimantadine.
Cetron said that antivirals, taken within 48 hours of flu symptoms, could lessen the risk of complications.
The flu vaccine for next year will not be prepared until fall.
The 1999-2000 edition of ``Health Information for International Travel'' made its debut at the conference.
This big yellow book, which most commercial travel-health guides lean on, has been reformatted for clarity and legibility.
The information on malaria risk and prophylaxis has been updated as of April, and the section on recommendations for the HIV-positive travelers has been expanded and shifted to a section on travelers with special needs.
The book is sold by the superintendent of documents, (202) 512-1800 as document No.
017-023-00202-3. It costs $22 in the United States; $27 from overseas.
OUAGADOUGOU, June 10 (Xinhua) -- African leaders have once again pledged their effort to fight against malaria which is plaguing the world's poorest continent and claiming a large number of lives every year.
The 34th assembly of heads of state and government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in a decision calls upon all member states to commit additional human and material resources for malaria prevention and control, including disease surveillance and research, in line with the development of health sector reform.
It also asks them to mobilize all partners, public and private, local and foreign, to support the execution of malaria prevention and control activities as part of the economic recovery and development.
At the same time, the assembly requests the World Health Organization (WHO) to continue working closely with the OAU to coordinate efforts aimed at the eradication of malaria from the African continent and to increase its level of support in that respect.
The summit acknowledged the initiative and critical role played by WHO in 1997, specifically the generous assistance provided by the director-general through the accelerated program of malaria control in Africa, the actions taken to develop strong community-based approaches to ensure sustainability of control and the continuing support in 1998.
You may wonder why I would write a health column about malaria when there is no malaria in the United States.
Well, that is only partly true.
Malaria is not endemic in this country or to Canada or Europe.
But one-third of the world's population lives where the malaria parasite and its carrier mosquitoes thrive, and every year more than 1 million Americans travel to those areas for business or pleasure.
Malaria, it seems, is gaining ground annually as control efforts become more costly and cumbersome.
Worldwide there are 300 million to 500 million cases of malaria and 2 million to 3 million deaths from the disease each year.
And each year the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta receives reports of 1,000 to 1,200 cases of malaria that were acquired abroad but diagnosed in this country.
A malaria expert at the centers, Dr.
Trenton Ruebush, estimates that an equal number of unreported cases occur among United States residents.
But Ruebush said that all malaria deaths that occur in the United States, normally four or five a year, are probably reported.
Why so many cases, and why should anyone die of a disease that doctors have long known how to cure?
Because many people outside the endemic areas do not take malaria seriously and ignore the measures recommended to prevent it or are careless about them.
When the flu-like symptoms of malaria develop, they are often not acted on soon enough.
In addition, outside of endemic areas, doctors often fail to recognize the symptoms of malaria and thus do not make the correct diagnosis or treat the disease properly or quickly enough to cure it.
Complicating matters, preventive measures have gotten trickier and much more costly in recent years, ever since the malaria parasite in most areas developed resistance to chloroquine, the inexpensive and well-tolerated medication that had long been used to prevent and treat malaria.
Current options cost a lot more and are associated with potentially more serious side effects.
Furthermore, there is currently no effective anti-malarial vaccine, nor is there one on the immediate horizon, despite efforts by scientists in the United States and elsewhere to uncover the parasite's Achilles heel and block its ability to flourish in the human body.
A WILY PARASITE Malaria is a disease of the tropics and subtropics.
Its range extends as far north as the Mediterranean, Middle East, Mexico, Northern India and China and as far south as South Africa, Argentina and New Guinea.
There are four types of the malaria parasite that normally infect people, and only one _ Plasmodium falciparum _ is potentially deadly.
P. falciparum flourishes in Africa, where it is responsible for 95 percent of cases.
In fact, Ruebush said, 90 percent of all malaria infections and 90 percent of malaria deaths occur in Africa.
In other endemic areas, falciparum malaria is responsible for 5 percent to 50 percent of cases.
The other three types, P.
vivax, P.
ovale and P.
malariae, are far less virulent, although they can make their victims quite miserable for varying lengths of time.
As Dr.
Robert S.
Desowitz, an expert in tropical diseases, explains in his engrossing book ``The Malaria Capers'' (W.W.
Norton, 1991), a malaria infection in humans begins when an infected female Anopheles mosquito, seeking a blood meal to foster the development of her eggs, injects into the human bloodstream threadlike malaria parasites called sporozoites that have been stored in her salivary glands.
Thousands of sporozoites are usually injected into the blood with one mosquito bite, and they quickly invade the cells in the liver where they multiply.
In this period, the infected person experiences no symptoms.
The first symptoms appear about 10 to 35 days later when the liver cells burst and the spores enter the blood stream, causing intense chills and sweating with high fever.
Then the symptoms come and go _ usually in 24- to 72-hour cycles _ as the tiny parasites feed on the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin of the infected person's red blood cells.
Each cycle can render the victim more anemic with less and less oxygen reaching the brain and other vital tissues.
Ruebush said that two of the nondeadly species could remain alive in a person's liver for up to a couple of years, periodically causing relapses of malarial symptoms.
The other nonfatal form can hide in the body outside the liver for up to 30-40 years, waiting for some unknown signal to trigger its emergence and cause a recurrence of symptoms.
The deadly species, P.
falciparum, causes the most severe symptoms, but if the victim does not get treated and does not die, the infection burns itself out within a year or two.
PREVENTION AND TREATMENT Since there is no vaccine against malaria, prevention depends on two important measures: taking a drug that combats the parasite prophylactically _ that is, in advance of any known infection _ and avoiding bites by the Anopheles mosquito.
In the few areas where there is still little or no chloroquine resistance, this drug is taken weekly starting one week prior to departure for the endemic area, weekly while there and for four weeks after returning home.
For most endemic areas where chloroquine-resistant parasites flourish, the Centers for Disease Control now recommends mefloquine, sold under the trade name of Lariam.
This drug is taken one time a week before departure, each week while in the malaria area and for four weeks after returning.
It is extremely effective but expensive _ about $7 a tablet _ so for a two-week trip the cost is about $50.
Lariam can sometimes cause anxiety, depression, hallucinations and insomnia, and in one in 10,000 or 15,000 cases, these side effects are incapacitating.
A trip-mate of mine to Panama developed sky-high blood pressure, fever, shaking chills, severe anxiety, hallucinations and was unable to walk on her own, all attributed to Lariam.
It took her months to recover.
An equally effective alternative to Lariam is doxycycline, which is recommended for northern Thailand, where mefloquine resistance has been detected.
Doxycycline has to be taken daily, starting one to two days before departure and continued for four weeks after returning.
Anyone who chooses doxycycline must be very conscientious about taking it every day; if you miss a couple of days, you are unprotected.
Among the possible side effects are upset stomach, yeast infection in women and increased sensitivity to the sun _ which means you must remain covered to avoid a severe sunburn.
A standby treatment is the drug Fansidar, which can cause rather severe skin rashes.
It is used only as an emergency treatment, should symptoms suspicious of malaria develop when the person is far from medical care.
But even if one takes Fansidar, it is vital to get to a doctor for thorough treatment as soon as possible.
Ruebush emphasized that preventive medication is only one measure.
Travelers should be aware of the habits of the Anopheles mosquito, which typically reigns in rural areas and bites between dusk and dawn (although in heavily shaded jungle areas it may bite in daylight).
Use of protective clothing and insect repellent and a mosquito net over the bed at night (preferably first dipped in a solution of insecticide) are important parts of malaria prevention.
Anyone who develops a fever a week to a month after being in an area where malaria is a problem must report immediately to a doctor, who should do a blood smear right away.
As Ruebush said, ``Malaria is eminently curable if it is caught early and treated appropriately''.
Many large cities now have clinics that advise travelers and administer vaccines.
State and local health departments may also be helpful.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has a malaria hotline _ 770-488-7788 _ that can be reached 24 hours a day every day and where callers can request a faxed copy of protective information.
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- African leaders today reaffirmed their "unflagging resolve" to prevent the outbreak of malaria which claims 4,200 lives every day on the continent.
The leaders, ending their 33rd summit here, issued a declaration which considers malaria control in Africa as one of the continent's priority programs.
The declaration said African countries "support fully the implementation of the Global and Regional Strategy and approaches recommended by the World Health Organization".
African countries, the declaration said, will implement well planned and coordinated malaria control programs involving individuals, families, communities, institutions, relevant government ministries, and other public and private sectors.
The declaration called on African countries to allocate sufficient human, financial and material resources, and mobilize other local resources including resources from non-governmental and private and civil sectors, for the sustained prevention and control of malaria in Africa.
Efforts should also be made to mobilize additional external resources from international agencies, governmental and non-governmental agencies, foundations and industrial and commercial enterprises to support national and commercial action to control malaria and surveillance to prevent epidemics and sustain the progress already made, the declaration said.
It suggested the following actions: -- Give full political support to actions directed towards sustainable malaria preventioan and control as an urgent priority; -- Further develop and implement plans for malaria prevention and control, including incorporation into development projects based on environmental and health impact assessments; -- Develop strong community based programs to mobilize active community participation for malaria prevention and control; -- Promote and support micro-financing schemes, especially for women, to initiate income generating projects aimed at basic environmental and household improvements; -- Develop mechanisms that will facilitate and ensure well coordinated multisectoral action to reduce substantially the burden of malaria and promote inter-country collaboration and coordination of efforts; and -- Promote basic and operational research to ensure that new tools, including vaccines, are made available without delay and existing ones are used in the most cost-effective and sustainable manner.
HANOI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaria spread in 14 central and central highland provinces of Vietnam in the first seven months this year, Vietnam News Agency reported Tuesday.
The number of malaria patients and deaths increased by 5.71 percent and 14.9 percent respectively in these provinces.
Seven of 14 provinces in the region saw rapid increases in the number of malaria patients, and 54 deaths were reported.
32 villages in seven communes of Tra My district of Quang Nam province had outbreaks of malaria, with 15,000 people infected.
The worsening epidemic is attributed to neglect of prevention measures against the deadly disease.
Unseasonably warm weather, which caused the rapid development of mosquito sectors, low standards of living, limited awareness of malaria and a weak health care network were other factors to blame.
To remedy the situation, local health care networks would be strengthened, disease prevention facilities better supplied and awareness on malaria prevention raised, reports said.
enditem nnnn
HANOI, January 28 (xinhua) -- The number of malaria deaths in Vietnam last year dropped by 70 percent compared with that of 1995, local media reported today.
Only 198 cases were reported in the year against 660 cases in 1995.
The achievement was attributed to the joint efforts of the medical sector at different levels and the anti-malaria teams preventing outbreaks of the disease.
The medical teams have provided medicines to 2-2.5 million people and distributed three million mosquito-nets for malaria prevention in remote and mountainous areas.
This year, the health care service plans to promote health care awareness, teach people how to prevent malaria by themselves, help village medical stations to detect malaria patients, and provide mosquito-nets to all people in remote, isolated and mountainous areas.
MANILA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has made a big stride in malaria control with malaria infections rate in the country is now generally low, a senior health official said today.
Malaria infection rate in the Philippine has been reduced from a yearly 7.4 per 1000 in 1994 to 3.8 per 1000 in 1996, according to Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica.
"The massive infusion of logistics, training of key personnel, the active support of local governments and communities, have resulted to the marked improvement of the malaria situation in the past six years," Reodica said in a statement.
From 1991 to 1996, the health chief noted, the confirmed cases of malaria were reduced from 86,392 to 39,855.
The malaria control program is being implemented by the Department of Health through its regional field offices in collaboration with 824 local government workers, she said.
Although funding for the program has been drastically reduced, "the achievement in control and prevention is significant," Reodica said.
The Philippines is also in step with the World Health Organization target of a 50 percent reduction in Malaria cases in the Western Pacific region in the year 2000, she added.
The health department has recently officially declared the elimination of Malaria in 13 provinces out of 78 provinces in the country.
Reodica said that out of the remaining provinces where malaria is endemic, 16 have infection rates of less than one per l000 population per year, three have had no indigenous case in the past two years.
The malaria problems in the country are mainly concentrated among farmers, forest workers, charcoal makers, migrant workers and settlers in hard-to-reach communities, including provincial boarders, cultural minorities slash and frontier areas, she said.
UNITED NATIONS _ Three major U.N. agencies and the World Bank said Friday that they were joining forces in a coordinated campaign against malaria, a leading killer of the world's poorest people.
Malaria, which is reaching epidemic proportions in Africa and parts of Asia, Latin America and the southern fringe of the former Soviet Union, kills about a million people a year, and children are especially vulnerable.
Experts say one child dies of malaria every 30 seconds.
Around the world, malaria kills 3,000 children under 5 every day, a higher mortality rate than AIDS.
Research on prevention and cures for malaria has been all but nonexistent in big pharmaceutical companies for more than two years because the drugs proved not to be money-makers, experts said Friday.
At the same time the parasites that cause malaria and the mosquitoes that carry them have alarmed public health officials with their fast-evolving resistance to most known medicines and insecticides.
``We're dealing here with just about the cleverest pathogen that's known to human medical science,'' said Dr.
David Nabarro of Britain's foreign aid agency, who will become manager of the anti-malaria program in January.
The project will be coordinated by the World Health Organization in Geneva, in cooperation with the U.N.
Development Program, UNICEF and the World Bank.
The new drive against malaria is the first big project undertaken by the World Health Organization's new director general, Dr.
Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway and a public health specialist.
She took over the huge agency in May, vowing to shake it up and make it more responsive to immediate needs.
At a news conference Friday she called malaria a cause of rising human suffering that targets the young and the weak, and said her project, to be called Roll Back Malaria, was prompted in large part by calls for help from African leaders.
Experts say 90 percent of malaria cases are in sub-Saharan Africa.
Dr. Brundtland also said that this project will be a ``pathfinder'' in better U.N. cooperation.
The anti-malarial drive will draw on each participating agency's special expertise, pooling resources in an effort to eliminate costly overlaps.
It is a policy in line with Secretary-General Kofi Annan's management reforms, which seek to streamline the way the organization works and make it more effective.
The leaders of the cooperating agencies said Friday that the anti-malaria drive will include efforts to generate new research in the pharmaceutical industry and to raise money from reluctant governments, as well as local efforts to provide health centers with insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets for village beds and packets of fast-acting pills or suppositories for malaria sufferers.
The budget for the first year has been estimated at about $19 million for the organizations involved, with additional money being sought from governments where the disease is rampant and the labor force is weakened or reduced as a result.
``Funding is less of an issue than getting governments to focus on malaria,'' said James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, at Friday's news conference.
``We are trying to make the case to financiers that this is central to the economic development of Africa''.
James Gustave Speth, administrator of the U.N.
Development Program, said his agency was well placed to look at the environmental situation in countries struck by malaria _ issues of sanitation, for example.
He said the ``social fallout'' of malaria was also of concern to his agency.
Carol Bellamy, executive director of UNICEF, the U.N. children's fund, said her organization would focus, as it already does, on local-level work in poor communities, where malaria contributes significantly to a high maternal mortality rate and to a high incidence of anemia among women and children.
Nabarro, now strategic director for human development at Britain's Department for International Development, said in an interview Friday that ``collective brainpower'' was necessary if health officials had any hope of even halving malaria deaths in a decade.
He said wiping out malaria is an impossible goal.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Nabarro, who has worked in Iraq and Nepal as well as Africa, and taught international community health at the Liverpool School of Medicine, explained that the project did not have a single goal, like some public health campaigns.
``What we're instead trying to do is approach an incredibly complicated health issue that's associated partly with the way in which people have to live, partly with a parasite that has one of the best disguises that we know _ in the face of any threat it can change its coat _ and an insect vector that seems to be able to shake off insecticides almost as quickly as we produce them''.
Dr. Tore Godal of Norway, a tropical medicine expert who is now acting director of the anti-malaria program, said in an interview that one of the best hopes of finding medicine to cure the disease may be in a plant cultivated in China and used there and in Vietnam as a very effective treatment.
The plant is the ching hao su.
``The Chinese have used it for more than 2,000 years against fevers,'' Godal said.
The World Health Organization has been encouraging China to make medicines from the plant to standards that would meet international requirements, Godal said.
He said that the compound in ching hao su attacks malaria so quickly and at so many levels that it also seems to help curtail the spread of the disease by destroying parasites before they can be passed on.
Godal has also been involved in trying to persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in anti-malarial drugs.
He said only one, Smith Kline Beecham, has showed much interest.
``The Vietnamese war actually made the U.S.
Army invest big in malaria drug development, and so some pharmaceutical companies took up leads from that effort,'' he said.
But today, he said, ``There is no sufficient commercial market for the drugs,'' so pharmaceutical companies are shying away from projects like this that would take years to show a profit.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have discovered a possible new way to vaccinate against malaria, which kills up to 3 million people a year and sickens an additional 300 million.
Creating a vaccine is crucial because the parasite has begun developing resistance to drugs used to treat malaria, and even mosquitos that spread the disease are withstanding pesticides.
But finding a malaria vaccine has proved exceptionally difficult, and testing in 1997 concluded the candidate long thought the best hope was actually worthless.
The reason most vaccine attempts have failed is that they focused on just one part of the malaria parasite's complex life cycle.
But researchers from the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from India have created a multipronged vaccine designed to make the immune system fight the parasite at many stages: When the mosquito bite sends it into the body, when it invades the liver and when infection moves into the bloodstream.
Rabbits immunized with the new vaccine produced antibodies that prevented malaria parasites from invading liver cells and from replicating in the blood, the researchers reported Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Just because the vaccine stimulates a rabbit's immune system doesn't mean it would work in people, cautioned parasitologist Anthony Holder of London's National Institute for Medical Research.
The CDC hopes further testing in primates will prove promising enough to try the vaccine in people.

HARARE, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Africa is optimistic in its endeavors to eradicate malaria which has affected the social and economic development of the continent, health experts meeting in Harare said.
The experts who met for the two-day preparatory committee meeting on the African initiative for malaria control in the 21st century were from different institutions affiliated to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Saturday.
According to a provisional report released Saturday in Harare, the meeting which ended Thursday resolved to develop an effective and timely malaria surveillance and information system.
That would help develop a practical malaria control strategy in all malaria endemic countries by the year 2005.
It was also envisaged that by the year 2030, malaria would no longer be the major cause of deaths in Africa.
The targets adopted by the meeting included reduction of malaria mortality by 50 percent by the year 2010, and reduce by at least half the socio-economic negatives of malaria.
The experts said they were encouraged to come up with the strategy which channeled 10 million U.S.
Dollars towards malaria control in Africa last year.
A further boost to their initiatives was through the commitment of African leaders to combat the disease as evidenced by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Harare Declaration on Malaria Prevention and Control signed in June 1997 in Zimbabwe's capital city.
The meeting also suggested that a competent interim secretariat be urgently recruited.
The secretariat would have a degree of operational independence from WHO.
It was also recommended at the meeting that an African Initiative for Malaria (AIM) steering committee be elected based on a coalition of major stakeholders and medical personnel to develop the fight against malaria.
LAGOS, August 4 (Xinhua) -- A recent research study in Nigeria has shown that children under six months old could suffer from malaria, a situation which was previously considered unimaginable.
Scientists hold that children at that age and below were never thought to have malaria parasites because it was assumed they were protected from the disease by the immunity acquired at birth, the Panafrican News Agency reported Wednesday.
However, the study says that the discovery could assist medical practitioners to adequately treat infant babies who presented vague symptoms of malaria.
The study, sponsored by the African Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the Nigeria Institute of Medical Research, aims at ascertaining the current trend of the malaria scourge among communities along the coastal areas of Nigeria.
Dr. Bamigboye Afolabi, who led a team of the researchers in Ibeshe Island, an isolated coastal village in Lagos State, said that about 30 percent of the 450 children seen in the first part of the study had malaria parasite.
"This research will definitely lead to improvement in the tools for diagnosis and treatment of malaria and its prevention," he said.
"Most importantly, it will not only reduce the severity of the ailment among pregnant women and children, but reduce the high mortality due to the disease".
Afolabi said that the detailed result of the study had been forwarded to the WHO, adding that its findings could be applicable to other parts of tropical Africa, as well as other malaria endemic regions.
Statistics show that more than 80 percent of the population of sub- Saharan Africa are at risk of malaria.
According to Lateef Salako, Director-General of the Nigeria Institute of Medical Research, "of the approximately 300 million cases of malaria estimated to occur globally every year, over 85 percent are from Africa, and of the estimated two to three million annual deaths, over 90 percent are in Africa."
And Merante notes that there are some benefits to being an openly gay candidate.
``It can be easier to raise money and recruit volunteers, and a more moderate candidate can gain support among some liberal non-gay voters''.
Money, obviously, plays an important role in campaigns.
And in California, San Diego City Councilor Christine Kehoe, a congressional candidate and lesbian, had raised $705,624 through the end of June, as compared with GOP incumbent Brian Bilbray's $650,123, according to Federal Election Commission figures.
That cash is expected to give Kehoe _ the Democratic nominee _ a strong chance to become the first openly gay woman elected to national office.
It is a title that Tracy would like, as would Tammy Baldwin, in Wisconsin, or retired Army Colonel Margarethe Cammermeyer in Washington, who was discharged from the military in 1992 after saying she was a lesbian.
Both are running for Congress.
Like the other congressional candidates, they are offering themselves as candidates who happen to be gay, not gay candidates.
&QL; ----- &QC; &QL; In 1974 _ the year after the American Psychiatric Association erased homosexuality from its compendium of mental illnesses _ Elaine Noble, openly gay, was elected to the Massachusetts Legislature.
She is believed to have been the first openly gay person ever elected to a state office anywhere in the country.
Since then, there has been a trickle of openly gay candidates, and more like Frank, who ``came out'' after serving in office.
``Any minority that feels oppressed is going to be more politicized than the mainstream,'' says Merante.
``Issues such as family life, taxes, and inheritance are problems if you are gay and tend to make people think and act politically''.
But one reason for the gay community's relatively quick fluency in politics is AIDS, say gay activists.
``AIDS brought gay people to the fore like no other thing had,'' says Mary Bonauto, civil rights director for Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders.
``The community was ravaged and had to come out to their families, interact with the medical system in a way they had not before.
Doctors and nurses saw committed, caring relationships between men, people caring for their partners to death''.
Frank says he doubts he would have won his tough first election if he had announced in 1980 that he was gay.
But, he says, the more that people come out, the more it diminishes prejudices.
``It is a very powerful force, a very successful reality check, and the average American is a lot less homophobic that he or she thinks they are supposed to be,'' he says.
Another reason for the double-digit number of gay candidates in Massachusetts is that it is, well, Massachusetts.
According to Victory Fund, there are 12 openly gay elected officeholders in the state, from municipal officials in Cambridge and Northampton to state Representative Liz Malia and Frank.
It is the highest number of gay officeholders, per capita, in the country.
``Gay and lesbian candidates feel they no longer have to hide in the closet, especially within the Commonwealth,'' says Dana Hilliard, a candidate from Newburyport running for a state legislative seat.
``It is a sign of how accepting this state is''.
Hilliard has served three terms as a state representative in New Hampshire _ but when he campaigned in the Granite State, he was not open about his sexual orientation.
And Miller says that ``Massachusetts is a special case; the political atmosphere here is more open.
Michael Duffy is running on the Republican ticket'' for state auditor.
In fact, the only other Republican candidate in either the Massachusetts or congressional races who is openly gay, is US Representative Jim Kolbe, of Arizona.
Like Frank, Kolbe announced his sexual orientation after several terms in office.
Miller also credits former Governor William Weld, a Republican who supported the gay movement, with helping make Massachusetts a more tolerant state.
``When I was working on `In Search of Gay America,' I went to Mississippi to interview a gay Republican, and when word got out that he might be gay, he withdrew from the race,'' recalls Miller.
``Almost all of these people are Democrats, and that is really significant''.
Mark Goshko, the local president of the Log Cabin, an organization of gay Republicans, notes that recruiting candidates _ gay or straight _ to run for office has been harder for Republicans than Democrats.
``In Massachusetts, the Democratic Party has much higher registration, and recruiting GOP candidates has been a general problem,'' he says.
Despite that, Goshko says, ``This is the year that the floodgates have opened for gay candidates.
Until this year really, fairly few people would run''.
What does Noble, the pioneer in 1974, think about the number of candidates?
``On the one hand,'' she says, ``it surprises me there are so many, and on the other, it saddens me there are so few.
And it is sad that folks say `You are gay' before they say `What are your stands on the issues'?
``Sometimes, I feel like a grandmother sitting off in the corner, clucking.
Win, lose, or show, they do advance issues tremendously, and they are all smart and bright.
Even if they come in last, they have won by being there''.
&QL; (Matthew Brelis is the Globe's Focus writer.)
WASHINGTON _ Democratic and Republican lawmakers predicted Tuesday that the House will reject legislation that would nullify President Clinton's executive order barring federal agencies from discriminating against people based on sexual orientation.
The House is scheduled to vote on the issue this week when Rep.
Joel Hefley, R-Colo.
, offers it as an amendment to a $28 billion appropriations bill funding different government agencies.
``I think we will defeat Hefley,'' said Rep.
Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.
, the only openly gay House Republican and a critic of the measure.
``But I never take these things for granted''.
Rep. John Linder, R-Ga.
, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said he ``wouldn't be surprised'' if the Hefley measure is defeated.
``There's some very hard work being done'' to defeat the proposal, Linder said.
Kolbe said he expects the 20-minute debate on the Hefley amendment to stay focused on the topic of discrimination against gays and lesbians.
Republican leaders, concerned that their party could be perceived as anti-gay, had hoped to focus the debate on presidential powers.
To that end, the GOP House leadership had combined Hefley's proposal with legislation to nullify another executive order expanding federal jurisdiction at the expense of state and local governments.
However, President Clinton last week rescinded the executive order dealing with federalism, thus blunting the Republican move to convert the gay-discrimination debate into a dry discourse on constitutional powers.
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
, an acknowledged homosexual and a leading congressional spokesman for gay rights, also predicted that the Hefley amendment ``is likely to lose''.
``We're talking about discrimination,'' Frank said.
``I think most people don't want to be associated with it''.
Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla.
, who was among a group of Republicans counting votes on the Hefley amendment, also predicted it would fail.
``It seems a number of members have looked at it and come to the conclusion that it was mean-spirited,'' Foley said.
He opposes the amendment.
Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif.
, said Clinton's executive order barring federal agencies from discriminating against gays ``is the kind of thing we need to see more of''.
Clinton's May executive order added ``sexual orientation'' to a 1969 executive order by President Richard Nixon, which bars federal agencies from discriminating based on race, color, religion, gender, national origin, disability or age.
``It's not a Democrat or a Republican issue,'' Bilbray said.
``When it comes to the workplace, we shouldn't tolerate any discrimination''.
Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for Log Cabin Republicans, a gay advocacy group, said he is ``cautiously optimistic'' that the Hefley amendment will fail because of opposition among House Republicans.
Members of Congress ``are being confronted with this issue head-on without an escape hatch,'' Ivers said.
``This vote is unlike any vote we've seen in years.
It is a complete confrontation between those who believe in discrimination and those who oppose discrimination against gays.
There is no middle ground''.
Last week, the House approved a measure aimed at San Francisco's ``domestic partners'' law.
That ordinance requires private contractors who do business with the city to bestow the same benefits _ mainly health insurance coverage _ on the unmarried partners of their employees as they confer on the spouses of their married employees.
The San Francisco policy was enacted two years ago after intense lobbying by gay rights advocates.
By a 214-212 vote, the House approved a measure sponsored by Rep.
Frank Riggs, R-Calif.
, that would bar San Francisco from spending federal money unless the city revokes the ordinance.
The Riggs amendment is expected to fail in the Senate.
WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov.
George W.
Bush's top campaign strategist defended the Republican presidential frontrunner's controversial decision to snub leaders of a gay GOP group, asserting Wednesday that the Log Cabin Republicans have been critical of Bush on several issues.
The strategist, Karl Rove, said the group's leaders have asked for meetings with Bush ``with the stated purpose of coming in and explaining why Governor Bush is wrong on gay adoption or why he is wrong on broadening the Texas hate-crimes bill'' to protect gays against attacks based on their sexual orientation.
Rove, who is based in Austin, Texas, added in a meeting with reporters here that ``the national office of the Log Cabin Republicans has been critical of Bush and is in fact doing a fund-raiser for John McCain''.
The governor has ``a limited amount of time, and we're just not going to set aside right now a time to meet with (Log Cabin leaders) and talk about their dialogue,'' Rove said.
Besides his hate-crimes and anti-gay-adoption positions, Bush, as governor, has refused to support gay marriages.
Rove held out the possibility of a future meeting between the group and Bush but said the candidate already enjoys support among gays.
``We have gay Republican supporters and advisers who are involved in the campaign and whom we meet with regularly,'' he said.
Kevin Ivers, spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, the nation's largest GOP homosexual group, called Rove's remarks ``very disappointing''.
He added that ``his comments are not at all reflective of the long and cordial relationship that we had with him for months''.
Rich Tafel, the group's executive director, said Bush ``has created what has become a confrontational situation.
We have now heard five different reasons why they won't meet with us.
Now it's because we attack them.
The campaign is saying, `We don't need to hear your opinions.
Get on board'''.
The controversy began after Bush's response last month to a question on NBC's ``Meet the Press''.
Asked whether he would meet with the Log Cabin Republicans, Bush replied, ``Probably not''.
He contended that such a meeting would create ``a huge political scene,'' and added, ``I am someone who is a uniter, not a divider.
I don't believe in group thought, pitting one group of people against another.
And all that does is create kind of a huge political, you know, nightmare for people''.
Arizona Sen.
John McCain, who also is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, recently met with the Log Cabin Republicans in Washington.
Like Bush, McCain opposes gay marriage and adoption and new hate-crime laws, but he told the group he would battle discrimination against gays.
Meanwhile, in other campaign matters, Rove said Bush will accept federal matching funds for the general election, assuming he wins the Republican presidential nomination.
Under government campaign spending rules, a candidate who accepts federal funds must abide by spending limits.
In explaining Bush's decision, Rove told reporters that ``it is awfully difficult to raise $60 million or thereabouts between the (political) convention and the Election Day and still campaign''.
He said Bush doesn't want to have to focus on fund-raising, but would rather be out ``shaking hands''.
During the long pre-primary season, Bush has raised an estimated $70 million on his own, which has allowed him to forego federal funds and spending limits.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS).
Rove also said that while Bush holds a commanding lead over the five other Republican candidates in national polls, ``every month I expect the numbers to tighten appreciably''.
In fact, a new survey released Wednesday by the American Research Group, a polling organization based in Manchester, N.H., shows McCain leading Bush in New Hampshire 37 percent to 30 percent.
Rove said Bush could stumble in some of the nine major primaries held early next year.
In addition to New Hampshire, Rove said McCain ``is competitive'' in his home state of Arizona.
``Somewhere along the line in one of those nine early states there's going to be a rough patch or two in the road,'' Rove said.
``But we have built a campaign that is able to endure and win and compete everywhere.''
WASHINGTON _ Gay Republicans call it the Selma of their own civil rights movement: Dallas, where the religious right dominates the GOP the way liberals dominate politics in San Francisco.
It was in Dallas two months ago that the spokesman for the Texas Republican Party, Robert Black, called the Log Cabin Republicans a ``deviant group'' like the Ku Klux Klan and denied the gay organization a booth at the state party convention.
``We don't allow pedophiles, transvestites and cross-dressers, either,'' he explained.
``Being a gay Republican in Texas is a little like being a black Democrat in Mississippi in the 1950s,'' said Dale Carpenter, Texas director of the Log Cabin Republicans.
``You're involved in a party that doesn't really want you, where you're excluded, discriminated against, segregated''.
When the Log Cabins protested their exclusion from the convention, they were met with venomous counterprotesters who shouted slurs, shoved and pushed them and waved signs saying ``God Hates Fags''.
So it is in Dallas this weekend that about 200 Log Cabin Republicans from around the country will gather for the group's national convention, challenging the GOP to come to terms with the gays and lesbians in their own ideological family.
``I think the radical statement of the gay civil rights movement is that you can be gay and be anything,'' said Carpenter.
``We are everywhere in society''.
Log Cabin Executive Director Rich Tafel said gay Republicans should fight rather than switch parties _ to prevent the GOP from becoming a Republican version of George Wallace Democrats.
``If you're a Republican and you believe in individual rights, less government and free markets, the Republican Party holds those principles still,'' Tafel said.
``Gay Republicans are simply saying, `We're staying and fighting for those principles'.
'' Sharpening the irony of the debate, the Log Cabin Republicans have invited two conservative icons to address their convention: University of California Regent Ward Connerly and Washington political pundit Arianna Huffington.
Connerly once said that the vitriol he heard when announcing his support for gay domestic partner benefits was worse than anything he heard in his battles to end affirmative action.
Huffington has rebuked her fellow conservatives for their intolerance of homosexuality.
The group also invited Andrew Sullivan, a prominent gay Catholic activist who advocates gay marriage as a conservative family value.
The debate over gay rights is part of a larger _ and more politically dangerous _ battle over the direction of the Republican Party.
Connerly and his allies in the party's libertarian wing believe that the GOP should represent limited government, low taxes and individual freedom _ including the freedom to live as a gay person.
On the other wing are the social or religious conservatives, whose greatest concern is what they see as America's moral decline, reflected by crime and the breakup of the traditional family unit.
For social conservatives, homosexuals embody all that is wrong with America _ a deviant lifestyle that in their view subverts religious and family values.
Like abortion, the gay movement evokes the kind of emotional force that can bring social conservatives running to the voting booth.
And that is just what the GOP needs this November, when control of the House of Representatives will hinge on which party can best energize its core supporters.
A net loss of just 11 seats would return the House to the Democrats and deliver a devastating blow to Republicans.
Social conservative activists such as Gary Bauer, head of the Family Research Council and a potential presidential contender, and James Dobson of the ``Focus on the Family'' radio talk show, have made homosexuality a major campaign theme, running full-page advertisements in major newspapers about how ``ex-gays'' renounced their homosexual lifestyle.
``It's one of those things that the party is very uncomfortable with,'' said an aide to a high-ranking House Republican.
``For some segments of the party, the whole gay issue is taboo, and the Gary Bauers of the world exert a lot of influence on them''.
But some party leaders are taking steps to address the matter head-on.
For the first time, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Jim Nicholson, will meet with the Log Cabin Republicans on Aug.
21. ``We enjoy the support not just of straight Republicans and straight Americans, but gay and bisexual Americans as well,'' said party spokesman Mike Collins.
``We want their support.
They want lower taxes, they want a balanced budget, they want to take people off welfare and give them jobs.
We're doing that.
And we welcome their support''.
&UR; &LR; Collins' comments reflect a considerable fear within the party that anti-gay rhetoric will cast the GOP as intolerant or bigoted.
A former official in President George Bush's administration who is homosexual contends that some party conservatives see the gay issue as a way to ``throw some red meat to the religious conservatives, at minimal risk''.
But he noted that even former Christian Coalition head Ralph Reed is urging Republicans to back away.
``A tone of intolerance and exclusion plays very badly in today's America, and only somebody with a political tin ear would think that you improve your position by gay bashing or anyone-else bashing.
.. . Every time you have this sort of `we want to tell you how to run your life' behavior, it makes it harder for Republicans in the Northeast and Midwest to gain ground''.
Jim Pinkerton, a former political strategist for Bush, said that while religious conservatives may think promoting anti-gay views is a good idea, the Republican Party as a whole does not.
The party is having a difficult time accommodating both sides.
And the public itself is of two minds: Polls consistently show that a large majority of the public condemns discrimination but at the same time does not approve of homosexuality _ or bringing ``queer values to suburbia,'' as Pinkerton put it.
Pinkerton argues that Republicans do need the support of social conservatives.
``But they should find better ways to do it,'' he says, ``by promoting such issues as school choice that animate religious conservatives, libertarians and minorities alike who are dissatisfied with public schools''.
Arizona's Jim Kolbe, the only openly gay Republican in the House, said many of his colleagues ``sincerely wish this thing would not come up and not be voted on, because of the obvious conflicts it puts them in''.
But Texas Republicans see no conflict.
Party spokesman Robert Black defended the decision to exclude the Log Cabin Republicans from the GOP convention, saying individuals are free to participate in the state party, but not ``narrow special interest groups''.
Asked why the Christian Coalition was allowed a booth, Black said, ``OK, let me redefine that.
A special interest group that is so fundamentally at odds with the core principles of the Republican party.
Republicans, at least here in Texas, by and large are against homosexuality.
That's not really news.
It's in our platform''.
&UR; &LR; Tafel said that is why the Log Cabin Republicans will be in Dallas this weekend.
``We really view Texas as the frontlines of the gay movement,'' Tafel said.
``It's important for the gay community, in general, that gay Republicans stay and fight because that's the frontlines, that's where the battles are taking place.''
WASHINGTON _ A coalition of influential Christian groups has launched a national ad campaign attacking homosexuality, igniting a firestorm of protest Tuesday as the religious right gears up for the November elections.
Praising Senator Trent Lott, the Republican majority leader from Mississippi who recently likened gays and lesbians to alcoholics and kleptomaniacs, the $200,000 ad blitz characterizes homosexuals as sinners in need of Christian healing.
The controversial campaign, widely seen as an effort by the Christian right to provide indirect support for congressional candidates who promote the movement's agenda, sparked outrage among gay rights leaders and produced the unintended consequence of exposing a major rift in the Republican Party.
Several GOP candidates facing tough elections in key races tried to distance themselves from the ad campaign.
``It's really wrong for both the Republican Party and the country,'' said Peter G.
Torkildsen, a Massachusetts Republican trying to regain the seat he narrowly lost in 1996 to Representative John F.
Tierney, a Democrat.
``I don't see that it serves any useful purpose at all,'' Torkildsen said.
``It incites fear in people, and it is not the traditional Republican role for the government to intervene in people's private lives''.
The ad campaign is funded largely by the Christian Coalition, whose chairman, Pat Robertson, sought the GOP nomination for president in 1988, and the Family Research Council, whose leader, Gary Bauer, is considered a prospective Republican contender for the White House in 2000.
In full-page ads this week in the New York Times, the Washington Post and USA Today, the coalition promotes the highly disputed theory that people become homosexuals by choice.
``Homosexuality is not a sex issue, it's a heart issue,'' one ad stated.
``There are problems for homosexuals even condoms can't fix''.
Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates gay and lesbian rights, said numerous medical and mental health groups have agreed in recent decades that homosexuality is not a product of personal choice.
Birch asserted the ads were part of an effort by the Christian groups to promote their agenda in association with GOP congressional leaders.
Robertson recently met with Lott and other key Republicans in the House and Senate to push for the religious right's priorities, as did James Dobson, who heads the Family Research Council's parent group, Focus on the Family.
``Now you're seeing some of the fruits of that alliance,'' Birch said.
``They are using these very manipulative ads to throw red meat to the firebrand, extreme-right, grass-roots wing of the Republican Party.
It's nothing more than a crass political move in an election year''.
Birch said the Human Rights Campaign was buying a full-page ad in today's editions of USA Today to counter the offensive.
Arne Owens, a Christian Coalition spokesman, denied the ad campaign was aimed at providing support for Lott and other congressional leaders who have stepped up their criticism of homosexuality since Robertson and Dobson visited Capitol Hill earlier this year.
``This message is not emanating from the GOP,'' Owens said.
``It's a non-partisan message based on the mainstream concern about the decline of morality in America''.
Owens said the advertising campaign would continue, although he declined to provide details.
He asserted the impetus for the campaign was to defeat the push for broader homosexual rights.
``This is a subject most Americans, including us, would rather not have to address, but since it is being advanced by the gay lobby, somebody needs to respond and provide some leadership,'' Owens said.
``The pro-family movement is doing just that''.
In Tuesday's Washington Post, the ad displayed a photograph of a large group of people who claim they no longer are homosexuals because of ``God's healing love''.
``We're standing for the truth that homosexuals can change,'' the ad stated.
The ad thanks Lott and former Green Bay Packers star Reggie White, among others, ``for having the courage to speak the truth about sexual sin''.
Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who is one of two openly gay members of Congress, challenged the assertion that individuals choose their sexual orientation.
``I've never met anybody who told me they decided to be homosexual or heterosexual,'' he said.
``Virtually every gay man or women I know was terribly upset when they first figured it out.
The notion that people voluntarily choose this is just nuts''.
Frank said studies have shown that people who believe individuals choose their sexual orientation are more likely to discriminate against homosexuals.
He asserted the ads were aimed at building opposition to antidiscrimination initiatives.
``Homophobia is losing the cultural war,'' Frank said, ``so they are doing this to try to pump up their side in the political arena.''
SAN FRANCISCO _ In the final days of his race for U.S.
Senate in California, Republican Matt Fong's stance on gay rights has become a dominant concern.
The hubbub over Fong's recent contribution to an avowedly anti-homosexual organization is delighting incumbent Sen.
Barbara Boxer and her fellow Democrats, who see the issue distracting Fong and dividing Republicans before Tuesday's election.
The issue was kicked up again Tuesday as religious conservatives, led by a Sacramento lobbying group, attacked Fong, the state treasurer, for pledging to support what it called a ``homosexual agenda''.
``For a candidate to cave in to the gay activists in the final days of the campaign shows a complete lack of conviction,'' Michael Bowman, executive director of the Capitol Resource Institute, said in a statement.
The criticism came a day after Fong signed a pledge to support gay causes such as benefits for domestic partners and anti-discrimination laws, part of an effort by Fong to quell the anger of gay Republicans over his $50,000 contribution to the Traditional Values Coalition, which is led by the Rev.
Lou Sheldon.
The national Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group, reaffirmed its support for Fong.
But the San Francisco chapter of the organization withdrew its endorsement, citing Fong's link to Sheldon, an ardent gay-rights opponent who at one time suggested quarantining people with AIDS in ``cities of refuge''.
The debate has pitted religious conservatives, who are active in Republican politics, against gay and socially moderate Republicans, who want the party to take a softer line on issues of concern to gays and lesbians.
And Fong, who has sought to find a centrist position, finds himself being attacked by both sides.
At a fund-raiser in the Chinatown section of San Francisco Tuesday night, Fong said he would be a ``unifier'' and bring the state together, but steered clear of any direct mention of the controversy over his donation.
``We are a tremendous state made up of diversity,'' Fong told 300 supporters at the $200-per-person event.
``America is a great country because we've always chosen hope over fear.
We've always chosen unity over division''.
But Fong was less than eager to face questions related to his $50,000 contribution.
He canceled a public event and avoided reporters at the Chinatown fund-raiser.
Fong spokesman Steve Schmidt said the candidate wasn't worried about losing votes, either from gay Republicans or conservatives.
``Conservatives have been with us from the beginning and will continue to be with us,'' Schmidt said.
``No one has pulled their support''.
Bowman, however, criticized Fong for agreeing to support domestic partnerships, or unions of unmarried people, which he said promote homosexuality.
``Since the leading candidates both support the homosexual agenda to weaken families and society, conservative voters don't have much of a choice on Election Day,'' Bowman said.
Democratic Party officials have tried to capitalize on the division in the Fong camp.
On Monday, Democratic strategist Bob Mulholland faxed to gay groups around the state the story of Fong's $50,000 contribution.
On Tuesday, when Fong pledged his support for gay issues, Mulholland faxed the story to Christian radio stations.
``He gets squeezed on this issue,'' Mulholland said.
``Here it is the last week, and this is what he's talking about''.
Republican Party officials tried to downplay the issue, which they described as a fringe struggle between GOP groups that will never agree on a common agenda on gay issues.
``I think voters believe there are more important issues,'' said Mike Madrid, political director for the Republican Party.
``The people who this concerns made up their minds years ago.''
WASHINGTON _ Prominent Republican presidential candidates are creating an atmosphere that is subtly but fundamentally more inviting to gay and lesbian voters than party leaders have been in recent memory.
Texas Gov.
George W.
Bush, Sen.
John McCain and Elizabeth Dole _ who combined have the lion's share of support among Republicans in early polls _ have signaled an openness to gay supporters, including a willingness to appoint them to positions like ambassadorships.
The new receptivity toward homosexuality follows a similar soft-pedaling by leading Republicans on abortion.
While they still oppose abortion and are by no means converts on other gay rights issues like same-sex marriage, the most prominent candidates are offering a lower-key, more inclusive approach designed to appeal beyond the conservative base of the party to independent and Democratic voters in a general election.
It also reflects the continued growing political influence of gay donors and gay voters across party lines.
The new message on gay supporters is a far cry from 1996, when Republican nominee Bob Dole returned a $1,000 donation from the Log Cabin Republicans, a group of gay party members, and from 1992, when the dominant voice on the issue from Republicans was that of Patrick Buchanan, whose declaration of a ``culture war'' was aimed squarely at homosexuals.
Buchanan and other conservative candidates have not changed their views, and even Bush, McCain and Mrs.
Dole have not embraced a broader gay agenda that also includes adoptions by gays and a less punitive approach toward gays in the military.
But gay political leaders say the difference in attitude is striking nonetheless.
``The tone has totally changed,'' said Rich Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans.
``What I hear is gay Republicans enthusiastic about the tone being set by the leading candidates.
It looks like Republicans for the first time are saying, `This is a community I'm not going to alienate and maybe I want to reach out to it'.
That's kind of a shocking revelation''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Democrats, of course, have courted gay voters for years, and this year both Vice President Al Gore and former Sen.
Bill Bradley, the two rivals for the Democratic nomination, are competing for their support.
Both campaigns have fund-raisers working expressly with gay donors, who tend to be generous financially and active politically.
So intense is the Gore-Bradley rivalry for gay support that the two candidates even appeared recently at the same gay and lesbian community center in Los Angeles within a week of each other.
On the Republican side, though, this rapprochement is new.
Bush, so far the run-away favorite in the Republican field, has said he would have no qualms about hiring gays.
``If someone can do a job, and a job that he's qualified for, that person ought to be allowed to do his job,'' he said earlier this year.
McCain, who has appointed Rep.
Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the only openly gay Republican in the House, to his national steering committee, has similarly said he would hire on merit alone.
He has supported anti-hate-crimes legislation that would protect victims of crime not only because of their race but their ``sexual orientation''.
He has said that someday he could envision a gay president.
Mrs. Dole has said she would appoint to her administration anyone who was qualified, emphasizing in an NBC interview in July that ``all people are welcome'' and adding: ``I'm inclusive''.
Of the contribution that her husband spurned in 1996, Mrs.
Dole said that if she received a check from the same group, ``I would not turn it away''.
William Kristol, who was chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle and now is editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, said that the mainstream Republican candidates this year were clearly unhappy under the banner of strident, anti-gay language.
``The Republican establishment does not want to fight the conservative culture war,'' Kristol said, ``partly because they think it's a losing fight, but more importantly, they don't believe in it''.
Outside the party establishment, Buchanan and other conservatives remain adamant.
His spokesman, Bob Adams, said Buchanan ``has certainly not abandoned the culture war''.
Some, like Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes, make their rejection of homosexuality a major plank of their platforms.
Bauer said recently that when he heard McCain say the party should be ``a big tent that admits everybody,'' the phrase sounded to him ``like fingernails on a chalkboard''.
Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher and candidate, flatly opposes any concessions to gay voters.
He frequently says he wants ``equal rights for all, special rights for none''.
Asked if Forbes would appoint an openly gay person to his administration, his campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, said: ``If the person is qualified for the job, that's fine as long as it is not a statement on a life style or promoting a life style''.
As for gay adoptions, Dal Col said: ``There are plenty of heterosexual couples out there,'' and existing laws against hate crimes are enough.
The Rev.
Louis Sheldon, a staunch conservative who heads a national group called the Traditional Values Coalition and who has denounced homosexuals often in his career, denied that there was a trend among Republicans to reach out to gay voters.
Noting that the Republican presidential candidates oppose homosexuals in the military and same-sex marriages, Sheldon said that ``there aren't that many Log Cabin voters out there''.
He added: ``There is nothing immutable about sexual behavior _ it is chosen''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn Still, anti-gay sentiment is less strident this year.
Many Republicans avoid the matter entirely.
Brian Kennedy, the national political director for former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander, said: ``He neither brings up those issues in his stump speech nor do we ever recall him being asked about it.
It doesn't seem to be on the radar screen for the '99 cycle''.
Adams, Buchanan's spokesman, agreed.
``It hasn't come up, and we haven't been making it an issue,'' he said.
Even Quayle, a social conservative who has aggressively promoted ``family values,'' has shown moderation toward homosexuals.
Asked on a radio program last month what he would do if one of his children were homosexual, he said he would support them ``whatever they are''.
While he avoided answering specific questions about gays in the military and gay adoptions, Quayle also said: ``Life-style orientation really makes no difference to me at all.
Believe me, I don't inquire what one's sexual preference may or may not be''.
He repeated his view that homosexuality is a choice but did not say, as he did in 1992, that it was ``a wrong choice''.
Kristol said that most Republicans were still being careful in their statements because they did not want to alienate the grass-roots conservatives who believe homosexuality is a sin.
But the candidates' tempered tone, he said, poses a dilemma for conservative voters.
``The question is, do conservatives want to win so badly that they will accept this kind of establishment leadership''? he asked.
``Or have they, too, given up on the culture war?
Do they want a political champion for their views''?
Since gays emerged several years ago as a significant voting bloc, Republicans ceded them to the Democrats.
About 5 percent of voters in 1996 identified themselves in polls of people leaving voting booths as gay _ ``about the same percentage as Hispanics and larger than the Jewish vote,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian lobbying group.
Tafel, who is organizing gay Republican voters this week to participate in the Iowa straw poll and is seeking a slot for an openly gay speaker at the Republican national convention next year, said that the party was finally recognizing the influence of the gay electorate.
``It's the first time we haven't been take for granted'' as likely Democrats, he said.
His group has yet to make an endorsement or give any money to any of the presidential candidates, but it plans to do so closer to next year's convention.
Also making the gay vote more available to Republicans this year is the fact that liberal Democrats have not been entirely happy with the Clinton administration's record on gay issues.
They have complained of a lack of financing for the treatment of AIDS, the opposition to gay marriage and the murky ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy that has allowed a record number of anti-gay discharges from the military.
Such discharges increased 86 percent over the last five years.
Alert to the potential appeal of Republicans who refrain from broad cultural attacks, Democrats are warning that the Republicans are not as tolerant as they may appear.
Pat Ewing, a senior adviser at the Democratic National Committee, said of Bush: ``He is purposefully vague, not moderate.
Bush denied Texans protection from hate crimes and let it be known that he opposed any provision to protect gays and lesbians from these crimes.
His platitudes are meant to obscure''.
Karen Hughes, a spokeswoman for Bush, said he objected to the hate-crimes legislation because ``all violent crime is motivated by hate'' and Texas already has a law that covers such crimes.
But, she said, he also did not believe that sexual orientation should be singled out for special rights.
``He doesn't believe in granting legal rights based on sexual orientation,'' she said.
Gore has made an extra effort to appeal to homosexuals.
In one of his rare departures from Clinton orthodoxy, he has called for a more ``compassionate'' _ though unspecific _ approach to homosexuals in the military.
In California, which is likely to face a ballot initiative next year that outlaws same-sex marriage, Gore said he favored legal protections for same-sex partners, like health benefits and hospital visitation rights, but he opposed ``a change in the institution of marriage as we now know it between men and women''.
He would leave gay adoptions up to adoption professionals on an individual basis, his spokesman, Chris Lahane, said.
Democrats acknowledge that Gore and Bradley have virtually identical records on gay issues.
Eric Hauser, a spokesman for Bradley, said he supported a ``review'' of the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military.
He also supports gay adoptions and extending legal rights, including health benefits and hospital visitation, to same-sex partners as ``common sense'' measures.
When Bradley was in the Senate, he voted for the so-called defense of marriage act, which said no state had to recognize the same-sex laws of another state.
Likewise, President Clinton signed the bill into law, and Gore ``stood beside him'' in supporting it, Ms.
Birch said.
Although Gore has been outspoken in favor of gay issues, he has also been the target of gay demonstrators.
AIDS activists have cropped up, noisily, at several of his campaign events, accusing him of siding with drug companies and trying to block South Africa's access to cheaper generic drugs to fight HIV.
His staff says this is an international patent issue and is trying to work it out.
PHILADELPHIA _ The content of Rep.
Jim Kolbe's speech on international trade Tuesday night at the Republican National Convention was considerably less compelling than the fact that he gave it at all.
The eight-term representative from Tucson, Ariz.
is the House of Representatives' only openly gay Republican.
His pre-prime-time talk on trade relations might have gone down as yet another unmemorable convention speech.
But Kolbe's appearance itself was remarkable, given the strongly anti-gay platform that Republican delegates approved Monday objecting to any role for gays in the military and to the proposed extension of federal civil rights law to cover homosexuals.
Acting on a request by gay Republicans in April, Texas Gov.
George W.
Bush invited Kolbe to speak at the convention's second evening dedicated to the theme of ``Strength and Security with a Purpose''.
Kolbe told the convention in prepared remarks that if elected president, Bush would expand trade.
``He will work to launch an ambitious new round of global trade talks, and he will enforce trade agreements and trade laws,'' Kolbe said.
Some social conservatives had considered walking out when Kolbe took the podium.
However, Cathie Adams, a Texas delegate from Dallas, said that instead, she would bow her head during the speech to pray for gays to give up their ``unhealthy lifestyle''.
And Tim Wildmon, vice president of the Mississippi-based American Family Association, commented that ``the things that these homosexual advocates push for are contrary to everything that 90 percent of Republicans stand for''.
If any of this fazed Kolbe, 58, he didn't show it.
When the Bush campaign considered inviting him, ``they didn't say well, gee, you'd be the right person to speak about trade, but we can't have you do it because you're an openly gay Republican,''' he said in a brief interview before the speech.
``The fact that it's a non-issue is positive''.
The invitation to speak was seen as an effort by the Bush campaign to show that platform notwithstanding, Bush means what he says about being a ``compassionate conservative''.
Some social conservatives sought to downplay the significance of Kolbe's speech.
``We're pleased with the substance in the platform on the (gay) issue,'' said Charles Donovan, chief executive of the Washington-based Family Research Council.
Still, he added, ``this convention as a whole could send some messages better than it's doing''.
He noted that while a gay person _ Kolbe _ had been given a chance to address the convention, no anti-abortion advocate received the same privilege.
Gay Republicans saw the Kolbe appearance as a historic event.
``He's a living symbol of what an inclusive party is all about,'' said Kevin Ivers, spokesman for Log Cabin Republicans, a gay Republican organization.
Asked whether there is a future for gays in the Republican Party, Kolbe responded: ``Of course there is.
The fact that I'm speaking tonight is evidence of that'' ' $$$
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House came down solidly behind the Boy Scouts Wednesday with a 362-12 vote against a proposal to revoke their eight-decade-old federal charter because of the scouting organization's policy of excluding gays.
Republicans, who brought the legislation to the House floor to show the lack for support for critics of the Scouts, labeled it an attack on American values.
Rep. Cass Ballenger, R-N.C.
, said half the members of the House were former Scouts and would defend an organization ''as American as apple pie and baseball''.
While the bill's opponents accused its few Democratic supporters of extremism, Democrats complained that the GOP's only intent was to embarrass them.
Fifty Democrats and one Republican voted ''present'' in apparent protest of the procedure.
One Republican, Rep.
James Greenwood of Pennsylvania, voted for the bill.
David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign, a leading gay rights organization, said Republicans were ''trying to change the subject from hate crimes to Boy Scouts''.
The GOP leadership is resisting Democratic attempts to pass hate crimes legislation this year.
Beyond the politics, the legislation offered by Rep.
Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif.
, spotlighted the uneasy relationship between the federal government and the Boy Scouts since the organization's stance toward gays became a national issue.
Woolsey said she was a Girl Scout and one of her sons was a Boy Scout.
''We're not saying the Boy Scouts are bad; we're saying that intolerance is bad''.
''I know the value of scouting, and that's why I believe scouting should be available to all boys, not just to some boys,'' Woolsey said during Tuesday night's debate.
She was the only Democrat to speak in favor of the legislation.
In contrast, a long line of Republicans rose to condemn the bill.
''It's an attack on the fundamental values of America,'' said Rep.
Chris Cannon, R-Utah, led by ''a small group of extremists on the minority side''.
But Rep.
John Conyers, D-Mich.
, top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said Republicans were engaging in a ''political stunt'' in bringing to the floor a bill that had had no hearings or committee vote and didn't have a chance of passage.
Woolsey said she wasn't told until Monday evening that Republicans were taking up her legislation.
It ''was a total surprise to me''.
''We're disappointed that this bill would even be considered,'' Boy Scouts spokesman Gregg Shields said.
Having a federal charter is an honor and ''we hope to continue to live up to that honor,'' he added.
The Boy Scouts got their federal charter in 1916, six years after it was founded.
It is one of about 90 groups with such designation, an honorary title given to patriotic, charitable and education organizations.
While it confers no specific benefits, receiving a federal charter is a mark of prestige and national recognition for a group.
Among other groups with federal charters are the American Legion, Future Farmers of America, the National Tropical Botanical Garden and the National Ski Patrol.
The Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision in June, upheld the Boy Scouts' ban on homosexuals serving as troop leaders.
That ruling may also give legal backing to the 6.2 million-member organization's rejection of gay youths as members.
The Scouts asserted that homosexual conduct is inconsistent with the values it seeks to instill.
Separately in June, President Clinton issued an executive order barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in federally conducted education and training programs.
The Interior Department in August asked the Justice Department for guidance on how that order affected the holding of Boy Scout Jamborees on federal lands.
GOP presidential nominee George W.
Bush and other Republicans quickly accused the Clinton administration of trying to throw the scouts off federal lands.
But Attorney General Janet Reno, in a statement this month, said the tradition of Boy Scouts using federal lands for camping and other activities could continue.
After the June Supreme Court ruling, Clinton said he is ''generally against discrimination against gays''.
But he refused to criticize the Scouts or the court's ruling.
''The Boy Scouts still are -- they're a great group.
They do a lot of good''.

SACRAMENTO _ Exposing a deep political fissure in the Republican party, UC Regent Ward Connerly and several other prominent GOP party members announced their opposition Thursday to Proposition 22, a measure on the March 7 ballot that would ban gay marriage.
The initiative, which was put on the ballot by state Sen.
William ``Pete'' Knight, R-Palmdale, is broadly supported by state Republicans.
But Connerly, who led the campaign for the anti-affirmative action Proposition 209, said gay rights are a matter of personal freedom and not an area where the government should be involved.
``I support two people having the right to do whatever they want to do,'' said Connerly.
Thursday's statement by Connerly, GOP Senate candidate Tom Campbell, and state Assemblyman Jim Cunneen, R-San Jose, comes on the heels of several other public battles within the Republican Party.
Only last year, for example, a splinter group of moderate state Republicans held an alternative convention to adopt a pro-choice platform.
The statement also comes as leaders are hoping the rank and file will unite behind the party's candidates.
In less than two weeks, the state GOP will meet in Burlingame to adopt a party platform.
``What you are seeing is symptomatic of the problems the party has had for the past five years,'' said GOP consultant Mike Madrid.
``The base of the party has remained unchanged, while the demographics in California have changed dramatically.
``The question is, how do you broaden the base of the party when the core is so intense on certain key issues''?
Madrid said.
Supporters of Proposition 22 deny that there is any division among Republicans, citing the support of the California Republican Party and 56 GOP members of the Legislature and congressional delegation.
``I'm not at all surprised to see the author of Prop.
209, one of the most divisive measures ever introduced against Latinos, has chosen to join forces with a campaign against marriage,'' said Julio Calderon, a spokesman for the proposition, citing a survey showing 67 percent of Latino voters support Proposition 22.
But the president of the California Republican League, a group that promotes inclusion in the party, said such issues hurt Republicans.
``There is this notion that we put this stuff on the ballot as a `wedge' issue and promote wedge-issue politics _ it feeds the notion that Republicans are into dividing people,'' said Gary Zlotnick, the league's president.
Connerly also said Republicans suffer from their public image.
``We may have a more difficult time than the Democrats because some think it is written somewhere that we should oppress gays,'' he said.
``Some people invoke the Bible and don't think it through.
But Democrats come out against the initiative and then dance around the real issues''.
Both Democratic presidential hopefuls, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen.
Bill Bradley, have come out against the initiative but oppose same-sex marriage.
AUSTIN, Texas _ Because the Texas House race between Democratic incumbent Glen Maxey and Republican challenger Fred Ebner is the first in Texas history to feature two openly gay candidates, you'd think the two men would find it difficult to feud over the issue of sexual orientation.
But the campaign for Austin's District 51 has taken a strange turn in its final days: Ebner and other gay Republicans are accusing Maxey _ the only openly gay member of the Texas House and an outspoken gay rights advocate _ of gay-baiting.
Maxey, meanwhile, says Ebner is misleading voters about his sexual orientation.
A recent campaign mailing by Maxey sparked the controversy.
The leaflet points out that Ebner is gay, highlights his membership in the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group, and notes his support for expanding the state's anti-discrimination laws to include sexual orientation.
It also points out that Ebner is pro-choice and supports the legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes.
Maxey ``supports these issues too,'' the leaflet says, but unlike Ebner, Maxey ``will tell you where he stands''.
It doesn't say that Maxey is gay.
Ebner and the Log Cabin Republicans say the leaflet appears to have been sent only to people who voted in the Republican primary, and was intended to dampen GOP turnout by highlighting Ebner's sexual orientation and some of his socially moderate stands.
Maxey declined to identify the target audience.
``I would like very much for him to have distributed the same thing in Clarksville and Travis Heights,'' said Ebner, referring to two neighborhoods that are particularly liberal in a district that is among the most Democratic in the state.
``I'd like them to know that he's indulging in gay-bashing in order to win''.
Ebner said he considers his sexuality to be ``a private and personal matter which is irrelevant to holding public office,'' while Maxey has ``made a lifetime career of advocating a left/liberal approach to gay issues''.
Maxey said he sent the mailing because Ebner attacks him for being a gay advocate when he speaks to broader audiences, but tells gay groups that he can better represent their interests.
He said the leaflet didn't mention that he was gay because it is already well-known.
Maxey said he isn't gay-baiting because it was Ebner who injected sexual orientation into the campaign.
``I've heard him twice now call me a professional gay activist,'' Maxey said.
``He's put up by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay group, and then criticizes me for being a gay activist?
Give me a break''.
Maxey said the Log Cabin Republicans recruited Ebner to ``spit in the eye'' of the Republican party by showing that a gay, socially moderate Republican could do better against Maxey than an anti-gay conservative one.
The platform of the Texas Republican Party states that homosexuality ``is contrary to the fundamental, unchanging truths that have been ordained by God'' and opposes gay marriage and the repeal of sodomy laws.
The Log Cabin Republicans deny they recruited Ebner, who ran for Austin City Council in 1987.
Steve Labinski, who is president of the group's Texas chapter, dismissed the idea that Ebner's campaign is designed to send a message to the Republican Party.
He said Ebner ``honestly believes that a mainstream Republican can better represent the voters of District 51 than Glen Maxey''.
``The mailout was identical to a mailout that would be sent by the Christian Coalition or the Texas Family Association for the same purpose: to inflame voter homophobia''.
Labinski said.
``This is gay-baiting''.
Dianne Hardy-Garcia of the Lesbian Gay Rights Lobby of Texas, which doesn't endorse candidates, questioned why a gay Republican would want to target an outspoken defender of gay rights.
She said the leaflet was ``hard-hitting, and a little bit harsh,'' but declined to describe it as gay-baiting.
``Glen's borne the brunt of being a gay politician in this state for a long time, so I imagine that he's frustrated about Ebner not being open about it,'' she said.
``Maybe there will be a day when sexual orientation won't make a difference and I look forward to that day.
But it hasn't happened yet, and no one knows that more than Glen Maxey''.

Forget all that stuff about hating the sin but loving the sinner.
House Republicans are about to go after the sinners.
A vote is imminent on a provision supported by the leadership, and thus likely to pass, that would cancel President Clinton's recent executive order barring discrimination against gays and lesbians who work for the government.
Most federal agencies already had nondiscriminatory policies, though with slight differences here and there.
The main effect of Clinton's order is to impose uniformity, so what's the big deal?
The big deal is that in its thralldom to the religious right and its increasing tilt to ideological rather than to pragmatic conservatism, the Republican Party has gone from being just a little cracked about homosexuality to being outright peculiar.
Commonly cited as evidence of that have been the recent declarations by Senate and House Majority Leaders Trent Lott and Dick Armey that homosexuality is a sin, but both men were only answering questions they didn't seem pleased to have been asked and sin is a religious, not a political, judgment.
They are welcome to it.
(Though Lott also seemed to think homosexuality is a mental disorder or an addiction.
The American Psychiatric Association concluded otherwise 25 years ago, in effect finding that most folks are heterosexual but a few are not and there you are).
Far more disturbing is the worsening demagoguery of the party and its candidates in demonizing gays and lesbians as a shortcut to office.
Here's the U.S.
House of Representatives on the verge of all but endorsing job discrimination against gays and lesbians by disallowing an order forbidding that.
The Texas Republican Party recently denied recognition at its convention to the Log Cabin Republicans, a sobersided club of gay Republicans.
And when the group complained, delegates unleashed a torrent of abuse, with state leaders comparing it to the Ku Klux Klan.
Lott is blocking the appointment of a gay as ambassador to Luxembourg.
(In the course of which issue Sen.
James Inhofe, R-Okla.
, likened the nominee to the former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke.
Klan analogies apparently are going around).
This year's GOP gubernatorial primary in Nebraska sank into a contest in homophobia, with candidates competing in the vigor of their oaths to block homosexual marriage, which the conservative state legislature has never even considered.
Republican primaries in South Carolina, too, have set off a bidding war in anti-gay rhetoric, most bizarrely with a would-be agriculture commissioner declaring homosexuality a threat to family farms.
``You can't have farming based on having Bob and Bob being married,'' said Jim Gordon.
All this posturing is put about as a defense of morality but it is no such thing.
Republican candidates in many places no longer can win without certification from fundamentalist Christian pulpits, and as one GOP ally put it, when Republicans are quoting the Bible and Democrats are citing the American Psychiatric Association, Republicans win.
Count on it: When politics is talking about saving souls, it is thinking about counting heads.

WASHINGTON _ In an intriguing campaign dance, John McCain has collected tens of thousands of dollars in contributions from members of a gay Republican group with whom he disagrees on a broad range of issues, from job-discrimination protection to benefits for same-sex couples.
The Log Cabin Republicans, whose spokesmen praised McCain's willingness ``to have a dialogue,'' have chosen to help him despite his disagreement with them on matters such as the decision Monday by the Vermont Supreme Court that homosexual couples are entitled to the same benefits as wedded couples.
McCain spokesman Dan Schnur told ``The Arizona Republic'' that the senator ``has indicated that he disagrees with the decision'' by the Vermont court.
McCain also backs the ``Don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military, putting him at odds with Steve May, a prominent Log Cabin Republican supporter in Phoenix who is threatened with an Army discharge because of his sexual orientation.
Yet on Dec.
14, McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, simultaneously addressed members of the Log Cabin Republicans by satellite television at fund-raisers in Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, New Orleans, New York, Seattle and Washington, D.C., and raised about $40,000 for the campaign.
Phoenix was not included because many members there had already contributed to McCain.
The relationship between the senator and gay Republicans was noted earlier this month in the ``Washington Blade,'' a gay newspaper that labeled McCain an ``enigma''.
``While he has an avowed `visceral dislike' of discrimination, which presumably includes discrimination against gays, he has consistently chosen to vote anti-gay.
His actions over the years have likewise sent mixed messages to gay voters,'' the newspaper said.
In 1996, McCain helped ensure the defeat of a bill, which lost on a 50-49 vote, that would have barred employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
Three years earlier, McCain was denounced by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force for agreeing to be keynote speaker at a fund-raiser for an Oregon group that sponsored a ballot initiative condemning homosexuality as ``perverse''.
His aides said at the time that McCain's appearance didn't constitute an endorsement of the group's views and that McCain considered tolerance a ``bedrock value''.
The plan to hold the joint December fund-raisers was the brainchild of May, an openly gay Army reservist and state lawmaker who says he supports and admires McCain but disagrees with him on the policy permitting gays to serve in the military only as long as their sexual orientation is not disclosed.
Citing the policy, the Army is moving to discharge May, who has been open about his sexual orientation since he first ran for office in 1996.
May was honorably discharged in 1995, recalled this year, and is now appealing to end what he calls the ``ludicrous'' policy that threatens his service even though he has earned stellar performance evaluations.
Last week, May's sister, unbeknownst to May, asked McCain about the ``Don't ask, don't tell'' policy during the question-and-answer portion of a speech the senator was giving at Harvard University.
McCain told Shannon May, a Harvard senior, that if there were problems with the policy, they should be looked into.
But he repeated his support for the policy, saying, according to the Associated Press: ``Colin Powell, Norman Schwarzkopf, all the military leaders I admire, came up with it''.
Steve May sounded disappointed in an interview immediately after he heard about McCain's response.
``I guess McCain basically hid behind Generals Powell and Schwarzkopf, didn't really want to address the question,'' he said.
``I really admire his leadership.
He's a man I want in the Oval Office.
But I just hope that he is really willing to examine the immorality, impracticality and absurdity of this (policy)''.
McCain recently told moderator Tony Snow on ``Fox News Sunday,'' ``I want to sit down with (May), and look at the specifics of his case''.
A meeting has been scheduled for Dec.
30 in Phoenix, according to May.
``I hope McCain's not saying he's going to meet with me so he can deflect the issue.
We never had a meeting scheduled until Tony Snow asked him if he was going to meet with me,'' May said.
McCain was campaigning in South Carolina and could not be interviewed, his campaign said.
But Schnur, McCain's spokesman, said, ``The Steve May story broke over a weekend.
Upon hearing about it, Senator McCain indicated that he wanted to meet with May to find out the particulars of the way the case was handled.
Logistically, it wouldn't have been possible for him to arrange the meeting before Snow asked him about it''.
Schnur said that although McCain might disagree with Log Cabin Republicans on some issues, they were in agreement on such things as ``lower taxes and a strong national defense''.
In contrast to GOP presidential front-runner George W.
Bush, who has thus far declined the group's invitation, McCain sat down with members of the Log Cabin Republicans last month and said that he would work to end discrimination, and that appears to be enough for many gay Republicans, particularly when the senator's position is compared with those of other presidential candidates.
``You're talking about those kind of values (McCain's) versus people like Pat Buchanan, Gary Bauer and others who have historically said that gays should not be in the Republican Party, that we are people who should not have civil rights, that we should be in programs because we're mentally ill,'' said Kevin Ivers, the Log Cabin group's spokesman.
Bush said on ``Meet the Press'' last month that he would ``probably not'' meet with the group, adding, ``I am someone who is a uniter, not a divider.
I don't believe in group thought, pitting one group against another''.
Log Cabin members said they were confused by Bush's remarks, and some wondered whether he might be fearful of repercussions from the right.
Southern lawmakers in particular were incensed at President Clinton's proposal early in his first term to lift the ban on gays in the military.
When the plan was subjected to harsh congressional criticism, Clinton modified it into what became popularly known as ``Don't ask, don't tell''.
South Carolina's February primary is central to McCain's campaign strategy, and he could be subject to attacks from religious conservatives if they believed he had gone too far in including gays under the Republican ``big tent''. &QL;
PHILADELPHIA _ Homosexual Republicans rejoiced, but religious conservative delegates sat in silent protest Tuesday as their party's only openly gay congressman addressed the Republican National Convention.
Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona did not mention sexual orientation in his three-minute speech on free trade.
But gay delegates and their supporters said his presence on the podium in prime time was proof that presidential candidate George W.
Bush is serious about making the GOP more inclusive.
The gay Republicans are also heartened that the GOP presidential campaign seems to be welcoming Mary Cheney, 31, the openly lesbian daughter of vice-presidential pick Dick Cheney.
She appeared with her father in the convention hall on Monday night to the cheers of the delegates.
``It's a pretty vivid reminder that gays are part of the American family,'' said Kevin Ivers, communications director for the Log Cabin Republicans.
``We're thrilled,'' David Catania, an openly gay delegate and councilman from the District of Columbia, said of Kolbe's speech.
``This is something that means a great deal to gay Republicans''.
But other delegates disapproved of Bush's choice.
``It gives the opportunity for radical gay rights advocates to claim victory for their agenda,'' Texas GOP chair Susan Weddington told the Associated Press.
Dozens of delegates in the Texas delegation sat with their heads bowed and eyes closed as Kolbe spoke.
One held up a sign saying, ``There is a way out''.
The Republican platform opposes gay marriages, gays in the military and express legal protection for sexual orientation.
Applause for Kolbe was restrained in comparison to the raucous reception given to most speakers.
The muted reaction was as close to dissention as the convention has come in two evenings devoted to showing a new, more tolerant face of the GOP.
After years of political rejection, gay Republicans and their backers said the choice of Kolbe as a convention speaker furthered the message of inclusion that Bush is sending through the convention.
``We're happy to see changes taking place at our convention,'' said Rich Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans.
In 1992, there were two openly gay GOP delegates, he recalled, while this year there are 18 to 20.
``This is a party that's trying to expand its base,'' said Catania, who was among a dozen gay Republicans who met with Bush in Austin in April.
That meeting ended with disagreement on a lot of issues, he conceded, ``but the governor agreed to keep an open mind''.
``It's a great step in the right direction,'' said Fred Ronstadt, Linda's cousin and a Tucson city councilman whose wife works on Kolbe's campaign.
``Our party needs to be inclusive''.
At a reception sponsored by the Log Cabin Republicans, Kolbe stressed he was chosen to speak because of his economic views and not his private life.
``I never knew there was such an interest in trade by the media,'' joked Kolbe, as TV crews jostled for position in the packed room.
``I want to thank Governor Bush for sending a message of inclusion because I had been a McCain supporter''.
Kolbe, 58, acknowledged being gay in 1996, but has not been an outspoken activist on gay issues.
As chairman of an Appropriations subcommittee, he has led overseas trade missions.
In recent sessions, he pushed for approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China.
For the convention, ``he was well chosen to be the spokesman for free trade,'' said Rep.
Connie Morella, R-Md.

WASHINGTON _ Gay Republicans strongly opposed to elements of the party's platform are running into roadblocks erected by social conservatives who on Tuesday vowed to defend language opposing same-sex marriages and homosexual service in the military.
Representatives of the Traditional Values Coalition and the Family Research Council, both conservative bastions of opposition to gay rights, met Tuesday with Wisconsin Gov.
Tommy Thompson, chairman of the GOP committee that gathers in Philadelphia later this week to hash out they party's platform.
``We felt good about overall tenor of meeting, and it did sound as if (the platform committee) would address some of our major concerns,'' said Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's vice president for public affairs.
``They don't want to sound harsh.
We're trying to work with them to find a way to do that''.
Gay Republicans ``want to neuter the platform so that next time they can come in and say homosexual marriage is OK and gays in the military are OK,'' said Andrea Sheldon, executive director of the Traditional Values Coalition.
A platform that does not oppose gay rights would be ``a defeat for pro-Christian, pro-family voters who are inclined to vote conservative Republican''.
As is the case with other contentious social issues such as abortion, the gay rights issue is something of a thorn in the side of Republicans and their presidential hopeful, Texas Gov.
George W.
Bush. On the one hand, Bush is intent on reaching out to voting blocs such as Hispanics that have not traditionally been courted by Republicans.
On the other hand, reaching out to gays would cost him critical support from social conservatives.
In the short run, the social conservatives want to block efforts to eliminate the 1996 platform's stand against giving gays protection under civil rights laws.
The Log Cabin Republicans, an association of gay Republicans, and their supporters want to excise language favoring a ban on gays in the military, and supporting the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which permits states not to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states.
The dispute goes into its final stages this Friday and Saturday when the GOP platform committee hashes out the final draft of the party's 2000 platform in Philadelphia.
Republicans attending the convention then vote on the platform on Monday.
Win or lose, gay Republicans say they give the Bush campaign high marks for steering the party away from a confrontational tone.
Hostility to gays, for instance, surfaced in the 1992 GOP convention when conservative candidate Patrick Buchanan called for a ``cultural war'' against advocates of gay rights and abortion rights.
``There's no doubt in my mind there's effort by the Bush camp to send a message,'' said Rich Tafel, executive director of Log Cabin Republicans, noting that for the first time an openly gay member of Congress, Rep.
Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.
, will address the convention.
``We appreciate their efforts.
We understand it's a hassle for them''.
The 1996 GOP platform states: ``We reject the distortion of (civil rights) laws to cover sexual preference, and we endorse the Defense of Marriage Act to prevent states from being forced to recognize same-sex unions''.
It also says: ``We oppose Bill Clinton's assault on the culture and traditions of the Armed Forces, especially his attempt to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military.
We affirm that homosexuality is incompatible with military service''.
In line with Bush's effort to reach out, Thompson met with the Log Cabin Republicans earlier this month.
Thompson's spokesman, Kevin Keane, did not hold out much hope for the gay Republican strategy.
``It all comes down to the 107 (platform committee) delegates who vote on what's in, and what's not in, the platform,'' he said.
``I suspect it'll be tough to change anything because the 107 delegates are from the more conservative end of spectrum''.
&QL; (STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS).
&QL; &QL; Bush himself met with 12 prominent gay Republicans in April and declared himself ``a better person'' for having listened to their pleas for greater inclusion in the GOP ranks.
Still Bush did not change his views, which run mostly parallel to the 1996 GOP platform.
The gays in the military issue is an exception.
Bush has said he supports the military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy that permits gays in the military as long as they don't engage in homosexual activity, and he opposes a return to a total ban on gays in uniform.
Still, Tafel said gay Republicans are trying to look past the Republican platform debate to the convention itself and Bush's campaign against Vice President Al Gore.
``Some language unites and some pushes people out, and my sense is (Bush) wants language that unites,'' Tafel said.
``The language there now doesn't do that.
But at the same time it's not something the (Bush campaign) completely controls''.

PHILADELPHIA _ As Republicans wrapped up their convention intended to highlight inclusiveness, gay political organizations squared off Thursday over whether the party has a newfound moderation toward homosexuals.
Leaders of the nation's largest gay political organization said the GOP national convention demonstrated ``meanness'' toward gays and that the election of presidential nominee George W.
Bush and his running mate Dick Cheney would be a setback for gay rights.
``The verdict is in,'' Winnie Stachelberg, political director for the Human Rights Campaign, said as Bush prepared to deliver his acceptance speech.
``A Bush-Cheney administration has the potential to be very harmful for gays and lesbians.
... It is clear that the kinder, gentler face we see at the convention is nothing more than a facade''.
Elizabeth Birch, the group's executive director, said that the four-day affair was disappointing, even though the GOP sought to soften hard-line opposition to homosexual rights by allowing Rep.
Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.
, to address delegates.
Kolbe is openly gay.
The gay rights officials spoke at a news conference in Washington, D.C.
The Human Rights Campaign already has endorsed Vice President Al Gore for president.
Birch said she was ```very disturbed'' by the GOP platform, which included language gay Republicans wanted removed.
Birch said ``a kind of meanness won out'' when the platform was finalized on Monday.
The platform defines marriage ``as the legal union of one man and one woman''.
It says that ``federal judges and bureaucrats should not force states to recognize other living arrangements as marriages''.
And the platform further says that homosexuals should be exempt from anti-discrimination laws and that homosexuality is incompatible with military service.
Stachelberg said a low point for gays at the Republican convention was on Tuesday as Kolbe spoke to delegates in a four-minute speech on international trade.
Several members of Bush's own Texas delegation removed their cowboy hats and bowed their heads in prayer.
Birch noted the irony of the Republican position, saying that Cheney's daughter Mary is openly lesbian.
``The presence of Mary Cheney as an openly lesbian person shines a light on the fact that George W.
Bush and Dick Cheney have positions of grave concern to gay and lesbian people in this country,'' Birch said.
But Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, the country's largest organization for gay Republicans, said despite the Kolbe incident and the platform, the convention was by far the most successful ever for homosexual Republicans.
Ivers said that the ``old social conservative paradigm'' in the Republican party this week ``is showing signs that is is crumbling''.
''We've seen real advances this week,`` he said, pointing to a platform committee that had initially removed the anti-gay language, only to be overruled by conservatives.
The fact that Kolbe was asked to speak by Bush was a significant attempt at reaching out to gay Republicans, he said, adding that most of the 2,066 convention delegates applauded Kolbe heartily.
One other indication that the party is warming to gays: there were more openly gay convention delegates (19) to this GOP convention than at any previous.
There were five gay delegates in 1996 and two alternates in 1992, Ivers said.
``This week was a success.
We are at a turning point (in the Republican Party) on gay and lesbian issues,'' Ivers said.
Bush's relationship with gays and lesbians has been strained.
During the Republican primaries, Bush at first refused to meet with gay rights groups.
But in April, he met with gay Republicans saying afterwards that he was ``a better man'' for it.
Republicans also note that Cheney, while secretary of defense in 1991, supported his spokesman, Pete Williams, when he announced he was gay.
``I have operated on the basis, over the years, with respect to my personal staff that I don't ask them about their private lives.
... As long as they perform their professional responsibilities in a responsible manner, their private lives are their business,'' Cheney said. $$$
AUSTIN, Texas _ Republican presidential front-runner George W.
Bush has vowed to bring minority groups into the GOP fold.
But members of one minority group _ gays and lesbians _ still aren't sure whether Bush's emphasis on inclusiveness includes them.
During a recent debate, Bush said he would appoint people based on their qualifications, not their sexual orientation.
But he has refused to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay GOP group.
Gay-rights advocates hold positions in the Bush campaign.
But the governor promised a group of Christian conservatives that as president he wouldn't appoint people who espouse a homosexual lifestyle.
Bush's mixed signals reflect the complexities of cultivating a relationship with the gay community.
If he embraces it, Bush could lose Christian conservative votes in the GOP primaries or, in the general election, against a socially conservative third-party candidate such as Pat Buchanan.
But exit polls suggest that gay voters make up about 5 percent of the electorate _ about the same as Hispanics _ and they are concentrated in electoral-vote-rich states such as California, New York, Illinois and Florida.
Conceding so many votes to the Democrats could be politically perilous.
``There are lots of gay people who by tradition and heritage would be much more at home in the Republican Party, were it not for things like George Bush being embarrassed to be seen with homosexuals,'' said Kenneth Sherrill, a political science professor at Hunter College in New York City who studies gay rights issues.
As the country becomes increasingly tolerant of homosexuality, Bush's lukewarm attitude may alienate heterosexual voters as well, Sherrill said.
``This strikes me as a classic example of what happens when a candidate adopts a strategy that's designed to win the nomination, even at the cost of losing the election,'' he said.
In contrast, Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley haven't been bashful about courting the gay vote, which could be especially critical in their fight for the Democratic nomination.
People who identify themselves as gay make up between 8 percent and 9 percent of the Democratic electorate nationwide, and slightly more in the crucial primary states of New York and California.
In a recent debate, both Democrats argued that the current ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military isn't working and that gays should be allowed to serve openly.
Gore and Bradley are cognizant of polls that show 70 percent of Americans support that view, although 76 percent of senior military officers oppose it.
Furthermore, in the wake of several high-profile murders of gays, people are increasingly sensitive to the dangers of discrimination.
Even the Rev.
Jerry Falwell, the Virginia preacher who founded the Moral Majority, has called for an end to anti-gay rhetoric.
During a recent GOP debate, several Republican candidates said gays should be banned from the military and characterized them as immoral.
But Bush and his closest rival, Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, declined to criticize homosexuality and said they support the current policy.
Unlike Bush, however, McCain met with the Log Cabin Republicans.
Asked during a television interview to explain his refusal to meet with the group, Bush said he didn't believe in ``group thought'' or ``pitting one group of people against another''.
Many were puzzled by that explanation, given that Bush frequently meets with other political and interest groups.
Bush spokesman Scott McClellan shed little light on that response, saying Bush refused to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans because they politicize gay issues.
``He does not believe in politicizing the issue, and this is a group that wants to politicize it,'' McClellan said.
He added that Bush didn't see the point of meeting with the group because he disagrees with its positions.
Nor would the Bush campaign say whether the governor agrees with the Texas GOP's platform position on gays and lesbians, which is that ``homosexual behavior is contrary to the fundamental, unchanging truths that have been ordained by God''.
Instead, campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said that Bush believes that ``it's not his place to judge other people''.
Bush's Texas legislative record also is open to interpretation.
Rep. Glen Maxey, the only openly gay member of the Texas Legislature, describes Bush as ``pretty benign'' because whatever his policy positions, he hasn't resorted to anti-gay rhetoric.
``He's not a Jesse Helms,'' Maxey (D-Austin) said in a reference to the conservative North Carolina senator.
``But at a time when there's a tremendous rise in hate crimes, and discrimination in the workplace still abounds, the fact that a leader would not see gay and lesbian issues as important or take a position one way or the other is troubling to me''.
When state lawmakers last year proposed a bill barring gays and lesbians from adopting children in state custody, Bush said he believed that children were better off in homes with traditional couples.
But the state already favors such arrangements, and Bush wouldn't say whether he supported the bill, which would have removed children from gay and lesbian homes.
The legislation never reached his desk.
Bush also declined to take a firm position last year on a hate-crimes bill that would have listed homosexuals as a protected group.
He argued that all violent crimes are hate crimes and noted that Texas already has a hate-crimes law, albeit one that doesn't specify who is protected.
Bush promised to consider the latest version if lawmakers approved it, but he declined to help break the legislative deadlock that eventually killed the proposal.
Gay rights groups suspected that the bill's protection of gays was behind his failure to support the bill, but Bush denied the charge.
Like presidential candidates from both parties, Bush opposes same-sex marriages.
The Democrats want to guarantee legal and financial benefits to gay and lesbian partnerships, but they maintain that marriage is a religious and cultural institution reserved for a man and a woman.
``Bush has had a fair record, and many gays believe he's been a good governor.
But he does need to move more on some gay political issues,'' said Steve Labinski, who heads the Texas branch of the Log Cabin Republicans.
Gay Texas Republicans note that during the party's 1998 convention, Bush urged the GOP to allow the state's Log Cabin Republicans, who had been banned from setting up a booth, to do so.
Maxey suspects that some of Bush's positions are the result of political considerations rather than his personal views.
He points to a conversation he had with Bush last spring on the floor of the Texas House.
Maxey said the governor told him his stance on the gay adoption bill had nothing to do with his view of Maxey, whom he ``valued as a person''.
Based on that talk, Maxey believes that Bush is a lot more tolerant of gays than his record might indicate.
Bush, however, said later that the two discussed children's health insurance, not homosexuality.
Members of the Madison Project, a conservative political action committee, came away from a September meeting with Bush with a different impression than Maxey.
Michael Farris, the chairman of the group, said he asked Bush about his comment that he wouldn't fire an aide he discovered to be gay.
Farris was reassured by Bush's response.
``He said I'm not going to appoint people who are open advocates of the homosexual lifestyle because their policies aren't likely to be my policies on issues,'' Farris said.
Openly gay people serve on some of Bush's state steering committees, but Farris said he is not bothered by that because the panels are mostly honorary.
Furthermore, Farris believes that Bush has genuinely conservative views ``in his heart'' about homosexuality.
Gay Republicans hope Farris is wrong and that Bush is simply doing what he must to win the GOP primaries.
They say he may be more receptive to gays once he's the nominee.
Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for the national Log Cabin Republicans, said Bush should be well aware of the importance of creating a tolerant image for the GOP in the general election.
Ivers argues that Buchanan's anti-gay remarks at the 1992 Republican convention tarnished the party, helping to seal the failure of President George Bush's re-election bid.
``How the Republican Party deals with gays and lesbians is an indication of how it's going to deal with this persistent problem they have of being labeled as intolerant,'' Ivers said.
``The gay issue is the most hot-button issue of all the minority issues in this election''.

WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders, nervous about possible anti-homosexual remarks during floor debate on anti-gay legislation, said Thursday that they have devised a strategy to smother any fiery rhetoric on the issue.
They hope to convert the debate over an anti-gay proposal into a dignified discussion about presidential powers.
And they will limit the entire debate to 20 minutes.
The touchy legislation, sponsored by Rep.
Joel Hefley, R-Colo.
, would nullify an executive order issued in May by President Clinton that bars federal agencies from discriminating against gays.
The Republican leadership in the House has combined the Hefley proposal with legislation to nullify another executive order expanding federal jurisdiction at the expense of state and local governments.
The result: a dry-as-dust constitutional debate about states rights rather than a potentially emotional confrontation over the hot-button issue of gay rights.
The planned debate is expected as early as Monday.
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
, an acknowledged homosexual, said the brevity of the scheduled debate ``shows how embarrassed (the Republicans) are by this''.
``This is a very oppressive, outrageous and undemocratic way to talk about things,'' Frank said.
But Rep.
John Linder, R-Ga.
, who said it was his idea to blur the debate over Hefley's amendment, said 20 minutes of debate was more than enough time.
``I think five minutes is plenty on this issue,'' Linder said.
As chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee responsible for helping elect House Republicans this November, Linder said he ``did not want to see a debate on the floor over the gay issue''.
``I'm hoping to see the debate be on the broader issue of executive orders,'' Linder said.
Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.
, the only openly gay House Republican, agreed with Linder that an all-out debate on gay rights made him squeamish.
Koble said he was ``not anxious for a long debate on this''.
``The debate is not going to be terribly pleasant,'' Kolbe said.
``I don't think anybody's mind is going to be changed by it''.
Frank said Republican leaders resorted to the bundling tactic because they realized there wasn't sufficient support among House members for Hefley's anti-homosexual amendment if it stood alone.
``The Hefley amendment became the damsel in distress,'' Frank said.
``They're trying to use the other one to rescue Hefley''.
Rep. Gerald B.H.
Solomon, R-N.Y.
, chairman of the House Rules Committee, said GOP leaders decided to combine the proposals because they both deal with what Republicans claim is Clinton's abuse of executive orders to circumvent Congress.
But Winnie Stachelberg, political director of the gay advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign, said ``the Republicans sensed defeat and then they backtracked''.
``Gay and lesbian issues are not a recipe for defeat'' for Republicans, Stachelberg said.
``I think those who support equality for gays and lesbians are more appealing to voters back home.
Voters want their members to treat people fairly and not to discriminate''.
Some Republicans agreed with those sentiments.
Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
, who isn't shy about taking potshots at the GOP leadership, said in an interview he has been ``offended'' by his party's efforts to push through the Hefley amendment.
``This amendment is designed to placate our so-called base,'' Shays said, referring to conservative Christian groups opposed to homosexuality.
``I am being more and more offended by what people feel our base is.
I am pretty determined to speak out against any statement that goes after gays and tries to dehumanize them for the purpose of gilding our base.
That is wrong''.
Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla.
, said the Hefley amendment ``comes off as mean-spirited,'' adding: ``I saw this as a potentially explosive issue.''
WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has renominated James Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg, and a White House official said Tuesday the administration hopes ``fairness will prevail'' in the new Congress so he can be approved for the job.
The Senate last year refused to vote on the nomination of Hormel after several conservative Republicans accused him of promoting homosexual views.
The White House accused lawmakers of prejudice.
Hormel, who is gay, was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
, didn't allow his nomination to come to the floor in the face of scattered GOP objections.
Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, expressed confidence Hormel would be approved by the full Senate this year because a majority back the 66-year-old San Francisco philanthropist and heir to the Hormel Meat Co.
``We had the support of over 60 senators for the nomination in the last Congress and we felt that it was unfair that his nomination was not brought to the floor for a vote,'' Toiv said.
``But we are hopeful that in the new Congress fairness will prevail and he will have a chance to have his nomination voted up or down.
He is very well-qualified''.
Hormel's renomination was first reported in Tuesday's editions of the San Francisco Chronicle.
Toiv said Hormel was among a number of renominations Clinton submitted to the new Congress, which began its work this month.
If approved, Hormel would be the first openly gay U.S. envoy.
Christian right groups had attacked Hormel, a vocal supporter of gay rights and AIDS causes, over his sponsorship of a gay and lesbian center at the San Francisco Public Library that bears his name.
Republican critics called some of the material obscene and feared Hormel might promote a ``gay agenda'' as ambassador to the tiny European nation.
In a letter to the Senate last year, however, Hormel said he had no control over the books in the library and he rejected the notion he would promote gay rights while representing the United States overseas.
He also promised not to bring his partner to Luxembourg.
Hormel must go through the entire nomination process again, including approval at the committee level before a Senate vote.
The leader of one of Texas's most conservative Christian groups criticized national Republican party officials on Thursday for inviting a homosexual congressman to speak at the GOP convention in Philadelphia next week.
A spokesman for Texas Gov.
George Bush, who is expected to win the presidential nomination at the convention, replied that Arizona Rep.
Jim Kolbe's sexual orientation has nothing to do with his scheduled speech on free trade.
Cathie Adams, president of the Eagle Forum of Texas and a member of the national party's platform committee, said the decision to invite Kolbe directly contradicts the ``pro-family'' plank of the GOP platform, which does not uphold the rights of homosexuals.
Adams stopped short of pulling her support from Bush, saying ``I'm not making any threats like that right now''.
But, she said, ``this is a quota.
... This is being done to pander to the homosexual agenda''.
Kolbe is scheduled to address the convention about free trade issues for three minutes on Tuesday night.
According to the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay conservative group, it will be the first time a homosexual man has spoken at the GOP's national convention.
Adams sent an e-mail to about 500 people on Thursday _ delegates and others _ from Philadelphia, where she is meeting with the platform committee in preparation for next week's convention.
``My heart is crying,'' Adams wrote.
``I need your prayers for a response that proclaims God-fearing wisdom.
... ``It's hypocritical to have that plank, then invite an open homosexual to address our convention just because he's homosexual,'' she wrote, referring to the pro-family plank in the GOP platform.
A Kolbe spokeswoman said she had not seen the letter and declined to comment.
A Bush spokesman said the Congressman's sexual orientation ``is not a factor''.
``We're pleased that he'll be talking about the importance of free trade and opening markets to American products and producers,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan.
``Congressman Kolbe is a leader in promoting and encouraging free and fair trade''.
State party leaders agreed, saying Kolbe's sexual orientation is ``a nonissue''.
``I would respectfully disagree'' with Adams' characterization, said Texas state party spokesman Robert Black.
``It appears that Congressman Kolbe has decided that the broad issues that all Republicans agree upon is more important than his homoseuxal rights agenda, and that's why he has decided to speak at the convention''.
Bush was criticized by Christian groups earlier this year after meeting with Log Cabin Republicans and saying he welcomed them in his campaign.
Adams suggested the party invite conservative Alan Keyes, who lost his bid for the nomination early in the primary season, to speak on moral issues ``to save face with all the families across America''.
``The epitome of that ability as an orator on moral and social issues is Alan Keyes,'' she said.
Keyes spokeswoman Connie Hair said his phone lines were down at his home and he could not be reached for comment.

WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov.
George W.
Bush's first-ever meeting with gay Republicans may bolster his image as a ``compassionate conservative'' but the session this Thursday in Austin, Texas, has irked leaders of a nationwide gay GOP group who weren't invited.
Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, said Monday the two-term governor looks forward to his invitation-only meeting with 13 gay Republicans, including rank-and-file members of the Log Cabin Republicans, a national organization of gay Republicans.
Among those not invited were leaders of the Log Cabin organization, which endorsed Sen.
John McGain, R-Ariz.
, in the GOP primary.
``All Republicans are important in this election,'' Tucker said.
``We have to unify our party to be successful in November.
Part of unifying is reaching out and being inclusive''.
During his hard-fought presidential primary campaign when he was seeking the support of conservatives, Bush refused to meet with gay Republicans or representatives of the 11,000-member Log Cabin Republicans.
Bush explained at the time that such a meeting ``creates a huge political scene'' and that he ``didn't want to create a ruckus''.
Bush announced plans last week to meet with the GOP gays at the governor's mansion, saying the post-primary season is ``a different time''.
`It's important for me to unify our party.
And I welcome the gay Americans who support me, some of whom are members of the Log Cabin Republican club,'' he added.
Gays and lesbians voters made up about 5 percent of the electorate nationwide in 1996, according to exit polls conducted by Voters News Service during voting that year.
But the gay community tends to support Democrats for federal office more often than Republicans.
For example, in California's March 7 primary _ in which voters could cast popular votes for candidates in either party _ 2 percent of voters in the GOP primary and 11 percent of voters in the Democratic primary told exit poll surveys they were gay.
Tucker said that Bush wants to discuss the ``common goal of ending the Clinton-Gore era'' as well as ``other issues of importance to the governor and the group''.
Tucker added: ``The governor always likes to take the opportunity to talk about why he's running for president''.
Tucker said Bush would discuss education, tax cuts, a defense buildup, and steps to strengthen Social Security and Medicare.
She said she did not know if Bush would discuss proposals for broadening the federal campaign to combat AIDS or steps to tackle the discrimination that ranks as a top priority for many gay and lesbian activists.
GOP presidential nominees and the Log Cabin Republicans have a stormy history.
Republican nominee Bob Dole, a former Senate majority leader from Kansas, rejected a campaign donation from Log Cabin Republicans in 1996 in a bid to cement political support from voters who might be offended.
Bush's meeting has stirred controversy within the gay community.
David Hanson, a leader of Log Cabin Republicans in California from San Juan Capistrano, Calif.
, wrote to Bush last week to complain that the exclusive meeting with gay Republicans in Austin was merely ``an effort to end the media story'' rather than an attempt to ``deal forthrightly'' with the issues that concern gay civil rights activists.
Rich Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, the nationwide organization founded in 1978 that raises about $100,000 every two years to help Republican candidates in federal elections, said he has not been invited to meet with Bush.
Tafel's organization ran $20,000 in radio advertisements before the March 7 Super-Tuesday primaries that offered support for McCain, Bush's rival.
In a 1,800-word memo to members on the organization's website, Tafel said Bush's refusal to meet with the national leadership of the Log Cabin Republicans ``has illuminated many of the flaws in his campaign which may have an impact on our party's chances in November''.
Tafel said that Bush ``demands loyalty'' before considering a meeting.
Tafel adds: ``Bush, far from being a uniter who is compassionate, has actually played upon divisions to win the nomination and now shows little desire to heal them.
A candidate who cannot unite the Republican party won't win this elector''.
Carl Schmid, an alternative GOP delegate to the GOP convention from Washington, D.C., who serves on the board of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay rights advocacy organization in the nation, said he was meeting with Bush in an effort to ``improve the understanding of gay people and gay issues within the Republican party''.
Schmid added that Bush was holding the first meeting in history between openly gay Republicans and a presumptive GOP nominee.
``That shows that Gov.
Bush is trying to unite the party and broaden the level of support for his candidacy,'' Schmid said.
Schmid said that he hoped that leaders of the Log Cabin Republicans eventually ``will be invited to such a meeting in the future,'' adding that the first session with the presumptive GOP nominee was being reserved for ``gay Republicans who have worked with the campaign for the past year''.
Among others who have been invited to take part are: _ David Greer, chairman of the Pennsylvania Log Cabin Republicans; _ Rebecca Maestri, a member of the Northern Virginia chapter of Log Cabin Republican Club; _ David Catania, a city council member in Washington, D.C.
_ Plattsburgh, N.Y., Mayor Jim Stewart; _ Former Rep.
Steve Gunderson, R-Wis.
Log Cabin Republicans favor ``full equality'' for gays, including granting the legal protections of marriage to same-sex couples.
Bush has voiced opposition to sanctioning gay marriages.
He has been ambiguous about whether he would appoint openly gay people to posts in federal government.
Tucker said the Bush campaign is aware of Tafel's criticism but added: ``I really won't want to respond to him directly''.
Tucker said the Bush campaign would await the outcome of Thursday's meeting to map its next overtures to gay Republicans and gay Americans for the fall campaign.

The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug.
12: Gay men and lesbians may be born homosexual, but they aren't born Democrats.
They have often voted that way, however, because the national Republican Party has been so hostile.
Now, in the ebb of the great cultural wars mounted by conservatives for the last two decades, that seems to be changing.
The most prominent Republican candidates for president in the next election, as Katharine Seelye reported Wednesday in The Times, are taking positions that are ``subtly but fundamentally more inviting'' to gay and lesbian voters than at any time before.
Some, boiled down, are not all that subtle.
Texas Gov.
George W.
Bush Jr.
has said he would have no qualms hiring homosexuals.
Elizabeth Dole has declared that she would not turn away money from a gay Republican group, as her husband did in the 1996 campaign.
The plain-spoken Sen.
John McCain said he could envision a gay president someday.
But even the more subtle changes in the candidate field are remarkable.
When asked how he would react if one of his children were homosexual, former Vice President Dan Quayle, the standard-bearer of the religious right, said he would be supportive ``whatever they are''.
The pugnacious Patrick Buchanan, who declared ``a cultural war'' aimed squarely at homosexuals from the podium of the Republican National Convention in 1992, has not made the subject an issue this year.
That represents a sea change.
It was the Republican Party that first turned anti-homosexual attitudes into a political weapon.
It was among Republicans in the Senate in the McCarthy era that the witch hunt for homosexuals in government and the military began.
It was President Dwight Eisenhower who signed the executive order making homosexuality grounds for rejection or dismissal from federal employment, a directive that J.
Edgar Hoover's FBI, local police and local Republicans and Democrats alike turned into a decades-long hunt.
It was the television preachers of the religious right, reacting against the gay rights movement in the 1970s, who began to set the social agenda for the modern Republican Party 20 years ago.
The height of their influence came with Pat Buchanan's and Pat Robertson's speeches at the Republican Convention in 1992, but that spring Bill Clinton reached out to homosexuals in a single appearance at a gay fund-raiser in Hollywood.
No nominee had done that before, and the opposing party views produced a national gay vote for the first time in the 1992 presidential election.
It went Democratic, and in states like Georgia, which Clinton won by only 16,000 votes, it may have been decisive.
Republican oratory has been growing more moderate ever since.
In Congress, where Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, have solid fundamentalist voter bases back home, mean-spirited talk about homosexuals has continued.
But Ralph Reed, president of the Christian Coalition until last year, never made homosexuals a national campaign issue after 1992.
There are still 15 months for this new tolerance to be tested.
But for now it is refreshing to listen to the voice of an important preacher in the Republican Party, Rich Tafel, an ordained American Baptist minister and the head of the national gay Log Cabin Republicans.
For years, he and other gay Republicans have been feeling unwanted.
Now, he says, ``the tone has totally changed''.
That may not be music to the ears of Democrats like Vice President Al Gore, who has spent years being friendly to homosexuals.
But after half a century of jeers and police whistles, it is a hopeful sound indeed.
AUSTIN, Texas _ A West Texas legislator is sponsoring a bill that would ban gays and lesbians from becoming foster parents or adopting children in state custody, prompting a sharp attack from a gay Republican group.
``This bill is offensive, and I think any fair-minded individual will find this bill to be offensive,'' said Steve Labinski, president of Log Cabin Republicans of Texas, which advocates equal treatment of homosexuals in the GOP.
The proposal, filed this week by state Rep.
Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, would direct Child Protective Services not to place children in homes with homosexual parents and defines their sexual practices as ``deviate''.
Private adoptions would not be affected, but thousands of children at risk could be.
Currently the state oversees 17,578 foster children and last year approved 1,548 adoptions.
Labinski called Chisum's proposal ``unrepublican'' and said it hardly echoes the concept of ``compassionate conservatism'' championed by Gov.
George W.
Bush. Chisum, however, maintains that his research shows homosexual parents place children at risk of an unhealthy lifestyle, illegal activity or an unstable home life.
Chisum considers homosexual acts illegal under the state's sodomy law.
``This bill is not about any rights of gays and lesbians to be parents,'' said Chisum, who sponsored an unsuccessful bill in the 1997 legislative session that said Texas would not recognize gay marriages.
``This bill ensures that the state will provide the best possible homes for children who have already been abused and neglected,'' Chisum said.
The issue could erupt into a divisive debate should it hit the floor of the Texas House when the Legislature meets next year.
State Rep.
Glen Maxey, an Austin Democrat and the only openly gay legislator, has said any law or policy that authorized such a ``witch hunt'' would ``create a world of hurt''.
The bill responds to a dispute last year when Dallas CPS caseworker Rebecca Bledsoe was disciplined after abruptly removing an infant from the home of a lesbian foster parent.
Bledsoe said she was told she had failed to show respect for the foster mother.
She filed a lawsuit against the state in September, and the American Civil Liberties Union intervened the following month to argue against Bledsoe.
CPS officials have said Bledsoe wrongfully removed the child, violating agency policy because she did not notify the child's foster mother or the child's attorney first.
``We're looking for a placement that is going to best meet these kids' needs who have been abused or neglected.
We simply do not screen based on sexual preference or sexual orientation,'' said Marla Sheely, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services, the umbrella agency for CPS.
Homes are screened to ensure safe environments, whether the parents are ``green, purple, gay, straight, whatever,'' Sheely said.
&QL; XXXX END OF STORY &QL;
AUSTIN, Texas _ Anti-gay rights groups concerned about Gov.
George W.
Bush's recent meeting with gay Republicans now want the probable GOP presidential nominee to meet with them so they can enlighten him about ``the homosexual political agenda''.
``The homosexual agenda is incompatible with family life,'' the groups, including the Southern Baptist Convention, told Bush in a letter saying he should meet with them to ``demonstrate your commitment to the family by...
meeting with those of us who believe that homosexual activism poses a serious threat to our marriage-based culture and to the freedoms of speech, religion and association''.
Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush meets with pro-family leaders ``all the time'' but no decision has been made on whether he would sit down with the groups who sent the letter.
``He agrees with them on the importance of families and the sanctity of marriage,'' McClellan said, adding, ``Governor Bush is running an inclusive campaign and he welcomes the support of all Americans''.
The meeting request comes as Bush steps up his efforts to offer a bipartisan and inclusive image that includes inviting support from gay voters.
After months of declining to meet with leaders of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay organization, Bush earlier this month huddled privately with 12 gay Republicans hand-picked by his campaign.
Included was former U.S.
Rep. Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin, who said the session meant that ``never again will a major-party candidate be able to run for president without addressing gay and lesbian issues''.
On Thursday, Gunderson criticized the letter from the groups as something less than a request for ``dialogue or honest conversation''.
``There is a desire for a confrontation and an ultimatum,'' he said.
Gunderson said the letter is indicative of how tricky the equation is as Bush tries to put a more tolerant face on their party.
``There is no question that the struggle within the Republican Party is to hold together an increasingly diverse coalition,'' said Gunderson.
``And we all need to help manage it.
I would hope that could be done in ways other than public debates through press releases''.
The 12 groups said they want to tell Bush ``the facts behind the homosexual political agenda that often go unreported''.
``Homosexual activists are trying to use the Republican Party, much like the Democratic Party, as a vehicle to achieve their strategic objective of harnessing government and corporate power to impose acceptance of homosexual behavior,'' the groups told Bush, adding that gay groups ``seek nothing less than the ability to mandate teaching to schoolchildren that homosexuality is normal and healthy''.
``The legal attack on the Boy Scouts is the most visible example of where this agenda will lead if it is not firmly _ and actively _ opposed,'' the groups told Bush.
The U.S.
Supreme Court on Wednesday heard arguments in a case sparked by the Boy Scouts' expulsion of a New Jersey leader who is gay.
Bush's foray into gay issues also comes as some conservative groups are angered over the Vermont Legislature's approval this week of marriage-like ``gay unions,'' and shortly before Sunday's ``Millennium March'' in Washington that is expected to attract 300,000 supporters of gay rights.
Organizers hope the rally will highlight the issue in a presidential election year.
Bush has tried to reach out to gay voters without embracing their positions.
After his meeting with the gay Republicans, Bush said his message to conservatives upset about the session would be, ``I welcome gay Americans into my campaign.
... But I want the conservative Republicans to understand that we judge people based upon their heart and soul, and while we disagree on gay marriage, for example, we agree on a lot of other issues and it's important for people to hear that''.
Bush said he was a ``better person'' for having met with the gay Republicans, and that their life stories were ``very compelling''.
Though he said he welcomed gay voters into his campaign, Bush reiterated his opposition to initiatives of importance to that community, including same-sex marriages, adoptions by gay couples and expanding anti-hate crime laws to treat homosexuals in the same manner as racial and ethnic minorities.
The meeting upset some conservative Republicans, including former presidential contender Gary Bauer who said it ``elevated the gay rights agenda to a level of recognition within the Republican Party that contradicts our long-standing commitment to pro-family values''.
In their letter to Bush, the conservative groups, including the Family Research Council, the American Family Association and Concerned Women for America, indicated that they agree with Bauer.
``You will find that homosexual activists will not be satisfied with the civil rights all Americans enjoy.
They do not want tolerance; that's what they have.
They demand acceptance of their lifestyle and protection for their practices.
This will devastate family life and wholly undermine your plans to restore the morale of our military,'' the groups told Bush.

WASHINGTON _ Sen &UR;. &LR; Afonse D'Amato met privately Monoday with leaders from several major gay organizations, some of which have been among his sharpest critics, to defend his positions on homosexual issues and to ask for their support in his campaign for re-election.
People who attended the meeting at a private club in midtown Manhattan said by telephone that D'Amato, a Republican who is seeking his fourth term this year, had asked to meet with the groups because he felt that his record on gay rights was deeply misunderstood.
The meeting showed how far D'Amato has come in his willingness to anger the conservatives that represent his political base to win votes from moderate to liberal voters.
The senator will be running on the Conservative Party line in November and is seeking the nomination of the Right to Life Party as well.
``I would think it doesn't help him with individual conservative voters in New York,'' said Michael Long, chairman of the state's Conservative Party.
``But I really don't see conservatives deserting Senator D'Amato''.
Though many of the organizations represented at the meeting are nonprofit groups that do not give political endorsements, several people who attended said they thought that D'Amato was not just seeking support from gay voters, but also trying to burnish his image as a moderate among swing voters, including suburbanites and women.
``In a race where you are going to be attacked as an extremist, it's an inoculating thing to have a good record on gay and lesbian issues,'' said Rich Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, a group representing gay Republicans.
``It's hard to call you a extremist when you are a lead co-sponsor on a nondiscrimination bill for gays and lesbians''.
D'Amato is a co-sponsor of legislation that would prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual preferences.
Several people who attended the meeting said it was frank and open, as many of the advocates pressed D'Amato, whose own record on gay rights is considered relatively strong, to be more forceful in pushing his fellow Republicans to stop blocking such legislation, particularly in Albany.
``It was a good meeting, and it remains to be seen whether it was a good beginning,'' said Richard Burns, executive director of the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center, a nonprofit agency in Greenwich Village.
``There is a disconnect between Senator D'Amato's positions in Washington and the Republican Party here in New York state,'' he continued.
``The local party has institutionalized homophobia on many fronts, and we look to him as a Republican leader to help shape the future behavior and thinking of the New York State Republican Party''.
D'Amato did not return phone calls for comment on the meeting.
``Senator D'Amato was happy to discuss his strong record on civil rights issues with community leaders today,'' said his spokeswoman, Lisette McSoud Mondello.
At the meeting were about 20 people representing about 10 organizations, including the Human Rights Campaign, a political organization; Empire State Pride Agenda, a lobbying group; the Stonewall Democratic Club, the Gay Men's Health Crisis, a nonprofit organization, and the Hetrick-Martin Institute, an agency serving gay youths.
D'Amato has supported gay rights more in recent years, many advocates say.
In 1993, he spoke on the Senate floor in support of gay men and lesbians in the military.
He has also pushed for federal financing for AIDS services.
And this year, he wrote a sharply worded letter to the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss.
, urging him not to block the Clinton administration's gay nominee for ambassador to Luxembourg, James Hormel.
Many Democrats contend D'Amato's shifting views on gay rights fit a pattern of his taking moderate positions near election time.
But associates of D'Amato's contend his positions have been influenced by his friendship with gay people and his opposition to discrimination in general.
Many groups have complained bitterly that D'Amato, who is widely viewed as the most powerful Republican in New York State, has not done enough to pressure the Republican majority leader of the state senate, Joseph L.
Bruno, to stop blocking a sweeping bill in the senate to guarantee rights for gay people.
Several people who have been critical of D'Amato left the meeting pleased with his receptiveness, but still skeptical about his willingness to be their advocate.
``I do think he heard our request,'' said Matt Foreman, executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda.
``But politics really is about results, and not promises.''
WASHINGTON _ Despite high-profile shootings at schools around the country in the past year, such violence has remained steady since 1992 and the world inside the classroom remains a relatively safe place, a report being released Wednesday concludes.
The Justice Policy Institute (JPI), a liberal criminal justice think tank with offices in Washington and San Francisco, said a media-driven public fear about school violence is ``overblown''.
The institute's report charged that policymakers in Washington and in state legislatures have overreacted to a crisis that does not exist and are engaged in a ``tragic misdirection of attention and resources''.
JPI's Jason Ziedenberg, co-author of the study, said, ``Juvenile violence is a real problem in society, but if you really want to track it down, you're looking wrong place.
School is about as safe a place as you can put your kids''.
There were 40 shooting deaths in schools in the 1997-1998 school year, the report said.
A year earlier there were 25.
But In the 1992-1993 school year, 55 shooting deaths occurred.
In 1993-1994 there were 51, followed by 20 in 1994-1995 and 35 in 1995-1996.
Although the number of school deaths jumped 60 percent last year over the year before, Zeidenberg called the increase ``statistically insignificant'' because of the numbers in 1992-1993 and 1993-1994.
The report relied on data from the U.S.
Education Department, the Justice Department, the FBI, nongovernment groups that track school violence and newspaper clippings.
It defined deadly school violence as killings of adults as well as children on school property.
For instance, it counted the May 1998 shooting of a speech diagnostician by her jealous boyfriend at Stranahan High School in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
Concern over school violence reached its apogee in March when two boys, aged 13 and 11, opened fire on a crowd of children and teachers in Jonesboro, Ark.
Four students and one teacher died in the hail of bullets.
Similar incidents during the 1997-1998 school year occurred in Pearl, Miss.
West Paducah, Ky.
Edinboro, Pa.
and Springfield, Ore.
Many news outlets referred to each shooting as ``an all-too-familiar story'' or ``another in a recent trend,'' the JPI report said.
Members of Congress and other officials ``reacted abruptly to what they perceived to be a huge swing in public opinion,'' the report continued, adding: ``A moral panic swept the country''.
President Clinton has endorsed pending legislation to increase the number of police officers available to deal with juvenile crime.
Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, a Republican, suggested reducing the number of nighttime scholastic sporting events and after-school programs as a way of lowering the chance of violence.
Local school administrators also reacted.
Two elementary school students in Tyrone, Ga.
, were temporarily suspended for pinpointing those they wanted to do away with, a list that included Barney the purple dinosaur and the British singing group, Spice Girls.
The report called all these reactions ``overblown''.
It said that ``everyday gun violence'' against children is a far more pressing concern.
More than 3,000 children a year die from gunfire, said the report, quoting figures from the U.S.
National Center for Health Statistics.
Children are killed in gun accidents at 23 times the rate they are killed in schools, the report said.
The relatively flat trend-line noted in the report appeared to be in line with data from other sources.
The FBI, for instance, reported there were 25 homicides committed by juveniles under 13 in 1965 and 16 in 1996.
In a two-year study between 1992 and 1994, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that students had less than a one in a million chance of dying violently in school.
By contrast, the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Program in 1997 calculated that overall, for every million juveniles, 38 were murdered that year.
That's 40 times the rate for deaths in schools, the JPI report said.
The institute's study encouraged continuation of after-school programs as a way of ``productively occupying'' children.
It also recommended gun restrictions, including the ``one-gun-a-month'' laws that limit the quantities of guns an individual can purchase.
Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the conservative Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in Sacramento, Calif.
, said the flat school violence trendline noted in the report ``doesn't mean a whole lot''.
Although down overall in recent years, crime and violence in and out of school remains significantly higher than it was 40 years ago, he said.
LOS ANGELES -- Forget security guards and metal detectors, students and faculty at St.
Genevieve High School in the Panorama City community of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley started the school year figuring out how to get along with each other better.
Juniors and seniors put away their textbooks to paint welcome signs, write greeting letters for freshmen and learn friendship songs _ all building up to a surprise for ninth-graders who start school Thursday.
``This is our version of security,'' said Dan Horn, the school's new principal.
``I never understood the obsession with metal detectors.
You should be teaching educators and kids how to deal with rage''.
It's all part of Horn's dramatic departure from the national preoccupation with metal detectors, surveillance cameras, identification tags and armed guards aimed at preventing bloodshed at schools.
``You might keep guns out with metal detectors, but you won't keep the rage out,'' Horn said Tuesday.
The two Columbine High School students who attacked their Littleton, Colo.
, classmates left notes that detailed their feelings of alienation.
At St.
Genevieve, the goal is to make the school experience inclusive for all students by ``fortifying their hearts'' and creating a campus that values every student, Horn said.
For the first time in years, deeply rooted morale problems seem to have disappeared, students said.
``No one is throwing random insults anymore.
We should have started this way back,'' said 16-year-old Myrel Catbagan.
``On the first day, I thought it would be another boring, stupid day.
But now I really feel like this is my school''.
The juniors and seniors broke into small groups and talked about how to deal with problems that can grow into rage and how to treat every student with dignity and respect.
``We talked about how society creates criminals out of men and boys because we are taught not to express our feelings,'' said 16-year-old junior Muriel Tovar.
``We're learning how to express those feelings and listen to other people who need to talk''.
Some new St.
Genevieve teachers at first were skeptical.
``I didn't think the kids would be receptive to opening up and talking about feelings,'' said world religions teacher Peter Sabado.
``But I'm very surprised with the unity and character building that's going on''.
Sabado has always believed that extra security and metal detectors were just a Band-Aid that does nothing to prevent youth violence.
``Students have issues they need to talk about, and they need to know they can talk to teachers and other students and feel accepted,'' Sabado said.
Joanne Altamira, 16, spent most of Tuesday morning painting greeting posters for the freshman class, with great anticipation of a better school year.
``We don't want anything like Columbine to happen here,'' she said.
``I've got a really good feeling about this school this year.
I feel accepted and wanted.
I hope we leave a mark that stays forever''.
This year's atmosphere is vastly different.
Students described a years-long atmosphere of strict discipline and an administration that didn't seem to respect students, on top of the lure of the gang and drug culture typical of any urban neighborhood.
Javier Cisneros said in his freshman year he ``hung out with the wrong crowd,'' and met some of his classmates by insulting them.
``But then I changed because I saw I could have so many more friends if I treated them right, and I found myself opening up,'' Cisneros said.
``But after I changed, the old principal and some of the teachers kept treating me like a bad kid.
No one noticed that I changed''.
Cisneros credits Horn with re-creating a positive atmosphere and making students feel important, accepted and respected _ all this in the first week of school.
``I feel like that stereotype of me is gone and that I'm accepted,'' Cisneros said.
``It feels good''.
Cisneros is the poster child for what Horn is trying to accomplish.
``With having these focus groups and being positive, we are setting a new foundation built on character,'' Horn said.
``When you put character and issues of human spirit first, the grades, accomplishments, morale and everything else follow''.
Elsewhere on campus, students and faculty members joined to build their school anew.
They helped janitors clean closets and throw away years of debris.
Horn, who believes in the therapeutic effects of animals on humans, brings his dog, Blue, to school with him every day.
``He was a stray I found at my last school, and I found the kids loved it when he ran around campus,'' Horn said.
``He's been a hit here so far''.
But the rebirth of the campus community is what stands out the most.
``Instead of threatening us not to be violent or bad, the teachers are trusting us with everything...
and they keep trusting us,'' said 16-year-old Monica Monterroza.
``It really makes us want to be better and do better''.
And when the freshmen arrive Thursday, there will be no hazing, ignoring or insults.
Only greetings with open arms.
``We want all of the students to feel the same way we do.
We want to really welcome the freshmen,'' said 16-year-old Jellyn Dungo.
``Everything is fresh this year _ new coaches, teachers, principals _ I never thought there could be such a dramatic change here''.

INGLEWOOD, Calif.
(AP) -- A high school is scrapping celebrations of Black History Month and Cinco de Mayo, worried that the ethnic celebrations will spark ethnic violence.
Inglewood High School, 10 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, has been the site of tensions between black and Hispanic students.
The campus was forced to close for a day last May after a riot broke out and dozens of police were called in.
A task force found that the fight in May began, in part, because Hispanic students who comprise about half the school population felt slighted.
They were angry that a month was set aside to honor black history but only a day to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.
Instead of celebrating Black History Month and Cinco de Mayo, Principal Lowell Winston has told teachers to follow a ``multicultural education approach'' throughout the school year.
``Let's talk about all cultures and contributions all the time,'' Winston said.
``This school has had racial problems that are unique...
the old ways didn't work''.
February is marked by many schools around the country as Black History Month.
May 5 is a national holiday in Mexico commemorating an 1862 battle in which Mexico defeated French occupation troops southeast of Mexico City .
MCKEE, Ky.
(AP) -- Students returning to classes at Jackson County High School hardly paid attention to the new small plaques mounted in their classrooms.
Maybe the new dress code was on their minds.
But officials in this eastern Kentucky school district hope that by posting the Ten Commandments in each classroom, they can prevent violence and other problems that have plagued schools nationwide.
The county school board and superintendent allowed the plaques as part of ``an effort to start having good morals in school...
because of all the violent issues that have been showing up,'' said Betty Bond, principal of the high school.
The plaques went up Wednesday.
Schools around the country have considered using the Ten Commandments as a symbol of morality amid headline-grabbing violence involving students over the past year.
In the 1960s, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled that organized prayer and Bible readings were not permitted in public schools; in 1980, it decided posting the Ten Commandments violated the Constitution's ban of government-established religion.
But in June, the U.S.
House passed a measure allowing the Ten Commandments to be posted in schools and other government buildings.
The bill now goes to the Senate.
Timothy Crawford, Jackson County's school district attorney, said he is concerned about lawsuits, but believes the plaques in the district's five schools are allowed by law because they were paid for and posted by local volunteers and not sponsored by the district.
``I do not believe posting the Ten Commandments is imposing anyone's religious views because the kids are not tested on that, the kids are not required to look at it, and the kids are not required to read it, and they're not held accountable for that knowledge,'' Crawford said.
Tonya Adams, principal of Union Chapel Elementary School in Russell County, which has had the Ten Commandments posted for years, said she's never received any complaints about it.
``People in our community would probably be upset if they were taken away,'' Adams said.
In Adams County, Ohio, a group of ministers paid to place Ten Commandments tablets outside four high schools to counter ``moral decline''.
Jeff Vessels, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, said the ACLU considers the move unconstitutional, but would not act unless there is a complaint.
``The ACLU is certainly very concerned about school violence, but saying posting the Ten Commandments solves it is incredibly simplistic,'' he said.
Brad Hughes, spokesman for the Kentucky School Boards Association, said the organization tells districts to follow the Supreme Court ruling and not allow the Ten Commandments to be posted.
He said a lawsuit could cost a district up to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
There was virtually no opposition from the community about the plaques, and students returning to the high school said little about them.
``We have a new dress code this year, and I suspect in the children's mind that's much more of a trauma than the Ten Commandments being placed up because this is a very traditional community and really church-oriented,'' Bond said .
CONYERS, Ga.
_ Exactly one month after the fatal shootings in Littleton, Colo.
, a suicidal high school student, angry over breaking up with his girlfriend, turned his anger on the world Thursday, shooting six of his classmates and emotionally scarring countless others.
No one was killed at Heritage High School in Rockdale County, a middle-class community about 25 miles east of Atlanta.
Five victims suffered minor injuries, and a 15-year-old, Stephanie Laster, underwent surgery after a bullet struck her in the buttocks and entered her intestines.
According to witnesses, the 15-year-old unleashed a barrage of bullets into a crowd of students waiting for school to start.
Known to talk big about his guns, friends said, the boy started shooting at about 8 a.m. into a crowd of about 300 students in the lobby near the cafeteria.
Authorities say he was looking to shoot the boy who had stolen his girl, though that person was not in sight.
The troubled youth surrendered in tears minutes after firing.
By the end of the day, he was charged with aggravated assault.
As the rapid-fire shots ruptured the morning calm, panicked students dropped to the floor, leapt behind tables, or ran out the doors.
``It was a pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,'' sophomore Kylie Forrester said, describing the gunshots that chased the students outside.
``The whole school, everybody, was just roaring out of the school,'' said Amy Ladd, 16.
Even in the cautious wake of Columbine, some signs of trouble were seen and apparently ignored at Heritage.
The day before the shootings, classmate Nathaniel Deeter heard the distraught youth speaking of his failed romance, saying he wanted to take his own life.
A week ago he spoke of bringing a gun to school.
``I told him it was stupid,'' said Deeter, who didn't think enough of the threat to tell school administrators.
Lately the troubled boy's grades and his relationship with his parents were suffering, and he had told several fellow students he carried a handgun.
Police say he rode on the school bus with the.22-caliber rifle stuffed in a book bag.
He had sawed off much of the wooden stock to make it fit.
Rockdale District Attorney Richard Read said one charge of aggravated assault was filed in Juvenile Court against the suspect.
He said he expected that multiple aggravated assault charges, possibly as many as 30, will be brought in Juvenile Court.
And he said he will move to transfer the charges to Superior Court, possibly next week, where the 15-year-old could be charged as an adult.
Outside the school, breathless students hugged one another for comfort.
A half dozen linked hands in a circle and bowed their heads in prayer.
Some at first thought the firecracker-like clamor was a prank, coming on the last day of senior class, when yearbooks and prom pictures were to be handed out.
The day before, 2,000 crickets were released in the hallways.
Deeter recalled chatting with his classmate 10 minutes before he started shooting.
``I heard you had broken up with your girlfriend,'' Deeter had said.
``Yeah, I'm real mad about it,'' came the reply.
The boy looked distant and removed as he spoke of the failed relationship, a romance of two years that had ended this week, Deeter said.
``He looked like he was thinking about something else,'' said Deeter, who moved away.
A few moments later came the gunfire.
``He shot the kid next to me in the foot,'' Deeter said of the boy, who was wearing jeans and a baggy, blue pullover.
He seemed to be firing quickly and randomly.
Deeter said he screamed at him: ``What are you doing''?!
``When he was shooting, it was as though he was looking right through people,'' Jason Cheek and Brian Barnhardt were shot in the buttocks.
Ryan Rosa, a junior, was shot in the right ankle.
Cania Collins was shot in the knee.
Drake Hoy thought the first shot was a firecracker.
The second sounded real enough, and the third shot sliced into his left foot.
``I started to run, but it started hurting pretty bad,'' said Hoy, 18.
``I took off my boot and blood was everywhere''.
Teachers and parents got him and the other injured students to the front lawn, from where they were rushed to the hospital.
When he finished shooting, the former Boy Scout, described by students as quietly rebellious, dropped his rifle and backed his way outside.
He pulled out a handgun and put it in his mouth.
Over the next 10 minutes, a few teachers repeatedly asked him to put down the gun and step away from it.
The youth didn't say a word, as if in a daze, and kept the gun in his mouth.
Then a teacher walked up to him and said, ``Let me have the gun''.
According to senior Joe Watts, who watched from a window, the teen handed the revolver to the teacher.
``(Assistant Principal Cecil) Brinkley put his arm around him,'' Watts said.
``The guy started crying and saying, 'Oh my God, I'm so scared'''.
That the shooting happened in suburban Atlanta, in a school known for parental involvement and good academics, has heightened fear in many parents, students and teachers.
``Schools are no longer immune to guns, drugs and violence,'' said Pam Riley, executive director of the Center for the Prevention of School Violence in North Carolina.
``But I don't think that all schools should panic and close.
Then the terrorism will win out.
What we need to do is provide ways for kids to do the right thing''.
The shooting shattered what should have been a gorgeous last day of school for Heritage seniors.
Some had thought of taking the day off.
It was a sun-drenched morning filled with the promise of summer.
Graduation awaits next Friday.
Several students said they had finally shaken off the anxiety that followed the killing of 15 people at Columbine High School in Colorado, a school similar in many ways to Heritage.
Both schools serve predominantly white, suburban, middle-class neighborhoods.
Heritage High School was named one of the top 10 schools in the metro Atlanta area by U.S.
News and World Report.
About 80 percent of Heritage graduates go on to college.
The school has video surveillance cameras in the hallways and an armed sheriff's deputy on duty.
After the carnage at Columbine, Heritage was among many metro Atlanta school who felt the reverberations.
Letters were sent out to parents assuring them the school was safe.
But, like many schools, Heritage has endured bomb threats in recent weeks.
Though school will be closed at least today, many students said they would be frightened to enter those doors again.
``I kind of thought it could happen here.
It could happen anywhere,'' said Shayna McClelland.
``I don't feel safe here anymore''.
``No, I'm not'' going back to Heritage, said Julie Kull.
``I'm home-schooling or something.
I'm not going back there''.
She added, ``I just want to know why''.
With television crews broadcasting the frightened faces of Heritage students, a collective angst swept through many schools and homes.
Principals across metro Atlanta scrambled to figure out what to do next and how to prevent a similar occurrence.
Some parents, already in a heightened state of concern since Columbine, suggested simply canceling the rest of the school year, bringing down the curtain on a year brimming with fear.
Others called for metal detectors and more police in the schools, outcries that have been echoed for weeks following Columbine and the spate of bomb threats.
School safety has been catapulted to the top of the social agenda.
After Thursday's shootings, Cobb County school officials are considering asking for additional police support in the schools.
Security was doubled at McCleskey Middle School in Cobb, with a sheriff's deputy joining the campus officer.
At Cobb's Walton High, side entrances to the school were sealed off and visitors were not allowed on campus Thursday morning.
Charles Warr, principal at Sandy Creek High School in north Fayette County, plans to address the student body today.
He said he will urge students to help keep the school safe by breaking their code of silence.
``I'm going to tell them there's a difference between childish tattling and passing on critical information that someone is considering something serious such as suicide or murder,'' Warr said.
For now, the horror and fear and desire to stop such incidents has brought people together.
That process began right at the time of the shootings, as students such as Greg Bluemling assisted a girl who had been shot.
He and other students helped her into a room, where they applied pressure to stop the bleeding.
A teacher came in with a first aid kit and they used gauze to stanch the bleeding.
Thursday evening, people gathered to pray at the Church in the Now's youth ministry, where they prayed for the students and the community.
``I am definitely seeing the glass half full, and I'm so relieved we are not planning a funeral,'' said Bishop Jim Earl Swilley.
Gov. Roy Barnes planned to meet today with the families of students injured in the shooting.
``It's frustrating not to have an easy solution,'' Barnes said.
``I want to give the people a solution, but this will take more than just me.
This is not the time to have a knee-jerk reaction, but to ponder the long-term solutions that will work''.
Thursday's crime claimed more than just six victims.
``It was real heartbreaking, it really was _ even for the ones who didn't know who got shot,'' said Amber Barnhart, standing outside Rockdale Hospital on Thursday afternoon.
Her brother Brian was among the wounded.
Some people say they've had more of these threats and problems than they can take.
``It's springtime, when there are pranks and high spirits anyway, and unfortunately we have this horrible tragedy at Columbine hanging over us.
And we have students who are perhaps unstable themselves,'' said Tim Callahan, spokesman for the Professional Association of Georgia Educators.
``This school year cannot end soon enough,'' he added.

MELROSE, Mass.
_ Unless local school parent councils vote otherwise, every public school student in the state next year could be wearing clothes to school most wouldn't be caught dead in once they get home.
Dressed in a calf-length red velveteen coat over a black Amityville T-shirt, calf-high boots and with a casket-shaped purse slung over her shoulder, Melrose High school senior Erica Muxie was horrified at the thought of uniformity being imposed upon her.
``It's a public school, you should be able to express yourself,'' said the spiked-collar sporting Muxie, who plans to study forensic science in college.
But Governor Paul Cellucci _ and dozens of school officials and politicians across the country _ argue the opposite: if too much attention is spent on looking sharp in school, learning suffers.
Cellucci proposed legislation Thursday that would require all schools to have uniforms unless their local parent councils opted out.
This would effectively force each school to at least debate the uniform issue.
That debate has already been resolved in New York, where the city's 550,000 elementary school students will be required to wear uniforms this fall, following a school uniform revival that began in Long Beach, Calif.
in 1994.
About 10 states have some type of school uniform regulation, in addition to scores of individual cities.
In Massachusetts, several cities, including Lawrence and Springfield, have uniform policies, although they vary greatly.
Lawrence and Springfield require students to wear them, while Boston allows its schools to choose.
``With our proposal, Massachusetts will join a nationwide trend that has seen parents, teachers, principals and school committees work together to promote an atmosphere of safety and seriousness in their classrooms by regulating what students wear to school each day,'' Cellucci said.
The school uniform issue is far from new in Massachusetts, but still ignites enormous passion, no matter what the age of a student, teacher or parent.
It was an issue in the 1993 mayoral race in Boston, and in the 1996 presidential campaign.
In 1997, Gov.
William Weld filed legislation allowing schools to require uniforms if they chose, but it died.
The parent councils Cellucci mentioned also include school principals, teachers, and, in some cases, community leaders and students.
Since Lawrence began requiring in 1994 that students wear navy blue pants or skirt and white shirt every day, ``I've seen immense changes,'' said Denise McCarthy, principal of the Wetherbee Saunders Elementary School.
``The children felt better about themselves.
It gave them a sense of belonging to both the school district and the school''.
Some parents say the uniform both prevents violence over clothes, and sets a tone of the classroom as a serious place for learning.
``Kids fight over clothes, they steal clothes,'' said Carl Askins a Jamaica Plain parent of two children in Boston public schools, who sits on the city's Parent Council.
He said he would want more information before deciding on a mandatory policy, but that the cost of being fashionable in public schools is an undue burden on many parents.
Kids, while largely negative on uniform policies, do admit they can work.
Dressed in a crisp white shirt and tie at the East Boston Edwards School, where Cellucci made his announcement, Chris Hunt, 13, said ``everyone hates'' his school's uniform of khaki or blue khaki pants and white or navy blue sweatshirt.
But now, Hunt said, ``you can't judge other kids by their clothes''.
Melrose High senior Muxie on the other hand said that if forced to wear a uniform, ``I wouldn't feel like myself anymore.
So I would be less inclined to try to do well in school''.
Before the 1960s, uniforms in public schools were commonplace, then largely abandoned in that free-spirited decade.
It was as school violence and classroom disruptions increased across the country in the '80s and early 1990s that uniforms caught on again.
After Long Beach instituted its policy, it reported a reduction in school crime and an increase in attendance.
Chicago school officials attribute a drop in gang violence to school uniform policies in many of their schools.
What courts may still have to decide in Massachusetts is whether schools have the right to make uniforms mandatory.
In Lawrence and Boston, if parents protest the uniforms, their children can usually wear what they want.
``If it is voluntary it is fine.
When it becomes mandatory, it becomes more problematic,'' said John Roberts, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts.
He said buying uniforms might provide a financial hardship for parents and the argument that uniforms can save parents' money isn't true.
``They just go home and get out of them and put something else on,'' Roberts said.

*Associated Press Write PORT HURON, Mich.
(AP) -- City schools closed last week after the arrest of four students who allegedly planned a massacre similar to Colorado's Columbine High School slayings will reopen Monday.
Police will be posted inside Holland Woods Middle School.
A bomb was found near the school campus Thursday after school officials and parents gathered to discuss the alleged plot by the four students at the school.
Police have said the bomb is unrelated to the alleged plot.
All of the district's 21 schools were closed Friday, then searched over the weekend and found to be safe, superintendent Bill Kimball said Sunday.
Security will also be tightened district-wide on Monday, and teachers will discuss school safety with students.
``We're taking every measure possible to be sure our kids are safe,'' Kimball said.
Some parents were uncomfortable with the decision to reopen the schools in this city about 60 miles northeast of Detroit.
``I think that they should just end the school year and have that extra three weeks to figure out what they're going to do to safeguard our kids for next year,'' said Heidy Martindale, the mother of a 12-year-old girl at Holland Woods.
She said parents were told at a meeting Thursday night that Holland Woods was safe.
Within hours, a custodian found the bomb.
Whitney Fontenot, 12, a sixth grader at Holland Woods, cried when she heard that school would be reopened.
``I feel uncomfortable going to that school,'' Whitney said.
Four Holland Woods students ages 12 to 14 remain jailed after being charged on Thursday with conspiracy to commit murder at the 560-student school.
The two 14-year-olds, Justin Schnepp and Jedaiah Zinzo, have been charged as adults and are being held on $100,000 bond each.
The younger students are to appear Tuesday in St.
Clair County Juvenile Court.
All were arrested last week after a 14-year-old girl told police she overheard some of them talking about an elaborate school killing spree.
The girl told police the boys said their plan was to go on a shooting spree in a gym assembly and detonate a bomb afterward, acts aimed at killing the school's ``preps,'' the popular clique of students.
Again Sunday, police and school district officials declined to comment on evidence in the case.
Officials have said the teens planned to top the death toll of the April 20 massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
, where teenage gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 before committing suicide.
HOUSTON _ To prevent school violence, suburban and rural school districts should consider some measures used by their urban counterparts, experts and educators say.
None of the school shootings since 1997 have happened in urban schools.
Experts say that's probably because they stress such prevention measures as metal detectors, increased security, school uniforms, parental involvement, alternative schools and conflict-resolution programs.
``In the case of suburban school districts, they haven't had to think about this,'' said Joanne McDaniel, research director for the Center for the Prevention of School Violence in Raleigh, N.C.
And it doesn't help, she said, when school districts that haven't had to deal with serious violence ignore the multifaceted problems that lead to incidents such as the murders of 15 students Tuesday attack in Littleton, Col.
Many schools aren't taking day-to-day security measures, such as requiring students to wear school uniforms.
``More than 70 percent of our schools require uniforms, which make it hard to hide a weapon and prevent the wearing of gang-related clothing,'' said Terry Abbott, Houston Independent School District spokesman.
Whether real or perceived, violence in the nation's schools has been an issue of concern, research and debate for more than two decades.
When school shootings such as the ones that occurred in Colorado, Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas and Oregon happen, some districts look, listen and search for ways not to become the next Littleton.
In the Fort Bend Independent School District southwest of Houston, administrators such as Mary Ann Simpson, the associate superintendent for community relations, are watching the TV coverage from Colorado.
``Short of turning our schools into prisons, there is no 100 percent guarantee that you can eliminate this kind of thing,'' she said.
``But you can certainly look for ways to strengthen and improve what you have in place...
and listen to our kids, talk to our kids, especially those that seem isolated''.
Fort Bend doesn't have metal detectors in its schools but does have district police officers at middle and high school campuses, video surveillance cameras in some schools and a student crime-stopper number to report incidents to administrators.
Tonya Aultman-Bettridge, a researcher with the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence in Boulder, Colo.
, isn't sure the school shootings in Littleton could have been prevented with better or more security measures.
She believes school climate is more of a deterrent than metal detectors.
``I don't think installing metal detectors and having armed police officers roaming the halls is the solution,'' she said.
``We concentrate a lot on teaching kids math and science, and we don't integrate things like violence prevention into the curriculum''.
She suggested that districts foster an environment where violent behavior is unacceptable; teach students social skills such as anger management and empathy; and create a crisis plan and build partnerships between schools, law enforcement, social services, parents and the community.
``Schools don't exist by themselves,'' Aultman-Bettridge said.
McDaniel noted that the majority of the nation's schools continue to be safe places free of violent incidents.
``We are still talking small numbers,'' she said.
``But we are talking serious rage, and we need to get to know our young people so that when they are feeling rage we can act to help, not just react''.
XXXXXXX END OF STORY
ATLANTA _ At rural schoolhouses and sprawling urban campuses across the country, millions of students returning to class in the next few weeks will encounter a steely array of new security measures.
In many schools, lockers are being removed, cameras are being installed as hallway monitors, and students will have to swipe a computerized ID card just to get in the door.
Even as new statistics show that school violence is actually on the decline, the lurid images from armed assaults by students this year have prompted most school districts to take some kind of forceful action to instill a sense of greater security.
That inclination can only be strengthened by the shooting at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
Many districts are forging close new relationships with local police departments, and carefully regulating who can be on school grounds.
In dozens of locales as disparate as Pittsburgh and Palm Beach County, Fla.
, SWAT teams have spent the summer learning the layouts of high schools and conducting drills involving mock hostage-taking.
And in towns as small as Allen, Texas, many students returning to school will find metal detectors and armed security guards at the door, while others will have to trade their battered canvas backpacks for see-through bags designed to make it harder to conceal a weapon.
Some districts, by contrast, have rejected the idea of detection systems, finding them an affront to educational openness, and are concentrating instead on a drumbeat of programs to make students feel more responsible for their school's safety and less reluctant to report violations.
The new policies vary widely, but virtually all are a direct reaction to the shootings this spring at high schools in Littleton, Colo.
, and here in Georgia, in the Atlanta suburb of Conyers.
Many administrators who say they have never received a threat of bombing or gunfire have nonetheless felt obliged to reassure parents and students that steps have been taken to reduce the chances that their school is the next to be encircled by news helicopters.
``Everyone feels the need to do something, even though no one agrees on what that should be,'' said Joe Schneider, deputy executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, which represents superintendents.
``You can't just tell parents that you're doing more of the same''.
There are indications, however, that security measures and counseling programs gradually undertaken before the shootings this spring have proved increasingly effective.
In a report issued this week, the U.S.
Department of Education, having compiled statistics from each of the states, found that gun-related expulsions in the last school year dropped by nearly a third from the previous year.
Another study, issued last week by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, determined that violence committed by teen-agers had declined during the 1990s, along with the number of weapons carried to school.
But administrators know that such studies are of little comfort to parents who have learned that violence can erupt anywhere, at any moment.
Indeed, taken as a whole the new policies seem intended as much to instill peace of mind as to actually keep a student from opening fire on his school, prevention of which many officials say is probably impossible in any case.
A doorway metal detector, for example, can do little to forestall a blaze of gunfire in the schoolyard.
``It's not that districts are taking these steps solely to reassure people, but there's often as much reassurance built into them as actual effectiveness,'' said Dennis Lewis, director of school public safety in Springfield, Mo.
, and vice president of the National Association of School Safety and Law Enforcement Officers.
``Parents will call up and ask if a school has metal detectors.
All of us know that no metal detector is going to stop someone who wants to shoot in a school.
But a parent wants to hear that they're there''.
Many districts conducted highly publicized drills over the summer in which police SWAT teams entered schools to put down mock shootings.
Last month in Palm Beach County, Fla.
, for example, drama students with fake wounds pretended to be casualties as officers stormed a school and ``arrested'' police academy recruits who were pretending to take hostages and plant bombs, all under the gaze of television cameras.
A similar drill at a Pittsburgh high school on Wednesday, complete with helicopters and ersatz pipe bombs, was so realistic that some summer students believed that police were responding to an actual attack.
The exercises provided useful training to police in the unfamiliar territory of a school building, while also sending a message of control to parents and teachers.
Schneider, of the superintendents' group, said the shaping of a new relationship with the local police department was probably the most common step adopted by the nation's school districts.
After it became known that the Littleton Police Department had been unfamiliar with the layout of Columbine High School, where 12 students and a teacher were killed by two young gunmen on April 20, many districts began distributing floor plans and computerized blueprints of their schools to their police departments, which in turn began touring the schools over the summer.
The most aggressive districts are erecting virtual walls around their schools, as if trying to keep the outside world at bay.
In Allen, Texas, a suburb of Dallas that cut back its class schedule last spring after a series of bomb threats, officials are spending $1 million to bring in metal detectors, surveillance cameras and a new security force, and are requiring students to wear identification badges.
In Deltona, Fla.
, near Orlando, lockers have been removed and book bags banned; students will get a duplicate set of books to keep at home.
Many schools are installing caller ID on their telephones so they can trace bomb threats.
nn In Owensboro, Ky.
, all but the front doors of public schools have been permanently locked, and visitors and latecomers must be buzzed in with a new security system that alerts the office whenever anyone approaches the door.
Video cameras are being installed on school buses in Clayton County, Ga.
, southeast of Atlanta.
Columbine High School itself will install emergency alarms throughout the building, and will be employing dogs to search for weapons and explosives.
Proponents of such measures consider them effective deterrents, a tangible reflection of a school's insistence on safety.
John Coleman, director of safety and security for the public schools of Kansas City, Mo.
, said his district had not had a single shooting or knifing since it installed metal detectors in middle and high schools seven years ago.
Similar results are reported in Dallas.
But support for the fortress approach to security is hardly universal.
Methods of security tend to vary as broadly as parenting techniques, reflecting a lack of consensus on the best ways to reduce violence.
Most of the districts in the Los Angeles-Orange County area, for example, have chosen not to spend money on new electronic security systems or guards, relying instead on the random checks with hand-held metal detectors that they have used for several years.
Dan Isaacs, assistant superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, said the city's schools were far too large to check every student entering the building without cutting into class time.
But as a result of the Columbine shooting, he said, the district will be putting up thousands of signs around its 670 schools that read: ``Making threats is no joke.
All threats will be taken seriously and will subject anyone making them to any and all applicable criminal and civil penalties, as well as school discipline, including expulsion''.
Many administrators believe that increased physical security is futile and counterproductive, noting that Columbine High had security guards and that Heritage High, the school in Conyers where a 15-year-old gunman wounded six other students on May 20, had surveillance cameras.
Instead, these administrators have begun conducting intensive seminars to train students and teachers to recognize and defuse threats before they lead to violence.
``We don't want to create an image of a police state, and we don't want dogs sniffing around,'' said Dr.
Francis Connor, superintendent of the Dighton-Rehoboth regional schools, a small district in southeastern Massachusetts.
``By addressing the physical changes, you are only dealing with the symptom of the problem''.
Walled-in students, Connor said, tend to begin feeling isolated and outside the mainstream.
Connor's district has prepared a guide to alert teachers to the symptoms of students prone to violence.
And many districts will hold meetings with all students to impress on them a new seriousness about security, and encourage them to report even jocular-sounding threats made by other students.
(Several students at Heritage High School have said they knew that the teen-age gunman there had talked of emulating the youths who opened fire at Columbine High a month earlier).
``Almost every time a kid brings a weapon to school, he winds up showing it to someone else,'' said Jim Kelly, the chief of the school police in Palm Beach, where a pipe bomb was discovered at a senior prom in May.
``We're trying to help the kids understand that if they see that, they're doing their friend a favor by reporting it, maybe saving them from some prison time.
We've got anonymous hot lines set up, and we want them to feel like they're a part of what we're doing''.
In Shrewsbury, a suburb of Worcester, Mass.
, school officials are working with architects to design a new high school, scheduled to open in three years, which will have fewer entrances than the current building and a community liaison office where students and members of the staff can meet with counselors and police officers to talk about school security issues.
The new building will not, however, be equipped with any metal detectors.
Daniel Gutekanst, the principal of Shrewsbury High School, said anyone could evade a metal detector, but not necessarily a system of adults and students working together to spot threats.
``It sounds a little corny,'' he said, ``but the issue is not getting metal detectors, it's making sure you have mental detectors.''
At graduation Friday night (May 21) at Hobbton High School in rural North Carolina, Principal Stewart Hobbs will wear a bulletproof vest.
He will be guarded by a sheriff's deputy, and an expert marksman will be posted on the water tower that overlooks the football field where the seniors will receive their diplomas.
Everyone at the ceremony will have to pass through a metal detector, and the crowd will be peppered with plainclothes officers on the lookout for a potential killer.
``I doubt anything will happen, but right now, the way things are, you just can't take any chances,'' Hobbs said in an interview Thursday.
Hobbs's precautions _ taken in response to a death threat telephoned to the local sheriff's department on Monday _ seem a fitting punctuation mark to a school year that can't end soon enough for students, teachers, administrators and parents.
In the month since the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
, a sense of foreboding has enveloped schools across the country.
There are nagging fears and whispered worries that the angry kid, or the outcast kid, or the quiet kid, or the heartbroken kid, or the kid no one would ever expect, might suddenly erupt in violence.
Just such an event happened Thursday in Conyers, Ga.
, 25 miles east of Atlanta, where a 15-year-old sophomore who reportedly had recently broken up with his girlfriend shot six fellow students then surrendered his gun and cried.
None of the injuries appeared life-threatening.
Coming on the one-month anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings that ended 15 lives, the incident reinforced the growing _ some would say exaggerated _ perception that schools must now be considered danger zones.
Before Thursday's shootings, those fears had been fueled primarily by a rash of bomb threats that emptied schools and attracted widespread media attention, which by some accounts created a cycle of even more copycat threats.
Before Columbine _ where the two killers came armed with more than 50 explosives _ school bomb threats were usually ignored by the media in the belief that publicizing such events only encourages more.
There is no way to tell whether such threats have increased since the April 20 massacre, or whether the public is simply learning how frequently they occur.
But authorities on school violence said Thursday that the perception of greater risk seems to reflect a troubling reality.
``One of the things we're all wrestling with is the question of where did all these crazies come from at one time?
There's a feeling among some people that they were always out there, and were just waiting for a psychological release like Columbine so they could carry out their plans,'' said Peter Blauvelt, president of the National Alliance for Safe Schools in College Park, Md.
``Schools are going to need to spend this summer trying to develop strategies to take a hard look at their populations, because they clearly need additional help,'' Blauvelt added.
In one case, authorities say, they have no doubt the Colorado shootings unleashed a murderous plan.
The incident involved four boys arrested last week in Port Huron, Mich.
, for allegedly plotting to kill dozens of their schoolmates.
Afterward, a prosecutor said the investigation showed the youths' goal was ``to kill more people than in Columbine''.
At a court hearing, the local school board president, David Devendorf, pleaded for two of the suspects, both 13, to be kept in custody.
``You can't believe the fear out there,'' he said.
The reverberations from Columbine also have been felt in Allen, Texas, where school administrators in the Dallas suburb went so far as to cancel the last two weeks of classes after a dozen bomb threats in a single week.
Criticized by some parents for capitulating to terror, school officials rescinded the closure and decided to hold some classes.
Still, some parents were steaming.
``They got overly alarmed and sent a message to kids that they couldn't control what happens in school,'' said Al Burke, whose twin daughters Jackie and Jessica are seniors at Allen High School.
``Sometimes, the overreaction can do as much damage as the threat itself,'' said Burke, who runs a sports ticket agency.
``I don't think we should be sending our kids to school in the morning and telling them to watch out for the bomb that might get dropped on their heads''.
No part of the country has remained untouched.
In Lake County, Fla.
, the school board said a dog trained to sniff out guns and bombs would roam school hallways next year.
A bomb threat in Phoenix kept 1,700 students home on a test day; a student who allegedly bragged about the feat was suspended.
Maryland schools were paralyzed by a rumor that May 10 would be a day of violence.
And in the nation's capital, all but one of the city's 17 high schools were evacuated on April 26 because of a bomb threat.
Massachusetts schools also have been beset by numerous bomb and massacre threats.
In Cohasset, for instance, someone scrawled ``May 6 you will die'' on a boys' bathroom wall; nothing happened, but a quarter of the middle and high school students stayed home that day.
Boston schools responded by establishing an anonymous tip line for students to report fears of impending violence.
Several authorities on school violence said aggressive responses by school officials should be expected and even encouraged in the wake of Columbine.
They said the Colorado killings ratcheted up fears because of the amount of firepower and planning that went into the attack.
``With Littleton, with the mass destruction involved and the knowledge that such materials are available to students, the stakes were raised,'' said June Arnette, associate director of the National School Safety Center in Westlake Village, Calif.
``We had felt like schools in the suburbs were insulated, and the message now is that it can and does happen where we least expect it,'' she added.
Despite the fears, authorities hasten to note that schools are extremely safe.
Historically, fewer than 1 percent of homicides involving school-age children have occurred in or around schools, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
Since 1992, the annual death toll from school shootings has ranged from 20 to 55, according to the National School Safety Center, including suicides.
There have been 24 school shooting deaths so far this year, including the 15 in Columbine.
Joanne McDaniel, research director at the Center for the Prevention of School Violence in Raleigh, N.C., said the overall knowledge that schools are safe might have led to a sense of complacency before Columbine, despite past school shootings.
``We've become good at identifying warning signs, but I think in some cases we're still too slow to respond.
That's a sign of complacency,'' she said.
However, McDaniel added, the response to Columbine makes it unlikely schools will take danger signals lightly anytime soon.
Patty Yoxall, spokeswoman for the National PTA, said her organization intends to use that attention to focus resources and energy on the problem before the 1999-2000 school year.
``We're hoping to keep this issue at the forefront of concern for all of American society.
Until we are really willing to address the problems of school violence as a society, we're not going to be able to effect lasting change,'' Yoxall said.
As for Hobbs, the North Carolina principal targetted by an anonymous death threat, he said the precautions he takes will not end when the last diploma is handed out.
A new policy at his school calls for all doors to be locked except for the main entrance; all bathrooms have been closed off except for one; more lights have been installed outside the school; and a wooded area behind the school is being cleared, to prevent potential attacks from being lauched from the dense cover.
``I feel like every day I walk into this school I put my life on the line, and sometimes I sit there and wonder why I do that,'' Hobbs said.
``But it's the good days and it's these kids who come back down the road and thank you, and that's when you know why you keep doing it''.
As he spoke, a group of about 20 high-spirited seniors crowded around him, begging for extra tickets to the graduation.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like many other schools preparing for this week's anniversary of the Columbine High School shootings, Rich East High School in Park Forest, Ill.
, will have extra police officers on hand.
But Cmdr.
Patrick Fitzgerald, a city police officer who coordinates school safety, said he's heard more from reporters writing about Thursday's anniversary than from parents and students who fear it may precipitate copycat violence.
''Things have been very quiet out here,'' he said.
''When we take attendance on Thursday, we'll find out''.
On April 20, 1999, two students at Columbine High in Littleton, Colo.
, fatally shot 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves.
This year, education officials nationwide are taking steps to prevent their schools from suffering the same fate.
They've suspended students caught making threats, hired more officers and volunteers for the day, canceled classes or major school events and held meetings with parents and community members.
''The date has them worried about a lot of copycats or kids who may try to send a very, very strong message,'' said Curt Lavarello, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers, a group of K-12 school officers that has nearly doubled to 5,500 members in the last year.
''Let's face it, it's been absolutely clear in the tragedies we see on school campuses that these incidents can occur at any time, at any school''.
On Thursday, Colorado Gov.
Bill Owens will lead thousands in a moment of silence at 11:21 a.m., the time the attack began.
But the school itself is on alert, with 24-hour police patrols and special badges for anyone wanting to get in.
''Schools are under pressure to be prepared,'' said June Arnett, associate director of the Westlake, Calif.-based National School Safety Center.
The safety center, which advises school security officers, says its statistics show that youngsters are 99 times more likely to be shot and killed on the street or at home than in school.
And this school year's 11 homicides and suicides -- even with the Feb.
29 shooting of Michigan first-grader by a classmate -- is well below last year's tally of 26.
But multiple-victim shootings -- such as Littleton, Jonesboro, Ark.
, and Springfield, Ore.
-- have nonetheless left schools recently guarding against or preparing for a major school-wide crisis.
For example: --Four Anchorage, Alaska, students were suspended Friday after allegedly threatening to use guns and bombs at Wendler Middle School.
--In Rush City, Minn.
, high school officials suspended four students Thursday after saying the teen-agers threatened to take over their school and shoot it up on the Columbine anniversary.
--In Jay, Okla.
, where threats of gun violence prompted parents to pull their children out of classes Friday, police are expected to return to school halls this week, which also marks the fifth anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing.
But some officials fear they may be overreacting to perceived threats.
The year since the shooting has left schools open to critics who contend they prefer SWAT teams to mental health counselors.
Nearly two dozen schools have tested Mosaic-2000, an FBI computer profiling program that rates potentially violent students on a scale of 1 to 10.
And hundreds of officers trained at R.U.
Ready High, a school-shooting simulation at the Blackwater Training Center in Moyock, N.C.
These preparations are just as important as fire drills in keeping children out of harm's way, said Kenneth S.
Trump, owner of National School Safety and Security Services, a Cleveland-based school security consulting firm.
''You need some basic security measures in schools,'' he said.

JONESBORO, Ark.
(AP) -- A year after two heavily armed boys pulled a fire alarm and shot students filing out of Westside Middle School, killing four girls and a teacher, the superintendent talks about keeping a ``cloak of safety'' around his 75-acre campus.
Shrubs are cut back and a wooden fence now sets off the campus.
A uniformed officer teaches Arkansas criminal law and acts as student confidante.
School counselors are on duty every day.
The district is functioning normally, says Superintendent Dick Young, though it doesn't use alarms for fire drills anymore.
He won't allow visitors in the hallways, saying children may be reminded what happened March 24, 1998.
``We're in that gulf between wanting to remember and wanting to forget,'' Young says.
Students Natalie Brooks, Paige Ann Herring, Stephanie Johnson and Britthney Varner and teacher Shannon Wright were cut down in the brief outburst of gunfire.
A memorial garden is being built at the spot where they fell.
The shootings in Jonesboro and at schools in Pearl, Miss.
West Paducah, Ky.
Edinboro, Pa.
Fayetteville, Tenn.
Springfield, Ore.
and Richmond, Va.
, alarmed the nation last year.
President Clinton called the outbreak ``a terrible tragedy'' and noted ``the awful specter of students being killed by other young people at schools''.
Ronald Stephens of the California-based National School Safety Center told a House subcommittee after the Jonesboro shootings: ``It should not require an act of courage for parents to send their children to school''.
On Wednesday, the first anniversary of the Jonesboro shootings, Rep.
Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y.
, plans to introduce for a second time the Children's Gun Violence Prevention Act.
The legislation never came to a vote last year.
McCarthy says the bill would help prosecute people who sell guns to children, require gun owners to keep guns away from children and finance violence awareness programs in schools.
In the Senate, Richard Durbin, D-Ill.
, and John Chafee, R-R.I.
, will make another run at the Child Access Prevention bill.
The bill holds adults liable when children use improperly stored firearms to kill or injure others.
Stephens says some 20 states have laws calling for school safety plans and many have set up hot lines for anonymous tips on disturbing behavior by students, tightened access to campuses and improved screening for school visitors.
``In my view, the schools are safer than they were a year ago because we've had a heightened need to be vigilant,'' he says.
Suzann Wilson, who lost her 11-year-old daughter, Britthney, knows of the changes at Westside but says more should be done to make students feel safe.
Class sizes should be smaller, students should be taught how to deal with their anger and schools should have more counselors.
Wilson says her 14-year-old daughter, Brandi, is still afraid to go to school.
And for Wilson's part, ``there's not a day goes by that I don't think that she's going back to where her sister got killed,'' she says.
In Mississippi, where Pearl High School student Luke Woodham was convicted of killing two classmates and wounding seven others after first killing his mother Oct.
1, 1997, the Legislature passed a law broadening the death penalty to include killings on school campuses.
In Kentucky, student Michael Carneal received a life sentence after pleading guilty but mentally ill in the shooting deaths of three students at Heath High School near Paducah on Dec.
1, 1997.
McCracken County School District, home to Heath High, now posts armed security guards, requires student identification tags and searches for weapons in its schools.
In Lexington, Ashland and other places, anonymous tip lines were set up to report guns or drugs brought to schools.
In Virginia, where 14-year-old Quinshawn Booker wounded a teacher and a 74-year-old school volunteer last June 15, Gov.
Jim Gilmore has released $1.5 million to put some 45 additional police officers in schools.
Richmond schools ordered teachers to step up hallway patrols, and some school districts installed surveillance cameras.
Booker pleaded guilty to five counts and was required to complete a program at a school for troubled youths, then be on probation until age 21.
Wilson has forcefully lobbied the Arkansas Legislature to hold gun owners liable if they leave unlocked guns where children can get them.
She also wants to prohibit juveniles from owning guns after their release from detention centers.
A heated exchange with gun advocates on the state Capitol steps Feb.
1 brought Wilson to tears.
But the confrontation did not diminish her resolve.
``It keeps me directed,'' Wilson says.
``It's something to focus on.
If I didn't have this, then I would have to stop and think about what I lost''.
While Arkansas legislators debated her proposals and other measures, Andrew Golden, 12, and Mitchell Johnson, 14, remained in custody at a juvenile prison 20 minutes away.
The boys, 11 and 13 at the time of the shootings, were found delinquent in the five killings and the wounding of 10 others.
They are due to be released at age 18.
``We really have not had any major problems with either boy.
They have not been difficult juveniles for us,'' says Joe Quinn, spokesman for the Human Services Department, which oversees juvenile corrections.
Jonesboro is marking the sad anniversary with two gatherings at 12:40 p.m., the time of the shootings-- one at the school, the second at the courthouse.
Wilson says Brandi will sing at the courthouse, and afterward the family will visit the cemetery where Britthney is buried.
CONYERS, Ga.
(AP) -- Jim Borland came home from a business trip last month to find his 18-year-old son, Graham, gripped by news of carnage at a high school in Littleton, Colo.
``You know, this could happen in our school system,'' the teen-ager recalls warning his dad.
``We need to take more precautions''.
Jim Borland agreed.
As a school board member for Rockdale County, he was in a good position to respond.
Safety measures already were in place, and administrators quickly reinforced them.
But that couldn't stop a 15-year-old from opening fire Thursday, wounding six students and adding Heritage High School to the list of campus bloodbaths that have shocked and frustrated the nation.
The shooting in Rockdale County, a semirural setting of 68,000 mostly white, comfortable and churchgoing inhabitants, 25 miles east of Atlanta, suggests that even an elaborate safety system may not be enough.
Under measures adopted a few years ago, Rockdale schools already employed armed police during school hours, according to schools spokeswoman Susan Paul Smith.
Video cameras already watched kids on school buses and in the schools.
Trained dogs periodically came to sniff for drugs.
Earlier this year, when Thomas Solomon Jr.
, the youth now charged in the shooting, reportedly brought a gun to school, the allegations were followed up and recorded, though they could never be substantiated, authorities said.
After two teen-agers at Columbine High killed a teacher, 12 students and themselves, security measures in Rockdale, where Conyers is the county seat, were reviewed.
Teachers got a list of steps to take, like keeping rooms secure in an emergency, and taking the attendance roll.
Superintendent Don Peccia sent parents a letter promising investigations and a police response to any ``rumors, threats or allegations''.
``Strict disciplinary consequences will be assigned to any student and to anyone else exhibiting such behavior,'' Peccia wrote.
Children were encouraged to help.
``The kids were told, `Anything that doesn't seem right, speak up,''' said Mary Kommeth, an English teacher at Salem, one of three Rockdale high schools.
Graham Borland, the school board member's son, said that one schoolmate who had often boasted about ``blowing up graduation'' was followed constantly by staff members, and never allowed to be alone.
Borland's father, a leasing company executive, heads a committee to review safety in the school district, which serves more than 13,000 children including preschoolers.
The panel includes about 35 parents, business people, members of law enforcement, and even an FBI agent.
The bloodshed at Heritage High School could have been worse.
The shooter used a rifle that was missing its stock and shot from the hip, said Rockdale County Sheriff Jeff Wigington.
That may explain why the gun was aimed downward, lessening the carnage.
``We also used the word 'blessed' many times,'' Borland said after a school board meeting Thursday, the day of the shooting.
``I think we were very thankful to God.
I think he was looking out for us''.
Among parents gathering for the meeting, which had been scheduled before the shooting took place, there was a hint of resignation.
``I don't think that you could prevent it 100 percent,'' said Paul Lee, a Conyers father of two teen-agers.
``They have terrorists all over the world.
In the Capitol, that guy broke in and killed two guards,'' he said, referring to last July's killings in Washington.
``It could happen anywhere''.
Borland and others say they had striven until now to strike a balance between adequate security and not turning the schools into fortresses.
Now school officials are talking about mandating clear book bags, or no bookbags, a dress code, even metal detectors -- ideas that until now had been soundly rejected.
Borland's group will be reviewing the schools' inch-thick crisis management book.
One situation the book doesn't deal with, Borland said, is what to do when a student has a gun.
That could change too.
DECATUR, Ga.
_ If you walk into the middle of Shamrock Middle School wearing a blindfold, then take it off to study the signs on the corridor walls, you might think you're in the heart of scholastic darkness.
The signs warn students to stay in line _ or else.
They spell out rules: ``Three bullying threats: expulsion''.
They warn against distributing drugs: ``Violators will be imprisoned''.
They list the ``parole proof crimes: murder, rape, aggravated sodomy,'' for 12- through 14-year-old students to ponder on their way to class.
How many of their parents thought they'd see the words ``rape'' and ``sodomy'' on middle school walls?
Shamrock is not a seedy, dangerous school _ far from it.
If you turn from the signs to walk through the orderly classrooms, filled with neatly dressed students, or stroll around the surrounding Decatur neighborhood of pleasant ranch houses, the signs seem even more striking.
They are one glaring part of the fight to prevent heinous school crimes like last spring's Columbine massacre in Littleton, Colo.
Just last week, a 12-year-old pulled a loaded.380 handgun on another student in the crowded cafeteria of a Fulton County middle school.
Many schools have resorted to scare signs or metal detectors or surveillance cameras.
``This is the way it is today,'' Shamrock Principal Tom Davis says with regret, by way of explaining the scare-'em-straight signs on his walls.
``It's nothing like when I was a kid in school''.
Yet these measures, while easy to understand and media-genic, may not offer the only _ or the best _ hope at preventing violence at school.
Shamrock and other schools, in addition to employing the ``hardware approach,'' also have launched a new strategy to make schools both safer and happier in the long run: what might be called the human approach.
This tack relies on less visible, but perhaps more effective measures, such as developing mentor programs, broadening anti-bullying policies, bolstering the ranks of school psychologists and giving ``resource officers'' _ school police _ the interpersonal skills of guidance counselors.
``We can't search every knapsack in every car, wondering if there might be a shooting in the parking lot before school,'' says Bill Modzelski of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program of the U.S.
Department of Education.
``So we have to depend on prevention _ getting to the roots of the problem.
And that means awareness of the kids' family structure, drug and alcohol problems, making sure someone takes responsibility to know if a child is happy or sad.
Schools are so big now, kids pass through and nobody knows they're there''.
HUMAN VS.
HARDWARE Metal detectors are uncommon in metro Atlanta, but they are credited with sharply reducing violence in New York City.
Warning signs and surveillance cameras are widely used locally, and while they may well be helping to limit violence, they also add an oppressive air to schools.
Some students resent that cameras ``make everyone feel like a suspect,'' in the words of an Illinois high school girl who sent an e-mail to a chat room on school violence.
And the camera will never be invented that can peer into a young person's mind.
Witness the shooting at suburban Atlanta's Bear Creek Middle School, in 1994.
On camera, security officers actually saw one boy ambush another, wounding him in the knee, but it happened so fast there was nothing that could be done to prevent it.
The locked-down mentality has even reached elementary schools.
Dr. Stephen Pastan, 43, of Atlanta was taking his children to his old private grade school in suburban Washington when a guard stopped him at the door, issued him I.D. tags and tried to make him accept an adult escort to tour the school.
``It was like visiting IBM _ I was put off,'' Pastan says.
``Maybe I'm naive about the real dangers but I worry about our children growing up without knowing what it is to feel free''.
In the chatroom run by the Raleigh-based Center for the Prevention of School Violence (www.ncsu.edu/cpsv/), Chris Bresky, senior class president of Clackamas (Ore).
High School, addressed the desire for a more human approach.
``Metal detectors, cameras and K-9 task forces will not scare violence away from the students, it will only scare the students; if the violence is in the students it will get inside the schools,'' Bresky writes.
``The key is to connect with students, raise awareness through speakers, plays, candlelight vigils that there is violence out there and it can happen in their school''.
AN UNDERSTANDING EAR Programs that stress the human approach are in effect to some degree throughout the metro Atlanta area.
But it's DeKalb County _ which began a forceful anti-bullying policy in 1997, two years before it became state law _ that's building a national reputation for innovation.
The system's multifaceted security efforts were mentioned in Time magazine in the coverage of the Columbine tragedy, and are due to be spotlighted in a documentary on the A&AMP;E channel in March.
Although the wall signs at Shamrock, a DeKalb County school, helped curtail a bullying problem a few years ago, Garry McGiboney, director of student relations for DeKalb schools, says it's the less obvious, more subtle, human programs that will make the schools happier and safer in the long haul.
Russel Parris agrees.
The Shamrock student's grades _ and attitude _ have improved since he's received weekly mentoring visits at school from Fred Reese, an employee of a nearby BellSouth office.
``When I need to get something off my chest, my mentor's there,'' says the 13-year-old, one of the 10 percent of Shamrock's 1,057 students who are mentored.
``He tells me, `Don't get mad, don't hit him, even if he was messing with you first'.
It's good advice''.
Jennifer Haygood, 13, adds: ``I can talk from the heart to my mentor, and I don't come in all mad-crazy wanting to blow up the school''.
She smiles as she says this.
She just means normal modern frustration.
Principal Davis feels that mentoring helps students vent anxieties that might otherwise explode.
``That's one of the underlying reasons we have a safe school,'' he says.
DEKALB'S INNOVATIONS You could see the human approach at work at DeKalb's Soapstone Center for the Arts the other day.
A group of students age 9 to 18 was creating their own anger-management play to tour DeKalb schools.
Just when the actors were about to erupt into staged fights, they stopped short _ took a deep breath, slipped on dark glasses and repeated the play's clever, cautionary tag line, ``Get in the cool zone''!
DeKalb schools have broadened the definition of bullying to include not just physical intimidation but ``any kind of harassment that isolates a child,'' says DeKalb schools spokesman Spencer Ragsdale.
``Teachers are trained to look not only for the obvious victims of bullying, but to reach out to the kid who isn't picked for teams, who eats lunch alone.
That's where the pain starts''.
Policies on bullying are posted on the county's Web page (www.dekalb.k12 under ``What's New'') along with findings from a Norwegian study on bullying that was discovered on the Web.
DeKalb's school district also has been the most aggressive locally in enforcing the new state anti-bullying law, expelling at least 12 students since August and sending them for a semester or two to alternative schools where the student-teacher ratio is lower, and the number of psychology-based courses, such as decision-making and anger management, is higher.
``Kids have access to so much violent entertainment, spend so much time in a world where conflicts are resolved with a gun,'' says Kevin Dwyer of the National Association of School Psychologists.
``That's why adolescent bullying, which has always been with us, escalates so much more dangerously now than it did in 1960 or even 1980''.
A CRUCIAL GAME OF HOOPS The human approach to preventing violence is not limited to DeKalb.
Across the nation, school cops are making more effort to connect, to understand students' feelings, says Curt Lavarello, head of the police officers' Florida-based national association.
Sean Burke, resource officer at Lawrence (Mass).
High School _ where a girl recently slashed another girl's face with a knife _ tells of joining in on an after-school basketball game and getting to know a boy who was almost frighteningly silent and intense.
After months of gentle encouragement the boy revealed his secret: He took off his shirt to display a back full of ugly welts.
There was more.
The father who whipped him also had sexually abused him.
Burke, his voice cracking with emotion, says, ``There's tremendous pressure in these kids today.
You need to help them get it out''.
Connecting with students who hurt and healing them is more likely to occur when psychologists are a visible force in the schools, says Dwyer.
Dwyer, author of a widely respected study on the warning signs for school violence, says that when there is a ratio of at least one psychologist per thousand students _ as there are in only six, mostly northeastern states _ the reductions in violence are considerable.
The high ratio of psychologists and their active involvement in the curriculum of Tampa schools, under the banner Project Achieve, was credited for reducing violent incidents in those schools by 80 percent.
Georgia ranks in the middle of the states, with about one psychologist per 2,000 students.
It's the victims of bullies _ not the bullies themselves _ who are most likely to commit the high-profile acts of school violence, DeKalb's McGiboney has found.
``The common thread in these incidents is that the child feels isolated or ostracized,'' he says.
``That feeling may begin at home.
A 13-year-old kid left in his room with a ton of entertainment equipment, or dropped at the mall to hang out all afternoon _ that's not independence.
That's isolation.
Parents need to talk to their kids and offer support before that anger grows''.
Indeed, reaching parents _ persuading them that bullying isn't a necessary rite of passage to toughen a kid's hide _ is almost as big a challenge as reaching students, McGiboney says.
When addressing parents' groups, he begins by asking how many were bullied as youngsters, and almost everyone's hand goes up.
``Then I ask, `How many still think about that bullying today'? and nearly every hand stays up,'' McGiboney says.
``I think that makes my point''.
Story Filed By Cox Newspapers For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Could it happen here?
That was a question many principals and superintendents asked last year after a spate of school shootings across the country.
So they increased security, bought metal detectors and surveillance cameras, created profiles of potentially violent students.
But as another school shooting tragedy unfolded in Littleton, Colo.
, on Tuesday, officials questioned whether any school could protect against such deadly events.
``That's one of the great mysteries -- how do you identify a student who is going to act out''? said Barbara Wheeler, school board member in Downers Grove, Ill.
, and former president of the National School Boards Association.
Some schools, adopting an attitude that it's better to be safe than sorry, have responded to the slightest sign of troubled students: -- A high school student in Starkville, Miss.
, was arrested in February and faces criminal charges for having a gun on school property.
-- An eighth-grader in Clarion County, Pa.
, who had a gun and repeated a threat to kill teachers was arrested at Union High School after a fellow student told his mother of threats.
-- A ninth-grade girl in Fairfax County, Va.
, was suspended when she wrote a note to a fellow student expressing anger about her teacher giving her a D, and the teacher took it as a physical threat.
William Modzeleski, the Education Department's safe schools chief, said schools have used federal and state money to identify and treat students who need mental health services.
Schools have also gotten more federal money in the past few years.
Six months ago President Clinton held a White House conference on school violence with about 800 educators and law-enforcement officials.
But Tuesday night, he acknowledged the nation had made little progress in solving the violence problem.
``You know there are a lot of kids out there who...
who build up these grievances in their own mind and who are not being reached,'' Clinton said.
``And it's not just Littleton''.
When the federal Safe and Drug Free Schools program -- now funded at $600 million a year -- began five years ago, it focused on student drug abuse.
But in recent years, the focus has shifted to school security.
Federal officials still say schools are safe.
In 1996, theft accounted for 62 percent of crimes against students at school.
``There is the perception that schools are terribly crime-ridden.
The perception is unfounded,'' Modzeleski said.
As the 1997-98 year showed, violence can even erupt at schools that seem safe to teachers and parents.
In March of last year, two boys in Jonesboro, Ark.
, opened fire on a crowd of students at their middle school, killing four classmates and a teacher.
Students also were accused of fatal shootings in Springfield, Ore.
, West Paducah, Ky.
, and Pearl, Miss.
Earlier this week, a high school sophomore in Notus, Idaho, was accused of firing a shotgun in a school hallway.
No one was hurt.
Most school districts haven't faced legal action for not preventing crimes, but they have been held liable for violating students' rights when imposing penalties.
Yet schools have not backed off developing policies because of the threat of lawsuits, Modzeleski said.
They have been working with attorneys to develop fair policies.
It's not clear what policies were followed at Columbine High School in the middle-class suburb of Littleton, where gunmen -- believed to be fellow students -- opened fire Tuesday.
Deborah Fallon, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Education Association, said the state's 176 districts set their own policies .
NEW YORK _ The shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
, have led school officials in the New York City metropolitan area to reassess security and in some cases to make changes to minimize threats.
At one extreme is West Hartford, Conn.
, where administrators devised what they termed a ``lockdown'' drill in which students and teachers, practicing in case there should be a shooting, lock all doors and stay put until they are told that the police have arrived.
But a more common reaction is that of New York City, where the Police Department obtained blueprints of the 1,100 schools and asked precinct commanders to work with principals and superintendents on how to handle such an emergency.
Either way, the potential for violence at schools has weighed heavily on many administrators and has generated forums for public discussion in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which have been spared school shootings but not the heightened alarm.
There were bomb threats in New York area schools after the April 20 shootings at Columbine High School, but no serious incidents were reported.
Shootings at New York City schools are rare; there has not been a fatal one since February 1992, when two teenagers involved in a feud over a gold bracelet were shot dead in the hallway of Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn just moments before Mayor David Dinkins was to arrive for a speech, said Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for the board.
That shooting led to the widespread use of metal detectors, now installed at 70 city schools.
Reacting to Columbine, New York state officials are requiring districts to report major violent acts _ bomb threats, explosions, shootings _ to the state Department of Education within 48 hours of the incident.
The regulation is designed to better track violence and help raise awareness among school officials and the communities they serve to the potential for violence, said Christopher Carpenter, a spokesman for the department.
He said school officials who failed to comply could face disciplinary action by the state, which licenses principals and superintendents.
In the meantime, a task force headed by Lt.
Gov. Mary Donahue has held public hearings across the state _ the final one was on Wednesday _ to prepare a report for Gov.
George Pataki on improving school safety.
Likewise, New Jersey state officials convened public forums to gather information toward a similar goal, and local districts in Connecticut must report to Gov.
John Rowland by September on how they have improved security.
Some people who work in schools are taking no chances.
A conference on Monday sponsored by the Connecticut Association of Schools and Connecticut Center for School Change at Quinnipiac College in Hamden included agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation instructing teachers on how to be good hostages.
It drew 225 people, the association's largest audience in four years.
SEATTLE _ The sheer magnitude of the slaughter at Littleton's Columbine High School has put Puget Sound-area schools on high alert and prompted sober reviews of school security, including a special meeting this week between Seattle police and school officials.
Local school districts are also reassessing whether lockdown drills _ which are not required by law _ should become mandatory, and are offering training to anxious teachers and principals who feel ill-prepared to respond to armed intruders.
``I hadn't dreamt it could be this horrific,'' said Brian Benzel, chief operations officer of the 48,600-student Seattle School District, referring to the Columbine killings in Littleton, Colo.
``It's just chilling...
It seems like we're going to have to expand our thinking about how to be prepared''.
Benzel and other district officials are meeting this week with Seattle police to review emergency strategies and discuss whether more could be done to prevent an attack like that carried out by the two heavily armed Columbine seniors, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
``It seemed very appropriate that we review procedures and protocol given what happened,'' Benzel said.
``We've had a pretty good relationship with SPD but we want to look at what could be improved''.
Harris and Klebold took the lives of 12 students and one teacher and injured 20 others on April 20 before turning their weapons on themselves.
Seattle police officers serve as school resource officers, visiting regularly and getting to know students and school buildings, said Larry Ferrar, the district's security director.
Police SWAT teams have also drilled at Seattle schools, Ferrar said.
In the aftermath of the worst school slayings in U.S. history, local secondary schools have beefed up security measures, from cracking down on even the mildest threat to launching random weapons sweeps of students with hand-held metal detectors.
At Seattle's Ballard High School, principal Chuck Chinn followed the advice of district security officials and recently stepped up locker checks and random sweeps of students with hand-held metal detectors, a procedure that had only occasionally been used before the Colorado killings.
``It puts the students on notice,'' Chinn said.
``There were virtually no complaints because the kids understood''.
But the 1,120-student Ballard High School, like many schools, has never done a lockdown drill, and Chinn said he is reviewing whether that is now necessary.
When the violence erupted at Columbine, many local districts had already begun revising their emergency manuals to include the threat of armed attacks because of the string of school shootings over the past two years.
Now districts are moving up timetables for training school staff, said Pegi McEvoy, the Seattle district's safety coordinator.
She's been inundated with requests for security training from worried teachers.``We are in a state of hyper-vigilance,'' McEvoy said.
``Just because you have a plan doesn't mean you know what's in it''.
Teachers want basic information, from how to get a lock installed on a classroom door to advice for shielding students from armed intruders, she said.
``Telling students to `drop and cover' can be the wrong thing to do,'' McEvoy said.
``You then become a sitting duck and they can just come up and shoot you.
We saw that in Littleton''.
Instead, running for safety or trying to get out a window could be a better strategy, she said.
A teacher might need to pull the shades on a window to block an intruder's view, or barricade a door.
Some security officials say that lawmakers should make lockdown drills mandatory so that schools are better prepared to protect children.
``There clearly is an issue here that the Legislature should visit about making lockdowns a requirement,'' said Michael Sweeney, security director for the 21,300-student Federal Way School district in Washington state.
``It would overcome the inconsistencies with which schools practice lockdown drills''.
A lockdown is used when a principal determines that there is an external threat to students and staff, from a violent incident near a school to an armed intruder within the building.
Every school has a predetermined signal _ such as a specific number of bells or buzzers _ that alerts staff about a lockdown, and the PA system is also used to give additional information.
During a lockdown, students are held in their classrooms and all doors are locked until further instructions are provided about when and how to clear the building.
In the 25,000-student Kent School District in Kent, Wash.
, security staff are compiling computerized blueprints and aerial photos of each of the 38 schools, said Jim Shimensky, King County Sheriff's liaison deputy and Kent security director.
The Kent SWAT team has also trained in schools after hours.
``It's like an insurance policy,'' Shimensky said.
``If something should happen, they will know the layout and be ready''.
The Kent district has also increased the money it spends training security officers, including requiring them to attend a two-week academy annually, and has boosted salaries to ensure top-quality staff, Shimensky said.
But Shimensky believes that a crucial key to preventing school violence is encouraging students to report threats and weapons to school staff, police and on anonymous tip lines.
``The kids know what is going on before the adults do,'' Shimensky said.
``That's how we've found most of the major weapons in recent years''.
The idea of installing permanent metal detectors at school entrances won little support from school officials, who say it would not only be costly and a logistical nightmare but would be ineffective because determined students would find a way to smuggle in weapons.
``We're running a school district not a prison system,'' said Ferrar, Seattle's security director.
``Where do we draw the line?
I just don't see a simple solution.''
GOLDEN, Colo.
(AP) -- The school board that governs Columbine High School has adopted 27 security measures, including panic alarms in main offices and mandatory identification badges for high school students and staff.
The only recommendation by the Jefferson County school district's Safety Task Force that was rejected, because of cost, was the addition of a second non-uniformed campus supervisor at each of the 16 high schools.
Most of the high schools and the district's 18 middle schools now have a uniformed school resource officer who is a police officer or sheriff's deputy.
All will have one under the new plan.
Columbine students will return to their school on Aug.
16 for the first time since the April 20 massacre.
Columbine seniors Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, armed with guns and pipe bombs, killed 12 students and a teacher, wounded 23 others and then took their own lives.
Other measures adopted Monday include: requiring visitors to get a school pass, the continued use of search dogs and the installation of a hot line and tip box to report incidents that might lead to violence.
Some task force members asked whether the measures would have stopped the shooting rampage had they been in place.
``We found all of our recommendations can create some kind of safety in the schools.
I think some of these recommendations could have prevented what happened,'' said task force member and Columbine student Sergie Gonzalez.
WASHINGTON _ Despite a well-publicized spate of school shootings, the number of students expelled for bringing a gun to a public school dropped nationally in the 1997-98 school year, the U.S.
Education Department reported Tuesday.
Expulsions for gun possession dropped by as much as 31 percent, although inaccurate or incomplete data submitted by some states made precision impossible.
As many as 5,700 students in 1996-97 and roughly 3,900 in 1997-98 were expelled for bringing a firearm to school.
In the most recent gun-related expulsions, 61 percent involved a handgun, 7 percent a rifle or shotgun, and the remaining 32 percent another type of firearm or explosives.
``The sharp decline in the number of students bringing guns to school tells us that we are starting to move in the right direction,'' said Education Secretary Richard Riley.
The federal Gun Free Schools Act requires states that want federal aid for their schools to adopt and enforce laws that require an automatic one-year expulsion of a student who brings a gun to school.
The report showed that about 57 percent of the expelled children received no alternative education during their expulsion, a policy that the Clinton administration has proposed to outlaw.
The report also showed that the one-year expulsion was shortened on a case-by-case basis for 44 percent of those expelled.
About one-third of those whose expulsions were shortened had learning, emotional or physical disabilities.
Law enforcement officials agree that the decline in expulsions was due to fewer violations, rather than laxer enforcement by schools, according to Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder.
He said the drop was consistent with reports by the Department of Justice of a decline in gun-related violent crimes for all ages in all locations, and by the Centers for Disease Control of a decline in ``violence-related behavior'' by young people.
Holder said the trend was boosted by consistent enforcement of strict rules and by tighter gun control laws.
Another reason, according to school-district security officials who joined Riley for the announcement, is that more children think they might be caught.
The officials said adults and students alike are more likely to report gun-toting students than they were before the mass shootings in Pearl, Miss.
West Paducah, Ky.
Jonesboro, Ark.
Edinboro, Pa.
, and Springfield, Ore.
, and this year in Littleton, Colo.
, and Conyers, Ga.
``The community, they're our eyes and ears, and we can rely on them,'' said Lt.
Karen Hall of the Atlanta public schools.
``They'll report anything from a burglary in progress to students being disruptive or being where they're not supposed to be''.
(Story can end here.
Optional add follows).
Schools remain the safest place for children, with fewer than one out of 100 murders of children taking place in or around schools.
But many educators either share or feel they must respond to public concerns that crescendoed after a teacher and 14 students died at Columbine High School in Littleton.
``There are a still a lot of school districts that don't know what they are doing,'' acknowledged Jack Martin, chief of police for the Indianapolis public schools.
But this summer, even small districts that felt most distant from urban violence have been trying to find out which ``best practices'' are affordable, he said.
Schools are trying everything from hand-held metal detectors and closed-circuit TV cameras to policies that require transparent bookbags or forbid clothing baggy enough to conceal weapons, the security chiefs said.
Efforts by parents, communities and law enforcement to identify and assist ``red-flag children'' before they commit dangerous acts will do far more to make other children safe, said Edward Ray, director of security for the Denver public schools.
``I don't think anyone wants to see our schools transformed into institutions with concrete walls surrounded by concertina wire,'' Ray said.

GREENSBORO, N.C.
(AP) -- New software that helps highlight school trouble spots may help educators trying to avert violent episodes such as the Columbine High School shootings earlier this year.
GBA Systems' School Safety Software, formally called SSP2000, is designed to give school administrators an accurate way to track incidents of school violence and other crimes.
``Schools need to know what is occurring on the campus,'' president Sylvia Stone said in an interview last month at the company's Greensboro headquarters.
``And they need to have information available to them quickly''.
Once the appropriate data is entered, the program helps users identify potential problems and repeat offenders.
It tracks incidents by category, including offender, victim, weapons and location.
The analysis capability is similar to that in several existing business and financial programs -- not surprising since GBA Systems' main focus is selling accounting and other business applications.
Bob Bateman, school safety administrator for the Guilford County school district, used the software when a Greensboro middle school principal asked him to help identify places in the school where crime was a problem.
The principal thought the biggest problems were in the gym and cafeteria.
But after using the GBA software, Bateman found the hot spots were in the hallways.
``The principal used the information to justify shifting more resources to those areas, knowing that his decision was based on valid statistics instead of a hunch, or a quick reaction to one or two incidents,'' Bateman said.
While school safety measures such as metal detectors or additional security officers can be expensive, Stone estimated the cost of the software to be less than $2 per student.
So far, nearly 300 schools from North Carolina to California are using the software as part of their security programs, according to GBA Systems.
And others, including the New York City school district, are considering it as a means to get a handle on the problem of school violence.
School violence experts say more accurate and timely reporting of campus crime would help administrators get a better understanding of the problems they face and allow for early intervention.
``This is something we have encouraged for several years,'' said June Arnette, associate director of the National School Safety Center in Westlake Village, Calif.
``You cannot deploy resource officers to a particular school until you can see the problems''.
Peter Blauvelt, president of the National Alliance for Safe Schools in Berkley Springs, W.
Va., also saw merit in the software's ability to spot potential problems.
A report issued by the National Association of School Psychologists before Columbine concluded there was a common warning sign in five separate school shooting incidents.
Students who were isolated or withdrawn were prone to being picked on by other students, he said.
``This bullying was a common factor in all five cases and also at Columbine,'' he said.
``It should not be used as the basis for expulsion, but it can be used in determining if someone needs additional help''.
Blauvelt said schools need to be careful however about possibly violating a student's rights.
``There's a fine line,'' he said.
``Just because someone is withdrawn does not mean they are violent, but the student needs help to become reattached with the school community''.
GBA Systems' Ms.
Stone is quick to point out the software is not a panacea.
``If we can provide a tool -- and quite a simple tool -- to help schools make better informed decisions, then our goal is accomplished,'' she said.
FORT GIBSON, Okla.
(AP) -- The teen-ager standing on stage in short sleeves and jeans looked like he had nothing to hide -- until he pulled a knife from his pocket.
And then came a machete.
And another.
He drew a handgun from a front pocket, and three more from his waistband.
He reached down his baggy pants leg and up came a rifle.
By the time Chris Dorn's pockets were empty, an arsenal lay before the high school sophomore.
And the audience of school, police and emergency officials had a better idea of what they face in their efforts to keeping schools safe.
``He can double the number of weapons just with a jacket on,'' Michael Dorn, school safety specialist and Chris' father, said Tuesday during the school security workshop sponsored by the Oklahoma Schools Advisory Council.
More than 200 people came to learn about school safety in the town where in December, a 13-year-old boy shot four students outside Fort Gibson Middle School.
It was the country's third school shooting of the year.
In May, a 15-year-old boy in Conyers, Ga.
, wounded six students.
And in April, two students at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
, shot 12 students and a teacher to death, before killing themselves.
A national study found more than 100,000 students carry a gun to school each day, but only 4,000 student gun expulsions were reported to the U.S.
Department of Education last year, Dorn said.
While schools cannot ensure safety, they can enact strategies that make schools safer, he said.
Dorn, who works for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, said enforcing dress codes and reducing ``triggering behaviors'' such as fights and bullying can help make a difference.
Schools also have used random locker inspections and surprise classroom searches to foil potential acts of violence, he said.
He also discussed creating emergency plans for schools that would include everyone, from the local police to the school bus drivers.
Fort Gibson already had a crisis plan when the December attack took place.
The district has since started using a metal detector at special events, added security cameras and limited building access, Superintendent Steve Wilmoth said.
``Just being mentally prepared can help,'' Wilmoth said.
WASHINGTON _ As schools reopen for the new academic year, U.S.
Education Secretary Richard Riley offered this reassurance Tuesday: Parents and students should not fear repeats of deadly gun rampages such as the one last April in Littleton, Colo.
Riley said school efforts to counter violence are paying off and students are getting the message that guns have no place in school.
He cited a new Education Department report showing that a total of 3,390 students were expelled for bringing firearms to school during the 1997-1998 school year, the most recent year available.
The number was 31 percent lower than the previous school year, when 5,724 students were expelled.
The ``sharp decline...
tells us that we are starting to move in the right direction,'' Riley said.
``All of us _ parents, educators, students and all citizens _ can look to this new school year with hope, not with fear''.
Bill Modzeleski, director of the department's safe and drug-free schools program, said statistics for the 1998-1999 school year just completed are not yet available because of a lag time in reporting from local school districts and state education agencies.
Less than one percent of all homicides among school-age children occur in or around schools, Riley said.
Nevertheless, surveys have shown a level of anxiety among parents and students over school violence.
One such survey of high-school age students released Tuesday by the Horatio Alger Association showed 37 percent feel safe in school, down from 44 percent last year.
But local school security officials meeting with Riley said they believed schools generally are safe places, and that incidents such as the one at Columbine High School are ``an aberration,'' as Wesley Mitchell, police chief of the Los Angeles Unified School District, put it.
In that incident last April, two students stormed into Columbine and killed a dozen classmates and a teacher before committing suicide.
Other similar incidents have occurred in Pearl, Miss.
, West Paducah, Ky.
, Jonesboro, Ark.
, Edinboro, Pa.
, and Springfield, Ore.
The officials said that while educators and law enforcement officials have taken measures to pinpoint potential troublemakers and prevent violence from occurring, guarding against a future random attack is extremely difficult.
``At the point of attack, very few of the measures we could have, or do have, in place probably would have prevented the Columbine incident,'' said Edward Ray, director of security for Denver public schools.
``How do we identify those young people ...
`red flag' students that seem to be heading in (a violent) direction.
It's a very complex issue.
It's not something that can be readily identified at the school level''.
Ray said that incidents such as Columbine are ``beyond predictability,'' adding: ``Our number one goal is to make our schools as safe as we possibly can without turning them into bunkers.
I don't think any of us in this country want to see our schools become institutions surrounded by concrete walls and concertina wire''.
The education department report released Tuesday showed: _ The majority of those expelled in the 1997-98 school year _ 62 percent _ were expelled for handguns.
_ Seven percent were for possession of rifles or shotguns.
_ The remaining 31 percent were for other types of weapons such as bombs or grenades.
_ Fifty-seven percent of those expelled were high school students, while 33 percent were in junior high school and 10 percent in elementary school.
Not surprisingly, larger states reported higher numbers of expulsions.
California, with a school-age population of 6.2 million, had 382 expulsions.
New York, with 3.2 million school-age children, had 91 expulsions.
Texas, with 3.9 million children, expelled 424 _ the highest state total.
The expulsions are the result of the 1994 Gun-Free Schools Act, which conditioned federal education dollars on states passing laws that require local school districts to expel.
All states have adopted such laws.
Over the next few months, Riley said, the Education Department will release $135 million in grants to help schools and communities prevent violence through drug and alcohol counseling, and programs to help young people find ways of resolving problems without weapons.
Bruce Marquis, chief of police at the Houston Independent School District, said authorities have gotten smarter about making it harder for youths to carry guns in school.
Among the anti-gun measures are controls on backpacks and a dress code that makes it difficult for students to hide guns in clothing.
``Primarily, however, information (on students with guns) comes from other students,'' Marquis said.
``These are all signs ...
So when we say the numbers are down, we have good indicators''.
&QL; (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS).
&QL; Riley spoke at a press conference here just hours before a gunman opened fire in a Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles, wounding five persons including three children.
While that incident did not conform to the pattern of students taking out their frustrations with guns aimed at fellow students, it raised new concerns about levels of random violence and the ability of authorities to guard against unpredictable outbreaks.
Riley referred to the particularly gruesome round of blood-letting in Atlanta last month in which securities day-trader Mark O.
Barton killed 12 people including his wife and two children before committing suicide.
The Atlanta episode and the wave of school shootings serve to remind ``once again that this country really has created a culture of violence with this easy access to guns,'' Riley said.
``Americans really need to stop and think hard about what's happening''.

EDISON, N.J.
(AP) -- Lawrence Middle School has a bullying policy.
Hunterdon Central Regional High School students walk around with identification badges.
And in Hamilton Square, guidance counselors are ordered to tell administrators when a student talks of wanting to hurt someone.
School administrators sharing their tactics for averting school violence at a second annual conference Wednesday unveiled elaborate safety plans and said they preferred to err on the side of caution when dealing with threats of violence.
''You can never be too safe,'' said Linda Batz, the principal of Hunterdon Central Regional.
Since two teen-agers at Columbine High School killed twelve other students, a teacher and themselves in Littleton, Colo.
, on April 20, 1999, some critics have said that schools have taken zero-tolerance discipline policies to the extreme.
Sayreville school officials said they would review the district's zero-tolerance policy after complaints about the three-day suspension of four kindergartners who were pointing their fingers at each other while playing ''cops and robbers'' in the playground.
Six elementary school students in Plainfield were suspended for two days in March after an 11-year-old boy threatened to ''get a gun'' if other children did not stop teasing him.
Joe Duca, a retired police officer who works as a security coordinator for the South Brunswick Schools, said school officials are fearful of not doing enough to stop another Columbine.
''I think everybody is running scared,'' Duca said.
''They're afraid of being held responsible'' if a school threat escalates into violence.
Ellen Boylan, an attorney at the Education Law Center who handles students-rights cases, said zero-tolerance policies illegally keep students from receiving educations and don't result in safer schools.
She cited research that concluded harsh punishment for intolerable behavior does nothing to stop the behavior or increase school safety.
Ninety-five percent of school districts in the nation have such policies, she said, and yet suspensions and expulsions have doubled between 1990 and 1997, indicating that students are not deterred.
''In the mind of students, it's overcontrol,'' she said, adding that it may lead to more violence.
Chris Woolley, the principal of Lawrence Middle School in Lawrence Township, said that his school might meet with a parent or a school psychologist about a student threat before deciding upon a suspension.
He might not suspend a student for threatening to shoot a rubber band at someone, for example, but may suspend the student if the spitball seriously injures another person.
''It is incumbent on us all to make reasonable decisions,'' he said.
Jane Hammond, the Jefferson County (Colo).
superintendent whose district includes Columbine, said one of the most important lessons she learned from the tragedy was that student safety isn't a sure thing.
''I have learned to accept that I cannot guarantee the safety of all of our children,'' Hammond said in a keynote address.
''I cannot even guarantee my own safety for the rest of this day''.
''I feel stress every day we have school,'' she continued.
Schools have taken different approaches to the problem.
Lawrence Township's bullying policy bans students from intimidation, use of force or ''habitual or persistent cruelty''.
The school has made efforts to reach out to alienated students, Woolley said.
''Students must feel that people care about them and that they have a voice,'' he said.
Hunterdon Central Regional High School has practiced evacuation drills.
The school requires student identification badges and equips administrators with two-way radios and bullhorns.
The high school recently sent a police officer dressed in a fright wig and carrying a gun case to test the school's response to an intruder.
Some students directed the officer to principal Batz' office when he asked, but Batz said in a second drill the ''intruder'' was reported in two minutes.
Hamilton Square guidance counselors are told to report any threat a student makes in a counseling session to school administrators, said Superintendent Neil A. Bencivenga.
WASHINGTON _ Six years ago, a trench-coated classmate with a deer rifle and two handguns opened fire in Natalie Hintz's middle-school math class in Moses Lake, Wash.
Hintz was wounded, and two other students and the teacher were killed.
But last year's similar shootings in Littleton, Colo.
, that left 15 people dead led to few improvements in security at her high school, according to Hintz, now an 18-year-old senior.
Her school system's low-key response to the shootings at Littleton's Columbine High School on April 20 reflects a national pattern, according to students, school officials, researchers and safety advocates interviewed in the past two weeks.
``I think new policies were made, but they're not being vigorously enforced,'' Hintz said.
A police officer is stationed in her school and most entrances are locked during the school day, so that outsiders would have to use the main doors.
``But when kids bang on the door, anyone walks over to let them in, or like prop the door open,'' she said.
``On paper, we also have a really strict policy that you're not supposed to walk down a hallway without a pass,'' Hintz said.
``That's not enforced at all''.
In one sign that a new emphasis on reporting suspicious activity can pay off, a girl at her school notified the principal in January that a boy told her he had a hit list.
The boy was expelled, but Hintz and other survivors of the 1994 shootings didn't learn about that until a story appeared in the local newspaper.
While school systems located close to Littleton reacted strongly, most of those who experienced the event only through TV retreated from a sharp first reaction, gradually returning to previous practices.
``It had effects, but they dwindled down among those who weren't directly concerned,'' said Sgt.
James Stewart of the Atlanta police department, who supervises officers assigned to the city's schools.
``We were far more concerned a few years ago when we had to arrange to assess and get some psychological attention for some kids from the Atlanta schools who were in a local mall when some guy came through and shot it up''.
``In the week right after Columbine, the call volume to us increased tremendously,'' said Jim Jones, vice president of Security Voice, Inc.
His firm in Columbus, Ohio, accepts anonymous tips on a toll-free ``Safe School Helpline'' it operates for 4,000 of the nation's 15,000 school districts.
But he said the tips this year have been back at their usual level, as low as one per district per week.
``I don't see evidence that much has changed,'' said Lawrence Sherman, director of the Fels(cq) Center of Government at the University of Pennsylvania.
``This is a country in which most gun violence is concentrated in the inner cities, where it isn't newsworthy, and it looks like the window of opportunity (that news coverage of Littleton provided) for improving national gun control policy may have closed''.
In Washington, after a flurry of meetings at which experts and victims offered suggestions, President Clinton and the bipartisan House leadership separately appointed working groups on school violence.
Both groups issued long lists of virtually identical suggestions for new ways _ other than gun control _ that students, parents, schools and communities can work together to detect, prevent or cope with school violence.
But none of the suggestions that require new federal laws have been adopted, because each side believes that this might weaken its leverage in the election-year negotiations over controversial new regulations for guns.
``Maybe next year, we'll have more luck,'' said Rep.
Martin Frost of Texas, Democratic co-chair of the House task force.
``Or some people may try to add one or two of our recommendations as amendments to appropriations bills moving through Congress this year''.
The Republican co-chair, Rep.
Jennifer Dunn of Washington, said, ``I suspect we might be able to get some put into the Juvenile Justice bill.
After that, maybe there could be a second phase for the task force, where we would make specific recommendations to appropriations committees and then follow through on that over the next few years''.
The Education and Justice departments have given away more than 500,000 copies of ``Early Warning, Timely Response,'' a guide prepared by experts in 1998.
Most copies have been distributed since the Littleton shootings.
The guide tells school officials, parents and citizens how to prepare an action plan for detecting, preventing and responding to threats and crises in the schools.
``I think a lot of people are looking at it,'' said Kevin Dwyer, president of the National Association of School Psychologists, a co-author of the guide.
``Unfortunately, there is no record-keeping of the effect, so we have no idea how many schools and communities sat down, put some plans together and implemented them,'' Dwyer said.
He also helped prepare ``Action Guide for Safe Schools,'' a follow-up booklet that Education Secretary Richard Riley and Attorney General Janet Reno are issuing this month.
Solid information on how schools reacted to Littleton should emerge from a school survey on crime and safety that was mailed to a sample of 3,000 school principals last month, said the survey's director, Kathryn Chandler of the Education Department.
However, when the results are released in December, Ken Trump, a Cleveland-based school security consultant, will view them skeptically.
``Based on my 15 years of working with school officials on school safety, I know for a fact that crimes are grossly underreported by school officials,'' Trump told reporters.
Even without hard data, some school security experts and students said that since the Littleton shootings, they have observed several useful trends on the local level.
Schools have phased in innovations that range from more visible security procedures and creation of more local chapters of SAVE (Students Against Violence Everywhere) to a more efficient use of school psychologists and counselors.
The beefed-up security procedures include surveillance cameras, metal detectors, see-through bookbags, id cards for all students and teachers, and crisis-reaction drills.
(Story can end here.
Optional adds follow) ``A drill for a bomb threat is just like a fire drill, only it takes longer,'' said Kelly Boyd, a high school junior in Montgomery County, Md.
``But if someone fires a gun in school, I don't think most people are going to remember which exit they are supposed to use''.
Higher federal subsidies have increased the number of police working for or assigned to schools.
``Right now, we've got the resources made available to us that let us do the positive, proactive programs.
That includes providing kids with more positive inter-action with adults through after-school programs that are a combination of tutorial and recreational programs,'' said Jim Kelly, police chief of the school district of Palm Beach County, Fla.
``My only concern as crime statistics go down is that, as more people realize that school are the safest place for your child to be, the government powers that be might decide they've solved that problem and turn to another one,'' Kelly said.
The number of school psychologists and counselors may have increased slightly, according to their national associations.
Jan Gallagher of San Antonio, president of the American School Counselors Association, said, ``More importantly, I have counselors telling me they are getting to do more of the mental health work that they are trained to do, rather than to be used primarily as test administrators and clerical workers''.
``Unfortunately, I don't hear that at all,'' said Scott Poland of Cypress, Texas, author of ``Coping with Crisis'' and a school psychologist who has been part of teams dealing with multiple shootings in several states.
``There are still too many cases where kids know there is a gun on campus, or that a student shows signs of being homicidal or suicidal, but the kids won't come forward and tell an adult''.

ATLANTA _ It's a shocking statistic: Six thousand students were caught bringing guns to U.S. schools during the past two years, but a mere 13 cases were prosecuted under a federal law the Clinton administration promoted to keep guns away from schools.
In response to the call for additional gun control after a wave of school shootings, the purported gap between arrests and prosecutions has been cited and recited by political figures and others who say existing laws should be better enforced before new gun restrictions are imposed.
It will be a central theme of a House hearing Thursday into new gun-control proposals.
There's just one problem: While plenty shocking, this statistic isn't entirely accurate.
It is true that about 6,000 students were cited in 1997 and 1998 under the federal Gun-Free Schools Act for bringing firearms to school.
But, as the law requires, those students were suspended from school and charged as juvenile delinquents in state and local courts.
And it is true that the U.S.
Justice Department prosecuted just 13 people the past two years under the federal Gun-Free School Zone Act, a separate law that prohibits the possession of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school.
But thousands of other defendants who allegedly violated the federal law, including the 15-year-old accused of shooting six classmates at Heritage High School in Rockdale County, Ga.
, have been charged or prosecuted under state laws.
Federal prosecutions, authorities say, are reserved for particularly flagrant cases.
The 13 prosecutions have nothing to do with the 6,000 instances of children bringing guns to school, said U.S.
Justice Department and White House officials, who complained that gun-control opponents have drawn a misleading, if salient, link between the two numbers to divert attention from the emotional issues of school violence and firearms restrictions.
``If you look at any number in a vacuum, you can find a problem with it,'' said Brian Steel, a spokesman for the Justice Department.
``This is a total smokescreen''.
In 1997, the latest year for which statistics are available, the federal government prosecuted 6,078 gun offenses, the Justice Department said.
State and local prosecutors handled the rest of the year's 218,900 arrests in which a weapons offense was the most serious charge.
With political opponents citing such figures, the Clinton administration's enforcement of existing gun laws is becoming a focal point in the debate over new regulations.
In a speech to the Georgia Republican Party last Saturday, Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association's executive vice president, deplored ``a collapse of federal firearms law enforcement''.
At the same meeting, in Augusta, GOP presidential contender Steve Forbes ridiculed the administration's record on firearms violations at schools.
``In 1997,'' he said, ``they prosecuted a total of five.
Last year, they prosecuted eight.
And you can hear the White House spin now: From five to eight, that's a 60 percent increase''.
The House Judiciary Committee is ready to consider a bill supported by the president, similar to one the Senate passed last week, that would mandate background checks on people who buy weapons at gun shows and would require trigger locks on all firearms.
But at a hearing on Thursday, the House panel first will ask why Clinton's Justice Department isn't prosecuting more cases.
``We've taken it upon ourselves to federalize a lot of crimes, and it's the Department of Justice's responsibility to see to it that those laws are executed and followed,'' said Michael Connolly, a spokesman for Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.).
``What's the point of passing new laws?
.. . We want to look at how and why these (new proposals) would be prosecuted differently than the current record the administration has put together''.
U.S. Rep.
Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a Judiciary member, described the low prosecution figures as ``a major problem for the administration''.
``All this president is interested in is a sound bite, a photo op with a bunch of cardboard cops behind him to show that he's tough on crime,'' Barr said.
``They are more interested in limiting access to firearms by citizens than they are in tackling the misuse of firearms by criminals''.
But a White House spokeswoman said focusing on how many cases are prosecuted is irrelevant.
More important, said Julie Goldberg, a deputy press secretary, is the fact that the number of reported violent crimes involving firearms decreased by 29 percent from 1993 to 1997.
``Enforcement alone is not enough,'' Goldberg said.
``There are other issues that Congress also needs to look at.
That's what the president is hoping to have Congress act on _ his proposals to prevent crimes and prevent guns from getting into the hands of children''.

BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Five leaders of three hooligan gangs have been executed in China, Liu Jiachen, vice president of the country's Supreme People's Court, announced today.
The executions were carried out in Shangqiu of central China's Henan Province, in Nanping of east China's Fujian Province and in Xianyang of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, yesterday and today.
The five criminals were sentenced to death for committing such serious crimes as hooliganism, killing, theft and harming individuals.
"Some hooligan gangs are well organized, having some characteristics of sinister gangs of the underworld, which are doing serious harm to society.
It will be the focus of the crackdown against crimes in the next stage," Liu said.
The number of criminal cases, especially those involving criminal gangs, has been on a steady rise in some areas of China in recent times.
Usually they have the characteristics of large gang members, active in large areas, committing crimes frequently and doing serious harm to society, said Liu.
China has been striking hard against violent crime, focusing on wiping out those endangering social security and public order.
The crackdown against serious crime since April has effectively contained criminal activities and won widespread support from people.
NEW DELHI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Procurators, justices and crime prevention officials from 28 Asian countries gathered here on Tuesday to seek improvement of mutual cooperation in their fight against crimes in the region.
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Seventh World Conference of Asia Crime Prevention Foundation (ACPF), Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of China Liang Guoqing called for enhancing cooperation among Asian countries to fight crimes and set up a crime prevention regime.
The conference, with the theme of Effective Regional Cooperation in Crime Prevention and Crime Justice in the next millennium, is scheduled to discuss and foster strategies and viable approaches on crime prevention.
With the world moving toward multi-polarization and integration and exchanges among countries on the increase, Liang said, crime has also become international in nature.
Asian countries are faced with the common challenge of combating criminals who flee from one country to another and gang up with local criminals, he said.
Therefore, he added, it is imperative to enhance cooperation among countries so as to set up a crime prevention regime.
He informed the delegates that China has signed legal assistance agreements with 28 countries and extradition treaties with 10 countries.
China is ready to exchange experience in preventing and penalizing crimes with all countries, especially those in Asia, he said.
Liang also gave a brief account of the procuratorate system in China and the practice and experience of Chinese procurators in the field of crime prevention.
Opening the meeting, Indian Law Minister Ram Jethamalani said New Delhi favors creating international pressure against countries which give credence and shelter to criminals and various groups indulging in violence, arson and other unlawful activities.
"You can not fight crime at international and global level if a criminal of one society becomes an honorable guest elsewhere and is extended best of hospitality," Jethamalani said.
Without naming any country, the minister said perpetrators of crime should not be given "shelter" in any country.
ACPF, a non-governmental, non-political and non-profit organization founded in 1982, strives to promote sustainable development, peace and stability in Asia and the world through mutual cooperation and more effective crime prevention, criminal justice policies and practices.
BEIJING (AP) _ China urged Portugal Sunday to take tougher measures against gang-related crime in Macau to ensure the Portuguese colony's smooth handover to Chinese rule next year.
A committee picked by China to prepare for Macau's Dec.
20, 1999, handover said it ``took note'' of Portuguese authorities' measures ``to benefit the protection of social stability'' in the enclave, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
But the committee also ``hopes Macau's Portuguese government will take even more effective steps and clamp down harder on the criminal activities of evil forces,'' Xinhua said.
Portuguese officials are ``entirely responsible'' for social order in Macau until next year's handover, the committee pointed out in a statement at the end of a three-day meeting in Beijing.
A spate of shooting deaths, arson attacks and other acts of violence believed by police to be linked to gang wars over Macau's lucrative gambling industry have shaken the tiny enclave as it moves toward Chinese rule.
In May, Macau's Portuguese governor chided Beijing for its lax reaction to the troubles and called for a tightening of border controls.
Last week, a Chinese police chief denied claims that Chinese officers had given support to Macau's criminal underworld.
The Chinese committee preparing for Macau's handover also criticized Portuguese administrators for what it said were sluggish efforts to replace Portuguese civil servants with locally born Macanese.
The delay ``is not beneficial for Macau's stable transition and smooth handover of government power,'' the committee said, adding that it was ``deeply concerned.''
HONG KONG (AP) _ Chinese authorities have broken up a gang led by a Hong Kong man suspected in a string of murders, kidnappings and the smuggling of explosives across the Hong Kong-mainland boundary, reports said Thursday.
China's Xinhua news agency said police working with Hong Kong authorities had arrested 18 members of the gang in southern Guangdong province, which is adjacent to Hong Kong.
While applauding the arrests, Hong Kong papers said there was likely to be more such cross-border crime after the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule last year.
The Hong Kong Standard called on authorities to clarify gray areas of jurisdiction stemming from the case.
Most of the crimes allegedly were planned in China, but committed in Hong Kong.
Reports said the suspects likely would be tried on the mainland, where they could face the death penalty.
Hong Kong newspapers said the gang, led by 43-year-old Cheung Tza-keung, had been implicated in the kidnapping in 1996-97 of tycoons from two of Hong Kong's wealthiest property development companies.
Papers plastered a picture of a squinting Cheung, known as the ``Big Spender,'' with a few days' growth of beard on his chin.
Fourteen of the 18 were reported to be from Hong Kong Xinhua said the gang had been together since 1990, and besides the kidnappings were suspected of smuggling 800 kilograms (1,760 pounds) of explosives into Hong Kong; murders in the Chinese cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou, and robberies of Hong Kong jewelry stores.
BEIJING, November 25 (Xinhua) -- China is still facing the difficult task of fighting corruption and economic crimes, according to a report recently released by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
The report on China's social situation said that although the Chinese government's position against corruption is firm, corruption, especially bribery, is still widespread and in some places severe.
"From January to September of this year, 756 major economic criminal cases, involving a total of 3.87 billion yuan (466 million U.S. dollars), were reported by China's customs officials alone," the report said.
Some middle and high-level officials have been involved in many of the country's white collar criminal cases, it said.
According to the report, the government will make greater effort to crack down on corruption, smuggling and other economic crimes as well as criminal acts in the new year.
VIENNA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to strengthen cooperation with other countries and international organizations in combating and preventing organized transnational crime, a senior Chinese official said here today.
China's deputy minister of justice, Zhang Geng, made the remarks in a speech at the Sixth Session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice.
Zhang said that the Chinese government appreciates the efforts by the United Nations in crime prevention and criminal justice and has taken an active part in U.N. activities in the area.
"We are ready to strengthen cooperation with other governments and international organizations and make our contributions to the joint efforts in combating and preventing organized transnational crime," he said.
Zhang said that in the past few years, China's law enforcement authorities cracked numerous cases in southeast China involving killing, kidnapping and racketeering by members of criminal gangs which entered China from overseas.
They also assisted police authorities of other countries in tracking down and arresting members of criminal gangs, he said.
Zhang said that China amended its Criminal Law recently to enhance the fight against organized crime, money-laundering, terrorist crime, trafficking of illegal immigrants and environment-related crimes.
The amended penal code will play a greater role in combating transnational crime after it comes into force on October 1, 1997, he said.
By the end of 1996, China has signed 32 judicial assistance agreements with 25 countries and extradition agreements with six countries, Zhang said.
"We have also cooperated with other countries with which no agreements have been signed on a case by case basis in the principle of mutual benefit," he said.
Zhang said that the Chinese government is ready to expand its cooperation with other countries, including signing more agreements, on the basis of mutual respect for each other's sovereignty, judicial independence and dignity.
HONG KONG (AP) _ As a reputed local crime boss fights his death sentence in China, reports Thursday said Hong Kong officials had previously asked mainland counterparts to consider sparing the lives of territory residents convicted of capital offenses in China.
``We have asked whether it was possible that the death sentence on convicted Hong Kong people would not be carried out,'' the South China Morning Post quoted a source as saying.
The newspaper identified its source only as a senior Hong Kong security official.
It also reported the source would not disclose China's response.
Hong Kong officials had been working with their mainland counterparts on an agreement covering the transfer of fugitives, mutual judicial cooperation in criminal cases and the return of persons jailed abroad to serve sentences in local prisons, the paper reported.
The lack of such an agreement was highlighted in the case of Hong Kong gangster Cheung Tze-Keung, who was convicted this month by a mainland court in a string of crimes and sentenced to death along with four accomplices.
The Post said the Hong Kong-China talks took place before the trial of Cheung, known by his alias ``Big Spender''.
Cheung's trial was the first such high-profile cross-border case to be heard since Hong Kong reverted from British rule to China last year.
Human rights groups, legal experts and some politicians have criticized the Hong Kong government for not seeking a transfer of the Cheung case to Hong Kong, which has a more open court system and no death penalty.
Many of the alleged crimes were committed in Hong Kong, but the defendants were tried behind closed doors in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou.
Meanwhile, Cheung's lawyers are pressing ahead with his appeal, calling for two tycoons who were allegedly kidnapped to testify at an appeal hearing, the Post said.
The tycoons, reportedly Victor Li, son of property magnate Li Ka-shing, and Walter Kwok, chairman of blue-chip Sun Hung Kai Properties, never reported any kidnappings to Hong Kong authorities.
This is the main reason why the Hong Kong government did not have enough evidence to press charges, Hong Kong security officials have said.
Cheung's letter of appeal argues that Cheung cannot be guilty of kidnapping if there are no victims.
``There is no evidence of a victim reporting a criminal case.
And there is no evidence of someone being criminally harmed.
There are only defendant's statements,'' the Post quoted the appeal as saying.
The Hong Kong government has said it was forwarding to China clemency pleas for Cheung and one of his gang members on behalf of their families.
The Guangdong Higher People's Court is expected to deliver its ruling on the appeal by mid-February, the Post reported.
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) - A senior Chinese lawmaker said here today that public security in some areas has taken a turn for the better thanks to comprehensive public-order regulations, but the general situation is still disturbing.
Cao Zhi, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, China's top legislature, made this statement after concluding a legislative inspection tour to Hainan, Jilin and Jiangsu provinces, and several municipalities and autonomous regions.
In a report to the ongoing session of the NPC Standing Committee, he said local governments are basically maintaining social stability and causing people to feel safer by employing measures for years to mobilize community forces and help the police prevent and crack down on crime.
"Especially in coastal areas where there used to be quite a number of public security problems, the general security situation is obviously better," he said.
Without the comprehensive measures taken these years, Cao added, the present security situation would be "much worse".
Nevertheless, crime rates are still on rise; the problems of murder, robbery, explosions, and theft are prominent; prostitution, gambling and drug-related social vices persist despite repeated police raids; and gang crimes, juvenile delinquency, and felonies perpetrated by migrants are increasing, according to the senior lawmaker.
Chinese police have intensified their fight against criminal gangs and have smashed many in the past two years, but the public reports that gangs are still growing in number and influence, he noted.
Statistics from the Ministry of Public Security say that in the first six months this year, police nationwide handled 833,000 criminal cases, up 21.6 percent over the same period last year.
Cao proposed several solutions for the worsening situation: -- The "Strike-Hard" drive must continue to curb the rising crime rates; -- The community-level security network must be spread and instituted all across the country, as surveys have found that those places with poor security are also lax in law enforcement; -- And, most important, leaders at all levels must first become aware of the present situation and remain assiduous in the comprehensive management of public security.
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Thursday was the final day of a 43-day exhibition providing information on China's "Strike Hard" crime-fighting campaign that has attracted some 450,000 visitors.
The show, which was held in a military museum in Beijing, was the biggest and longest show on crime ever held in China and got quite a lot of attention.
Yesterday alone, it drew some 15,000 people, according to Beijing Daily.
According to the Public Security Ministry, the seven-month national crackdown on crime has brought China's rising crime rate down, with 3.1 percent fewer crimes reported in the first ten months of this year.
An accompanying "winter action" campaign has also started as a move to put a stop to anyone who might want to take advantage of the traditional Chinese Spring Festival, during the Chinese new year, when many people go to visit family members elsewhere and less public spirited people are driven to use that time to commit crimes.
According to statistics, 12,435 criminal cases were handled in Beijing last year, 6,426 of which were major cases, resulting in arrests of 14,088 criminals, and 1,827 gangs being stopped.
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A white paper released by the State Council Press Office today says that, during the past year and more, China has taken many measures to strengthen the judicial guarantee for human rights.
China has revised the Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law, promulgated and enforced new laws such as the Lawyers' Law and the Law on Administrative Punishment to strengthen the judicial guarantee for human rights during that period of time, the paper says.
It has cracked down on serious criminal offenses in accordance with law, and earnestly guaranteed the people's human rights and safety of lives and property, it states.
In 1996, public security and judicial departments launched, according to law, a severe nationwide crack down on criminal offenses seriously endangering public security, such as homicides, robberies, rape, kidnapping and blackmail, and major theft, with emphasis placed on crimes involving the use of guns, crimes with gangster connections and characteristics, and crimes committed by rogue and vicious social forces, it says.
Statistics show that in 1996, courts throughout the country sentenced 322,382 criminal offenders who had seriously endangered public security by committing crimes of violence, crimes involving the use of guns, and gang-related crimes.
The severe crackdown on crimes has safeguarded social stability and the human rights of the people all over the country, and won the heartfelt support of the general public, the paper claims.
The paper notes that in March of 1997, China's Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress made amendments to the Criminal Law enacted in 1979.
The amended Criminal Law has 452 articles, an increase of 260 over the previous 192 articles.
The amended Criminal Law has further defined three basic principles, namely "conviction and penalty according to law," "equality of everyone before the law" and "punishment commensurate with the crime".
It stipulates: "there should be no conviction or penalty if an act is not explicitly defined as a criminal act by the law," "all criminal offenders are equal in applying laws," and that "the severity of penalty should be commensurate with the offender's crime and due criminal liabilities".
These three principles have further improved China's principle of rule of law, and are conducive to judicial fairness and to the protection of the legitimate rights of the litigants, the white paper states.
It points out that China has paid close attention to standardizing the practice of administrative and law-enforcement departments, so as to protect the citizens' legitimate rights from any infringement.
Following the promulgation and enforcement of the Administrative Procedure Law and the Law on State Compensation, in March of 1996, China promulgated the Law on Administrative Punishment, thus standardizing in terms of system the act of administrative punishment by the governments, the white paper says.
Meanwhile, the number of employees in the lawyers profession national exceeded 100,000 in 1996, who have become a major force in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, the white paper says.
HONG KONG (AP) _ A reputed Hong Kong crime boss who reportedly has admitted to participating in the kidnapping of two of the territory's wealthiest businessmen also claims he had plans to kidnap more, a newspaper said Friday.
The Chinese-language daily Ming Pao said that Cheung Tze-keung, whose alias is ``Big Spender,'' told a Chinese court that he was the only person who had the ability to kidnap a tycoon in Hong Kong.
The newspaper quoted Cheung as saying during his trial in China that ``had I not been arrested...
there would have been no way that any of Hong Kong's top 10 tycoons could be spared'' from the gang's kidnapping spree.
The trial of Cheung and 35 other defendants in Guangzhou, southern China, is closed to journalists, and Ming Pao did not say how it obtained its information.
Charges against the reputed gangsters center around the killing of a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robberies, smuggling explosives into Hong Kong, and the kidnapping of the two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 205 million) in ransom.
Prosecutors also accused the defendants of kidnapping a merchant from Fujian, China, for a 4 million Chinese yuan ransom (U.S.
dlrs 48,300).
Some media reports have said Cheung had already admitted to planning and participating in the kidnapping of Hong Kong property tycoon Li Ka-shing's son, Victor Li, and Walter Kwok, chairman of Sun Hung Kai Properties.
But the Hong Kong Standard reported Friday that Cheung was trying to pin the blame for masterminding the kidnapping of one businessman, identified only by the surname ``Li,'' on one of Cheung's purported henchmen, Chan Chi-ho.
Chan was described by the Standard as a professional criminal who got 290 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 37 million) in the tycoon's kidnapping.
The courthouse has remained ringed by tight security, reportedly out of concerns that the gang's illicit weapon suppliers might try to assassinate the defendants to silence them.
The South China Morning Post also quoted an unnamed prison source as saying Cheung and other defendants were fearful that some of Cheung's accomplices might try to poison them, so they were taking their meals from food that had been brought in for security officials.
Ming Pao said two bomb threats have been delivered since the trial began, with the second on Thursday allegedly signed by someone claiming to be a Cheung accomplice .
BEIJING (AP) _ Accusing foreign media of plotting to disrupt relations with Macau, a Chinese police chief has denied allegations his officers are linked to a wave of gang-related violence in the Portuguese enclave.
Chen Shaoji, chief of police in southern Guangdong province, said the foreign reports about reputed Macau crime boss Wan Kuok-koi sought to give the ``mistaken impression'' that his officers supported criminal gangs in Macau.
Chen said the reports ``sought to drench Guangdong police leaders in dirty water,'' the official Yangcheng Evening News reported in its Thursday edition.
Guangdong police are not allowed contacts with foreign crime mobs ``except for work requirements,'' the newspaper paraphrased Chen as saying.
Wan, also known as ``Broken Tooth'' Koi, was arrested in May after a bomb exploded beneath the car of Dr.
Antonio Marques Baptista, director of Macau's Judicial Police.
The bombing was part of a wave of violence in Macau, off Guangdong's southeast coast.
Three Macau government employees, including the No.
3 official in the gambling inspection agency, have been killed since March.
The violence is believed to be part of gang warfare over payoffs from Macau's legal casinos and has strained relations between Chinese and Portuguese officials preparing for China's takeover of the colony on Dec.
20, 1999.
Chen, the police chief, said that by blaming the Macau violence on Guangdong police, media reports about Koi were trying to ``create suspicions between Guangdong and Macau police, causing chaos,'' the newspaper said.
He did not say which media organizations made the reports.
``These people's plots will absolutely never prevail,'' Chen said.
BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The nationwide crackdown on crime launched by the Chinese police has made marked headway in the last few weeks, information provided by the police shows.
In North China's Shanxi Province more than 1,000 criminal gangs have been smashed, and 132 criminals were sentenced to death or life-term imprisonment at public rallies.
In Datong city, police arrested 12 drug smugglers and abusers, and seized a batch of guns and ammunition.
Police in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region crushed a major criminal gang engaged in producing and smuggling guns, seizing 49 such guns and more than 100 bullets.
On April 6 police in Xining in Qinghai Province rounded up a gang operating out of the railway station, arresting 11 of its members and seizing 12 guns.
On April 10 police in Chongqing City in Sichuan Province raided an underground gun factory, arresting four suspects and seizing 54 complete double-barrelled shotguns, 193 unfinished guns, 377 barrels, 259 butts and many tools for producing guns.
On April 12 police in Gucheng County, Hebei Province, seized 20 guns and a quantity of ammunition from two people on a long-distance bus.
The two were arrested and 19 more guns were found in their houses.
On April 13 police in Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, arrested five people and seized 26 guns and 545 bullets from them.
The crackdown on gun smuggling is a major part of the "anti-crime campaign" launched by the Chinese police.
"We have been very successful so far," said officials of the Crackdown Campaign Office at the Ministry of Public Security.
The campaign has also led to the solution of four major cases nationwide by the end of April, the officials said.
On April 17, after 54 hours of investigation, police in south China's Guangdong Province finally hunted down a bank robber who had killed four people and stolen 143,000 yuan, 80,000 Hong Kong dollars and 270,000 yuan-worth of bonds and securities.
The criminal, Liao Yanxiong, was executed Tuesday.
In Dafang County, Guizhou Province, in southwest China, the police finally caught two people suspected of being involved in 28 cases of robbery and sexual harassment targeted at girl students living alone in rented accommodation.
In Fuzhou City, capital of Fujian Province in east China, the police crushed a three-member gang responsible for 90 burglary and theft cases since June last year.
In Zhejiang Province, also in east China, the suspects in seven cases of robbery and murder were finally tracked down by the police of Ningbo City.
MACAU _ In a last act of justice before it turns this compact colony over to China, a Portuguese court here convicted a 45-year-old Chinese man on Tuesday of leading a powerful criminal organization that infiltrated Macau's casinos and terrorized its government.
The court found the man, Wan Kuok-koi, guilty of loan-sharking, money laundering and other charges stemming from his reign as the undisputed lord of the Macau underworld.
Declaring that Wan had shown no remorse, Justice Fernando Estrela sentenced him to the maximum term of 15 years in prison.
Seven of Wan's associates, including his brother, Wan Kuok-hung, received lesser sentences.
The trial of Wan Kuok-koi has mesmerized this Portuguese enclave on the southern coast of China in the twilight of its colonial rule.
For the Portuguese, it represented a last bit of housecleaning before it turns Macau over to the Chinese government on Dec.
19. For Macau's Chinese population, it represented perhaps the last chapter in the saga of the man known as Broken Tooth Koi.
``The Portuguese are doing this to show the world that they finally did something about organized crime,'' said Joao Severino, the editor of Macau Hoje, one of the few Portuguese-language newspapers left in the colony.
``But there will be big trouble every night after this''.
Previous convictions of organized crime leaders in Macau have led to ugly explosions of violence.
Tuesday, the authorities were taking no chances.
A police sharpshooter squinted from the roof of a building across the street from the courthouse.
Inside, security troops from Portugal, clad in bulletproof vests, ringed the austere courtroom as Estrela read the verdict in a matter-of-fact, almost subdued, tone.
As the guards surrounded Wan to lead him out of the court, he began hurling abuse at the judge, prosecutors, and the police in Chinese and Portuguese.
``You're corrupt, you've taken dirty money''!
Wan shrieked, jumping on a bench and gesticulating wildly.
Finally Wan subsided, and seeming close to tears, he was manacled by the guards and led away to begin his sentence in a high-security prison on a nearby island.
The Portuguese authorities have been anxious to see Wan sentenced ever since he was arrested on May 1, 1998, the same day that his gang allegedly planted a bomb under the car of Macau's police superintendent.
With his flamboyant style and theatrical boasting about his gangland exploits, Wan had symbolized Portugal's inability to stamp out organized crime in its last colonial redoubt.
The mayhem threatened to overshadow Macau's return to China, embarrassing Portuguese administrators and provoking clucks of disapproval from senior Chinese officials.
Local officials contend that the violence has been exaggerated by the Hong Kong news media and that the gangs originally came from Hong Kong and Guangdong Province in the Chinese mainland.
``The police here are fighting a very particular type of organized crime,'' said Jorge Rangel, Macau's secretary for public administration.
``It won't go away, just because of the handover''.
Still, many people believe the Chinese government will do a better job of snuffing out criminal activity, in part because it plans to station army troops in the territory.
Chinese courts have also dealt more harshly with suspected gang leaders than Portuguese courts.
Cheung Tze-keung, a Hong Kong crime boss known as Big Spender, was executed last December after being convicted of kidnapping and arms trafficking.
Although Wan's gang, called 14K, is suspected of drive-by shootings, car bombings and attempted assassinations of public officials, prosecutors tried him on less serious charges, which carried the maximum sentence of 15 years.
For his part, Wan contended he was a businessman and a high-roller who had no idea why he was on trial.
With his squat build, round face and loud tropical-print shirts, Wan looks like many of the weekend wagerers who jam Macau's down-at-the-heel casinos.
But he inspired deep fear among people here _ not least the prosecutors and judges whose job it was to go after him.
The first judge in the trial resigned, so the government drafted Estrela from Portugal.
Estrela, a tough disciplinarian, professed to be unfazed by the defendant's fearsome reputation.
Yet the judge, too, took unusual precautions during the monthlong case.
At lunchtime Tuesday, people in front of the court saw the judge dash to his waiting car flanked by armed bodyguards.
HONG KONG (AP) _ The Chinese death penalty handed down to a reputed Hong Kong crime boss violates terms of Britain's handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, according to a lawyer who said Friday he will seek international help to spare his client's life.
``I think they made a mistake,'' attorney Ivan Tang told Radio Hong Kong, a day after a mainland Chinese court delivered verdicts and sentences for Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender,'' and 35 members of his gang.
Tang said he would appeal on grounds that the mainland had no jurisdiction over Cheung's case since many of Cheung's alleged crimes _ including kidnappings of two Hong Kong tycoons _ were committed in Hong Kong.
Tang said the verdict was a violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration intended to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition to Chinese rule, so he also will complain to British officials and international rights groups.
Some say the case _ the first high-profile cross border trial since the handover last year _ has set a dangerous precedent and befuddled Hong Kong's legal experts and legislators.
Crimes committed in Hong Kong, where no death penalty is imposed, can now be prosecuted in mainland China, where the death penalty is widely used.
But many Hong Kong residents believe the end justified the means in the Cheung case, which was tried in Guangzhou, 100 miles (160 kms) north of the border.
``It's better to execute him in China rather than wasting the Hong Kong government's time and money,'' housewife Chan Lee Kit-ho was quoted as telling the South China Morning Post.
``His family should pay the Chinese government for the bullets to execute him,'' an import and export worker, Li Huamin, was quoted as telling the Post.
The official Chinese news agency Xinhua has reported that all proceedings were appropriate under Chinese law, noting that many of the alleged crimes were plotted in China and some were carried out there.
Cheung and his gang were all arrested in China, and half of the defendants were mainland residents.
Because Hong Kong is now part of China, international agreements on the transfer of criminal suspects do not cover such cross-border crimes _ even though the outcome of cases can been vastly different under the two legal systems.
Legislator James Toh of the major opposition Democratic Party said Friday the court's verdict did not reflect the Basic Law _ Hong Kong's post-handover constititution approved by China and Britain.
Toh predicted the verdicts would lower people's confidence in Hong Kong's independent legal system.
Tang said that because neither evidence against Cheung nor details of the court proceedings were made known in the territory, Hong Kong residents could face the possibility of arbitrary arrest and trial while in China.
HONG KONG (AP) _ A police chief of a southern Chinese city where a reputed Hong Kong crime boss is on trial has stepped up security following assassination threats by gang members, Hong Kong newspapers reported Saturday.
Gang members loyal to ``Big Spender'' Cheung Tze-keung have put a 4 million Hong Kong dollar (U.S.
dlrs 512,000 million) price tag for the death of Guangzhou police chief Zheng Guoqiang, the Hong Kong Standard said.
The assassination threat was said to have been made in a letter sent to Zheng, the Standard said, without identifying its source.
Cheung has been charged with kidnapping, armed robbery, and murder.
The trial, which also includes 35 other defendants, in Guangzhou 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the border, is closed to journalists.
Zheng has been personally leading a fleet of vehicles escorting the defendants from jail to the central Guangzhou city courthouse and back.
Charges center around the killing of a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robberies, smuggling explosives into Hong Kong, and the kidnapping of the two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 205 million) in ransom.
Prosecutors have also accused the defendants of kidnapping a merchant from Fujian, China, for a 4 million Chinese yuan ransom (U.S.
dlrs 48,300).
Regina Ip, Hong Kong's secretary for security, said on Saturday the government was unable to seek the extradition of Cheung _ a Hong Kong citizen _ for trial in the absence of any hard evidence, government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
Speaking after an anti-crime symposium, she said there had been no hard proof of crimes committed in the territory despite reports that two of Hong Kong's wealthiest businessmen had been kidnapped.
Security has been tight since Cheung's trial began Monday.
The courthouse has remained ringed by tight security, reportedly out of concerns that the gang's illicit weapon suppliers might try to assassinate the defendants to silence them.
News broadcasts Saturday showed the defendants being led out from several vehicles _ including armored personnel carriers _ their legs chained, escorted by soldiers in bulletproof vests carrying machine guns and pistols.
The news blackout has fueled various reports in Hong Kong's flamboyant media, riveted by one of the most dramatic gang trials in Hong Kong history.
On Friday, The South China Morning Post quoted an unidentified prison source as saying that Cheung and other defendants were afraid Cheung's accomplices might try to poison them.
They were only eating food brought in for security officials, the newspaper said.
Chinese-language Ming Pao Daily reported that two bomb threats have been delivered since the trial began.
Cheung reportedly has said that he masterminded the kidnapping of Hong Kong property tycoon Li Ka-shing's son, Victor Li, and Walter Kwok, chairman of Sun Hung Kai Properties.
Ming Pao quoted Cheung as saying.
``There would have been no way that any of Hong Kong's top 10 tycoons could be spared'' from the gang's kidnapping spree, had he not been arrested.
GUANGZHOU, China _ On a back street in this mangy city, where thick steam bubbles off woks at outdoor food stalls and mah-jongg tiles can be heard clacking late into the evening, a gang of Hong Kong mobsters often met in a well-guarded house to plot their most lucrative capers.
The gang got its start years ago by robbing jewelry stores in Hong Kong, then retreating across the Chinese border to hide here because the local police were either too inept or corrupt to care.
The gang's most spectacular crime came in 1996, police now say, by kidnapping the son of one of Hong Kong's richest businessmen and getting away with a staggering $125 million in ransom.
The gang's leader, known as ``Big Spender'' for his habit of dropping a million dollars a shot at a favorite casino in the nearby Portuguese colony of Macau, seemed to typify the excesses of organized crime that flourished in southern China in step with an economic boom in the 1990s.
Big Spender, whose real name is Cheung Tze-keung, may have been the most wanted man in Hong Kong, but in this part of China he became a folk hero for his apparent invincibility.
Last week, after a series of brazen robberies, murders and kidnappings, Cheung's gang was officially pronounced dead.
China's national police seized 32 people they described as his accomplices.
They also seized nearly $5 million in cash, 11 luxury cars and a cache of explosives and firearms.
Cheung was not only in custody, police said, but had confessed to the gang's role in murder, robbery, kidnapping and smuggling explosives.
What Cheung actually said, and how he pleads, will probably remain as secret as other case files in China.
The gang's downfall is the latest chapter in the curious evolution of lawlessness that straddles the border between Hong Kong and Guangdong province, an area with a rich history of secret societies, pirates and criminal intrigue.
Perhaps it is a sign that Asia's mounting economic woes are hurting criminals, too.
More likely, it is a kind of poetic justice for a singularly talented gangster and his crew, who had a remarkably long run before getting caught.
For years, Cheung took advantage of the wide cracks that exist between distinctly separate law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong and Guangdong, which have long mistrusted each other's methods and principles.
Bouncing back and forth over the border as it suited him, Cheung was able to capitalize on the poor communication between police on each side.
Even since Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule last year, cooperation between the police forces has been limited.
Now, however, the tables have turned on Cheung.
This time he is likely to fare worse from the cross-border confusion, not better.
Ordinarily, Hong Kong police ask for the return of a Hong Kong citizen who commits crimes in Hong Kong but is arrested in Guangdong.
But this time, Hong Kong police have raised no objection to seeing Cheung's case handled in Guangdong, where being charged is a virtual guarantee of being found guilty and where the penalty for any serious violent crime is usually a swift execution.
Were Cheung to be tried in Hong Kong, he would have at least have a chance at acquittal, a trick he pulled off once before on an armed robbery charge.
Zhang Xingfeng, director of the criminal investigation bureau of Beijing's Ministry of Public Security, said Cheung's major crimes were planned in Guangzhou, so his case will be handled by the Guangdong provincial authorities.
Many of the plans were made, Zhang said, in one of 50 properties owned by Cheung and his gang.
In addition to murder and kidnapping, Zhang also said, the gang had smuggled more than 1,500 pounds of explosives from Guangdong into Hong Kong.
Of the gang members, 18 were Hong Kong residents and 14 were from mainland China, Zhang said.
Just over half were arrested here on July 22; the rest were apprehended on July 29.
``All of the arrests were made in the mainland after six months of investigations carried out with the support and cooperation of the Hong Kong police,'' Zhang said at a news conference in Beijing.
Yet Cheung himself was actually apprehended in January, after a tip from an informer led police into a long cat-and-mouse chase that ended in Jiangmen, a city south of here, where Cheung was caught trying to escape in a taxi cab.
Hardly the image of the hard-nosed, tough-jawed outlaw that dominates a popular genre of Hong Kong gangster movies, Cheung is a slight man with a gently protruding forehead.
Apparently enjoying the image of fancy cars and fast women that comes with his territory, Cheung reveled in his aura of invincibility in 1995, when Hong Kong's High Court acquitted him on a technicality from an earlier conviction for armed robbery of an armored truck at Kai Tak Airport.
He had served 18 months in prison, apparently leaving him with such serious grievances against the prison authorities that his gang was suspected when a bulldozer suddenly demolished a prison guard house one night.
The next month, the home of Hong Kong's secretary for security was fire-bombed.
Hong Kong newspapers also reported that Cheung was behind a bizarre plan to kidnap Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary, as a way to win the release of a fellow gangster, Yip Kai-foon.
The plan was apparently foiled.
Of all the gang's crimes, the most astonishing one was undoubtedly the kidnapping of Victor Li, the son of Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's most powerful businessman, in May 1996.
Apparently fearful of more kidnapping attempts, neither father nor son has ever spoken publicly about the kidnapping.
Yet Hong Kong media have reported that the Li family paid a ransom of one billion Hong Kong dollars, worth $125 million, without telling the Hong Kong police.
Chinese police confirmed Cheung's role in the kidnapping and the $125 million extortion.
Police also argued that the crime was planned in Guangzhou, justifying a prosecution here, even though it was carried out in Hong Kong.
Cheung, as the kidnapping's mastermind, awarded himself 40 percent of the take, or roughly $50 million, and split the other $75 million among nine associates, a Hong Kong newspaper reported In a second high-profile kidnapping in September 1997, Cheung took half of the $80 million extorted from the family of another property tycoon, Walter Kwok of Sun Hung Kai Properties.
Chinese accounts of Cheung's downfall suggested that it grew out of the cooperation of a gang member.
The Hong Kong media have also reported that some Hong Kong property tycoons had quietly expressed their concern about the danger of kidnapping in Hong Kong by cross-border gangs to China's President, Jiang Zemin.
Whether Cheung's arrest came about by pressure on the police from Jiang, by a rare case of successful cooperation between Guangdong and Hong Kong police, or simply by a lucky break, may never become public.
But Big Spender's days are over.
MACAU (AP) _ Bombs blamed on gangsters exploded Tuesday in the violence-rocked Portuguese enclave of Macau, wounding four senior police officers and 10 journalists, authorities said.
The bomb blasts were the worst in recent years, and were the first to involve journalists, indicating gang members may want to punish reporters covering their criminal activities.
Witnesses said a police officer's car exploded first.
When police and journalists gathered at the scene, a home-made bomb apparently hidden in a motorcycle parked nearby exploded and injured the crowd at around 2 a.m.
TV footage showed bloodied journalists and police screaming for help and running for cover in a small alley, fearing another explosion.
Police said the second bomb was believed to have been set off by remote control.
The four injured police officers and eight journalists remained hospitalized in stable condition Tuesday.
Police said the injured officers were members of the judiciary and security units.
Another car was set ablaze 30 minutes after the explosions.
But police said the two incidents were probably not related.
The explosions were the latest in a recent spate of gangland-style shooting deaths, arson and other attacks _ many targeting government officials _ which have shaken the enclave.
Undersecretary for Security Brig.
Manuel Monge described the explosions as an ``act of intimidation'' by gang members, and said Macau's police would ``double their work in defense of the population and the territory's stability''.
Police also said the explosions may have been gang-related, but the motive was not yet known.
They said they were searching for two men, both aged 30.
In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao urged Macau to take tougher acts against crime lest the violence jeopardize the Portuguese colony's smooth return to Beijing next year.
``We hope the Portuguese government in Macau will conscientiously shoulder their responsibility there and take further, effective measures to recover sound public security,'' Zhu said.
Officials at China's Xinhua news agency in Macau also expressed shock and anger.
The Macau Journalists' Union issued a strong statement criticizing the violence, saying it was intended to injure the police and seriously damaged Macau's image.
Police have said they believe the recent spate of violence is linked to gang wars over gambling profits that have been shrinking because of Asia's economic slump.
Three government officials, including a gambling inspector, have been killed since March.
Macau, 40 miles (70 kilometers) west of Hong Kong, is a popular tourist and gambling enclave at the tip of south China.
The enclave, which has a population of about 450,000, will revert to Chinese rule in December 1999.

MACAU'S Judicial Police on Sunday announced the arrest of three alleged 14K triad members, among them two women said to be ``very close'' to the gang's detained reputed leader, Wan Kuok-koi.
The three were identified as Wong Tat-hou, an alleged gang leader; Wong Wan-wa, who is widely known by her Cantonese nickname Fei Mui or Fat Woman; and Lam Iok-im, who is known by her nickname Dai Ka Che or Big Sister.
Macau's district court yesterday ordered the pre-trial detention of the two women on preliminary charges of criminal association.
Both women were taken under police guard from the district court building on the peninsula to the central prison on Coloane island.
A police source said Wong Tat-hou was facing possible charges of organised crime membership, casino loansharking and blackmail.
Wong is scheduled to appear in court on Monday.
A source recalled that police last year found a huge amount of cigarettes smuggled from the mainland in a house on Coloane island owned by Wong Tat-hou.
On Saturday the police arrested an illegal Chinese immigrant surnamed Ho, suspected of kidnapping and extortion allegedly committed between 1995 and 1996, and a Thai national working as a bouncer in the Heavy Club discotheque, which is reportedly owned by Wan.
The Thai national, whose name was not released by police, allegedly carried an explosive device at the time of his arrest.
Wan has been in pre-trial detention at Coloane prison since 4 May by order of the district court.
He was arrested on 1 May, several hours after a bomb destroyed the car of Judicial Police Director Antonio Marques Baptista.
But Wan has been charged only with being a triad member, not with the bomb attack on the police chief's car.
As part of a major crackdown on organised crime, Macau has set up a special taskforce within the public prosecutor's office and hired half a dozen criminologists from Lisbon.
During a visit to Lisbon last month, Macau's governor, general Vasco Rocha Vieira, called on China to be ``more rigorous'' in controlling its borders with Macau.
China has pledged it will increase its anti-crime cross-border co-operation with Macau in the run-up to the enclave's reversion to Chinese administration in December next year.
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police have solved a significant number of cases involving major criminal offenses, since the start of a nationwide anti-crime campaign on April 28.
These included apprehending six people who were on the Public Security Ministry's most-wanted list, arresting some escaped criminals, and confiscating a large number of illegal firearms.
In other developments, police in east China's Fujian Province have cracked a kidnapping case that involved a Chinese-American gang and one from Hong Kong, and a total of 1.3 million yuan (some 160,000 U.S. dollars).
Police in Guangdong and Yunnan provinces joined hands in work on a drug smuggling case that involved a total of 600 kg of heroin.
Thirty-nine drug traffickers were arrested and ten vehicles used to ferry the drugs were seized.
In central China's Hunan Province, an eight-member gang of thieves who were connected with 141 thefts involving 370,000 yuan-worth of stolen articles, has been put out.
Police in northeast China's Liaoning Province arrested a person who had killed and wounded three victims and been at large for ten years.
Attempts to stop the manufacture and sale of firearms have been increased because of the obvious harm to society.
In east and northeast China's Shandong, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang provinces, more than 8,000 illegal firearms have been confiscated in each of the provinces, and the numbers for Hebei, Hubei and Shanxi provinces are more than 3,000 each.
A number of criminals have voluntarily surrendered to police as well.
Over 600 escapees had given themselves up in central China's Henan Province, by May 6, and the number for Hunan Province stood at 490.
A senior police official attributes these achievements in the nationwide crackdown on major crimes to the positive attitude and participation of ordinary citizens everywhere.
Over the past two weeks, 80 percent of the criminal cases cracked in east China's Shandong Province, in fact, were the result of tips provided by citizens, and 45 percent of the criminal arrests came about because of help from the people.
A high-ranking official pointed out recently that government at all levels should take this opportunity to improve rules and regulations, management, and precautionary measures in order to make the social order much better.
VIENNA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China is backing the strengthening of international cooperation in fighting crime involving firearms, especially transnational firearms smuggling.
The point was made today by Li Changhe, the deputy representative of the Chinese delegation, at the sixth session of the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice.
Li briefed the session on how China had tightened up the management of firearms, and the laws involved.
He said China attached great importance to public security and personal safety.
It had adopted resolute measures to fight the illegal manufacturing and smuggling of firearms.
Li, China's Representative to the U.N.
Office in Vienna, proposed that concerned U.N. agencies hold expert meetings to find measures of coping with all types of crimes.
He called on the international community to exchange information and coordinate their actions in handling cases and to step up efforts in fighting crimes involving firearms.
HONG KONG (AP) _ Law enforcement officers staged about two dozen raids and arrested 15 people for alleged money laundering in connection with a cross-border gang, police said Wednesday.
The arrests are the latest in a series by Chinese and Hong Kong police to crack down on criminal activities related to 43-year-old Hong Kong gang boss Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender''.
Hong Kong police were alerted when an unidentified man approached them saying his cousin _ who had sneaked into Hong Kong from China _ was being held for ransom by the gang, Radio Hong Kong said.
The report quoted Chief Inspector Lam Nam-wing as saying 85 officers were mobilized early Wednesday to search 23 addresses and two safety deposit boxes.
Among those arrested by the Organized Crime Bureau of the Hong Kong police was Cheung's wife, who was in one of the houses raided, Television Broadcast reported.
Last month, Cheung and 31 members of his gang were arrested in China on charges of kidnapping, murder, and armed robbery.
The gang allegedly kidnapped two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 205 million) in ransom.
Hong Kong police also issued restraint orders against the assets of 17 relatives of Cheung.
More than 160 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 20.5 million) in property, bank accounts, and vehicles are restrained under the order.
Police on Wednesday arrested four men and 11 women between the ages of 34 and 80 and seized valuable watches, jewelry and about 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 25,740) during the raids.
The 15 arrested by Hong Kong police _ some of them illegal immigrants _ are still being detained for questioning.
Although no official information was ever released on the kidnapping, Hong Kong papers said they were believed to be tycoons from two of Hong Kong's wealthiest property development companies.
Chinese police also charged gangsters with murdering a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robbery at seven gold shops and smuggling explosives into Hong Kong.
In late July, police seized about 40 million yuan (U.S.
dlrs 4.8 million) in cash, 11 vehicles, 50 properties worth 40 million yuan (U.S.
dlrs 4.8 million), guns and explosives, according to Chinese state media.
VIENNA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China today put forward proposals for organized transnational crime and international exchange and cooperation to be included in the priorities of a U.N. anti-crime commission.
Zhang Fusen, head of the Chinese delegation, told the fifth session of the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) that China will participate in United Nations activities in crime prevention and criminal justice.
The 10-day meeting has been called to assess and redefine the priorities of the CCPCJ.
Zhang, the Chinese vice minister of justice, also proposed that drug trafficking, juvenile delinquency and economic crime should be included in CCPCJ's priorities.
He said that in a bid to strengthen judicial administration, China has over the last few years passed new laws on the police, prosecutors, judges, prisons and lawyers.
FOSHAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Members of a criminal gang in Foshan City of south China's Guangdong Province, which was controlled by a larger and more notorious gang in neighboring Macao, have been apprehended by local police.
Police arrested 28 people who have been involved in more than 30 cases of blackmail, gambling, illegal use of guns and other crimes.
The gambling cases involved more than 50 million yuan ( about six million U.S. dollars) of illicit money.
Police also seized a number of guns and ammunition, including eight military pistols.
The gang was established by Zeng Qiqiang in 1996, as a branch of the "Shuifang Bang," a large criminal gang in Macao.
The gang in Foshan, with more than 100 members, used to help the "Shuifang Bang" run its gambling operations and collect money from people by force.
To date, the provincial public security department of Guangdong and the local police in Foshan have completely uprooted the gang which seriously threatened the security of Foshan and Macao.
The recent internal shake-up inside judiciaries and their efforts to ensure justice have also been fruitful, and have won applause from the public, Cao said.
However, the present security situation is still "rather serious," legislators said.
They said criminal rates are rising; the problems of murder, robbery, explosion, thefts are prominent; prostitution, gambling and drug-related social vices persist despite repeated police raids; gang crimes, juvenile delinquency, and felonies perpetrated by migrants are sharply increasing.
Chinese police have intensified their fights against criminal gangs and smashed many since 1996, but the public have reported that such gangs are still spreading in number and influence, they said.
According to statistics, 60 percent of suspected criminals landing in the hands of police are now minors.
Inspection teams also proposed several solutions for the worsening situation.
They are: -- The "Strike-Hard" drive must continue to curb the rising crime rates; -- The community-level security network must be spread and instituted all across the country, because surveys have found those places with poor security are also lax in enforcing this system; -- And, most importantly, leaders at all levels must first realize the present situation and never slacken their work of comprehensive management of public security.
NEW YORK (AP) -- It's quite a scientific expedition -- testing birds up and down the East Coast to track the encephalitis virus that has killed five people and infected 38 others in the New York City area.
``We've got to look at all kinds of urban birds -- crows, pigeons, starlings and sparrows,'' said Andrew Spielman, an expert on mosquito-borne diseases at the Harvard School of Public Health.
The West Nile strain of the virus has been found in dead crows in the New York area.
The U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now collecting blood samples from city pigeons and also looking at ticks as possible carriers.
In New York's Queens borough, where the first cases of encephalitis were reported last month, the CDC and the city's health department planned to take blood samples door-to-door, with 300 households selected at random and on a voluntary basis.
``We hope to get a better understanding of the symptoms caused by West Nile virus, as well as possible risk factors for infection,'' said Ned Hayes, the CDC's medical epidemiologist.
Fearing the infection might spread with the fall bird migration, experts also are testing dead birds from Maryland to Florida.
No sign of the virus has appeared in those birds, said Roger Nasci, a CDC entomologist.
The virus is believed to have been transmitted by mosquitoes that typically feed off birds.
Six new cases were confirmed Wednesday, including a 79-year-old woman from the borough of Queens who died Sept.
11. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have been spraying pesticides to kill as many mosquitoes as possible before the first winter chills.
Dr. Neal Cohen, the city's health commissioner, said mosquito density has declined substantially, probably by 90 or 95 percent since the second citywide spraying a few weeks ago.
The encephalitis cases found in New York originally were blamed on the St.
Louis strain.
But late last month, some dead crows were spotted near the Bronx Zoo.
Subsequently, 20 zoo birds died and tested positive for the African strain, said zoo spokeswoman Linda Corcoran.
The West Nile virus -- never before recorded in the Western Hemisphere -- probably entered the United States in infected birds.
Symptoms of the strain -- fever and headache -- are similar to those of the St.
Louis strain but generally are milder.
In rare cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders and death.
The elderly, young and those with weakened immune systems are most vulnerable.
WARWICK, R.I.
(AP) -- Environmental officials announced plans Monday to spray insecticide in a two-mile radius where researchers found a dead crow with West Nile virus, the first time the virus was detected in Rhode Island.
Four trucks will spray more than 200 miles of streets in Warwick and Cranston starting Tuesday night at the earliest.
State environmental officials said they expected to find the virus in Rhode Island because it already has been detected in Connecticut and Massachusetts.
It has also been found this year in New Jersey.
No one in Rhode Island has been infected.
Three New York City residents contracted the illness this summer and have been recovering.
The virus is commonly carried by bloodsucking mosquitoes, which transmit the virus through bites.
Infection may result in encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, an inflammation of the brain's lining and the spinal cord.
Last summer, during the first known appearance of the West Nile virus in the Western Hemisphere, seven people died and 62 others were infected in the New York metropolitan area.

TRENTON, N.J.
(AP) -- Four dead crows found in New Jersey tested positive for the West Nile-like virus believed responsible for the deaths of at least five people in the New York City metropolitan area.
The state health department said Monday this is the first time the virus has been identified in New Jersey.
The crows were found in Bergen, Essex, Middlesex and Union counties in the northern part of the state.
The virus is believed to be transmitted by mosquitoes that bit infected birds.
New York City, Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut have been spraying pesticides to kill as many mosquitoes as possible before the first winter chills.
Scientists are also concerned the virus will move south as birds migrate this fall.
There have been five confirmed deaths and several dozen cases of infection in the New York City area.
New Jersey Health Commissioner Christine Grant said residents should take precautions against mosquito bites but should not be ``unduly concerned'' by the test results.
There have been no reports of New Jersey residents being infected with the virus.
``We have no reason to think that in fact we will see cases in New Jersey residents,'' Grant said.
``Diseases like this can have a hot spot, a fairly localized outbreak''.
The U.S.
Centers for Disease and Control Prevention have classified the ailment as a West Nile-like fever, a virus never before seen in the Western Hemisphere.
It is called West Nile-''like'' because scientists have not yet identified it with certainty.
Health officials initially thought the virus was the more dangerous St.
Louis encephalitis.
Symptoms of both -- fever and headache -- are similar, but are generally milder with the West Nile virus.
In rare cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders and death.
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.
_ As the season for encephalitis approaches, Florida public health workers are setting up surveillance for the mosquito-borne West Nile encephalitis virus.
The Palm Beach County Health Department will begin drawing blood biweekly from ``sentinel'' chickens on May 22 and ship it to a state laboratory for testing, said Jack Petenbrink, who coordinates the county program.
Chickens are used to monitor the prevalence of encephalitis viruses because the mosquitoes that spread them feed on birds.
Scientists will examine the blood for signs of the viruses that cause St.
Louis, Eastern Equine and West Nile encephalitis _ which often cause headache and fatigue, and in rare cases, coma and death.
St. Louis encephalitis affects people.
The Eastern Equine variety usually sickens horses, but occasionally occurs in other animals, such as emus, and people, Petenbrink said.
West Nile virus can affect people, horses and birds.
This year will be the first season county health workers routinely test chicken blood for West Nile virus, he said.
That's because West Nile virus had not been reported in the United States until August; in the late summer and fall, 61 cases of severe infection and seven deaths were reported in the New York area, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
Health officials have been concerned that infected birds might spread the West Nile virus if they migrated from New York.
In October, an infected bird was found in Maryland.
``We don't have any indication it's reached Florida yet,'' Petenbrink said.
The West Nile virus has killed crows, some sparrows and predatory birds such as hawks and eagles.
People get infected most commonly through mosquito bites.
After a mosquito bites a bird, the virus moves into the bug's salivary glands, where it stays until the mosquito bites again.
So far, the West Nile virus has had only one impact on the county: The U.S.
Equestrian Team is moving trials to pick the Olympic dressage team from New Jersey to nearby Loxahatchee.
Organizers feared a repeat of last year, when the European Union closed its borders to horses from the Northeast, where at least nine infected horses died.
Florida typically has very few cases of St.
Louis encephalitis.
But cases can number in the hundreds during an outbreak.
In 1990, 223 cases and 13 deaths were reported.
A 1997 outbreak resulted in nine cases with one death.

NEW YORK _ The number of birds and mosquitoes testing positive for West Nile virus in New York state is accelerating rapidly, state health officials reported on Wednesday, a finding that is inspiring yet more pesticide spraying in New York City, on Long Island and in other areas.
As of the end of July, the state had confirmed 67 infected birds and 25 samples of mosquitoes that were carrying the virus.
But in just the last two days, those totals jumped to 115 birds and 38 samples of mosquitoes, state officials said.
No human cases have been reported so far this year as a result of the mosquito-borne virus.
Last year, seven people in the New York region died and 55 became seriously ill from West Nile virus.
In New Jersey, the virus had been confirmed in 15 birds as of July 31, and in Connecticut, it was confirmed in one bird in Stamford on Monday, as in mosquitoes there earlier.
And in Massachusetts, officials last week reported their first infected bird.
Within New York state, the reach of the virus has also grown in the last week, with a report for the first time this year that infected birds had been found far from New York City, in Ulster County and in the village of Liverpool, near Syracuse.
The most intense evidence of the virus continues to surface in the New York City area, especially on Staten Island.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced on Wednesday that health officials had confirmed 15 additional infected birds, two in Manhattan and 13 on Staten Island.
This means that as of Wednesday, the total number of infected birds found this year in New York City had doubled to 32.
The mayor announced said the the city would expand its pesticide campaign.
Given the finding of the infected bird in Central Park and growing signs of resurgent mosquito populations there and in Alley Pond Park in Queens, Giuliani also announced that the city would respray the two parks, both of which were treated with pesticides late last month.
Dr. Neal L.
Cohen said that city officials were working intensely to try to ensure that any human cases were identified.
To date, the city has ruled out 160 possible cases while it awaits test results from some 40 people with West Nile-like symptoms.
``We are very, very actively looking,'' Dr.
Cohen said.
West Nile-related pesticide spraying has also taken place, or is scheduled, in Liverpool and in Suffolk County, on eastern Long Island, where officials reported on Wednesday that the virus had been confirmed in 13 samples of infected mosquitoes collected on July 17 and in 12 additional birds.
In Suffolk, the infected mosquitoes appear to be concentrated in Belmont Lake State Park in Babylon, which was sprayed with pesticides the day after the infected mosquitoes were collected.
John R.
Bianchi, a spokesman for the National Audubon Society, said he thought pesticide spraying had been excessive.
The spraying might present a risk to humans and wildlife, he said.
City officials have offered assurances that the treatments are safe.
A mother confines her toddler indoors to avoid the West Nile virus, often running with the child up and down the stairs to release energy.
If they venture out, they dart from the door to the car.
Is this logical?
An American is 50 times more likely to die in an accidental fall, such as while on stairs, than to be killed by the West Nile virus.
A person is also about 150 times more likely to be killed in a motor vehicle accident, according to statistics.
Based on current information on casualties, the odds of an American dying of this summer's most-dreaded virus are roughly 1 in a million, the statistical cutoff point for saying something has almost no risk at all.
Yet, these odds do not prompt a casual attitude from this Brookline, Mass.
mother who has extra reason for concern: She found a dead crow on her own driveway near Coolidge Corner, later found to be infected with the West Nile virus, and learned this week that infected mosquitoes are on her street.
``The West Nile virus is so new,'' said Cindy Leung Yue, 34.
``Anything new makes you worried''.
The West Nile virus has triggered a psychological reaction all its own, tapping into some of our most primitive fears.
High doses of statistics don't seem to stop the fear epidemic.
This virus scares not just because it's exotic and new, but because many feel so helpless to fight it.
Psychologists say people often worry less about risks when they undertake them voluntarily, such as smoking, driving, sun-bathing, or bungee-jumping.
They hate risk imposed on them, feeling like a helpless walking target for the ubiquitous mosquito, which can now give us a bad infection, not just a bad itch.
``What do people get most scared of?
They don't like things outside their individual control,'' said Sheldon Krimsky, a Tufts University professor of urban and environmental policy.
``That's why people are often more worried about being a passenger in an airplane than driving a car''.
He added that people also have an exaggerated fear reaction to cluster deaths related to some kind of new event.
It may be widely known that heart disease is the leading cause of death among Americans, but the here-and-there reports of those deaths don't pack the kind of emotional power that the West Nile virus does.
Yet, psychologists and scientists say it's a mistake for the public to focus on one extreme risk while ignoring more serious ones.
It's what some psychologists like to call misallocation of a person's ``worry budget,'' like the smoker who is afraid of flying or the sunbather who eats only organic produce.
In the list of health precautions, quitting smoking, exercising, eating a low-fat diet, and regularly washing one's hands to avoid transmitting infectious diseases would far more likely lengthen one's life than extra mosquito repellent to avoid the West Nile virus.
There's also the ongoing controversy about whether pesticide spraying may do more long-term harm to humans _ as well as create resistant mosquitoes _ than the West Nile virus.
The virus produces mild flu symptoms in the overwhelming majority of people and has been fatal in rare cases among the elderly.
Public health specialists note that more people appear to worry about the West Nile virus than the winter flu.
While the West Nile virus killed seven people last year _ all of them New York City residents over the age of 65 _ the influenza virus killed about 1,700 people nationwide in 1998.
The flu also is most fatal to the very old, very young, and those with compromised immune systems.
``Our reaction to the West Nile virus is clearly based more on emotion than fact,'' said David Ropeik, director of risk communication at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis.
``It's out of proportion to the actual risk''.
Furthermore, the New York City health department's fact sheets say that, in infected areas, only 1 percent of the mosquitoes actually carried the virus.
Ignoring huge odds against acquiring a rare disease is similar to the public's rationale for playing the lottery, which can carry an even greater improbability for winning.
Despite the minuscule chances, people simply reason: Someone has to win (get infected) and it could be me.
Not everyone is so emotional about the West Nile virus.
Many say they can't understand all the media attention, government resources and public hysteria.
``Maybe the race for president is so boring that people are concentrating on the West Nile,'' said Shai Inbar, a retired biomedical researcher who now works in the computer industry.
``It's more interesting than Al Gore and George Bush''.
But, as with the devil, some people say the virus they know is better than the virus they don't know.
``It's the unknown,'' said Louisa Bertman, a mother of a 7-month-old girl, who has stopped taking long outdoor walks.
``And I worry it's only going to get worse and worse''.
Specialists who study risk perceptions say the alien origins of this virus _ it was isolated first in 1937 in the West Nile region of Uganda _ enhances its scariness.
It's a reminder that the boundaries of our country aren't safe from new invading diseases, particularly in this mobile and diverse society, said Donald MacGregor of Decision Research, a nonprofit firm in Eugene, Ore.
, that studies risk perceptions in health and environmental issues.
``The AIDS virus made us aware of these exotic diseases in other parts of the world,'' MacGregor said.
``The West Nile virus raises yet another signal that there's new hazards coming to us that we don't understand''.
He said our more reasonable approach to the West Nile virus will come only after we have experience surviving it over time.
He said that explains why people don't fear the flu too much.
``We've lived through many flu seasons,'' he said.
``We believe we know how to control it and what to do if we get it''.
Steve Pinker, a psychology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said people find it difficult to ignore the threat of blood-sucking insects that deposit illness beneath our skin, regardless of statistical odds.
Through evolution, he said, such trading of vile fluids has ``given us the willies''.
Pinker, author of a best-selling book, ``How the Mind Works,'' said it is understandable that humans will always have an alarmist reaction to any new threat, and raw facts won't temper anxiety until there's more emotional experience with it.
Even if you hear that the chance of the West Nile virus killing you is 1 in one million, he said, ``the mind has trouble with risks associated with that many zeros''.
Another reason the West Nile virus is particularly threatening is that its victims are random and get no ``perceived benefit,'' said Scott Geller, a psychology professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute who studies risk perceptions.
As Geller explains it, people often have a psychological need to believe that the misfortune afflicting another person is somehow deserved.
Uncharitable as this sounds, it's part of a common belief that those who get hurt must have sought too much pleasure, he said.
For instance, a motorist died in an accident because he was driving too fast to get to a party, or a boater died because he dared to make the outing in bad weather.
Geller calls it the ``Just World'' hyphothesis, in which people believe bad things happen for a reason.
Consequently, when a deadly virus strikes randomly, with mosquitoes passing infection to a passive and unknowing recipient, it threatens people's ability to rationalize misfortune.
``When something looks random like that, people worry that even the good guys can get it,'' Geller said.
Whatever the reason, some local residents say they can't help but have a heightened reaction to the West Nile virus _ including lost sleep.
Architect James Batchelor, who also lives on the Brookline street where infected mosquitoes were found, woke up at 4 a.m. one recent day to the sound of a buzzing mosquito in his ear.
While he turned on the light and smacked the bug, he lay awake wondering if he was the conqueror _ or conquered.
Said Batchelor: ``I kept thinking, `What if the mosquito already bit me'? ''
The crow was just lying there.
Its eyes were open.
It was breathing.
But there was no movement in its greasy black wings.
Park ranger Jennifer Grant walked up to it cautiously.
She stamped her foot.
The crow struggled to its feet, unfurling its wings to fly.
Instead, it keeled over, falling back into the dirt next to Willow Pond in Boston's Jamaica Plain section, its wings quivering.
Grant put on plastic gloves and scooped the ailing bird into a cardboard box.
``Ever since last summer, we were told to keep an eye out for that sort of thing,'' she said.
Last summer an outbreak of the West Nile virus killed seven people in Queens, N.Y., and sickened more than 60 others.
Hundreds of crows died as well.
Every park ranger and public health specialist on the East Coast has been on alert since.
On July 22, Grant trucked specimen No.
ZL00036 to a laboratory, unaware she had stumbled onto the first sign the virus had come to Massachusetts.
Another virus-positive crow found in Hopkinton, Mass.
was later identified.
But no people have been reported infected.
The encephalitis virus usually produces flu-like symptoms but occasionally causes quick and fatal brain inflammation, especially in the elderly.
It is spread to people by mosquitoes.
The virus has turned up in mosquitoes in several New York counties and in Stamford, Conn.
About 40 infected crows were found in the New York City region.
Officials from Maine to Miami are frantically testing birds, mammals, and mosquitoes for signs of the virus.
Boston health officials are certain that mosquitoes here are carriers.
They just don't know how many.
But they do know this: the local population of the Culex pipiens mosquito, the primary carrier of West Nile virus, is in the midst of its annual explosion.
It is also the time when people maximize their time outdoors.
If there are human infections, they will probably turn up in the next few weeks.
The Queens outbreak occurred in late August.
But West Nile could also be a blip.
Either way, scientists are watching.
West Nile has been something of a wayward virus.
It first appeared in Uganda, on the western bank of the Nile River, in 1937 and has since popped up here and there in Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia.
But 1999 was different.
That year the virus sickened 1,000 and killed at least 40 on the Volga Delta in southern Russia, in a little-reported outbreak.
It also killed an elderly couple and hundreds of geese in Israel.
That puzzled scientists: The virus had never been so fatal to birds.
Then it made its jump to the Western Hemisphere _ Queens.
The genetic fingerprint of that strain was almost identical to the one in Israel.
Researchers theorized how the virus might have made its move: an infected Israeli airline passenger?
An infected bird blown across the Atlantic?
They still don't know.
And they are unsure of the deadliness of the American strain.
At an international meeting of infectious disease researchers in Atlanta two weeks ago, there seemed to be a consensus.
``Something has happened to this virus,'' said Sharone Green, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School who attended.
``I think we're seeing a new virus, but we're not sure exactly how it has changed''.
Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's West Nile specialists, said: ``The fact is West Nile does kill.
We're looking and watching it closely to see if it's more virulent than we see in other parts of the world''.
Amid the curiosity and excitement, scientists are realizing that the virus will probably be a feature of Eastern Seaboard summers for decades to come.
``We should get used to this,'' said Andrew Spielman, a professor of tropical public health at the Harvard School of Public Health.
&QL; ------ &QC; &QL; Ralph Timperi was used to examining sick birds by last Monday when specimen No.
ZL00036 landed in his lab in Boston.
It was his 42d sick animal since June 1.
His eight-person crew peeled back the dead crow's scalp and extracted brain tissue.
They treated the sample with different enzymes, chemicals, and dyes to read its genetic fingerprint.
They had a CDC sample of West Nile virus to compare with it.
The mixture formed a gel and an electric current was run through it.
Then it was injected with an ethidium bromide stain.
The team of researchers watched the stained crow brain sample form into white bands on the black sample of gel.
When they saw the results, the researchers ran downstairs to their boss's office.
``I ran up to the lab to take a look at the photo they'd taken of the sample,'' said Timperi.
He saw the tell-tale white stripes on the gel dish and turned to his staff: ``Let's get moving''.
There were more tests to be done to confirm West Nile but Timperi was sure _ even though the CDC would soon dispute him _ that he had found the virus.
He started a chain of phone calls on Tuesday that ended at the residence of Boston Mayor Thomas M.
Menino. But the series of events that brought the virus here is far murkier.
Scientists agree that the Queens outbreak was the virus's entry into the United States but are unsure how it got from Queens to Boston and from the Eastern to the Western Hemisphere.
The West Nile virus found in Queens is genetically very similar to the strain that turned up in Israel.
There it killed an elderly couple from Moscow who had immigrated to Tel Aviv.
Also, a 34-year-old woman from England was sickened, but not fatally, in the southern part of the country.
The Israelis had not even noticed the outbreak until the publicity around the Queens case spread.
In fact, the virus has surfaced several times in Israel since 1957.
This will be the case in the United States for years to come, scientists suggest.
Scientists have four theories on how the virus traveled.
The theories illustrate the ways a virus can nation-hop.
The first, and most likely, said scientists, is that the virus boarded a commercial airline flight to the United States.
``An infected mosquito bit a guy in the Middle East, he hops on a plane and lands in New York, where he is bitten by another mosquito.
That mosquito spreads it,'' said Spielman of Harvard.
``And the guy may have never known he was sick''.
Heavy air traffic has allowed viruses to spread much more quickly, said scientists.
They can now go to any country where they can find warm temperatures and hosts to infect.
``Air travel has decreased the size of the world effectively,'' said Richard Pollack, a public health entomologist at Harvard.
The second theory is that an infected bird from western Africa was blown here.
Most birds could not make the flight on their own, but a cyclone or heavy winds could have dropped them here.
In 1998, researchers found that several million locusts had been blown from West Africa to the Caribbean.
Thirdly, scientists theorize that an infected bird was brought, perhaps illegally, to John F.
Kennedy Airport in New York.
According to the US Customs Service, 2,770 birds entered the United States that way in 1999.
The final theory returns to mosquitoes: a bunch of infected insects somehow got transported here via airplane.
This, too, is possible.
Researchers recently transported live mosquitoes across the Atlantic Ocean by placing them in the wheel carriage of a 747 jet.
Most scientists agree the West Nile virus's journey from New York to Boston occurred in birds.
Infected mosquitoes bite New York birds, then the birds migrate to different parts of the East Coast, where more mosquitoes bite them and spread the virus.
Corvus brachyrhynchos, or American crow, has a migratory pattern that takes it from New England, New York, and Canada in the summer to Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Florida in the winter, according to a recent study by researchers at the National Zoo in Washington.
Almost all of the New England routes pass near New York City.
Public health officials were expecting West Nile to show up in a city south of New York because birds are headed that way in late summer.
Last year one dead crow infected with the virus turned up in Baltimore.
But crows roam widely, and it is possible that an infected crow simply flew here this summer from New York City.
&QL; ----- &QC; &QL; On Wednesday, Dr.
Anita Barry, director of the Boston Health Commission's communicable disease program, convened a meeting of local officials at Timperi's lab.
The CDC was disputing Timperi's West Nile diagnosis but it was decided the public should be warned anyway.
``I think the most important thing we wanted to do is get accurate information out to people that the risk of getting the virus is quite low and that you can make it even lower by taking some precautions,'' said Barry.
They went before TV cameras at 3 p.m. and announced the discovery of the infected crow.
The mayor repeated the announcement several hours later.
And in what became almost an afterthought, hours after Menino's speech, the CDC called to tell Timperi he was right.
The drill was handy in one sense: Officials say they will probably have to do it many times again.
``West Nile is living here now,'' said Green of the UMass Medical School.
``And there's no way we can get rid of it.''
BOSTON _ Massachusetts officials identified two more birds infected with the West Nile virus Friday, one day after they announced that the sometimes-lethal virus had not been detected in the state in almost two weeks.
One of the dead birds, a robin found in a residential neighborhood in the city's Jamaica Plain section, confirms the virus is being carried and spread by local mosquitoes, state officials said.
Meanwhile, in Staten Island, N.Y.
Friday, the first human West Nile infection this year surfaced: a 78-year-old man who reported to a New York hospital on July 22 complaining of dizziness and fever.
He was hospitalized for a week and is now at home recovering, said New York health officals.
Until Friday the virus had only been detected here in crows, which easily could have flown to Boston from New York, where the virus is most heavily concentrated.
But robins don't fly long distances.
``Robins are local and the only way one could've gotten the virus is by getting bit by an infected mosquito here,'' said state Department of Public Health spokesperson Roseanne Pawelec.
``That basically indicates the virus is present in mosquitoes in this area''.
In addition to the robin, another West Nile-infected crow found in a residential Brookline neighborhood was identified Friday, bringing the total number of diseased birds found in Massachusetts to four.
All but one were found in the area where Jamaica Plain meets Brookline, not surprising, said state officals, given the tree and pond-filled parks there.
Thursday state officals told the public that a mass testing of 7,000 mosquitoes and 200 birds turned up no signs of the virus.
Although the newly discovered birds seem to contradict this reassurance, state officials said they were consistent with earlier state predictions that sporadic signs of the virus would surface throughout the summer.
``It's here, and from now until the cold begins, we're going to be concerned about people avoiding mosquito exposure,'' said Alfred DeMaria, director of communicable diseases for the state Department of Public Health.
``I'm sure we'll eventually find infected mosquitoes''.
In 1999 the virus killed 7 elderly people in Queens, N.Y., and sickened 60.
New York officials responded to the report of the first human case by announcing they would redouble their aggressive mosquito-spraying campaign.
Victims of West Nile virus typically experience flu-like symptoms.
In a small number of cases, the virus can cause fatal brain swelling.
The elderly, infants and those with weakened immune systems are considered particularly vulnerable.
Health officals here issued now-familiar suggestions: wear long clothes when outside, consider using mosquito repellent, avoid parks around dusk and dawn, and empty containers with stagnant water in them.
The Culex pipiens mosquito, the type that carries the virus, is currently in the midst of its annual population explosion.
In Boston, officals said they would spray pesticides in a two-mile radius around where the two new birds were found.
Spraying will occur late at night.
They will also continue to lay tiny poison tablets in thousands of mosquito breeding grounds around the city.
The Boston prevention effort is dwarfed by the goings on in New York.
Friday night, entire area codes in the Bronx were sprayed with pesticides, as were massive Central Park and parts of the chic upper East and West Sides in Manhattan.
ATLANTA _ Migrating birds may have brought an encephalitis-causing virus never before seen in the Western Hemisphere to New York, where the virus has killed four people and sickened at least 37 others.
Some scientists are concerned birds carrying the virus may bring it farther south as they migrate to warmer climates for the winter.
Georgia public health officials say they aren't worried because the human outbreak has been confined to New York, and it's unclear whether the virus would pose a threat to Georgia.
No one knows which birds carry the virus, which is similar to the West Nile virus of Africa.
Humans are infected through mosquitoes that have fed from the blood of infected birds.
In addition to its human victims, the virus has felled scores of birds in New York and Connecticut _ mostly crows, but also a few flamingos and an Asian pheasant at the Bronx Zoo.
The ideal animal host for a virus doesn't die from carrying it, however.
The ideal host remains alive so the virus can be passed on to other species.
``Until we have some more details about what the bird is and we can look at migratory directions, all we can do is take the normal precautions that anyone can do with encephalitis,'' said Tom Bennett, an environmental health specialist with the Georgia Department of Human Resources.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has sent at least six researchers to New York.
Researchers at the CDC's labs in Fort Collins, Colo.
, identified the virus and are conducting further studies.
``It may be some time before we know how long this virus has been around or where it came from,'' said agency spokesman Tom Skinner.
Since late August, more than three dozen people in New York City and the neighboring counties of Westchester and Nassau have been stricken with encephalitis caused by the West Nile-like virus.
Doctors are analyzing blood from another eight New Yorkers who died since August to determine whether they were killed by the same strain.
About 170 cases of illness remain under investigation.
Originally, the CDC identified the culprit as St.
Louis encephalitis virus, the most common cause of epidemic encephalitis in the United States.
Late Friday, the agency changed its diagnosis to West Nile-like virus.
The immediate solution is the same in either case: Kill the mosquitoes.
``It's important to note that all the control measures in New York and surrounding states are appropriate whether St.
Louis or West Nile-like virus is involved,'' Skinner said.
Georgia doesn't have statewide mosquito control measures, but many coastal counties do, Bennett said.
No human or avian cases of encephalitis have been reported this year in Georgia.
Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain, caused by anything from head injury to bacterial or viral infections.
Most people with encephalitis suffer flu-like symptoms, including fever and headaches.
In some cases, the infection leads to paralysis, seizures, coma and death.
Young children, the elderly and those with weak immune systems are at greatest risk.
The West Nile virus was first identified in 1937 in Uganda.
West Nile encephalitis has been reported in Africa, Europe and Asia.
West Nile encephalitis cannot be passed from person to person, or from birds to people; the virus must pass through a mosquito.
No vaccine exists for the virus, and treatment is limited to the symptoms of the illness.

HACKENSACK, N.J.
(AP) -- An 82-year-old New Jersey man has become the first person in the United States this year to die of the West Nile virus, Gov.
Christie Whitman said Wednesday.
Officials did not immediately identify the man, who died on Sept.
14, 11 days after he became ill.
They said that he had other ailments but that West Nile virus had been the principal cause of death.
''People shouldn't panic,'' said Whitman, who urged residents to wear insect repellent and long-sleeved clothes.
Last year, seven people died and 55 others were infected in the New York metropolitan area during the first known appearance of the virus in the Western Hemisphere.
The virus is typically transmitted by mosquitos.
This year, 13 people have been infected in New York and four in New Jersey, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
New York reported its 13th case on Wednesday.
The virus also has been detected in birds in Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania officials Wednesday said they had found the virus in two dead crows outside Philadelphia.
The disease can cause flu-like symptoms and can be dangerous to young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems.
CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said it is increasingly unlikely that there will be any more human cases this year since the cooler weather reduces the number of mosquitoes.
When you hear hoofbeats, don't think of zebras.
To doctors, the axiom is a call to focus on common ailments and not waste time on the exotic.
But on those rare occasions when they do detect a zebra, doctors say they need to take extra steps in their investigation to make sure they have identified the right one.
A case in point is the encephalitis outbreak that is blamed for at least three deaths in New York City.
Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the New York City Health Department said the cause was the mosquito-borne St.
Louis virus, which had never been identified in New York City before.
But last weekend the CDC, responding to findings from laboratory tests performed by Dr.
Tracey McNamara, a pathologist at the Bronx Zoo, announced that the outbreak was caused by an even rarer zebra: the West Nile virus from Africa.
Dr. W.
Ian Lipkin, of the Emerging Diseases Laboratory at the University of California at Irvine, confirmed the findings.
The viruses are closely related, causing virtually the same type of inflammation of the brain.
But the West Nile virus had never before been detected in the Western Hemisphere.
``CDC would not have made the diagnosis of West Nile virus as quickly without Dr.
McNamara's persistent medical sleuthing,'' Dr.
Duane J.
Gubler, the head of CDC's arbovirus field station in Fort Collins, Colo.
, said in an interview.
The change in diagnosis, though not important in terms of the spraying and other public health measures taken to combat the outbreak, was scientifically embarrassing to the CDC, the premier federal agency that is responsible for tracking infectious diseases in this country.
In recent years, CDC and other health officials have led a campaign against the threat of new and emerging infections, warning doctors to expect more infectious disease ``zebras,'' like the sudden appearance of old microbes in new areas.
In fact, health officials thought they had scored a coup when they diagnosed the mysterious illness as the St.
Louis virus.
The disease is usually found in the Southeastern states, and humans are usually bystanders in such infections.
Birds are the principal reservoir for the arboviruses, but they do not become sick.
Instead, mosquitoes transmit the viruses to people who may become ill.
In hindsight, the concurrent deaths of an unusual number of birds in the city has turned out to be an important but underestimated clue.
Federal and local medical sleuths did not immediately relate the bird die-off to the human outbreak because West Nile, St.
Louis and similar encephalitis viruses generally do not kill birds.
Now the CDC is retesting blood and spinal fluid from patients who had symptoms of encephalitis and who did not show evidence of St.
Louis virus.
The new findings mean that health workers need to investigate a number of other possibilities, Gubler said.
A critical one is that the CDC can no longer be certain that the West Nile virus has never been present in the United States, because federal scientists never specifically checked for it in earlier outbreaks and individual cases.
In testing mosquitoes and specimens from humans with encephalitis, CDC routinely checks all types of viral encephalitis known to have caused infection in the Western Hemisphere, Gubler said.
There can be considerable overlap in findings from the laboratory tests unless extra steps are taken to distinguish between the many types of encephalitis-causing arboviruses.
In a sense they are all one virus, but with many variations that can be detected in the laboratory.
The encephalitis they cause is the same disease, although there can be subtle differences in the type of brain damage they produce.
The viruses occur in different geographic areas, and by scientific custom they are named for the area where they were discovered.
They include Murray Valley encephalitis in Australia, Japanese encephalitis, and Rocio virus in Brazil and Argentina.
They are distinguished in the laboratory by small differences in the proteins in the covering of the virus known as its envelope.
``We don't include West Nile, Japanese and other encephalitis viruses because they have never been known to be here,'' Gubler said, adding that in the New York outbreak, ``we had tunnel vision on St.
Louis virus, because all the clinical, epidemiological, laboratory and geographic features pointed to St.
Louis''. ``We've learned a lesson here,'' Gubler continued.
``We've got to be more open-minded.
``Once we get past this crisis, we are going to have to go back and check specimens from CDC and state health departments to see if it has been here, and if so, for how long''.
The West Nile virus was discovered in 1937 in Uganda.
Since then ``it has rarely reared its head,'' Gubler said, though outbreaks and occasional cases have been reported from Israel, France, Romania and elsewhere in Europe.
Presumably the virus was carried northward by birds migrating from Africa.
After a nearly two-decade silence, West Nile virus caused a large outbreak in Romania in 1996.
This year West Nile virus apparently caused illness among humans in Volgograd, Russia, though Gubler said he had received no reply to an inquiry he has made to Russian scientists about the outbreak.
Lack of communication among scientists thwarts efforts to learn why a virus is spreading.
When birds began dying in and near the Bronx Zoo, McNamara, the pathologist there, initially thought they might be due to viruses that cause avian influenza, Newcastle disease, fowl cholera or Eastern equine encephalitis, Gubler said.
McNamara sent the specimens to the Department of Agriculture Laboratory at Ames, Iowa, where scientists eliminated those candidates as the cause.
Because the Ames laboratory lacked the material to test for the pertinent arboviruses, they forwarded the specimens to CDC, Gubler said.
Gubler said scientists also needed to investigate whether the deaths of the birds indicated that West Nile virus had become more virulent.
The virus has been shown to stay in the blood of humans longer than other types of encephalitis virus, so that mosquitoes are more likely to pick up and transmit it to other humans.
But whether such transmissions occur on a regular basis is not known, Gubler said.
A main focus will be to prevent a recurrence of the outbreak in New York next summer.
Scientists do not know whether the virus can persist in infected mosquitoes while they hibernate over the winter, Gubler said.
In the absence of definitive information, health officials will consider the need to begin control of storm drains to decrease the probability of infected mosquitoes' surviving the winter.
The bird virus that killed seven New Yorkers last year has now spread all over the Americas, say U.S. researchers.
They warn that the Gulf coast of the United States will probably see the next outbreak of West Nile virus.
Despite the threat, U.S. authorities have so far failed to provide the research funding to keep tabs on the virus in wild birds.
The scientists say that scrupulous monitoring of bird populations is needed, otherwise it won't be possible to identify and spray high-risk areas with insecticide to kill the mosquitoes that transmit the virus to people.
The infection is endemic to Africa, Asia and Europe, where it resides harmlessly in many bird species but kills others, according to Bob McLean, head of the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis.
Humans usually get the disease from mosquito bites when the population of infected city birds is sufficiently large to infect enough mosquitoes.
In 1997, 527 people in Bucharest were ill with West Nile virus, and 50 died.
There is no specific treatment for the infection.
The virus may have reached New York last summer in a bird imported from Israel.
However, West Nile expert Zdanek Hubalek of the Czech Academy of Sciences, suggests it may have originally escaped from the Sloan-Kettering Institute in New York, where in the 1950s, a strain of the virus was given to 95 terminal cancer patients as an experimental treatment.
But there is evidence that the New York outbreak last summer which killed thousands of crows, and caused encephalitis in 61 New Yorkers, seven of whom died, resulted from a different strain.
But what is certain, McLean says, is that as early as last summer the virus had already spread to an alarming extent in the New York area.
``It had already infected more than half the local geese and sparrows.
That's scary,'' McClean says.
And the discovery of the virus in birds in New York, New Jersey and Delaware last month has dashed hopes that it would not survive the winter.
John Rappole and his colleagues at the Smithsonian Institution's zoo in Front Royal, Va.
, have calculated that the virus would spread far and wide from New York if there were susceptible migratory birds congregating on mosquito-infested wetlands nearby.
In this month's issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, they and Hubalek report that there are 77 migratory species there, including ducks, starlings, terns and gulls, capable of carrying the virus.
``The virus is probably in every corner of North America by now'' as well as parts of South America, says Rappole.
Another outbreak could occur anywhere there are enough infected birds, possibly this summer.
``We think the next outbreak will be along the Gulf coast, where northern migrants remain concentrated,'' Rappole says.
``It is essential to capture and test healthy local birds to know where West Nile poses a threat,'' McLean says.
``Then mosquito spraying can be targeted to protect people''.
McLean's proposals to screen birds in the coming months have not yet been funded.
Eastern and Gulf states plan to test dead birds and ``sentinel'' chickens _ caged birds used as an early warning system.
But this is much less sensitive, McLean warns.
Caged chickens are less likely to encounter infected mosquitoes than free-range birds.
But Stephen Ostroff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta told New Scientist: ``Extensive screening of wild birds in hopes of finding the virus would not be cost-effective''.
&QL; &UR; (This article is excerpted from New Scientist, a weekly science and technology magazine based in London).
&LR; &QC;
NEW YORK (AP) - The West Nile virus is here to stay and is likely to keep spreading into other areas of the country, experts said Tuesday.
Although there have been no reports of human infections so far this year, ''we have to redouble our efforts, because now is the time when you would see any human cases,'' said Dr.
Steven Ostroff, a West Nile authority at the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
With the mosquito-borne virus appearing this year in Connecticut, New Jersey and Maryland, ''the range is wider than last year,'' he said.
Ostroff spoke on a panel at New York University Medical Center convened by three members of Congress ''because New Yorkers have as many questions as answers'' on how to protect themselves, said Sen.
Charles Schumer, D-NY.
Last year, with Queens as the epicenter, the first U.S. case of West Nile was reported in late August; a total of seven people in the New York area died and 62 were infected.
So far this year the virus has appeared only in birds and mosquitoes - bloodsucking insects that can spread West Nile to humans.
The latest infestation seems to be centered around Staten Island.
Rep. Nita Lowey, D-NY, said New Yorkers are confused about how to act on a day-to-day basis, asking questions like, ''Do I go to Central Park, do I not go to Central Park''?
And especially when it comes to their children, they wonder: ''Are they better off wearing long sleeves and gloves, or just staying in the house all summer''?
Over the winter, health authorities set up a monitoring system to locate and destroy insects infected with the virus while they were hibernating.
And several weeks ago, trucks started spraying neighborhoods where West Nile-bearing mosquitoes or birds were found, including Central Park and parts of Long Island and Westchester County.
The system ''is working,'' said Ostroff, judging by the lack of human infection.
Despite some public concern, the spraying compounds being used are among the safest available, he said.
Ostroff was introduced by Rep.
Joseph Crowley, D-NY, as the nation's West Nile ''czar,'' backed by $20 million in federal funding for research and prevention of the virus over a two-year period.
''The data are telling us that the virus is here to stay, and is likely to keep moving to other areas,'' Ostroff concluded.
Agreed Dr.
Marty Blazer, an NYU specialist in infectious diseases: ''It will not go away, it will remain in our ecosystem''.
The West Nile virus is commonly found in Africa, Eastern Europe, West Asia and the Middle East.
Its appearance in the New York area last year was the first in the Western Hemisphere, prompting a massive campaign of aerial and ground spraying to kill mosquitoes.
The first case was detected by Dr.
Deborah Asnis, director of infectious diseases at Flushing Hospital Medical Center in Queens.
In August of last year, she contacted the city's Department of Health to report two patients with encephalitis, a swelling of the brain which can be caused by West Nile.
From now on, ''we believe knowledge and understanding are the most effective antidote,'' Asnis said Tuesday.
While some people infected with West Nile show no symptoms, others suffer from a flu-like condition that can include high fever, gastrointenstinal problems, muscle ache, a headache, or mental confusion.
The only sure way to diagnose an infection is through a test that detects antibodies to the virus, said Dr.
Marcy Layton, the Health Department's assistant commissioner for communicable diseases.
Warned Schumer: ''There should be no fear, no panic - but you can't be too careful.''
PARAMUS, N.J.
(AP) - Centers for Disease Control officials left New Jersey on Wednesday to await the results of tests on mosquitoes and sparrows in four northern counties that could show how far west the West Nile virus has spread.
The CDC ended a two-week research project that was centered on Bergen County, where seven dead crows have been found infected with the virus this year.
One dead crow was found in Middlesex County and another in Hudson County last week.
Chet Moore, a supervisory entomologist for the CDC, said the agency will look for signs of infected mosquitoes in Bergen, Passaic, Morris and Sussex counties to find out if the disease has spread to western New Jersey.
The agency is collecting samples from sparrows to find out how many antibodies birds have to defend themselves against the virus.
The CDC is testing sparrows instead of crows because crows are exceptionally sensitive to West Nile and are not a good average sample, Moore said.
Test results are expected next week on 2,000 to 3,000 mosquitoes collected in each county, and on samples from several hundred birds in each county, Moore said.
Many of the crows found in Bergen County and Rockland County, N.Y., were located along a straight line along the Hackensack River, which Moore said may or may not mean something.
Mosquitoes are known to breed in standing water.
The birds were found quite a distance offshore, he said, but ''it looks too interesting to be pure chance''.
State testing of 452 flocks of sentinel chickens and 405 mosquito-breeding areas have found no mosquitoes or chickens infected with the disease, Bergen County Executive William ''Pat'' Schuber said.
No humans have become infected.
Seven people died last year in New York, when the West Nile strain of encephalitis first surfaced in the region, sickening dozens.
Schuber lashed out Wednesday at New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who said it would be preferable if some suburban counties sprayed areas where the virus is detected more thoroughly.
Schuber said the county has spent $1.15 million on West Nile prevention efforts this year and last year lent its trucks to New York City to help spraying efforts there.
''In fact, this disease unfortunately started in the city of New York,'' Schuber said.
''Our efforts...
are not only expensive, they are expansive''.
Giuliani declined comment on Schuber's remarks through a spokeswoman.

TRENTON, N.J.
(AP) - State health officials Friday said a dead crow found in River Edge, Bergen County tested positive for the West Nile virus.
The bird was one of 120 crows so far tested by state officials.
Results were confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
''The New Jersey test shows that the surveillance system we have established to monitor West Nile virus is working as planned,'' Christine Grant, state commissioner of Health and Human Services, said in a statement.
Blood samples taken from 43 test chickens stationed in every county have proved negative for the virus, according to Grant.
The virus has not been found in tests of mosquito pools in eight counties.
Last year, health workers found traces of the virus in 74 crows and two mosquito pools.
No New Jersey resident was found to carry the virus, state officials said.
Last year, West Nile - first misdiagnosed as St.
Louis encephalitis - killed six people in New York City and one in Westchester and sickened more than 60.
It was also blamed for hundreds of bird deaths - mostly crows - in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and it killed several horses on Long Island.
West Nile virus can cause a range of symptoms.
In the most serious cases, infection can result in encephalitis, or swelling of the brain.
Elderly individuals, or those with compromised immune systems, are most at risk.
Birds harbor the disease and many are susceptible to it, but they cannot transmit it to humans.
NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced Monday that the city would re-spray all of Staten Island on Wednesday and Thursday with the pesticide Anvil as a ``prudent measure'' against the mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus.
Giuliani said the number of dead birds found with the virus on Staten Island _ 13 at last count _ prompted the additional spraying.
No dead birds with the virus have been found in Manhattan, the Bronx or Brooklyn, and three have been found in Queens.
Dr. Neal Cohen, the city's health commissioner who made the announcement with Giuliani, also said Monday that an increasing number of mosquitoes found in traps in Staten Island was prompting the city to act.
Cohen said that the spraying, scheduled from 10 p.m.
Wednesday to 5 a.m.
Thursday from trucks, was aimed at killing those mosquitoes not reached by the ground-spraying of Staten Island on July 19-20 and July 24-25.
``There's always a population of mosquitoes that have recently fed who are not in the air on any given evening,'' Cohen said.
He estimated that the initial ground-spraying of Staten Island might have missed 10 percent to 20 percent of the mosquito population.
Mosquitoes feeding on birds infected with West Nile virus become carriers of the virus, and may then infect animals the insects bite subsequently, including humans.
Last year the virus killed seven people and made 55 others ill in the New York area.
Infected birds indicate that the virus is present.
No human has been found with the virus this year.
In recent weeks, New York has sprayed pesticide throughout Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn to kill mosquitoes.
On Monday, health officials in Stamford, Conn.
, announced that they had found a dead crow infected with the West Nile virus, the first infected bird found in that state.
A Stamford health official said that area residents had collected 200 dead birds for testing in the past week.
And in New Jersey on Monday, tests showed that six more crows found dead there were also infected with the virus, including the one found in Union County, state health officials said, bringing the total found infected so far this year in that state to 15 according to the state health department.
All counties in New Jersey spray bodies of water to kill mosquito larvae, and Sussex County has done limited ground spraying for adult mosquitoes, said Sharon Southard, a spokeswoman for the state department of environmental Protection.
BOSTON _ A dead crow that had been infected with West Nile virus was found in the city, health authorities said Wednesday, confirming that the exotic encephalitis virus has migrated here and prompting officals to calmly warn the public to protect themselves against mosquitoes.
The West Nile virus is spread by mosquito bites and scientists said Wednesday they are unsure how widespread it is among Boston's mosquito population.
Birds cannot spread it to humans.
After discovering the infected crow Saturday, public health officials began testing mosquitoes to see if any were carrying the virus.
Those results are due Thursday and will determine if mosquito spraying outside the immediate Willow Pond area of Jamaica Plain, where the dead crow was discovered, is necessary.
They will also consider aerial spraying, though only if signs emerge that large numbers of mosquitoes here carry the virus.
In the meantime, officals said residents will be notified if areas around their homes are to be targeted.
They advised people to wear long clothing when outdoors and to use insect repellent liberally.
There have not been a human cases of West Nile reported in the state.
Last year the virus sickened 55 people and killed 7 in Queens, N.Y., all of them elderly.
On Monday, New York officals closed that city's massive Central Park after infected mosquitoes were found there, though no humans have tested positive.
Believed to have originated in Africa and Asia, West Nile is most likely to be fatal in the elderly, and state officials said all cautions apply doubly to them.
Infants are also at higher risk.
In most younger, healthy people the virus is typically benign.
State officals said they will aggressively test all dead animals found in the area for signs of the virus.
Hospitals will also be on the lookout for patients with West Nile-like symptoms.
Horses throughout the state will be tested.
Residents were urged to protect themselves and pets against mosquitoes, and empty any outdoor containers filled with water because mosquitoes breed around stagnant water.
``We have no idea how intense the force of transmission is locally.
It may be that we will see another Queens 1999 in Boston or that (Wednesday's findings) are the end of things,'' said Andrew Spielman, a professor of tropical public health at Harvard School of Public Health.
``We'll soon have some handle on how intense the outbreak is likely to be, or if there will be an outbreak''.
State officals have been testing dead crows regularly since the virus first appeared in New York last year.
Though it was expected more likely to turn up in southern cities, where birds migrate, officials said they weren't caught off guard by Wednesday's discovery.
``We're not surprised at all at the findings,'' said Ralph Timpari, assistant commissioner for the Bureau of Laboratory Sciences.
``It's a single bird.
It's not a time of being overly concerned.
It's an indication of how rare it is in Massachusetts''.
The West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause encephalitis or inflammation of the brain.
It is transmitted through mosquitoes which become infected from birds that carry the virus.
It cannot be spread by person-to-person contact, such as touching, kissing or caring for someone who is infected.
West Nile tends to produce flu-like symptoms, such as slight fevers, headaches and body aches, five to 15 days after the initial bite.
The most severe infections can cause headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, paralysis and sometimes death.
In most of the people who get the virus, it passes unnoticed.
Only a small percentage require hospitalization.
Of those, only 7 percent die.
There is no treatment and no vaccine.
&QL; &QL; A WEST NILE VIRUS Q AND A &QL; &QL; Q.
What is West Nile encephalitis?
A. West Nile encephalitis is an infection of the brain caused by West Nile virus, which is commonly found in Africa, West Asia, and the Middle East.
Q. How long has West Nile virus been in the U.S.?
A. It is not known how long it has been in the U.S., but scientists believe the virus has probably been in the eastern U.S. since the early summer of 1999, possibly longer.
Q. How do people get West Nile encephalitis?
A. By the bite of a mosquito that is infected with West Nile virus.
Q. What is the basic transmission cycle?
A. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds.
After an incubation period of 10 days to 2 weeks, infected mosquitoes can then transmit West Nile virus to humans and animals.
Q. Can you get West Nile encephalitis from another person?
A. No.
West Nile encephalitis is NOT transmitted from person-to-person.
Q. Can you get West Nile virus directly from birds?
A. There is no evidence that a person can get the virus from handling live or dead infected birds.
Q. Can you get West Nile virus directly from other insects or ticks?
A. Infected mosquitoes are the primary source for West Nile virus.
Ticks infected with West Nile virus have been found in Asia and Africa.
Q. What are the symptoms of West Nile encephalitis?
A. Most infections are mild and symptoms include fever, headache, and body aches, often with skin rash and swollen lymph glands.
More severe infection may be marked by headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, paralysis and, rarely, death.
Q. How is West Nile encephalitis treated?
A. There is no specific therapy.
In more severe cases, intensive supportive therapy is indicated, i.e., hospitalization, intravenous fluids, airway management, respiratory support and good nursing care.
Q. Is there a vaccine against West Nile encephalitis?
A. No.
Q. What is the incubation period in humans (time from infection to onset of disease symptoms) for West Nile encephalitis?
A. Usually 3 to 15 days.
Q. Who is at risk for getting West Nile encephalitis?
A. All residents of areas where virus activity has been identified; persons greater than 50 years of age have the highest risk of severe disease.
Q. What proportion of people die when infected with West Nile virus?
A. Case-fatality rates range from 3 percent to 15 percent and are highest in the elderly.
Q. How many cases of West Nile encephalitis occurred in the U.S. in 1999?
A. Before August 1999, West Nile virus had never been reported in the U.S.
In 1999, 62 cases of severe disease, including 7 deaths, occurred in the New York area.
No reliable estimates are available for the number of cases of West Nile encephalitis that occur worldwide.
Q. Can infected dogs or cats be carriers and transmit West Nile virus to humans?
A. There is no documented evidence of person-to-person, animal-to-animal, or animal-to-person transmission of West Nile virus.
Q. What can I do to reduce my risk of becoming infected with West Nile virus?
A. Stay indoors at dawn, dusk, and in the early &UR; evening &LR;. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants whenever you are outdoors.
Apply insect repellent sparingly to exposed skin.
An effective repellent will contain 35 percent DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide).
DEET in high concentrations (greater than 35 percent) provides no additional protection.

BALTIMORE (AP) - A dead crow found in a downtown neighborhood this week has tested positive for the West Nile virus, making it the third bird found in two weeks in Maryland with the mosquito-borne virus.
The bird was found Sept.
18 in the Federal Hill section and tested in a state lab, Mike Morrill, a spokesman for Gov.
Parris Glendening, said Friday night.
The state Department of Agriculture planned to spray the pesticide Permethrin Saturday evening in a 2-mile area around where the bird was found, including in the Inner Harbor tourist area, Morrill said.
The department is targeting populations of the Culex mosquito, which has tested positive for the virus in the past.
State officials sprayed the same insecticide Friday at dusk in sections of Howard and Baltimore counties, where two birds with West Nile virus were found last week.
No one in Maryland has been hospitalized with symptoms of the virus, which can be passed to humans through mosquito bites.
West Nile virus can cause fatal encephalitis, usually among children, the elderly or people with weak immune systems.
An environmental group expressed concern Friday about the anti-mosquito spraying, saying the risks of the pesticide outweigh the threat of West Nile to humans.
''The chance of humans becoming seriously ill from West Nile virus is very small,'' the Maryland Pesticide Network said.
The group said pesticides such as Permethrin have been linked to brain cancer in children.
It said several Connecticut communities have opted not to spray for mosquitoes because of such concerns.
However, state officials said the pesticide is harmless and residents do not have to stay indoor during the spraying.
Those who still have concerns are advised to leave the spray area or remain inside, Morrill said.
Sixty-two people have been tested for the West Nile virus this year, health officials said.
Of those, one was suffering from encephalitis; 32 had aseptic, or viral, meningitis; and others suffered from a variety of diseases or conditions, said John Sweitzer, an epidemiologist with the state health department.
None tested positive for West Nile virus.
''We've been trying to encourage physicians to submit samples for testing,'' Sweitzer said.
''And with this publicity, we think we're going to get a lot more samples rolling in''.
Residents finding dead or dying birds are asked to call the Department of Natural Resources' toll-free hotline at 1-888-584-3110.

NEW YORK (AP) -- A strain of encephalitis never before reported in the United States is to blame for at least one of three deaths in the city, federal health officials said.
Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Protection identified a ``West Nile-like'' virus in the victim on Friday and were continuing to determine the specific strain, CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said.
``We're using the word 'like' to indicate that we still have some more work to do to determine if it is a variation on the strain of West Nile or a new virus,'' she said.
Health officials said last week that a virus believed to be West Nile had been found in dead birds in the metropolitan region.
Reynolds said the West Nile virus is usually found in Africa and Europe, never before in the United States.
Scientists earlier thought St.
Louis encephalitis killed three and sickened 15 other people in the city and neighboring Westchester County.
It's possible the numbers could go higher.
Spinal fluid samples from 77 people who fell ill but tested negative for St.
Louis encephalitis would be re-examined for the West Nile or Kunjin virus, city Health Commissioner Dr.
Neal Cohen told The New York Times.
Seven of those 77 people died.
Officials said the unprecedented discovery of the virus in the United States was no cause for alarm, since the pesticide spraying now under way to combat St.
Louis encephalitis should also work against the mosquitoes that carry the West Nile virus.
Brain tissue from victims of the encephalitis outbreak has been undergoing analysis at the CDC and at the Emerging Diseases Laboratory at the University of California at Irvine.
W. Ian Lipkin, the director of the Irvine lab, said his colleagues had identified either West Nile virus or a variant found in Australia, Kunjin virus, in the brains of three encephalitis victims from the city's Queens borough.
``The significance of this is that this particular agent has never been reported in North America,'' Lipkin said Sunday.
NEWARK, N.J.
(AP) - The number of dead birds that have tested positive for the West Nile virus has nearly doubled in a week to 322 and expanded to a 10th county, state officials said Thursday.
The number of birds testing positive for the mosquito-borne virus jumped from 165 last Thursday and includes one bird found in Mercer County, health officials said.
All are crows except one, a cockatiel.
The publicity about the West Nile virus and counties' intensified mosquito control efforts have prompted more residents to call about dead crows they have found, which has led to more testing, said Dennis McGowan, a spokesman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services.
But McGowan said the numbers likely mean the virus has reached new heights in the state.
''I think we're really at the peak right now,'' McGowan said.
The number of affected crows in Essex County more than tripled, from 10 to 39, the department said.
Bergen County crows rose from 51 to 84, while the birds found in Union County more than doubled from 14 to 34.
Thirty-six birds were found in Hudson County, up from 18 last week, 68 were in Middlesex County, 29 in Monmouth County, 27 in Passaic, three in Morris County, one in Somerset and one in Mercer, officials said.
No humans in New Jersey have tested positive for the virus, which killed seven people and sickened scores last year in New York City.
Three Staten Island residents have tested positive for the virus this year.
The virus is carried to birds by infected mosquitoes.
It is potentially life-threatening to the elderly and those with weakened immune systems.
Test results on 11 suspected cases of the virus in New Jersey are still pending, health officials said.
Four pools of mosquitoes collected in Bergen County in late July have tested positive for the virus, but none of the 10,000 mosquitoes analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control, sentinel chickens or sparrows have tested positive.
State Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Bob Shinn said the increased numbers of birds will not prompt the state to begin aerial spraying.
''If counties continue their effective control strategies, using focused, intense, ground applications to further reduce the adult mosquito population on an as-needed basis, we are unlikely to need aerial spraying of urban areas,'' Shinn said.
CDC officials said they would return to northern New Jersey this weekend to conduct a second round of tests on mosquitoes and sparrows to track the progress of the virus.
''It gives us a better handle on the way the virus behaves naturally so that it helps us translate into what the human health risk is,'' said Steve Ostroff, the federal West Nile coordinator for the CDC.
A third round of testing is planned before the mosquito season officially ends before the first frost of the year, he said.

HARTFORD, Conn.
(AP) - Citing a congressional report critical of the handling of a mosquito virus, U.S.
Sen. Joseph Lieberman on Monday called for an improved federal response to outbreaks of infectious disease.
The report, which concludes an eight-month investigation by the Democratic staff of the Governmental Affairs Committee, said last summer's outbreak of the West Nile-like strain of encephalitis exposed the nation's vulnerability to emerging infectious disease.
The outbreak should serve as a ''wake up call,'' the report said.
''This is serious and we ought to take it seriously,'' said Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who is the ranking minority member on the committee.
The report proposes a unified federal West Nile Virus response plan, closer cooperation between experts in the fields of human and animal health and an assessment of state's preparedness to deal with the mosquito-borne disease.
It also urges accelerated research into a West Nile virus vaccine and a national web site to keep the public and media informed.
The report criticizes the way the Centers for Disease Control responded to the outbreak that resulted in the deaths of seven people in the New York area.
Specifically, it faults the CDC for having ''tunnel vision'' after an initial diagnosis in humans blamed their illness on the St.
Louis version of the encephalitis virus.
Indicators, including a massive die-off of birds in the area, should have alerted health officials that something else was going on, the report says.
But a diagnosis of St.
Louis encephalitis ''colored CDC's thinking for several weeks,'' and delayed a correct diagnosis, according to the report.
Because the two diseases require the same prevention and control measures, no harm was done, the report states.
''CDC failed to expect the unexpected,'' the report states.
''West Nile provided the wake up call.
The next outbreak of an infectious disease, whether naturally occurring or deliberately inflicted, may not be so forgiving''.
In a prepared statement Monday, the CDC said the report emphasizes the critical challenges the country faces regarding emerging infectious diseases and said the recommendations in the report can help clarify the importance of strong partnerships among local, state and federal health agencies.
''As noted in the report, CDC has made significant progress in addresing many of the recommendations.
CDC takes seriously its leadership role in preparing for emerging infectious disease outbreaks and continues to work to keep Americans safe and healthy,'' the statement read.
The report notes that while the CDC and others were investigating human illness, animal health experts were doing a separate investigation into the deaths of birds and horses.
''The cultural and communication divides between the worlds of human disease and animal disease exacerbated the situation, a state of affairs that must be righted,'' the report states.
But the main emphasis of the report is on the improvement of the public health infrastructure, and the establishment of disease surveillance and reporting networks to better respond to any future infectious disease crisis.
That would include any bioterrorist attack, to which the report says the West Nile outbreak shows the U.S. may be vulnerable.
''There is widespread agreement that the next emerging or re-emerging disease that lands on our shores may be even more challenging than West Nile has proved to be, especially if it can readily be spread from person to person, as diseases like flu and small pox are,'' the report concludes.
''When - not if - such an event occurs, there will be little margin for error in identifying and responding to the disease.''
BRIDGEPORT, Conn.
(AP) - The state Department of Environmental protection is reviewing a $2 million proposal to kill mosquitoes and combat West Nile encephalitis.
Included in the plan is mosquito surveillance and the application of larvacide in 20 towns along a 62-mile stretch from Greenwich to Madison.
The larvacides, which would be deposited in selected catch basins in each of those cities and towns, would kill up to 90 percent of the mosquitoes before they hatch and can transmit the virus.
Several agencies as well as environmentalists believe the application of larvacides presents the best way of quashing or containing the threat of West Nile.
"Larvacides are not totally safe for the environment, but they are less damaging to human and animal health.
They are more specific than pesticides," Diane Lauricella, chairwoman of the Sierra Club's Fairfield County chapter.
Since last fall's outbreak of West Nile encephalitis, state officials have been concerned about preparing for the coming mosquito-biting season.
If the pre-emptive strike fails or additional communities discover bird kills connected with West Nile, a contingency fund of $800,000 is built into the proposal for larvaciding additional towns and for spraying adult mosquitoes.
Stamford officials are coming up with their own plan of action.
Stamford officials want to set up surveillance and prepare an arsenal of chemical agents to ward off any public health threat from mosquitoes that bear the West Nile encephalitis virus.
The city's Department of Health and Social Services wants companies to submit proposals for a comprehensive mosquito-control program that could be enacted quickly if mosquito-borne illnesses appear to pose a threat to public health this season, said Director of Public Safety, Health and Welfare John Byrne.
Ted Andreadis of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment station in New Haven has been testing mosquitoes to see if they carry West Nile encephalitis.
So far none of the 178 insects he has collected were infected with West Nile.
The insects collected are helping state scientists develop a profile of where mosquitoes go to survive the winter.
Experts say that information will help them devise strategies for the anticipated return of West Nile virus in Connecticut.
Last fall, seven people died of West Nile encephalitis in New York and at least 59 others, who experienced high fevers and brain swelling, were stricken with the disease.
In Connecticut, there were no human cases of West Nile virus.
But the disease was linked to the die-off of hundreds of birds, primarily crows.
"Now the question is what do you do about it to lower the risk and prevent it from transmitting to people"? said Michele Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protection.
ATLANTA _ Georgia and other states on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts may not be prepared for a resurgence of West Nile virus, the imported illness that infected 61 and killed seven in the Northeast last fall and may have spread south with migrating birds, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Thursday.
Up to 17 states and the District of Columbia could be at risk if the virus rebounds, the agency said in a report released Thursday.
The August outbreak in New York City marked the first time that West Nile, which lives in birds but can pass to horses and humans via mosquitoes, had ever been seen in this hemisphere; by the time cold weather ended the mosquito season, the virus had spread from Connecticut to Maryland.
In its report, the CDC said the emergency effort to track and identify the virus placed extraordinary demands on New York and surrounding states, inhibiting other crucial work by their public health systems.
Before the virus surges again, the agency warned, the other states at risk should be prepared to respond.
The Georgia Division of Public Health said Thursday that its plans are under way.
``We've got several things in place already and we're putting the finishing touches on a request for assistance to the CDC for more funds,'' said Dr.
Susan Lance-Parker, a medical epidemiologist with DPH.
Because the virus was not pinpointed until late September _ 20 days after it was misidentified as a different mosquito-borne virus _ many questions about it are still unanswered.
It isn't known, for instance, how far infected birds traveled along migration pathways, if New York-area birds carrying West Nile passed the virus to local birds or whether the virus can persist over a winter season.
According to CDC research, the virus was found in 1999 in crows, pigeons, and bald eagles; mallard ducks, sandhill cranes and kingfishers; ring-billed, herring and laughing gulls; broad-winged, Cooper's and red-tailed hawks, and kestrels; and robins, cuckoos and blue jays.
Thursday's report summarized 60 pages of guidelines developed during a November summit meeting of disease experts convened by the CDC.
It warns that states are likely to be weak in: _ Surveillance of birds and mosquitoes, to see whether they are carrying the virus, and reports by veterinarians and doctors of unexplained neurologic problems in horses and humans.
_ Laboratory ability to do several levels of blood testing and virus identification.
_ Mosquito control and public education about avoiding mosquito bites.
_ And expertise on mosquito-borne diseases in state health departments.
Georgia has already identified and addressed some of those needs, Lance-Parker said.
The state health department employs three scientists specializing in diseases that are passed to humans by insects or other invertebrates such as snails.
It has enlisted three veterinary diagnostic labs, two in Athens and one in Tifton, to gear up for required tests.
And it has begun an inventory of mosquito-control programs and resources, since wiping out mosquito populations stops transmission of West Nile.
Currently, Lance-Parker said, only four Georgia counties have long-term mosquito control programs.
If the state's bid to CDC for additional funding is successful, she added, DPH will also create training programs for district and county health departments, which would be the first to receive reports of unexplained diseases.
``We want to improve surveillance for many things: not just (viruses of the West Nile type), but bioterrorism and pandemic influenza,'' she said.
Lance-Parker declined to specify how much the state will ask the CDC to provide.
The agency, which regularly passes federal disease-fighting money along to the states, said last month that it would distribute up to $2.5 million to states for fighting West Nile.

HENDERSONVILLE, N.C.
_ The best defense against West Nile virus, the Third World pathogen that has unexpectedly invaded the East Coast, sits in a swampy corner of a county park in the heart of North Carolina's apple country.
And clucks.
Five white chickens brood in an improvised battery cage perched 4 feet off the ground to protect them against predators.
Every day, Henderson County engineer Jerry Robinson feeds and waters thems and collects their eggs.
Every two weeks, he draws a tablespoon of blood from a vein beneath one wing.
Back at the county health department, the blood is centrifuged and refrigerated, then shipped to a lab in Raleigh to check whether the birds are infected.
The African virus that in 12 months has killed seven people, sickened 56 and killed thousands of wild birds from Massachusetts to Maryland _ and for which there is no vaccine _ has not yet turned up in Henderson County's chickens, nor in 57 other ``sentinel flocks'' across the state.
But health officials in North Carolina _ and in Georgia and other states that are watching North Carolina for the first signs of virus in the South _ don't expect that to last.
``West Nile virus will probably reach North Carolina late this year,'' said Dr.
Nolan Newton of North Carolina's Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
``If not, we will see it next summer''.
West Nile virus is this summer's scary disease.
Like hantavirus in 1993, Ebola in 1995 and the Hong Kong avian influenza in 1997 _ and a new rodent-borne virus, announced Thursday, that appears to have killed three women in California _ it is a reminder of how easily pathogens that infect animals can leap across species and take humans by surprise.
Among public health experts, though, it is a reminder of a second phenomenon as well: the frequency with which infectious diseases that once were thought confined to the Third World are menacing developed countries, too.
``West Nile virus shows us that new diseases can emerge at any time, unexpectedly,'' said Dr.
Peter Daszak of the University of Georgia, a specialist in diseases of wildlife.
``It is a sign of our globalized planet, with humans, animals and their products being transported internationally at an unprecedented rate''.
The discovery last summer that West Nile had arrived in New York City, coupled with confirmation this month that the virus is circulating locally in at least four states, has triggered an extraordinary national effort to track the microbe.
Led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the initiative has enlisted health departments in 17 at-risk states, which are collaborating to detect the disease as it migrates across borders.
Humans acquire West Nile from mosquitoes, which transmit it from birds.
Some bird species, such as chickens, can be infected without showing signs of illness: North Carolina's chicken flocks are the above-ground equivalent of canaries in a coal mine.
Public health experts predict that West Nile will arrive in Georgia in the bloodstream of migrating birds that were bitten somewhere north of here by infected mosquitoes.
When the birds land to rest or feed, they could be bitten by local mosquitoes, which would then transmit the virus to other birds and on to humans.
So many migrating birds cross the Southeast that a new CDC study suggests southern Georgia could actually become a significant site for the virus: The coastal plains of Georgia, northern Florida and Alabama are winter habitat for some species that move through New Jersey and New York.
There have also been two fatal cases of viral encephalitis, transmitted by mosquitoes, in North Carolina this summer.
And south Florida, along with southern Texas, is consistently recording cases of dengue, a mosquito-borne tropical disease.
Authorities tracking the spread of emerging diseases fear the situation could get worse.
Many insect-borne diseases are kept under control by the arrival of cold temperatures, because most mosquitoes don't survive through winter.
But the planet is warming: A study done by malaria experts at Maastricht University in the Netherlands suggests that now-temperate parts of the planet, including the eastern U.S., will become friendlier environments for mosquitoes, and more vulnerable to the diseases they carry.
Georgia's risk of malaria, they predict, will rise 1.7 times by 2020.
Despite alarm over West Nile and other unrecognized diseases, public health experts stress that the potential for infection is largely under individuals' control.
Insect-borne diseases cannot imperil humans unless the insects are given the chance to bite.
``We recognize, in public health, that people are often willing to take risks, for instance smoking, that they themselves can control, and unwilling to accept risks where they feel they don't have any control, such as potentially being bitten by a mosquito,'' said Dr.
Susan Lance-Parker of the Georgia Division of Public Health.
``So I try to encourage people to know that the diseases are out there, that their chances of contracting them are small, and that there are things they can do to lower the risk further.
``They should put screens on their windows.
They should cover themselves when they go outside if they can, and use repellents if that is not possible.
And they should try to avoid being outside for extended periods during the time when the disease-bearing mosquitos are most likely to bite''.

ALBANY, N.Y.
(AP) - After confirming the West Nile virus in birds from five upstate counties, state health officials said Thursday the virus is likely present statewide.
''Since we are finding West Nile virus in birds in counties well outside of the area originally infected, and many birds are too young to fly far, it is likely that the virus is present throughout New York state,'' Health Commissioner Antonia C.
Novello said.
Crows that tested positive for the virus this week were in the Albany County town of Colonie, Warrensburg in Warren County, and in the Washington County town of Greenwich.
In Dutchess County, the virus was confirmed in a blue jay from Wappingers Falls and a sparrow from Putnam County, found in the town of Southeast.
Until the birds in Washington and Warren counties tested positive, the farthest north the virus had been found was in Ulster County and in Onondaga County, near Syracuse.
Novello said the news shouldn't unnecessarily alarm people.
But she said stagnant water where mosquitoes breed should be monitored and eliminated when possible.
State Wildlife Pathologist Ward Stone said the latest discoveries show the virus is here and the public should get used to dealing with it.
Most people interviewed Thursday agreed, particularly considering the heavy rains that have saturated the state and given mosquitoes ample breeding grounds.
''There's not much we can do,'' said Bob Foggo, manager of the Colonie Town Pool.
''There's been so much water it's hard to keep it under control...
we've been squeegeeing a lot''.
''I'd be more concerned with Lyme disease and that deer tick,'' said Arnie Whitcom, the maintenance man at the Colonie pool.
''I think Lyme disease is more of a threat,'' agreed Thelma Hansen, 50.
''We know Lyme disease is horrible''.
Some people who are infected with West Nile virus show no symptoms, but others suffer from flu-like symptoms.
West Nile can also cause encephalitis, a swelling of the brain.
The young and old and those with weakened immune systems are considered most susceptible to it.
Less than one percent of those infected will because seriously ill.
Last year, the first U.S. case of West Nile virus was reported in late August, and a total of seven people in the New York City area died and 62 were infected.
Hansen said that she would keep her two grandsons, ages nine and 15, covered in bug repellant and would try to cut the long grass in the back yard.
''It's been rainy every day, so it's kind of hard to get back and cut it,'' Hansen said.
So far this year, there have been no confirmed cases of humans infected with the virus.
Officials at Saratoga Race Course that draws thousands of people a day during its 36-day race meet, said they routinely spray for mosquitoes and flies drawn to the track's well-watered grass and manure piles.
''We're always vigilant,'' said Glen Mathes, spokesman for the New York Racing Association.
''If there's a need to do some more, we'll do it''.
The third and last scheduled spraying of the year was Tuesday.
In the wake of the state's announcement Thursday, NYRA may spray again.
''Really, all you can do is keep the mosquito population down,'' Mathes said.
''We'll do everything we can''.
Thomas Ciametta, executive director of Boys and Girls Clubs of Schenectady, said they routinely remove stagnant water from their locations by filling in road crevices and drilling holes in tire swings.
Mosquitoes can produce 4,000 times more offspring in tires than in other habitats, officials said.
In addition to getting rid of standing water, officials recommend wearing bug repellent limiting time spent outside to hours when mosquitoes are inactive.
''If you are working out in the yard early, with all this moisture, the mosquitoes are still out having breakfast on everyone at 9 a.m.,'' said Foggo of the Colonie pool.
As if to prove Foggo's point, Cathy Riccio waved at her 16-month-old son Matthew: ''He's full of mosquito bites.
He woke up with a bunch of them''.
The virus, commonly found in Africa, Eastern Europe, West Asia and the Middle East, is spread to humans by mosquitoes.
Its appearance in the New York area last year prompted a massive campaign of aerial and ground spraying to kill mosquitoes.
In Warren County, health officials will move immediately to address the problem, said Harold Robillard, commissioner of administrative and fiscal services.
He said the county will consider spraying for mosquitoes .
WASHINGTON _ A week after Senate Republicans killed sweeping anti-smoking legislation, House GOP leaders on Thursday outlined a scaled-down bill to persuade teens not to smoke and urge states to lift the driving licenses of teens who do.
Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, who headed a House Republican task force that drafted the outline, provided few details about how the plan would work, saying that no decisions have been made about how much it would cost or who would pay for it.
She said detailed legislation would be written by committee chairmen over the July 4th recess, which begins Friday and ends in mid-July.
The GOP leadership outline urges states to enact laws penalizing minors who smoke by suspending their drivers' licenses and requiring them to perform community service.
The plan was vague about the future powers of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco, though it specifically urged that the FDA have the power to regulate cigarette manufacturing.
The outline, which didn't mention any tax hikes to discourage smoking, appeared to have been timed so that Republican lawmakers could return to their districts over the July 4th recess and point to the outline as evidence that they are trying to do something to combat teen smoking.
Republican lawmakers face a potential public backlash because Senate Republicans took the lead last week in killing tough anti-smoking legislation managed by Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz.
That bill would have raised the price of cigarettes by at least $1.10 a pack, expanded the federal government's ability to regulate tobacco advertising and marketing and imposed financial penalties on cigarette makers if they failed to reduce teen smoking.
The House GOP outline was considerably less ambitious.
Under the GOP plan, the director of the White House office of drug policy _ the ``drug czar'' _ would launch an anti-smoking and anti-drug publicity campaign, Pryce said.
``We want to show kids that smoking is dumb,'' Pryce said.
Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, a member of the House leadership and a smoker himself, said the bill would seek to reduce underage smoking, but he added: ``Teen-agers are going to smoke.
It's one of those rites of passage, if you will''.
Boehner also said the bill would not settle lawsuits against tobacco companies by state attorneys general or offer the industry any protection from lawsuits.
``That's not our business,'' Boehner said in an interview.
``This is an ongoing effort to go after what the American people want''.
The plan also would allow states to keep any money they win as a result of lawsuits against the tobacco companies, if their legal fees are ``reasonable'' and ``documented''.
Those suits typically seek reimbursement for state health-related costs, such as Medicaid payments.
House Democratic Leader Richard A.
Gephardt, D-Mo.
, denounced the Republican plan as ``an unprincipled attempt to spare tobacco companies from effective regulation''.
``Instead of penalizing the tobacco companies for marketing their deadly wares to kids, they want to punish the kids who smoke,'' Gephardt said.
``This is a classic case of blaming the victim instead of the perpetrator''.
Gephardt said the Republican plan fails to give full authority to the FDA to regulate cigarettes, fails to propose penalties if tobacco companies don't curb teen smoking, and fails to restrict the industry from marketing to children.
Long-time tobacco foe Rep.
Henry A.
Waxman, D-Calif.
, called the House Republican plan ``a sham'' designed to provide Republicans with political cover in the November elections.
``It's a fraud,'' Waxman said in an interview.
``But worse, it's a step backwards''.
Waxman said the Republican plan only ``pretends'' to give the Food and Drug Administration jurisdiction by allowing it to regulate cigarette manufacturing.
``This is a payback to the tobacco companies for the $12 million that Republicans have received in political contributions since 1995,'' Waxman said.
But Rep.
James V.
Hansen, R-Utah, who has sponsored a tough anti-smoking bill along with Waxman and Rep.
Marty Meehan, D-Mass.
, that would boost the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.50, was more positive about the Republican leadership's plan.
``The leadership proposal is only a very rough skeleton,'' Hansen said.
``I think we can work this out''.
McCain said in an interview that the House GOP proposal falls short in several areas.
For example, McCain said revoking driving licenses of teen smokers would do little to stop tobacco use by those too young to drive.
``What do you do with 15, 14, 13 and 12-year-olds''? he said.
McCain also said he is skeptical that any anti-smoking bill would discourage underage smoking unless it hikes tobacco prices.
``I know of no one who believes that you can effectively address the kid's smoking issue without raising the price of cigarettes,'' McCain said.
CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Love her or loathe her, she is impossible to ignore.
From taking on the tobacco industry to importing Cuban doctors, Dr.
Nkosazana Zuma, South Africa's first black Minister of Health, is at the center of most government controversies.
On Thursday she notched her latest victory when the upper house of Parliament gave final approval to one of the world's toughest anti-smoking laws, which bans lighting up in public places and all tobacco advertising.
It awaits President Nelson Mandela's approval.
In some ways she typifies the leadership of the governing African National Congress as it gears up for national elections next year, which it likely will sweep.
Transformed from liberation fighter to government minister, Zuma and her colleagues still display sometimes defensive mentality that marked the struggle for survival under the onslaught of apartheid.
Zuma summed up her own attitude during a parliamentary debate earlier this year when she lambasted opposition lawmakers for demonizing her and insisted she would not ``somehow disappear''.
``Forget about the person and look at the issues,'' she snapped.
Zuma accuses her detractors of defending elitism and past privileges.
The battlefields of the fight against white rule may have shifted to the corridors of power, but the language is the same.
``If you protest her policies, she calls you a racist, or says you oppose transformation,'' said David Morrell of the South African Medical Association ``Every change she makes seems to carry some threat''.
To critics she is the ``nanny of the nation,'' an interfering, power-hungry busybody who wants to ban smoking in public and whose mistake prone department squanders millions of rand (dollars).
Recent criticism came from researchers who attacked her decision to end funding for expensive AZT treatments for HIV-positive pregnant women to reduce the risk of passing on the virus to their children.
Zuma said the money was better spent on prevention.
While often sympathizing with Zuma's aims, doctors agree she appears dictatorial and refuses to listen to the other side.
``Her ideals are wonderful,'' said Morrell.
``But relations are very strained.
She seems to regard doctors as adversaries''.
Some of the abuse is vulgar.
An edition of sex magazine Hustler had its sales restricted after printing a picture of Zuma's face and urging readers to urinate on it.
The article was protesting anti-tobacco legislation.
But for her defenders, Zuma is the champion of the poor who overhauled a racist health system and brought basic health care to millions of blacks ignored during apartheid.
Given her fondness for simple clothes and unadorned hair styles, Zuma, 49, seems an unlikely revolutionary.
But change has come quickly in her four years at the helm since all-race elections in 1994 ended apartheid.
Within months of taking office, she made primary health care free for pregnant women and children under six.
By 1996 it was free for all South Africans.
Shifting resources from wealthy hospitals mainly serving whites, Zuma launched a campaign to build clinics in poor rural areas.
By the end of 1997 more than 350 had been built, compared to 17 in the last year of white rule.
``We have brought health care into parts of the country that never had it before,'' said Zuma's spokesman Vincent Hlongwane.
Born in KwaZulu-Natal, Zuma was the oldest child in a family of eight headed by a primary school teacher.
She won a place at medical school, but left the country to join the ANC in exile and finished her degree in Britain.
From the start Zuma hit the headlines after sponsoring an AIDS awareness musical that cost one-fifth of the government's AIDS budget and was shut down due to mishandling the tender for the lavish production.
Other scandals followed, including her backing of anti-AIDS drug Virodene, which contains a potentially cancerous industrial solvent.
But she has hung with the full backing of Mandela, and likely will stay on in the job after the elections.
TRENTON, N.J.
(AP) - Gov.
Christie Whitman on Tuesday snuffed out a bill that would have slapped fines on teens who smoke in public, suggesting it could have done more harm than good.
The governor also vetoed a bill that would have gone after underage drinkers in private homes, saying it would have taken the long arm of state government "too far into private family conduct".
Both bills were pushed by lawmakers who said more needs to be done to curb teen smoking and drinking.
In both cases, Whitman essentially said: Good idea, but not the best plan of attack.
Because both bills passed in the waning days of the 208th Legislature, Whitman's vetoes stand.
Lawmakers can introduce the bills again during the current two-year session.
The smoking bill, A-2254, would have forbidden underage smokers from possessing cigarettes in public places such as streets, schools, parks and shopping centers.
Underage smokers caught puffing in public or possessing tobacco products could have been hit with a $25 fine for first-time offenders.
The fine would have been suspended, however, until a minor attended a class that teaches why smoking is bad.
Repeat offenders would have been ordered to perform up to 15 hours of community service.
Sponsors said the bill was intended to send a strong message about smoking to teens.
However, anti-smoking groups opposed the bill, saying no studies show such a crackdown actually cuts down on youth smoking.
Whitman said in her veto message that anti-smoking groups told her "this is not the most effective or efficient use of public resources to combat smoking by young people".
The governor also said she worried that the bill "may inadvertently harm community policing efforts aimed at building positive relationships between police and juveniles, and will draw youths into the municipal court system".
Assemblyman Joseph Suliga, D-Union, a sponsor of the bipartisan bill, said he believed it was killed "by misinformation".
"Every year New Jersey continues to delay measures that keep young people away from tobacco, another 36,000 kids will begin smoking," Suliga said.
"Obviously, the steps that have been undertaken in reducing tobacco's appeal to youngsters have not had much impact.
The primary purpose of my bill was to break outside the bounds of traditional youth tobacco control programs and educate kids on the immediate consequences of smoking".
Suliga said some police chiefs told him the bill would not harm community police efforts.
Larry Downs, director of NJ Breathes, an anti-smoking group, said the bill's "unintended effect" would have been to send the message that tobacco use is acceptable for those who turn 18.
"There is no research that says this approach was going to work," said Downs.
"We'd rather see the money go to good tobacco control policies".
Whitman also vetoed S-1617, which lawmakers said would crack down on underage drinkers who imbibe in private homes.
Underage drinking is already prohibited in public places, and sponsors said this bill would solve a problem they say is particularly acute during summers at the Jersey shore.
The governor, however, said the bill could go too far.
"I am concerned that the prohibitions could be construed to apply to situations in which an underage person consumes even a small amount of alcohol under the watchful eye of an adult family member, such as a grandparent," Whitman said.
"Application of this bill in such situations may intrude too far into private family conduct."
AMMAN, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordan, where one in four smokes, has complained of a great loss caused by smoking.
Jordanian Anti-Smoking Society President Mohammad Shreim told a seminar Sunday that smoking costs Jordan at least 166 million Jordanian dinars (about 234 million U.S. dollars) a year in economic and public health losses.
The seminar was held to mark the International Anti-Smoking Day.
The figure was far more than the sum of revenues collected from domestic cigarette production and imports, Shreim was quoted by the semi-official Jordan Times Monday.
Jordan's cigarette imports stand at 90 million dinars (about 127 million dollars) every year.
Smokers in Jordan, accounting for nearly one-fourth of its 4.5 million inhabitants, spend 134 million dinars (about 190 million dollars) on cigarettes every year, Shreim said.
Mohammad Ali Khan, who represents the World Health Organization at the seminar, said that Jordan has also found common grounds with other Middle East countries in the fact that the majority of its youths have slid into smoking.
The fact predicted a worse picture of economic and public health situation for the kingdom in the future, he added.
Jordan has enacted law banning smoking in public places, but many people ignore.
Meanwhile, smuggling of foreign-made cigarettes is rampant in the country.
TRENTON, N.J.
(AP) - A handful of New Jersey towns considering developing local smoking bans may have second thoughts after last week's court ruling striking down Princeton's broad anti-smoking ordinance.
''It will certainly put a damper on and intimidate the (communities considering new local smoking restrictions) from moving ahead,'' Regina Carlson, executive director of the anti-smoking nonprofit New Jersey GASP, told The Times of Trenton for Monday's editions.
Bans are in place already in several towns, but none of the existing anti-smoking ordinances are as sweeping as the one in Princeton, which would have been the strictest in the state.
It prohibited lighting up in bars, restaurants and workplaces, restricting smoking to homes, cigar shops or outdoors.
Violators faced fines from $100 to $1,000.
In the 64-page ruling, Superior Court Assignment Judge Linda R.
Feinberg said the Princeton Regional Health Commission did not have the authority to enact the ban for fire-safety purposes.
The judge also held that the ordinance is pre-empted by state law.
Carlson said a few New Jersey towns - including Cherry Hill and Ocean City - had considered implementing a similar ban, but were waiting for the outcome of the Princeton case.
Ocean City Mayor Henry Knight said the proposed anti-smoking measure there likely will be dropped following the advice of the city solicitor.
Rutgers University law professor Robert Williams said the future of anti-smoking laws in other towns depends on whether the decision last Tuesday is upheld on appeal.
''It's only one judge's decision until there's a more authoritative decision from an appeals court,'' he said.
The health commission has not yet decided whether to appeal.
ROME, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Lighting up in public and private indoor areas throughout Italy could draw hefty fines under a smoking ban that was formally approved Friday by Italy's cabinet.
The sweeping ban allows for designated smoking zones in ventilated areas, but calls for stiff fines against those who violate the ban.
All publicly and privately owned indoor places open to the public are covered by the bill, including bars, restaurants, prisons and police stations.
Owners, managers and designated "smoke-busters" who fail to apply the norms are also subject to fines though the cabinet Friday agreed to reduce the penalty.
The proposed fines would range from 100,000-300,000 lire (about 50-150 U.S. dollars) for anyone who lights up.
The ban was drafted by Italian Health Minister Umberto Veronesi and previously approved on first reading by the cabinet and by the State-Region Conference, and it will go into effect after being upheld by the parliament.
Veronesi, one of Europe's leading cancer specialists, has announced a crusade against smoking, saying that too many Italians still die of lung cancer caused by cigarette smoke.
An estimated 1 million people, or 24.5 percent of the population, in Italy smoke cigarettes though figures compiled by the national statistics bureau Istat show that the percentage of smokers nationwide has fallen by nearly 1 percent since 1993.
According to Veronesi, the proceeds from the fines will be used to fund anti-smoking campaigns, Veronese said.
MACAO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A new law on the restriction of smoking, which extends non-smoking areas and limits advertisement of cigarettes, has been passed by the Macao legislative Assembly and will become effective from January 1, 1997.
The new law has extended the non-smoking area to all places for health care, whether public or private, including clinics, chemist's shops and ambulance, places for people of under 16 years old, places producing or marketing inflammables, libraries, museums, public meeting halls, reading rooms, exhibition halls and within taxicabs.
In addition, it rules that smoking is also banned in all passenger transportation vehicles, like buses and ships, and places for public reception.
Violators of the rules will be fined between 250 Patacas (about 31.6 US dollars) and 10,000 Patacas (about 1,265.8 US dollars).
Fines will double if the violator is found to have violated the rules for a second time within three months.
Meanwhile, the law also imposes more strict restrictions over the advertisement of cigarettes.
The number of smokers in Macao has been rising over recent years, and people have called for a more effective restriction on smoking.
BONN, February 5 (xinhua) -- The German parliament Thursday rejected a tough anti-smoking bill which tried to make public places, buses and working places free of smoking in Germany.
Of the 626 deputies who cast ballots, 336 voted against the bill, 256 voted for it, and 34 abstained.
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Beijing legislators have passed a smoking ban, stepping to the forefront of keeping tobacco out of offices.
The ban is scheduled to take effect next Wednesday in public places such as hospitals, schools, cinemas, department stores, and public conveyances.
More than 30 "no-smoking" signs have been placed inside buildings of the Municipal People's Congress, the local legislative body, since it passed the ban last December.
Cigarettes were banned from all offices and meeting rooms of the MPC as soon as it published news of the regulation.
Buildings of the municipal government and the Municipal Communist Party Committee have also become smoke-free areas, meaning that smokers are allowed to satisfy their craving only in designated smoking areas.
The city has asked all government office workers to set an example in the citywide anti-smoking drive, which is expected to be a long and trying time for millions of smokers.
More than 80,000 volunteers will be on duty in no-smoking areas from next week to levy a ten-yuan (a little more than one US dollar) fine on those who break the rules.
NEW YORK (AP) _ Smokers on the go are always a step ahead in plotting when and where they can get that next nicotine fix.
On a day-trip with the kids in the back of the car and a wife with an attitude about second-hand smoke, they finesse with frequent pit stops blamed on the bladder.
But deep dread sets in when boarding a U.S. airliner and some foreign carriers, knowing there is no finesse.
That's a given.
But what is less defined are the anti-smoking laws in the countries you plan to visit.
They vary greatly and often are winked at.
Authorities in Singapore are determined to make the city-state the world's first smoke-free nation.
To that end, smokers can be slapped with a dlrs 600 fine just for lighting up while waiting in line for a bus or taxi.
On the other hand, smokers in Japan are allowed for the most part to light up when and where they please.
Could that be because the powerful Ministry of Finance owns two-thirds of the stock in Japan Tobacco, which controls nearly 80 percent of the cigarette market?
There's also a smoker-friendly atmosphere in Egypt, where the government owns the country's biggest cigarette company.
A reporter who was covering Israel's Knesset (parliament) when it passed a law banning smoking in elevators, among other public places, recalls riding an elevator with the minister of police, Haim Bar-Lev, holding a lighted cigar.
``How can you smoke in the elevator''? the reporter asked.
``Shouldn't you be setting an example of compliance with the new law''?
Haim Bar-Lev smiled and replied: ``The law says I mustn't smoke in the elevator.
It doesn't say I mustn't hold my cigar in the elevator''.
He later died of cancer while ambassador in Moscow.
A newswoman in a small restaurant in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was sitting beneath a ``No Fumar'' sign.
She asked the waiter if there was someplace else she could smoke.
``The waiter promptly lifted the sign off the wall and urged me to go ahead and smoke,'' she says.
``There weren't any other customers, so I did''.
In Montreal, once a smokers' haven, there's a move afoot to restrict smoking in restaurants and most public places.
That bothers Frank Valente, a restaurateur who fears business will suffer.
``The nonsmoker will have a coffee,'' he says, ``The smoker will have three cognacs and two coffees, then he'll have a bottle of wine with dinner''.
For the benefit of smokers _ and nonsmokers _ who travel, we asked AP correspondents around the globe to summarize the smoking laws where they are stationed.
This is their report, with the countries in alphabetical order: AUSTRALIA: Even pubs are succumbing to creeping anti-smoke sentiment, with bar workers' unions in Sydney suggesting that employers should be legally liable if workers end up with lung disease.
Smoking is outlawed in most public places and offices, and the heaps of butts at back doors and loading docks indicate compliance.
BELGIUM: Enter a restaurant in Brussels and one question you will never hear is: ``Smoking or nonsmoking''?
Belgian law bans or curbs smoking in public places, but enforcement is sloppy, violations rampant.
Belgians are simply not bothered by anti-smoking rules, and complaints from nonsmokers are often treated with disdain.
BRAZIL: A recent ban on smoking in public buildings and on short flights is widely ignored.
Smokers routinely light up in shopping malls and waiting rooms, and the ``No Smoking'' section in planes often exists only in theory.
Cigarette ads on TV must carry a health warning, but often it's no more than ``Avoid smoking around small children''.
Brazil is a major producer and exporter of tobacco.
CANADA: Toronto tried to become Canada's first city to ban smoking in bars and restaurants but backed down last year in the face of widespread defiance.
In smoker-friendly Montreal, provincial legislation in the works would outlaw smoking in most public places and require restaurants to allocate at least 60 percent of their seats to nonsmokers.
CHINA: With 320 million smokers, smoking is the closest thing China has to a national pastime.
Lighting up in the Forbidden City, on a subway train, or other very public places can risk a small fine, perhaps 60 cents to dlrs 1.20 (5 to 10 yuan), but generally the 1996 ban on smoking in public places is ignored.
DENMARK: Although smoking is banned in hospitals, public transportation and shops, Danes can still have a puff in Copenhagen cafes and restaurants so long as they don't bother others.
Most offices have a smoking room and, if colleagues don't mind, smokers can light up at their desks.
EGYPT: Smokers puff away almost anywhere: on buses, in elevators, next to ``No Smoking'' signs.
The government regularly announces anti-smoking drives, but it owns the biggest cigarette company, too.
Its newest brand, Toshka, is named for a vast government plan to turn Egypt's desert into farmland _ perhaps for growing tobacco?
FRANCE: Smoke-filled cafes are still pretty much the norm.
But thanks to a 1991 law, the haze is starting to clear.
Smoking is prohibited in subways, trains, airplanes, hospitals and public places.
Though some still light up in those places, it's happening less and less.
Officials at the National Committee Against Smoking say the biggest headache remains the workplace, where it's up to the boss to enforce the law.

BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A total of 79 provinces and cities in China have formulated regulations banning smoking in public places, a senior Chinese health official announced today.
Zhang Wenkang, minister of Health, made the announcement in a written speech marking the 11th "World No Tobacco Day", which falls on today.
Zhang said that provinces and cities which have formulated smoking-ban regulations include the provinces of Shanxi, Jilin, Shandong, Jiangxi and Fujian, the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing, and 70 provincial capitals such as Guangzhou and Wuhan, as well as medium- and small-sized cities.
China has about 320 million smokers.
A survey shows that over 90 percent of smokers smoke in public places.
Since smoking in a public place causes serious secondary smoking and has a bad impact on youngsters, China has taken the ban on smoking in public places as a key part of the ban on smoking in public places in its anti-smoking effort.
A regulation banning smoking in public transport means and waiting areas was enacted in last May.
However, these "smoking-control" cities only account for one-eighth of all the country's cities, according to an official with the National Committee for Patriotic Health campaign (NCPHC), who described it as a "long-term and arduous" task to promote work in this regard in all cities.
Lu Ming with the NCPHC said that the rapid development of the country's tobacco industry in recent years has resulted in a substantial increase in the number of smokers.
A survey shows that the ratio of adolescent and youth smokers in the age group of 15-25 increased by six percentage points in 1996 over 1984, and the average age for smoking the first cigarette moved to 19.7 from 22.4.
However, Lu pointed out, China's efforts to control smoking is gaining increasing support from both smokers and non-smokers.
According to a survey, 84 percent of the smokers and 89 percent of the non-smokers have become aware of the hazard caused by smoking to health.
Meanwhile, 74 percent of the correspondents support government's effort to ban smoking in public places.
The Beijing Municipal Committee for Patriotic Health Campaign awarded today a group of "smoking-free" schools and a group of educators who have done a good job in promoting smoking-control efforts.
Activities to publicize the knowledge that smoking is hazardous to health and keeping youngsters away from cigarettes were also conducted in busy commercial districts in the Chinese capital today.
TIANJIN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that the majority of Tianjin residents have hailed the "No-Smoking" regulation that goes into effect in public places this autumn.
The survey, conducted by the Tianjin Academy of Social Sciences, revealed that 95.7 percent of the respondents were in favor of the ban.
The supporters include 93.1 percent male and 98.5 percent female of those polled.
Nearly 92 percent of the people who smoke also expressed their support for the anti-smoke movement.
"I have smoked for a long time, and it does great harm to my health.
I hope young people will abstain from smoking," said a 59-year-old housewife.
According to the survey, nearly 47 percent of the citizens over age 15 are smokers, as against the country's average rate of 33.8 percent.
The figures showed that smokers account for 21.7-23.6 percent of local high school students, 16.7-18.6 percent of secondary school students, and even 2.01-9.8 percent of primary school pupils.
Each smoker in the city spends an average of 58 yuan on cigarettes, which amounts to 17 percent of their monthly expenditure.
The regulation on anti-smoking in public, which has been passed by the standing committee of the local People's Congress, will go into effect on October 15.
About 81.5 percent of the people polled believe the new regulation will help smokers kick the habit; 91.2 percent believe that it will help primary and secondary students stop smoking.
Many smokers have given up their long-term habit since the current anti-smoking regulations went into effect in Beijing and Shanghai, where many cigarette stalls reported low sales.
CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ No smoking in enclosed public places except in designated areas.
No tobacco advertising.
Even ads for non-tobacco products would not be allowed to show people smoking cigarettes.
Such is life in South Africa envisioned by one of the world's strictest anti-smoking bills, which parliament's lower house approved on Wednesday.
Parliament's upper house has already passed the bill proposed by President Nelson Mandela's health minister.
It must now reconsider it due to some last-minute amendments.
Final passage appeared assured.
``It is just a formality,'' said one dejected lawmaker, Ruth Rabinowitz of the Inkatha Freedom Party, which voted against the bill.
But tobacco industry groups and their supporters are likely to mount a constitutional challenge to the bill, which could delay it becoming law or perhaps kill it altogether.
Opponents say the bill infringes individual and free-trade rights.
All but one of the opposition parties in the National Assembly opposed the bill on Wednesday, but the ruling African National Congress' hefty majority ensured a victory.
It was approved by 213 votes to 106.
``Fundamental fanatacism has won the day,'' rued the National Party, which ruled under apartheid and whose last president, F.W. de Klerk, was a chain smoker.
Although the two sides remained deeply divided, the day had its light moments.
ANC lawmaker Kader Asmal evoked laughter when he spoke in support of the bill, saying it didn't ban smoking altogether but just ``privatized pleasure''.
Asmal smoked for 50 years until giving up under a doctor's orders earlier this year.
When the house speaker announced absent lawmakers would be given five minutes to appear for the vote, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel asked whether the time could be used for a smoke break.
Manuel is not known to be a smoker, and he did not join a handful of lawmakers who hurried out of the chamber to sneak a quick puff below a nearby flight of stairs.
Parliament banned smoking in most public areas of the building, including the area below the stairs, several months ago.
During debate on Tuesday, Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma declared ``the social cost of continued indulgence in the destructive habit of smoking is prohibitively high''.
The bill outlaws smoking in enclosed public places like train stations and shopping malls and in the workplace.
It provides exemptions where well ventilated and separate facilities are created for those desperate for a puff.
Bars and restaurants with designated smoking areas also would escape the ban.
The planned law bans all tobacco advertising and sponsorship.
Even ads for products such as drinks and clothes would be banned from showing people smoking.
The maximum fine for smoking at work or in public places would be 200 rand (dlrs 35).
Advertising violations could generate fines of up to 200,000 rand (dlrs 35,000).
Cigarette advertisements in South Africa on billboards and the print media already must prominently display such warnings as ``DANGER: SMOKING CAN KILL YOU,'' or ``DANGER: SMOKING CAUSES CANCER''.
The tobacco industry, advertising groups and some unions oppose the bill and are vowing a fight. (ph-aos)
CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A drastic anti-smoking bill cleared a key legislative hurdle in Parliament on Friday, paving the way for clamp downs on advertising and tobacco use at work and public places.
A health committee approved the bill that has been fiercely opposed by the tobacco industry, media and advertising groups and some unions.
The planned law, one of the toughest in the world, bans all tobacco advertising.
It outlaws smoking in public and the workplace, but provides exemptions where well ventilated and separate facilities are created for workers desperate for a puff.
Bars and restaurants with designated smoking areas also would escape the ban, said committee member Ruth Rabinowitz.
A lawmaker with the minority Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party, Rabinowitz said she abstained from voting because her party had not taken a position on the bill.
But she said she personally considers the bill too extreme.
``Its intentions are good, but it is not good law making,'' she said ``Some of it is far too draconian''.
Opposition lawmakers oppose the bill, but the ruling African National Congress' overwhelming majority guarantees passage of its bills through all committees.
Tobacco industry groups and their supporters are likely to mount a constitutional challenge to the law, which is expected to be passed by full Parliament early next month.
The panel approved minor amendments to lighten the bill, such as granting permission for tobacco logos to be displayed on clothing.
But it tightened other areas, banning all advertising from showing tobacco use, even if the product is not tobacco related.
The top fine for smoking at work or in public places would be 200 rand (dlrs 35).
Advertising violations could generate fines of up to 200,000 rand (dlrs 35,000). (ph-pr)
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police in Thailand have announced they will start enforcing a law banning smoking in public places, Thai newspapers reported Wednesday.
Assistant city police commissioner Maj.
Jongrak Juthanon announced the policy after meeting the head of the government's anti-smoking body, Dr.
Waraporn Pumisawat, who complained that the ban was not being enforced, the newspaper The Nation reported.
The Non-smokers' Health Protection Act and the Tobacco Products Control Act came into effect earlier this year.
They impose fines of 2,000-20,000 baht (dlrs 50-dlrs 500) for smoking in such places as government offices, buses, malls, supermarkets, barbershops, tailor shops, beauty salons and drug stores.
Restaurateurs who do not arrange non-smoking areas in their restaurants will also be fined.
said the Bangkok Post.
Police Maj.
Jongrak was quoted as saying that police initially would apply light penalties against offenders in an effort to raise public awareness.
NEW YORK _ Since the city banned smoking in restaurants in 1995, restaurateurs have complained that the prohibition is bad for business.
On Monday, a group of academic researchers, admittedly anti-smoking ones, released a series of six analyses suggesting that the ban has not hurt.
The studies indicated that the anti-smoking law, which took effect on April 10, 1995, has had no effect on local sales, job growth or income.
The studies, which were financed by the Substance Abuse Policy Research Program, which receives money from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, showed that restaurant industry jobs rose 18 percent from 1993 to 1997, to 19,347.
During the same period, sales tax receipts rose 2 percent at restaurants in the city but dropped 4 percent in the rest of the state.
The number of restaurants in the city during that period increased 6 percent.
At a news conference, the researchers characterized their work as the first comprehensive look at the city's ban on smoking in restaurants with 35 or more seats.
They said earlier studies suggesting economic harm were smaller and were financed by the tobacco industry.
``Local officials can now go about their business of protecting the public from the toxins in second-hand smoke without worrying about this phony issue,'' said Dr.
Stanton Glantz, who wrote an editorial accompanying the articles, which are published in the January issue of Public Health Management and Practice.
Mike O'Neal, who owns O'Neal's restaurant on West 64th Street, near Lincoln Center, supported the ban, saying it has helped his business.
``If 75 percent of people don't smoke and 25 percent do, that means 75 percent are going to eat out more and 25 percent are going to eat out less,'' he said at the news conference.
Others in the restaurant industry took sharp issue with the studies' methodology and conclusions.
Scott Wexler, executive director of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, a trade group, said in an interview that his group sponsored a study in 1996 that showed jobs at city restaurants declining 4 percent.
He said that since his group's study examined statistics for the months just before and after the law took effect, it could isolate more fairly the ``cataclysmic'' influence of the smoking ban on business.
Wexler said his group's study showed retail jobs going up 2 percent at the same time that restaurant jobs dropped 4 percent, suggesting that something beyond general economic trends was at work, he said.
Dan Tubridy, who owns Pier 92, a restaurant in Rockaway Beach, Queens, said in an interview that he lost customers immediately.
``They said that if they couldn't eat at my place they were going to Nassau County, pure and simple,'' he said.
``And you know what happens?
They don't come back''.
Wexler also pointed out that 8,000 of 15,000 restaurants included in the overall sales tax figures were small enough to allow smoking or were primarily bars, where smoking is also allowed.
The study conducted by Dr.
Andrew Hyland, a biostatistician, and two colleagues at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, acknowledged this limitation.
The restaurant trade group is heavily supported by the Tobacco Institute, which recently admitted funneling $443,072 to the group, after earlier claiming a far lower amount.
The money was used to lobby the state Legislature for less stringent laws than the city's.
The studies also concluded that the law has been enforced very effectively.
An examination of city records, one study said, showed that city health inspectors found smoking at only 2 percent of the 251 restaurants they visited.
Another study indicated that 90 percent of restaurant owners reported that their indoor areas were smoke-free.
Three out of four restaurateurs reported that complying with the law cost them no money.
Several researchers said the next step would be a dual effort: to pass laws like the city's in other counties, and to extend the city law to bars, both those within restaurants and free-standing ones.
``A bar is a workplace,'' said Dr.
John Seffin, chief executive of the American Cancer Society.
``You should not be allowed to smoke in a workplace.''
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Cigarette smoking in public has been outlawed in 71 major Chinese cities and three provinces, according the Chinese Association on Smoking &AMP; Health.
"We believe the number of cities and province banning smoking at public places will go higher soon because the whole country is promoting an anti-smoking drive," Han Changlin, vice-president of the association, told Xinhua today.
The smoking bans of these places mainly cover public transportation facilities, schools, cinemas, theaters, meeting halls, hospitals, department stores, museums, stadiums, and so on.
Many big cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing municipalities, and Guangzhou, Wuhan and Xi'an and other cities took similar measures after Changzhi of north China's Shanxi Province initiated the no-smoking law in November, 1989.
The local legislative bodies passed regulations, or city governments published orders, to prohibit tobacco use in public.
The provinces of Shanxi, Jilin, and Shandong also enacted the smoking bans.
"It is urgent to step up anti-smoking measures, since smoking and second-hand smoking have become a serious public health hazard in China," Minister of Health Chen Minzhang said earlier this month.
Health officials and experts said to ban smoking in public places should play a leading role in the anti-tobacco campaign in the country.
China has some 350 million smokers and more than 400 million passive smokers, and the rate of teenage smoking is still on rise.
Over 70 percent of lung cancer cases resulted from smoking, according to a study conducted by the Cancer Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.
Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer in Chinese cities with a population of more than one million, "Death toll related to tobacco use will climb to two million annually by the year 2020, from some 500,000 at present, if we don't take actions immediately," Minister Chen warned.
Chinese authorities in charge of health and transportation have jointly prohibited tobacco from passenger trains, ships, planes, buses, subways, taxi cabs, ferry boats, cable cars, and waiting rooms at railway stations, airports, and seaports, from May 1.
The action is a strong support to the country's endevours to create a clean and no-smoking environment for the Chinese people, the health officials said.
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Tomorrow will mark the start of hard times for more than two million smokers in the Chinese capital, when public places just say "no" to smoking tomorrow.
A local smoking ban will go into effect tomorrow, and "No smoking" signs and admonitory slogans will be seen on major streets, at busy shopping areas, and in public places in Beijing.
Some 80,000 people will go to the areas to enforce the ban tomorrow, stopping and fining offenders.
The ban was passed by the Municipal People's Congress, the local legislative body, last December, and has gained wide support, although half the adult males are still smoking, and the number of women and teenagers who puff is on the rise.
A massive publicity campaign backed by media coverage was begun several years ago to make people aware of the adverse effects of smoking and to encourage them to stop.
Of course, chewing gum companies have been eager to take the opportunity to cash in, collecting money that used to be used to support the habit.
Different types of gum began appearing and being heavily advertised in recent times, selling themselves as "good companions" to those who want to kick the habit.
A recent survey of 9,408 citizens found that about 94 percent endorsed the ban, because they believe that smoking not only harms smokers' health but also that of people nearby.
Officials, government employees, medical personnel, and teachers have taken the lead in the fight against smoking, according to the Beijing Patriotic Public Health Campaign Committee, headquarters of the anti-smoking drive, and about 500 schools, hospitals, department stores, and other units have adopted measures to become "smoke-free units", according to the committee.
TORONTO (AP) -- Photos of diseased organs would cover up to 50 percent of cigarette packaging under a proposal expected to be announced on Canada's national anti-smoking day, ``Weedless Wednesday''.
Health Minister Alan Rock has been studying the matter for more than a year, and persistent news reports said he would formally propose the new warning regulations on Wednesday.
A ministry spokesman refused to comment on the proposal.
If approved by the government after public hearings and other steps in the regulatory process, the warnings would be the first anywhere to include graphic photos of diseased organs, according to Cynthia Callard of Physicians for a Smoke-Free Canada.
``Showing a picture of a brain that's been destroyed is a much stronger way of getting the message across,'' she said.
Canada has stiffened anti-smoking regulations in recent years.
Smoking is generally prohibited in public places such as government buildings and auditoriums, and some areas ban smoking in bars and restaurants.
Health warnings on cigarettes were required until the Supreme Court in 1995 struck down portions of the Tobacco Products Control Act as unconstitutional.
Cigarette makers continued including health warnings voluntarily, and a new Tobacco Act passed in 1997 left it to the government to impose any regulations on health warnings.
The tobacco industry has challenged other aspects of the 1997 Tobacco Act in court, contending it amounts to a ban on cigarette advertising and therefore infringes on free expression guaranteed by the Charter of Rights.
The case is pending.
Robert Parker, president of the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturer's Council, was quoted by The Globe and Mail newspaper as saying that the industry has been left out of consultations on the government's health warning plans.
He questioned whether the graphic images under consideration could be reproduced on packages, and said the industry previously agreed with the government that cigarette packages should have warnings but disagreed over what the warnings should say and how large they should be.
In the United States, cigarette makers are required to include warning labels on packages.
Two U.S. senators, Democrat Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Republican Richard Lugar of Indiana, intend to propose legislation this year that would require the warnings to be worded more clearly and directly, and to include a list of all ingredients and cancer-causing agents in cigarettes, Lautenberg's office said Wednesday.
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Sun Guihua failed to find a single smoker to fine in a big Beijing department store, even though she searched among the bustle of shoppers for several hours.
Sun was happy about her work anyway, saying: "It shows that almost all people know about the regulation and observe it".
The regulation she was referring to, which took effect today, bans smoking in public places.
To enforce it and to fine offenders, a small army of more than 80,000 people like Sun was sent to department stores, hospitals, schools, railway stations, and other public places.
The air in packed waiting rooms at the Beijing Railway Station used to be filled with smoke, but now look cleaner and smell better.
"I have to go outside to take a cigarette because of the 'no smoking' signs everywhere," a traveller waiting for his train said, shrugging.
That sign and others have been placed in easy-to-see locations on major streets, in busy shopping areas, and in public places around the city, for several months.
There were even people handing out millions of pamphlets on the street to make people aware of the adverse effects of smoking and advising them to avoid it.
"I feel relieved because I will no longer be surrounded by clouds of cigarette smoke in offices and meeting rooms," said a passer-by who stopped at one information site on Chang'an Avenue.
A government office worker was another beneficiary of the massive anti-smoking drive: "I don't need to clean ash trays full of cigarette butts from now on, because nobody will use them anymore," she remarked while cleaning up a meeting room.
"I'm thinking of smoking less and trying to quit," Tian Yong, vice president of the Beijing No.
4 Middle School and a veteran of 26 years of smoking, told Xinhua.
He said he thinks stopping teachers from smoking at school is vital to providing a healthy example for students.
LOS ANGELES, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The first day of the introduction of the law which bans smoking in California's bars and nightclubs ended with mixed reactions from the public.
The new anti-smoking law, the strongest in the United States, went into effect in the small hours on January 1, 1998.
The ban stems from California's indoor workplace smoking prohibition that started in 1994.
According to the new law, bar owners will be fined up to 100 U.S. dollars for the first offense and 7,000 dollars for the second violation.
Reporters from local newspapers based in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and other cities spent much time in New Year's Day in bars which were packed with patrons to interview with smokers, non-smokers, bar owners and policemen.
In some bars, smokers went right on smoking despite waitresses had confiscated ashtrays at midnight.
But in other bars, customers got in their last puffs before midnight, and then the smoke cleared.
An organization called Californians for Smokers' Rights issued a statement on Thursday, calling for the repeal of the law.
The organization argued, "the law deprives smokers of the right to consume a legal product within a private establishment".
But other smokers seem not so assured.
Although complaining and cursing the law, they smoked out of the bars.
Some people also said that they would quit smoking because of the new law.
The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency urged residents to embrace the law and report violations.
Anti-smoking activists were confident that people will become accustomed to the law.
However, owners of bars and restaurants argued that the ban would severely hurt their business.
California's Health Department hoped that most bar owners and patrons would eventually comply with the new law.
BEIJING, May 25 (Xinhua) -- China's cigarette industry appears to be losing its puff for the first time ever, with sales and production falling in the first four months of this year, the "China Daily" reported.
Nationwide anti-smoking campaigns and rising production costs have taken their toll on the industry, which fuels the habits of over 300 million smokers.
The industry, boasting nearly 180 cigarette factories, churned out 56.66 million cigarettes in the first four months of this year, an 1.7 per cent drop from 57.625 million in the same period last year, according to the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau(STMB).
A total of 54.21 million cigarettes were sold, down 2.3 percent from the 55.465 million sold last year.
"This is a normal situation, because usually cigarettes see brisk sales prior to the Spring Festival.
More often than not, the sales drops markedly afterwards," an STMB official said.
"But the influence of the smoking ban in public places in 26 cities throughout the country cannot be ruled out," the official added.
"Although we expect an upturn in the sales and production in the second half of this year, the outlook is not rosy," he said.
In response to the national anti-smoking movements, STMB has slashed its planned output to 1,712.5 billion cigarettes this year, down from the actual production of 1,736 billion last year.
However, as one of the country's largest tax generators, the industry turned in 25.5 billion yuan (three billion US dollars) in profits and taxes, a marked 16 percent rise over the same period of last year.
The official attributed the rise in profits to the increased production of famous-brand cigarettes and those with filter-tips, which sell for a higher price.
Output of as many as 50 famous-brands has topped 17.34 million over the first four months, accounting for 30 percent of total volume, up 6.7 percent from last year.
"Nevertheless, cost hikes in raw materials like tobacco, filter tips, paper, and packaging as well as rise in prices of water and electricity, has trimmed at least three billion yuan off the expected revenue for the period," he said.
TEHRAN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian cabinet here Wednesday approved a bill prohibiting smoking in public places in a move to intensify its nationwide anti-smoking campaign.
The bill lists various public places to enforce the smoking ban, including holy sites, mosques, factories, hospitals and clinics, transportation terminals, public transport, department stores, and hotels and restaurants.
Cultural places such as libraries, museums, cinemas, and sports halls, and corridors and waiting rooms in state organizations are also included.
The cabinet ministers at today's session chaired by First Vice President Hassan Habibi stressed that all executive organizations and the mass media are duty-bound to campaign against smoking and to prevent any act that might encourage smoking, according to local reports.
GERMANY: Health-conscious Germans are drinking less beer and eating leaner meat, but they still like their cigarettes.
Big ``No Smoking'' signs hang at subway entrances in Berlin, but, recognizing the inevitable, there are ashtrays on the platforms.
In February, parliament easily defeated the first attempt to regulate smoking nationwide.
GREECE: One would never know it, but smoking is actually forbidden in public places in Greece _ where 45 percent of adults smoke _ and it has been for years.
It is banned on all public transport (1952), in closed public spaces (1980), on domestic flights (1990) and in health-care facilities (1993).
``Regardless, some people abuse it,'' says Pantelis Vekios of the Health Ministry.
``It happens a lot in Greece.
If your boss smokes and you can't say anything to him because he'll fire you, what can you do''?
ISRAEL: By and large, Israel has followed the United States' lead in enacting bans, but some time later.
But the head of Israel radio, Amnon Nadav, refused to allow government inspectors into his building after some of his staff complained about the round-the-clock stench of nicotine.
ITALY: Cigarette smoke wafts from the Coliseum in Rome, cigarette butts litter the Forum.
You've come to Rome to see the sights, but the country's anti-smoking laws are, in general, blowing a lot of smoke.
Two years ago, the government banned smoking in private businesses serving the public and ordered government agencies to enforce the prohibitions.
Still, banks put up ``No-Smoking'' signs just a few feet from...
ashtrays. Ditto for some hospital waiting rooms.
JAPAN: In Tokyo, restaurant patrons eat in a fog of tobacco smoke, a blue haze hangs over coffeehouses and workplaces reek of cigarettes.
Restrictions are slowly springing up.
Smokers are limited to special parts of train platforms, for example, and small no-smoking sections are becoming more common in family style eateries.
MEXICO: If it isn't a smoker's paradise, it's only because the cigarettes are so bad.
It's hard to walk a block in Mexico City without finding someone hawking smokes such as Marlboros or Delicados (unfiltered ``Delicate Ones'').
The only places with effective bans are the movie theater, subway and public buses.
NETHERLANDS: You can walk into a so-called ``coffeehouse'' and smoke marijuana or hashish without fear of arrest, so puffing on mere tobacco is tame stuff.
There are no ``smoker segregation'' laws, but change is in the air.
More companies are sending employees outside to smoke, and this year KLM Royal Dutch Airlines banned smoking on all flights.
PORTUGAL: When entering an elevator in Lisbon, don't worry if the ashtray is full.
You can stub out your cigarette on the floor like those before you.
Such occurrences are much rarer than they once were, but the smoke still blows thick in Portugal _ especially in bars and restaurants.
RUSSIA: Moscow has a few designated no-smoking areas, but everywhere else people smoke as they please.
State officials light up in the corridors of government buildings, school teachers puff away in lounges and school stairwells, restaurants allow smoking in the dining rooms.
Even in clinics and hospitals, there is little apparent concern for the dangers of smoking.
But smokers may be fined if they light up on a city bus or subway.
SINGAPORE: Soon smokers will have nowhere to hide.
It's still safe to light up in a bar, disco, karaoke lounge and in the great outdoors.
But if you are on line for a bus or a taxi with more than two other people, you'd better stub out that butt fast.
All public areas, air conditioned shopping centers and shops, offices, schools, private clubs, taxis, buses and public toilets in Singapore are designated smoke-free.
Smoking is also barred in underground pedestrian walkways and any lines of two or more people.
The maximum fine for selling tobacco to anyone under 18 is 5,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 3,000) for the first offense, and 10,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 6,000) for subsequent offenses.
Last year, a court sentenced a 16-year-old boy to two years in juvenile detention for repeated underage smoking.
But after 28 years of increasingly restrictive laws, about 18 percent of the population still smokes.
SPAIN: When dining out in Madrid, don't worry about fighting for a seat in the no-smoking section because there's no such thing.
Just hold your breath and chew fast.
In other public places, such as stores and public transport, smoking is banned under law but some people light up anyway.
In government buildings, smoking is prohibited only in ones that deal directly with the public.
TURKEY: A year after a law banned smoking in public offices, hospitals, buses and airports, people are still said to ``smoke like a Turk''.
Cinema lobbies and waiting rooms seem less hazy these days, with the nonsmoking minority policing the ban.
Still, ashtrays remain under no-smoking signs to collect the butts of violators, who dare to face a 10 million turkish lira (dlrs 32) fine.
UNITED KINGDOM: Pity the smoker who doesn't drink, as pubs remain a safe haven.
Otherwise, British smokers increasingly are relegated to the sidewalk or the parking lot, largely at the initiative of employers, and smoking is banned in many public places including subways and trains.
The government has set a target of reducing cigarette consumption by 40 percent by the year 2000.
VENEZUELA: It's pretty much OK to smoke anywhere you want in Caracas and most other cities, with a few exceptions, such as hospitals and the Health Ministry.
Upscale restaurants are beginning to create no-smoking sections, and there's a de facto ban on overcrowded buses because passengers are already irritated by exhaust fumes from traffic jams .
JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Smokers across South Africa will soon be hounded out of many public places because a tough clamp-down on smoking in shops and banks will be imposed, Saturday Star paper reported.
The controls, in terms of amendments to South Africa's tobacco laws, are due to be tabled in parliament shortly.
Tobacco companies are considering whether to challenge the new law in the Constitutional Court, the report said.
The draconian measures against smoking in public are in addition to the proposed ban on tobacco advertisements and sports sponsorship by tobacco companies.
The new law will enable local authorities to ban smoking in public places and to designate areas where smoking is allowed, a health spokesman of the Gauteng province was quoted as saying.
Gauteng, the economic powerhouse of South Africa, is gearing itself for the anti-smoking move, with regulations in the pipeline and ready to be implemented when the new law is promulgated, the spokesman said.
Public places are defined as gyms, banks, hotels, libraries, post offices, schools, creches, shopping malls, retail stores, theaters, cinemas and stadiums.
The amendments will also see a ban on smoking in municipal buildings and on public transport.
Recent surveys show that one in three adult South Africans smoked, and the habit is growing among teenagers, at whom much of the tobacco advertising was aimed.
Surveys also show that most South Africans support the state's proposal to ban smoking in public and regulate tobacco advertisement.
LONDON _ The Metropolitan Police, whose friendly London ``bobby'' made it one of the most recognizable police forces in the world, is institutionally racist, according to a British government report released Wednesday.
In the most comprehensive examination of race relations in Britain in nearly 20 years, Sir William Macpherson, a retired judge, concluded that the London police force is riven with ``pernicious and institutionalized racism,'' and that racism among the police reflects a problem in the wider society.
The government of Prime Minister Tony Blair responded to the 800-page report by announcing a radical overhaul of the country's racial discrimination laws, saying they would now apply to the police and all government agencies.
A solemn Blair told the House of Commons Wednesday that the report on racism was ``an important moment in the life of the country''.
``We should confront as a nation honestly the racism that still exists in our society,'' Blair told lawmakers.
``It is a moment to learn, to reflect and to change''.
The report, commissioned after police botched the investigation into the 1993 racially motivated murder of a black teenager, Stephen Lawrence, has put pressure on Sir Paul Condon, the Metropolitan Police chief, to resign.
But Condon, whose seven-year term expires in January, said he will not step down and the British government issued a vote of confidence in him after the report was released.
According to British government sources, Condon saved his job by accepting the findings of Macpherson's report, and especially by accepting the sweeping new definition of institutional racism issued by Macpherson.
He defines it as ``the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture and ethnic origin''.
Macpherson's report is a scathing indictment of not only the police but all those in Britain who have ignored or tolerated racism.
In a city where more than 20 percent of the residents are minorities, only 2 percent of the police force is.
Minorities make up more than 5 percent of the population in all of Britain, but less than 2 percent of all police officers.
The murder of Lawrence, 18, has put police under scrutiny like never before.
But it has also touched off a wider national debate about racism, and now brought about major reform.
Lawrence's parents, Neville and Doreen Lawrence, who are natives of Jamaica, gave the report a guarded welcome, though they said they were disappointed it had not called for the prosecution of five suspects in their son's murder for perjury.
Three of the suspects were acquitted in a civil prosecution brought by the Lawrences, but the report calls for allowing even those acquitted of crimes to be tried again if new compelling evidence emerges.
The Lawrences, who watched from the visitors' gallery in Parliament as Home Secretary Jack Straw announced a series of reforms, said they were heartened that Macpherson had declared that institutional racism was a major problem in Britain.
``For the first time, a lot of people are aware of the situation,'' Neville Lawrence said at a news conference, urging people to ``try and do some good in the name of my son''.
The tone and sweeping conclusions of Macpherson's report surprised even civil rights campaigners who have long complained that the British establishment is in denial about the extent of racism in their country.
When he was a High Court justice, Macpherson had a reputation for being a conservative and part of the very establishment he was asked to critique.
Lawrence's parents initially complained about his appointment to review the police.
Some criticized Macpherson's report as being too sweeping in its conclusions and more aimed at being sensitive to grievances of minorities than providing realistic solutions to complex social problems.
Fred Broughton, chairman of the police federation of England and Wales, which represents rank and file police officers, said he does not believe the Metropolitan Police is institutionally racist and called Macpherson's report ``grossly unfair''.
He said the charge of racism is being thrown around carelessly.
He acknowledged that some officers investigating the Lawrence murder may have been insensitive to the victim's family, but added, ``There can be no justification for a blanket allegation that the police did not care about this murder because the victim was black''.
The Lawrences, whose dignity and tenacity in demanding justice has impressed many Britons, have repeatedly called for Condon to step down, saying someone has to be accountable for the incompetence and racial insensitivity by police that allowed their son's killers to escape prosecution.
But Straw, who is in charge of law enforcement, Wednesday backed Condon as the ideal person to implement the 70 recommendations to improve policing made in Macpherson's report.
Straw ordered that all unsolved murder cases in London be reopened.
Some of those murders are thought to be racially motivated.
At a news conference, Condon accepted the findings, including the new definition of institutional racism.
He had previously denied steadfastly that his force was institutionally racist.
``We in the Met feel a sense of shame,'' he said.
Condon received bipartisan support in Parliament.
``A hunt for scapegoats will help no one,'' said the opposition leader, William Hague.
While resigning from governmental posts for the errors of subordinates has a long tradition in Britain, Condon said morale within the force would collapse if he allowed himself to become a scapegoat for the botched investigation and the bitterness it has provoked among minorities.
He said he made combating racism one of his top priorities, devoted his first speech as chief to the subject, and has doubled the number of minority officers on the Met during his tenure.
Bernie Grant, one of the few blacks in Parliament, said the report was a wakeup call for white Britons.
``This is the last chance for British society to tackle racism,'' he said, suggesting that failing to do so could eventually lead to a repeat of the 1981 riots in Brixton, a black section of London.
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Prince of Wales Thursday launched a scholarship to try to open up architecture to the ethnic minorities, in memory of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
His Foundation for Architecture and the Urban Environment will pay about 10,000 pounds (14,500 U.S. dollars) a year to fund an ethnic minority student through architectural school, the BBC reported.
"How wonderful it would be if, through my foundation, we could help to increase the proportion of black and ethnic minority practitioners in the field of architecture," Prince Charles said.
Stephen Lawrence was cruelly robbed of the chance to develop his potential talents in the field of architecture.
Stephen, who was studying for his A-levels when he was murdered by racists in April 1993, had always wanted to be an architect.
He was on a work placement with a firm of architects.
The prince expressed his "deepest sympathy" to Stephen's parents who were present at the first Stephen Lawrence memorial lecture in London.
"I wish them well in their quest to build something positive from the shocking and sudden loss of their son Stephen," he said.
The memorial lecture will be an annual event aimed at inspiring young black and Asian people.
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The British government rejected Calls on Friday for Home Secretary Jack Straw to resign over the publication of details of witnesses in the Stephen Lawrence case.
Home Office minister Paul Boateng denied that Straw or his officials were to blame for the publication of witnesses' names and addresses in appendices to the report on the police investigation of the racist murder.
He told MPs that the chairman of the inquiry team, Sir William Macpherson, had accepted full responsibility for the blunder.
"This is not a matter that cannot be put at the door of the Home Office," he said.
Several of the named informants are now under police protection after their names were made public and the opposition Conservative party MPs have called Straw to resign for the error.
Distribution of the report has been suspended and fresh copies are to be published without the offending details.
Both Labor and opposition MPs expressed incredulity that the Home Office did not remove the names from the document when it received the report more than a week prior to publication.
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- British police launched a series of crackdown on "hated crime" across the capital on Wednesday, arresting some 70 suspected racists.
The Metropolitan Police swoops came as part of Operation Athena, a campaign aimed at cracking down on racist crime in the capital.
Those taken for questioning were alleged to have committed offenses ranging from the publication of racist material to racially aggravated assaults.
"Our aim is to create a hostile environment for those who, because of racism and prejudice, wish to undermine communities and destroy the principle of 'Justice for All'," said Detective Chief Superintendent John Godsave, who headed the operation.
Godsave said the raid, in all 32 of the capital's local districts, was part of the Met's anti-racist Operation Athena.
The suspected offenses ranged from grievous bodily harm to the publication of racist material.
The age and sex of the suspects was not released but police said the arrests spanned Hounslow, an Asian stronghold in the west of the city, to Greenwich, a wealthy white enclave in southeast London.
"Our goal is to eradicate the fear and distress caused by hate crime," Godsave said in a statement.
Britain is 94 percent white but ethnic minorities have a stronger presence in the inner cities, London chief among them.
Yet the Met's record on promoting black and Asian officers, rooting out racist staff and clamping down on racially motivated crime have all come under fire.
An official report last year condemned the capital's police force for institutional racism.
The dawn raids came as police questioned three men in connection with the country's most notorious racist crime: the unsolved 1993 murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
Two were arrested in London, the third in Scotland.
The number of racist crimes being reported in Britain was rising sharply.
Police believe greater awareness has encouraged more victims to come forward.
LONDON (AP) -- One minority leader warned today that volunteers will begin patrolling Southall, a racially mixed south London district, to prevent further bombings by a white supremacist group.
Police and other organizations have posted an $80,000 reward for the arrest of the neo-Nazis from Combat 18 who have been attacking minorities, most recently setting a bomb off Saturday that injured seven people in Brick Hall, a district in London's East End.
Metropolitan police Assistant Commissioner David Vaness said police feared ``a continuing series of vicious attacks,'' possibly spreading to other cities.
Suresh Gover said 100 volunteers from the Southall Monitoring Project and local mosques and temples would patrol Southall next Saturday wearing distinctive armbands.
``We have suffered a long history of racial hostility...
but this is racial terrorism,'' he said.
Another group in the central England city of Leicester, the Montserrat Community Association, warned that vigilante groups might take to the streets if the attacks continue, the Times of London reported today.
On Saturday, in the second attack in eight days, a bomb exploded in Brick Lane, which has a high concentration of Bangladeshis.
Combat 18 claimed responsibility for it.
The group was also among four far-right organizations that each claimed to have planted a nail bomb April 17 that injured 39 people in Brixton, a racially mixed south London neighborhood.
Police said the two attacks, both with crude nail bombs, appeared linked and were clearly racially motivated.
In addition, several black lawmakers reported receiving threatening letters signed by ``White Wolves,'' a name that has cropped up before under racist threats.
London's Sunday Telegraph reported that a 15-page document signed ``White Wolves'' and giving instructions on orchestrating a bombing campaign was faxed to a radio station a week before the Brixton bombing.
One of Britain's largest Asian community newspapers also received a threatening letter from the ``White Wolves,'' its editor said Sunday.
Britain's state-funded Commission for Racial Equality said the bombings were a backlash against an official inquiry into the bungled police investigation of the fatal stabbing of a black London teen-ager in 1993.
The report, released in February, said the London police force was riddled with racism.
Five white youths suspected of killing Stephen Lawrence have never been successfully prosecuted.
Commission chairman Claude Moreas said far-right elements ``don't like the idea of lifting the rock and seeing racism underneath.''
LONDON _ A long-awaited government report has found London's police force to be ``riven with pernicious and institutionalized racism'' and suggests that chief officers must accept that conclusion as a condition for keeping their commands.
The report, which surprised leaders of Britain's non-white communities with its sweep and bluntness, makes 70 recommendations for changes in police practices and social habits ``designed to usher in a fundamental transformation of Britain's race relations''.
Sir William Macpherson, a retired High Court justice who was the author of the report and chairman of the eight-month government inquiry, defined institutional racism as ``the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate professional service to people because of their color, culture or ethnic origin'' reflected, he said, in ``processes, attitudes and behavior which amounts to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping''.
His report said, ``There must be an unequivocal acceptance of the problem of institutionalized racism and its nature'' and that ``any chief police officer who feels unable to respond will find it extremely difficult to work in harmony and cooperate with the community in the way that policing by consent demands''.
Among the recommendations were measures making individual officers liable for legal judgments of up to $800,000 for racist behavior, giving the Commission for Racial Equality statutory power to investigate the police, making racist language even in private conversations criminally punishable, changing the national schools curriculum to emphasize cultural diversity and improve race awareness and empowering the Court of Appeal to allow acquitted defendants to be tried anew if compelling new evidence comes to light.
The judicial recommendation, in effect eliminating protection against ``double jeopardy,'' addresses the case that gave rise to the report, the 1993 killing of Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old Londoner of Jamaican parentage, by five white youths with a history of race baiting.
Three of the suspects were acquitted in 1996 in a widely faulted prosecution and cannot be tried again despite the subsequent emergence of a video tape in which they assailed blacks and demonstrated knifing techniques that bore chilling resemblances to the way Lawrence was killed.
The inquiry into the Lawrence case and racism among the police ended in November after 69 days of hearings over an eight-month period and has taken on dramatic new life this year through a play based entirely on testimony called ``The Color of Justice'' that is playing to sellout audiences in a small West London theater and is moving to the West End in May.
At many points in the lengthy proceedings, police witnesses including Sir Paul Condon, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, turned aside all references to the existence of institutional racism on the force, the very characterization they are now being told they must embrace.
The official originally in charge of the Lawrence investigation, deputy assistant police commissioner David Osland, said at the time, ``The suggestion that any police officer would investigate a murder less competently because the victim was black is an absolute disgrace''.
At the outset of the hearings, Lawrence's parents, Neville and Doreen Lawrence, and others pursuing the case protested the choice of Macpherson as chairman, saying he was insensitive to their needs and perspectives.
But on Monday there was praise and expression of some astonishment at his conclusions.
Peter Herbert, the chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, said that Sir William had ``managed to grasp the nettle'' of Britain's race relations.
``Our expectations were low, but if they had been higher, this is the sort of thing we should have expected,'' he said.
Lee Jasper, director the black policy group The 1990 Trust, said: ``We are very pleased.
The report is full-blooded in its criticism, and it does reflect, as far as we can see, the broad concerns of the black community''.
Ros Howells, a friend of the Lawrences, suggested that Sir William had had his views changed dramatically by the evasive testimony of police officers, which in their current staged retelling, draw gasps of disbelief from theatergoers.
``He was shocked during the inquiry by the incompetence of the police,'' she said.
The government, which has received praise from backers of the Lawrence family for its pursuit of the case, came in for criticism on Monday for actions it took this weekend to prevent publication of a leaked version of the report, which is due to be made public on Wednesday.
Home Secretary Jack Straw obtained a judicial order on Saturday night forcing The Sunday Telegraph to drop an exclusive account of the report in its early editions, then had to back down when other papers protested the move.
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Home Secretary Jack Straw unveiled new curbs Wednesday to combat police racism in the country after a damning report on ther murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
Straw told the parliament that he had ordered an immediate inspection of the London Metropolitan police force by the Inspectorate of Constabulary.
The report into the racist murder of Lawrence which was released earlier in the day labeled London's police force "institutionally racist" and condemned officers for "fundamental errors".
Straw's response to the report followed Prime Minister Tony Blair's promise Wednesday afternoon during the Prime Minister's Questions of a "fundamental shift in the way British society deals with racism".
"The publication of today's report on the killing of Stephen Lawrence is a very important day in the history of our country," Blair said.
"It will certainly lead to new laws but more than that it will bring a new era of race relations," he added.
In his announcement, the home secretary said the Race Relations Act would be extended to cover the police -- one of the report's 70 recommendations.
Straw also said he had asked the Law Commission to consider giving the Court of Appeal powers to permit prosecution after acquittal new, viable evidence was presented.
But he lent his backing to Metropolitan Police Chief Sir Paul Condon to remain in his job.
Condon has admitted the report had brought "shame" on his force, but he refused to resign.
Stephen, 18, was fatally stabbed by white youths at a bus stop in southeast London in 1993.
Nobody has been convicted of the murder so far.
LONDON Stephen Lawrence was the picture of a typical English lad.
On that April night in 1993, the 18 year old was neatly dressed and well-groomed as he waited for a bus to take him the last leg home to his prim middle class London suburb.
He was a good student with dreams of becoming an architect.
People knew him as courteous, intelligent and sociable.
But because he was also black, he was attacked by a gang of white thugs and stabbed to death.
Lawrence's death and the bungled police investigation that failed to bring his killers to justice generated an extraordinary level of anger and frustration among blacks that last year, after more than five years of pressure, finally moved the government to conduct a formal inquiry.
On Wednesday, Home Secretary Jack Straw stood solemnly in Parliament to report the findings.
The report was startling in its condemnation of Scotland Yard's investigation of the murder and its conclusion that the respected police force and by implication much of British society is plagued by racism.
Racism tainted every turn of the investigation, the report said.
Investigators were slow to respond to statements made by black witnesses and treated with suspicion the account of the incident offered by Lawrence's friend, another black man, who witnessed the crime.
Racial biases even prevented police officers at the scene from providing first aid to Lawrence who lay bleeding to death on the sidewalk, the report said.
Even Lawrence's grieving parents were treated badly, the report said.
''From the first contact with police officers at the hospital, and thereafter, Mr.
and Mrs.
Lawrence were treated with insensitivity and lack of sympathy,'' the report said.
``They were patronized.
They were never given information about the investigation to which they were entitled''.
Because the initial investigation was so flawed, the prosecution of three of the five suspects failed to win convictions and crown prosecutors dropped the cases against the other two.
The government now is considering a change in its rules with regard to double jeopardy protections to prosecute the young men again if more evidence can be developed against them.
In the meantime, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government is promising a full assault on racism, including moves to broaden anti-discrimination laws to cover now-exempt police and government departments.
The government also ordered an inquiry into all unsolved murders in London that are suspected of being racially motivated.
Yet, Lawrence's parents, who were present in the House of Commons to hear the results of the inquiry, seemed little comforted.
''No one is serving time for the murder of my son,'' Doreen Lawrence later told reporters.
''To me, institutional racism is so ingrained, and it is hard to see how it will be eradicated out of the police force''.
&QL; OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS &QL; While the 10-week inquiry focused on the culture and practices of Scotland Yard, the findings are being interpreted as an appraisal of race relations in Britain as a whole.
In the days before and after the release of the report, the Lawrence case was the dominant news story.
Major newspapers dedicated several pages to the story on Thursday and Friday and it was the main topic on talk TV and radio.
To many, Lawrence has become the symbol of racial struggle in a country that has never really had a U.S.-style civil rights movement.
``His name will resonate in a way that no other individual in British black history has done before,'' said Stuart Hall, visiting professor in sociology at the Open University.
``It will stand for the fact that this time we were able to smoke out prejudice''.
Young blacks in particular have embraced Lawrence, in whom they see someone familiar.
Posters and T-shirts bearing his likeness are common in London.
``I think black teenagers identify with him because they are at the sharp edge,'' Hall said.
``They are saying that the police prejudice shown in Stephen's case has been going on for a long time''.
Peter Herbert, chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, believes the Lawrence case will leave an indelible mark.
``There has never been a civil rights movement in this country, therefore there has never been something to touch the heart of the community,'' Herbert said.
``There has never been a black martyr in this country, but that is what Stephen has become''.
&QL; END OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; While Britain takes pride in its tolerance, it remains a place of contradictions in its attitudes toward blacks.
Last year, a statue of Martin Luther King Jr.
was set among 20th Century martyrs above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey, the only American granted such an honor.
Yet, tourist shops routinely sell figurine models of blacks in insulting stereotypical poses long vanished from the American South.
In Cornwall, residents celebrate with little controversy an annual festival called ``Darkie Days,'' during which locals in wigs and blackface sing and dance in the streets to commemorate the landing of a slave ship 200 years ago.
Despite a 50-year influx of blacks and Asians from former colonies, Britain remains overwhelmingly white.
Less than 6 percent of the 58 million residents are members of minorities and most live in major cities such as London.
For many Britons the only contact they have with blacks is through American films and sitcoms.
While the common belief in Britain is that race relations here are better than they are in the United States, recent studies indicate powerful similarities between the plight of blacks in both countries.
A 1993 study found that 62 percent of young black men in London were unemployed.
Four of the five boroughs with the highest concentration of black people are in the top 10 most deprived districts in the country.
Black boys are four times more likely to be excluded from school than their white peers.
Black people aged 16-24 are twice as likely to be unemployed as whites.
Black people are more likely to be stopped, searched and imprisoned than whites.
They receive longer sentences and are more likely to die in custody.
Despite recent public efforts to put more blacks in visible positions such as newscasters and political leaders, 80 percent of 18-to 34-year-olds from ethnic minorities feel race relations have worsened in recent years, according to a report by the University of Warwick's Center for Research in Ethnic Elections.
Acknowledging the challenge Britain faces in coming to grips with race relations, Blair said the Lawrence case offers a place from which the effort must rise.
''This is a general problem we have to face as a society,'' Blair said in a television interview.
''It will require a determination that the real monument to Stephen Lawrence is not to be found in the laws passed by Parliament, but in the fundamental change in attitude in our society''.

LONDON (AP) -- Declaring that the racially motivated killing of a black teen-ager shamed the nation, the British government today ordered a major overhaul of race laws.
The order followed today's release of an official report that said London's police force is riddled with racial prejudice.
``We should confront as a nation honestly the racism that still exists in our society,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair told a hushed House of Commons.
``It is a moment to learn, to reflect and to change''.
The government released the report of a judicial inquiry that said the police inquiry into the 1993 fatal stabbing of 17-year-old Stephen Lawrence was marked by ``professional incompetence and institutional racism''.
Five white youths suspected of killing Lawrence while he waited at a bus stop with a black friend have never been successfully prosecuted.
All five denied involvement.
Home Secretary Jack Straw, the Cabinet minister in charge of the police, announced that laws making racial discrimination an offense will be broadened to include the police and all government departments.
He also ordered an inquiry into all unsolved murders in London and tighter disciplinary regulations for police.
In addition, appeal judges may for the first time be empowered to permit suspects to be tried twice for the same offense if there is new evidence.
Three of the suspects in the Lawrence killing cannot be charged again because they were acquitted.
The killing of Lawrence, whose Jamaican-born parents came to Britain 30 years ago, provoked a national debate.
It has also come to epitomize what some see as underlying racism in a nation where race riots are rare and laws barring discrimination already are wide-ranging.
``There was only one reason for this murder.
Stephen was black,'' Straw told lawmakers as the teen-ager's parents, Neville and Doreen Lawrence, watched from the visitors' gallery in the House of Commons.
The report by retired judge Sir William Macpherson also said that an internal police inquiry into the handling of the Lawrence investigation was ``flawed and indefensible''.
A section of the report, which had been leaked to the media earlier, said London's overwhelmingly white Metropolitan police force was plagued by ``institutional racism''.
``It can be seen, or detected in processes, attitudes and behavior which amounts to discrimination...
which disadvantages ethnic minority people,'' the report said.
Straw said Lawrence's killing and its repercussions had given whites -- 93 percent of the population -- a look at what it is like to be black or Asian in Britain.
``Some of the truths are uncomfortable,'' said Straw, adding he wanted the report to be a catalyst for irrevocable change nationwide .
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of racist incidents continues to rise, according to the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) on Wednesday.
It said fewer people turned to the CRE for help last year, despite the increased prominence given to race issues following the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.
Stephen, 18, was stabbed to death in a racist murder in 1993 at a bus-stop in Eltham, south-east London.
No one has been charged with his murder.
The CRE warned of worrying signs that the number of racist incidents is still going up.
Since the 1980s, the ratio of black and Asian people who are unemployed compared with the white population has risen sharply.
The commission was calling for reform of the Race Relations Act to include the police, and said there must be a determination to make racial equality a reality.
GENEVA (AP) -- Britain defended its record in fighting racism before a U.N. panel Monday but conceded that the tone of the country's recent asylum debate could provoke racial tension.
Britain ''remains attractive to migrants precisely because it is seen as a tolerant and diverse society,'' British delegation leader Sarah Marshall told the 18-member Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
She noted that Britain received 71,160 asylum applications last year, up 55 percent from the year before.
The increase comes among a recent focus on immigration by the country's leading political parties.
The opposition Conservative Party has accused the Labor Party government of making Britain a ''soft touch'' for migrants and called for asylum-seekers to be put in detention centers.
The Labor Party, hoping to deter asylum seekers, in March cut cash grants previously paid to them.
The government also said more would be forced to settle outside London and announced heavy fines for truckers caught smuggling illegal immigrants.
A group of 29 British rights organizations said the revised laws create racial tensions rather than racial harmony.
They claimed Britain ''has failed to take adequate measures to protect the human rights of ethnic minorities, leaving millions of people vulnerable to discrimination, violence and social exclusion''.
Marshall conceded Monday that ''the tone of some debate around asylum has led...
to incidents of racial harassment against settled minority communities''.
But she said asylum-seekers will be better off under new British policy that clears up confusion and speeds up the processing of asylum claims.
A tough stance on illegal immigration helps integrate legal migrants, she added.
She said British authorities and police have learned from the 1993 murder of black teen-ager Stephen Lawrence by a gang of white youths and the failure of the police to investigate his death adequately.
The killing prompted a national debate on racism and on police handling of such crimes.
''The worst incidents of race-hate violence in recent years were the Brixton and Soho nail bombs last year,'' Marshall said.
''They were perpetrated by a loner who is now confined to a secure state hospital''.
She was referring to white supremacist David Copeland.
Copeland was given six life sentences in June for the 1999 bombing campaign against minorities in London that killed three people and injured more than 100 others.
The U.N. committee is meeting to review the records of some of the 150 nations that are party to the 1969 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
The United States' race record is not among those being reviewed.
Britain submitted a 72-page report to the panel, which is expected to issue its conclusions Aug. 25 .
LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw Tuesday promised new measures to combat racism in the wake of the inquiry into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
Straw, setting out the government's point-by-point response to the Lawrence report, said his plan of action should bring about "real, practical change".
The report was commissioned to investigate the police handling of the inquiry into the death of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence who was fatally stabbed by white youths at a bus stop in south-east London in 1993.
The new measures would focus on tackling "institutionalized racism" in the police service, with a shake up of training and procedures.
But Straw warned that the government had "serious reservations" about proposals to allow prosecutions for racist offenses which take place in private.
He also stressed that changes to the double jeopardy principle, whereby a defendant could not be tried for the same offense twice, would be considered without any firm prospect of action.
The action plan aims to bring the police fully within the remit of the Race Relations Act and states that all aspects of policing will be covered by forthcoming Freedom of Information laws.
Straw said he would lead a steering group including members from the Commission for Racial Equality, the Black Police Association, the Metropolitan Police and other police organizations and the Crown Prosecution Service to enact most of the recommendations.
"We recognize that action to tackle racism must begin at the earliest stage and be carried out across all agencies," he said.
LONDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in leading British newspapers Wednesday.
The Times: -- England plunged out of the World Cup Tuesday night when they were beaten on penalties by Argentina, who is to go on to meet Holland in the quarter-finals.
Financial Times: -- Prime Minister Tony Blair has recognized that his ambition of carving a powerful role for the UK within the European Union (EU) could take 10 years and has commissioned a sweeping review of the UK's approach to the EU.
The Daily Telegraph: -- For the second time in a World Cup, England's dream of glory disintegrated in the agony of a penalty shoot-out Tuesday night.
The Independent: -- The five men suspected of killing Stephen Lawrence were thumped and pelted with bottles by an enraged crowd Tuesday after a day of evasive and implausible evidence that made a mockery of their appearance before the public inquiry.
The Guardian: -- The five men suspected of murdering Stephen Lawrence could face perjury charges after their two days of evidence ended Tuesday with them fleeing from the inquiry building under a hail of missiles from an angry crowd.
LONDON (AP) _ The chief of Britain's largest police force apologized Thursday to the parents of a black teenager whose stabbing death five years ago focused attention on relations between police and minorities.
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon told Stephen Lawrence's parents that he accepts the ``anger and frustration'' directed at him.
``I deeply regret that we have not brought Stephen's racist murderers to justice and I would like to personally apologize again today to Mr.
and Mrs.
Lawrence for our failures,'' Condon said, from his seat a few feet away from Neville and Doreen Lawrence at a public inquiry into the case.
``We have heard what people have been saying and I accept that a central concern is that the Met is racist.
I acknowledge that we have not done enough to combat racist crime and harassment,'' he added.
Stephen Lawrence, 18, was stabbed in April 1993 at a London bus stop by a group of white attackers.
The Lawrence family has said police acted slowly and incompetently in resolving the case.
Two men were charged, but prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to pursue the case.
A private criminal prosecution, admissible under English law, also collapsed.
The Lawrence family has called for Condon to resign. (mb-kg)
LONDON (AP) -- The mother of a black British teen-ager slain by white youths presented Nelson Mandela with a lifetime achievement award Thursday in recognition of his fight to end apartheid.
''I'm sure that I can speak for all South Africans, black and white, that this award is recognition of their struggle for peace and democracy in our country,'' the former South African president said.
Mandela, 81, received the BT Ethnic Multicultural Media Award from Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen was stabbed to death at a London bus stop in 1993.
She said Mandela was the only person of world stature to take up her cause.
After a long campaign by Lawrence, an official inquiry found that police bungled the investigation and were racist.
None of the five white suspects was successfully prosecuted.
Mandela, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, said the award ceremony ranked among the important occasions of his life, adding, ''There's a possibility that one day I might die, and when I reach the new world I will have many fond memories.''
BIRMINGHAM, England _ Police stopped Carl Josephs on suspicion of having a stolen car.
They stopped him on suspicion of having a criminal record.
They stopped him on suspicion of carrying drugs, of not wearing a seat belt, of driving where he did not belong.
They stopped him, he said, 34 times in two years, until finally he started taking the bus to work.
Because he never was found to have done anything wrong _ never ended up with so much as a speeding ticket _ Josephs, a quality-control supervisor in a meat factory, could only conclude that he was singled out because he was black and drove a car with a big picture of Bob Marley, the late Jamaican reggae star, on the back.
``Every time I went out of the house, the first thing I thought is, `Am I going to be harassed'?
'' he said.
Finally, he couldn't take it any more.
In the first case of its kind in Britain, he sued the West Midlands Police, complaining that he had been racially harassed.
And though he won on only one of his complaints _ that he had been wrongfully stopped on one occasion _ his case added to what has become an increasingly noisy debate in Britain about the way police treat people from minority groups.
For years, black and Asian Britons have complained about what they see as overt and tacit police racism, and except at times of particular upheaval, like the riots in Brixton in 1981, no one in authority in Britain has paid much attention.
But in the last few months, the issue has been at the forefront of the country's consciousness.
More and more people like Josephs are making public complaints.
Home Secretary Jack Straw recently told a parliamentary committee that he planned to require Britain's police departments to hire more minority officers.
And the government is poised to release a stinging report about race and the police that is likely to order nothing less than a sea change in British police culture.
The impetus for all this is the six-year-old case of Stephen Lawrence, a case that Peter Herbert, the chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, described in an interview as ``Rodney King without the video''.
Lawrence, an 18-year-old black student who was set upon and stabbed to death in South London in 1993 by a group of white youths who directed a racial epithet at him.
What happened to him _ and how police apparently botched the inquiry _ has proved a galvanizing force among minority groups, as well as forcing the rest of the public to pay attention.
``The Stephen Lawrence case has got such exposure that in other places, like Birmingham, cases of racial terror and injustice are finally being recognized,'' said Maxie Hayles, chairman of the Birmingham Racial Attacks Monitoring Unit.
``It's a shame that it should take the death of a schoolboy to bring this out in the open, but unfortunately that's what did it''.
Straw is due to release a much-anticipated independent report this month on police handling of the case.
The report is expected to present a damning portrait of police incompetence and racial prejudice, and to conclude that the Metropolitan Police, Britain's largest police force, is guilty of pervasive institutional racism.
Richard Norton-Taylor, whose play about Lawrence's killing, ``The Color of Justice,'' has been playing to rave reviews in London, said that the attention paid to the Lawrence case and others was a sign that British attitudes toward the overarching authority of the police and other institutions were finally being called into question.
``There's been an antipathy building up toward the cops for all sorts of different reasons, but it hasn't been part of the culture to have movements, to protest in an organized way,'' he said.
``But what we're seeing now is that there's a slow building up of demands for more openness, whether on racism or consumerism or medical matters.
There is much less deference''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn That there may be racism in the Metropolitan Police hardly seems surprising in a city where 20 percent of the population, but only 2.3 percent of the police force, is made up of people from minority groups.
Of the 860 or so black and Asian police officers, only 24 hold the rank of inspector and above, and only about 20 are sergeants, said Inspector Leroy Logan, chairman of the National Black Police Association.
(As a whole, ethnic minorities account for 5.6 percent of the British population, and 2 percent, or 2,500, of the 127,000 police officers in England and Wales).
But it has taken Britain _ at least white Britain _ until now to ask whether there is anything unusual about these numbers.
Britain has never had anything like the American civil rights movement.
Nor has it had an affirmative action system or a system of racial quotas.
Large numbers of black residents began arriving only about 50 years ago, coming by boat from the Caribbean as part of an influx of post-war immigration, giving parts of Britain a sizable minority population for the first time.
Nor is there a history of slavery here.
But black residents and members of other minority groups have had a hard time beating their way into the corridors of power.
Efforts to change the status quo have been difficult: Britain has traditionally been a society of deference, in which institutions of authority, like police department and other government agencies, are meant to be respected, not questioned.
``In Britain, people have traditionally acquiesced, rather than insisting on standing up and being counted,'' Logan said.
``In America the response has always been much more militant, more in your face.
Here, until recently, racism was not a word that was generally discussed in the media, and it was not something on every chief constable's agenda.
Suddenly, the community has been galvanized''.
Recent polls show that confidence in the police is falling.
In a poll conducted by Gallup for the Daily Telegraph, 60 percent of people interviewed said that they were satisfied with the way the police do their job, compared with 74 percent 10 years ago.
At the same time, a third of those questioned said they believed the police treated black and Asian people worse than they treated whites.
Why has the Lawrence case been so important?
If it hadn't been for the determination of Stephen Lawrence's parents, his death would probably have been quickly forgotten and filed away.
But Neville and Doreen Lawrence pushed for answers from what they said was a high-handed police department.
When none of the five young white men who were identified by numerous informants as the likely murderers were brought to trial, Stephen's family brought a civil suit against them.
In the end, there was insufficient evidence to find anyone guilty of Stephen's murder.
But the civil case _ and an inquest in which all five suspects smirkingly refused to answer questions on the advice of their lawyers _ provoked widespread outrage, even from such unlikely quarters as the right-leaning Daily Mail newspaper, which daringly printed the suspects' names and embarked on a campaign on behalf of the Lawrences.
In addition to Norton-Taylor's play, the case has been the subject of numerous television programs, including documentaries and a searing docudrama examining the case from the Lawrences' point of view.
At the same time, the government not only ordered an inquiry into the case, but also began examining the culture of the country's police forces.
Now, Straw is considering changes to a system that has protected police officers guilty of misconduct and allowed them to retire early with their pensions intact.
Such officers, under legislation he is looking at, would have their pensions cut by up to 75 percent.
Civil rights leaders say that they are impressed by the Labor government's efforts.
``There is quite a sea change with the Blair administration,'' said Herbert of the Society of Black Lawyers.
``It empathizes and understands that if you have an injustice against part of society, than sooner or later it affects everybody.''
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Two suspects in the Stephen Lawrence murder case and one other man were arrested Monday on suspicion of theft by Kent Police, police said.
A spokeswoman for Kent Police told local reporters three men were arrested in the early hours of Monday morning on suspicion of theft.
They were now in custody at a police station.
She added that they had been arrested "in the vicinity of the alleged theft".
Black teeager Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death at a bus-stop in Eltham, south London by five white youngsters six years ago.
No one has been convicted of the murder.
LONDON (AP) _ Britain said Wednesday it plans to keep a 12-year ban on Louis Farrakhan entering the country, but gave the militant U.S. black leader a last chance to appeal despite his ``clearly offensive'' views.
A government announcement said Home Secretary Jack Straw has told Farrakhan that ``he is minded to maintain'' the ban.
``Mr. Farrakhan now has the opportunity to make further representations before the Home Secretary takes a final decision,'' the statement added.
Straw, in charge of immigration, had considered lifting the ban after Farrakhan last month signed a pledge not to make attacks on whites, Jews and homosexuals while in Britain.
He also said he recognized that under Britain's Race Relations Act it is an offense to stir up racial antagonism.
However, Farrakhan's chance of an entry visa was apparently dashed when 20 supporters of his Nation of Islam movement on Monday disrupted an inquiry into the racially motivated murder of a black teenager in London, Stephen Lawrence.
They burst into the inquiry room when five white suspects started testifying.
Lawrence's parents appealed to the militants not to disrupt the inquiry.
The Home Office said Straw reached his decision after reviewing the ban and ``recent events at the Stephen Lawrence inquiry''.
Earlier, Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said Farrakhan ``has clearly offensive views''.
The Board of Deputies of British Jews also lobbied the government to keep the ban, imposed when Farrakhan planned to visit in 1986. (mj-rs)
LONDON (AP) _ A senior Scotland Yard police officer Wednesday apologized to the parents of a black teenager slain five years ago in a race killing that has become the focus of debate over relations between police and ethnic minorities.
Ian Johnston, assistant Metropolitan Police commissioner for southeast London, told Neville and Doreen Lawrence that he ``could not justify'' errors in the investigation into the stabbing and death of Stephen Lawrence, 18, at a London bus stop on April 22 1993.
``I wanted to say to you that I am truly sorry that we have let you down.
It has been a tragedy for you, you have lost a son and not seen his killers brought to justice,'' Johnston told Mr.
Lawrence at a public inquiry into the teenager's death.
Stephen Lawrence's family believe that the police acted slowly and incompetently in trying to bring to justice members of a white gang which police believe stabbed Lawrence.
Police charged two men with murder but the state prosecuting agency abandoned the case, saying there was insufficient evidence.
A private criminal prosecution, admissible under English law, also collapsed.
Johnston said that the case had had a severe impact on police relations with London-based black Britons, saying that the inability to solve the case had been ``a tragedy for the Metropolitan Police who have lost the confidence of a significant section of the community for the way we have handled the case''. (rs)
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Police forces in England and Wales were failing to eradicate racial prejudice in their ranks, a government inspector's report said on Monday.
The report comes less than a week after an inquiry highlighted "institutional racism" in London's Metropolitan Police following the bungled investigation into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
"There are pockets of good practise, but generally there is room for substantial improvement," said Dan Crompton, the report's author, who investigated how forces have implemented 20 recommendations made by the inspectorate 16 months ago.
Home Secretary Jack Straw said the report underlined the need to tackle racism as laid out by Sir William Macpherson in his report on the Lawrence murder investigation last week.
The Macpherson report denounced the Metropolitan Police as fundamentally racist for its handling of the investigation into the death of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence, stabbed to death by white youths in 1993.
No-one has been convicted of the crime.
After the Macpherson report, the government promised to broaden anti-discrimination laws and make immediate changes in policing methods.
Straw has already announced that officers will soon be liable to criminal prosecution for discrimination when police forces are brought under the Race Relations Act.
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon has revealed plans to introduce tests for racism as well as launching a major study of what the public look for from the police.
LONDON _ Which new play has provoked the most attention in the British theater so far this year?
Which has garnered the most column inches in the press, the most hours on television, and by far the most enthusiastic reviews?
No, the answer is not some striking drama at the National or a searing satire at the Royal Court.
It has been a defiantly undemonstrative, unpretentiously devastating piece called ``The Color of Justice'' that opened in January in the little Tricycle Theater in the unfashionable North London area of Kilburn and went on to replace a revival of ``Annie'' at a 1,500-seat theater in the West End, where it ended its run Saturday.
It has been a startling phenomenon, given that the subject was the murder of a quiet teen-ager in an obscure corner of Southeast London way back in 1993, and yet it isn't an altogether surprising one.
Nothing in 1999 has kept British reporters, pundits and editorial writers busier than a long-awaited, much-leaked and now officially published report into the aftermath of the killing of an 18-year-old whose only known offense was to have been born black.
Think of the impact in the United States of the recent conviction of a white racist in the Texas dragging case, and of the shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant early last month by police officers in the Bronx.
That will give you some idea of the soul-searching that the Lawrence case, as it has become known, has continued to provoke _ not least in that 2,500-year-old forum for public inquiry, the theater.
Stephen Lawrence, by all accounts a promising student and good-natured young man, was waiting for a bus in suburban Eltham in April 1993 when one or more members of a group of white youths stabbed him to death after using a racial epithet, a witness said.
The case against the prime suspects has never been officially prosecuted, though they were tried and acquitted when lawyers acting for Stephen's parents instituted what is known in Britain as a private prosecution against them.
The case subsequently collapsed because the trial judge thought the evidence inadequate.
But the victim's parents always refused to let go.
They prompted an outcry against racial violence loud enough to reach the ears of President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, who met with them when he visited London.
The couple embarrassed the police into holding what is now agreed to have been a totally unsatisfactory inquiry into its own handling of the case.
&UR; &LR; And when the Labor Party took office in 1997, the issue was still sufficiently alive for the incoming Home Secretary to order a new, fully public inquiry under an eminent judge, Sir William Macpherson.
He delivered his report late last month, and it was even more unsettling than the commentators prophesied.
The London police stood accused of botching and bungling the murder investigation not only because of incompetence but because of ``institutionalized racism''.
Whether the government accepts Sir William's more radical recommendations _ that racist language in private places become a crime; that victims themselves should decide what offenses are and are not racially motivated; that individuals acquitted of one crime may sometimes be retried for the same one _ it has already announced it will toughen Britain's anti-racism laws and act to cleanse the police.
Why such public and parliamentary outrage?
That, ``The Color of Justice'' made clear along its trip from Kilburn to the Theater Royal in the East London district of Stratford, in a showing on the BBC, and at the Victoria Palace in the West End.
The play consists of extracts of evidence given to the Macpherson inquiry and edited by the journalist and dramatist Richard Norton-Taylor.
In performance, it seemed as fresh as the O.J.
Simpson trial and yet as old in its implications as Aeschylus' ``Oresteia''.
As more than one critic suggested, the play vitally concerns the health not just of society's custodians but of society itself.
The Tricycle has long reflected the special nature of Kilburn, which is sometimes thought to be the most culturally mixed urban area in Europe.
It has given world or British premieres to plays by black writers _ including Mustapha Matura's ``Playboy of the West Indies,'' the work of the American August Wilson and several imports from the Market Theater in Johannesburg _ and to many works by Irish writers.
&UR; &LR; The theater also has plenty of experience in documentary drama.
Recently, it staged extracts from the Nuremberg trials, from hearings at the Hague into war crimes in Bosnia, and from an official inquiry into British arms exports to Iraq.
nn In Nicolas Kent's production of ``The Color of Justice,'' as in those pieces, everything was so matter-of-fact that you felt you were not in a place of entertainment but the gallery Sir William reserved for the public.
The lawyers sat in gray pews in front of boxed files and video screens.
People wandered in, whispered, dropped pens, chewed nibs, yawned, wandered out.
&UR; &LR; The downbeat tone extended to the witnesses.
Actors who didn't look at all like actors described in bald, banal yet riveting words the investigation Sir William has now condemned so unequivocally.
Prodded by the Lawrences' silkily menacing counsel, Jeremy Clyde's Michael Mansfield, and the other attorneys, the witnesses confronted question after question.
&UR; &LR; Did the police who originally arrived on the scene assume Stephen was a hoodlum himself?
Why didn't they give him first aid or instantly start a proper hue and cry?
Why weren't the suspects arrested far earlier than they were?
Why did camera surveillance begin just too late to record one of them taking a trash bag crammed with clothes from his house?
Why have so many police notes disappeared?
How much did it matter that one investigating officer had a decidedly unprofessional relationship with a drug baron who was also a suspect's father?
Norton-Taylor did not alter a single word of the inquiry's transcript and added nothing of his own; however he did cut the 11,000 pages of evidence to a 100-page script.
The audience heard endless quibbles about what is and isn't a racial attack, as well as a junior officer earnestly claiming to ``understand black people'' because she was raised in Africa.
&UR; &LR; A very senior policeman offered a fulsome apology to the Lawrences for his force's failures and, using a word the inquiry had already deemed inappropriate, went on to justify the disproportionately frequent arrest of blacks because ``colored people'' tend to live in high-crime areas.
The suspects were subpoenaed by the inquiry, but only one was seen in the play.
He failed to remember being shown a police surveillance video in which his brother and their friends violently brandish knives and speak in obscene terms of their desire to dismember blacks.
&UR; &LR; The good samaritan, whose wife cradled the dying student, whispering ``you are loved'' into his ear, admitted he initially wondered if the boy was a mugger faking a collapse.
After the murder, he washed his bloodstained hands and poured the water on a rosebush in his garden, ``So in a way, I suppose, he is kind of living on a bit''.
It is impossible not to feel that in other, subtler yet more substantial ways, Stephen really is.
Is it crazy to claim that, when they gathered to see a jury of Athenians decide how much responsibility Orestes had for his mother's death, Aeschylus' audiences were in a parallel predicament to those at ``The Color of Justice''?
&UR; &LR; It is not merely that effective drama has often been forensic in content and style and has concerned itself with trying to root out difficult truths.
It is that an effective theater should regularly address us as citizens and ask us whether or not our community is just or unjust.
At the end of ``The Color of Justice,'' Michael Culver's self-effacing, punctilious Macpherson echoed what the real Sir William did at the end of the first inquiry.
He asked everyone to stand silently in memory of Stephen.
For once we all felt implicated in something that was, yes, a play, but also a significant civic happening.
LONDON (AP) -- Police cracked down on racial intolerance, arresting three men in connection with the 1993 killing of a black teen-ager, and picking up 100 suspected racists in separate raids around the capital Wednesday.
The brutal murder of Stephen Lawrence, 18, by a gang of white youths and the failure of the police to investigate adequately prompted a national debate on racism and how police handle such crimes.
Five white youths were identified as suspects after the April 1993 killing in east London.
None has been successfully prosecuted.
The two new arrests Tuesday night came as Lawrence's family appealed on a British Broadcasting Corp.
program for anyone with information about the slaying to contact police.
A third man was arrested on Wednesday, and all three were released on police bail.
Their identities were not made public.
Police said none of the arrests resulted from the television appeal, but that it had prompted more than 70 telephone calls, some of which were useful.
A separate series of police raids Wednesday resulted in the arrest of 100 people on suspicion of offenses that included threats to kill and racially aggravated criminal damage.
''Our aim is to create a hostile environment for those who, because of racism and prejudice, wish to undermine communities and destroy the principle of justice for all,'' said Detective Chief Superintendent John Godsave.
He said none of the arrests appeared to be linked to any far-right racist group or the Lawrence case.
A public inquiry after the Lawrence case found London police institutionally racist, prompting a government pledge to take a more active role in combating racial intolerance.
Wednesday's raids stemmed from the work of units set up in June in each of the capital's 32 boroughs to target those responsible for racist crimes.
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- British Health Secretary Frank Dobson vowed Wednesday to keep racism out of the health service after reports that human organs had been donated on condition they were given to white patients.
The reports cast a new cloud over race relations in Britain, already strained after the police force was found to be racist following its bungled investigation into the 1993 murder of black youth Stephen Lawrence.
"I have not been the opponent of the apartheid movement for the whole of my adult life to see it introduced in the National Health Service," Dobson said while touring a hospital outside London with Prime Minister Tony Blair, according to local media reports.
Dobson later told ITN television news he would introduce rules preventing donors from choosing the race of the person to receive their organs if rules were deemed necessary.
"It had never occurred to me that a rule would be necessary to keep racism out of blood transfusion and transplants," Dobson said.
"If it is necessary to introduce a rule, we'll introduce it".
On Tuesday Dobson ordered an inquiry into a case revealed by BBC television in which a donor's family told the Northern General Hospital in the city of Sheffield last July that the recipient of their relative's kidneys must be white.
Black Labor MP Bernie Grant, himself awaiting a kidney transplant, condemned race-selective organ donations and called on Dobson to get to the bottom of the case.
"It's an outrage of enormous proportions," Grant was quoted by Reuters as saying.
"It challenges the whole basis of the NHS as a universal service in which black and white life is of equal value".
"We were promised things would change and there wouldn't be the official reluctance to stamp out racism there has been in the past," Grant said.
"It's up to Frank Dobson to take some urgent disciplinary action and find who was behind this".
Race relations campaigners expressed outrage at the kidney transplant report, with Assembly Against Racism spokesman Kumar Mushid calling it "incomprehensible" for people engaging in an act of humanity by allowing the use of an organ to be imposing racist conditions on its use.
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw announced on Wednesday the targets for the recruitment of black and Asian officers for every police force in England and Wales.
Straw said he hoped that in 10 years' time, every force in England and Wales would reflect the racial make-up of the area it served.
"There is a real determination within the police service by officers of every rank to put the past in terms of attitudes to race behind them," the home secretary said.
The report on police handling of the racist murder of the south London teenager Stephen Lawrence prompted the reform.
The Metropolitan Police in London, which investigated the death of the black 18-year-old, faces one of the toughest challenges.
Only 3.3 percent of its officers are black or Asian, according to Home Office figures.
It will have to increase this to more than a quarter in line with London's population.
Only four of England and Wales' 43 regional forces are on track to meet the targets.
Home Office research also showed that black and Asian police officers are almost three times more likely to be sacked than their white colleagues, and it takes a black constable about 18 months longer to be promoted to sergeant than a white constable and 12 months longer for Asian officers.
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The parents of the murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence began legal action on Wednesday against the men suspected of his killing.
They are also taking action against the Metropolitan Police over the failed investigation into the murder.
No one has been convicted of the killing, according to BBC report.
The move comes the day before the sixth anniversary of Stephen's death and narrowly beats the six-year deadline for launching civil actions.
If the case goes ahead, the five key suspects may be cross-examined in a court for the first time.
Three of the suspects -- Neil Acourt, Luke Knight and Gary Dobson -- were formally acquited of the murder of Stephen three years ago when a private prosecution brought by the Lawrences collapsed.
This meant they could not face further criminal charges for the murder.
The action against the police comes amid ongoing negotiations with Scotland Yard over compensation.
The police have offered Lawrence's parents 50,000 pounds (78,000 U.S. dollars) each for mishandling the investigation into their son's murder in Eltham, south London in 1993.
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Almost 80 percent of hospital beds in Kenya's government hospitals are occupied by AIDS patients, a senior health official has said.
G.B. Galgalo, Assistant Minister for Health made the remarks Wednesday when he closed a two-day AIDS workshop in Eldoret, southwest Kenya.
More Kenyan risk contracting the dreaded AIDS disease if measures are not taken to prevent the spread of the pandemic, Kenya Times newspaper Thursday quoted the official as saying.
Galgalo added that the AIDS cases are increasing at an alarming rate, noting that the number of AIDS-created orphans have now reached a million and this will impact badly on the country's economy.
It is said that the AIDS threat has reached disaster proportions with both private and public organizations incurring costs of as high as 200 million shillings (about 2.7 million U.S. dollars) daily on HIV/AIDS- related expenses.
According to media reports, 14 out of every 100 Kenyans are infected with HIV, the virus which causes AIDS, and nearly 500 Kenyans die of AIDS everyday.
Research by the National AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control indicates that more than 1.9 million adults and 100,000 children in Kenya are infected with HIV/AIDS.
ADDIS ABABA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Six ministers of health from countries in the Horn of Africa started here today a four-day meeting to map out common strategies in the fight against communicable diseases rampant in the sub-region.
During the four-day deliberation, the ministers from Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Uganda, Eritrea and the Sudan will assess the magnitude of tuberculosis, malaria and diarrhoeal diseases in their respective countries.
Addressing the regional health conference, Ethiopian Minister of Health Dr.
Adem Ibrahim said major health problems affecting the peoples in the Horn of Africa should be dealt with common strategies based on economic rationality and sustainability.
Africans are highly suffering from communicable diseases and illnesses related to food deficiencies, he pointed out, saying that malaria, tuberculosis and diarrhoeal diseases could be controled if proper and agreeable inter-country collaborative strategies regarding the above mentioned diseases were drawn.
Dr. Wedson C.
Mwambazi, representative of the World Health Organization (WHO) to Ethiopia, said on his part that the United Nations agency is working out plans for strengthening surveillance to epidemic in the African region.
The health conference is organized by the Ethiopian Ministry of Health in collaboration with the directorate general for Development of Cooperation of Italy, the WHO and Institutes Superiore Di Sanita Italy.
NAIROBI, October 23 (Xinhua) -- One out of 10 children in Kenya dies of preventable diseases before the age of five, the East African Standard newspaper reported today.
The children die mainly of malaria, diarrhoea, vomiting and malnutrition, J.
Mati, Executive Director of the Institute of Reproductive Health and Research, was quoted as saying.
The growth of up to one-third of children under the age of five is stunted in the eastern African country, he warned, citing poverty as a key reason.
Infant mortality rate in the country stood at 67 per 1,000 in 1993 while the birth rate was at 46 per 1,000 and total fertility rate 5.4 percent, he quoted the latest available data as saying.
Mati also called for a review of the government's policy on health framework which he said should comprehensively improve donor co-ordination in the prevention of diseases.
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- AIDS is expected to reduce Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP) by 14.5 percent by the year 2005, according to a latest analysis released by the Ministry of Planning and National Development of Kenya available hereTuesday.
The analysis, compiled by the Long Rang Planning Division of the ministry, said the cost of treatment for AIDS patients in 2000 will equal the entire 1993/1994 recurrent budget of the Ministry of Health.
Statistics from the ministry showed that one in seven workers in Kenya is HIV-positive and this figure would increase to a four to one ratio, the Eastern African Standard newspaper reported Tuesday.
"One in every three deaths in Kenya's sugar sector is currently caused by AIDS.
As a result sugar firms are losing highly skilled workers," Director of Planning Kang'ethe Gitu in the ministry said last week.
Experts at the ministry predicted that as AIDS related diseases and deaths take their toll, small scale farming will decline sharply due to lack of laborers.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Health, some 1.5 million Kenyans are HIV-positive.
One out of nine persons is infected with the killer virus among the age group between 15 to 49.
NAIROBI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Life expectancy among Kenyans will be reduced to 42 years by 2010 from currently 58, if the AIDS scourge is not fought seriously, a UNICEF official warned here Sunday.
The Unitd Nations Children's Fund representative to Kenya, Chrispin Wilson, said his organization had declared war on AIDS and it was time the church in Kenya joined in to save its congregation from the scourge, the East African Standard reported Monday.
With 80 percent of Kenyans being Christians, Wilson said, the church must play its part and help eradicate AIDS.
He said that in Nyanza Province in southwestern Kenya, 30-35 percent of adults have the HIV virus that cause Aids.
Some villages in the province have been abandoned as the old moving to safer areas, with the middle-aged group wiped out.
He praised Kenyan President Moi's call on everybody to protect themselves against Aids.
Wilson noted that if Kenyans could reduce sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS could be reduced by at least 40 percent in the eastern African country.
NAIROBI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Top medical experts have flown to Kenya's Northeastern Province to investigate the mysterious disease which claimed over 160 lives in the last four days, local press reported today.
A urgent response medical team has arrived in the province, which comprises experts from the Kenya's Ministry of Health, World Health Organization, Kenya Medical Research Institute and Africa Medical Research Fund.
Local press quoted James Mwanzia, Director of Medical Services, as saying Tuesday that the experts listed 12 possible diseases including yellow and Rift Valley fevers, Marburg fever and severe malaria.
The symptoms of the disease are diarrhoea, high fever and bleeding from the mouth and nose.
Mwanzia said that the disease which is said to kill people within 36 hours could be a mix of malaria and dysentery because of the flooding caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon and the warm spell which followed.
He said that relevant specimens would be flown to Nairobi on daily basis for analysis.
NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- More than eighty people have died of malaria within the past two months at the Kisii General Hospital in Nyanza Province in western Kenya, newspapers reported on Saturday.
According to records at the hospital, 38 people died in January, 33 in February while 10 others in the first week of March.
Over 5,000 cases of malaria have been handled in the hospital during this period.
Anti-malaria drugs, including quinine injectables and tablets, were sent to the area last week, said acting superintendent J.
O. Ogato in Kisii on Friday.
Kenyan Public Health Minister Sam Ongeri, who recently carried out an anti-malaria awareness campaign in the region, said his government is well- prepared to tackle the annual highland malaria menace that afflicts the areas at the onset of the long rains between March and June.
The government would not allow a repeat of what happened last year when the disease killed thousands of people including school children, he said.
He said that the government has stocked enough anti-malaria drugs in all health facilities in the country to manage any outbreak in the malaria prone areas.
Malaria and HIV/AIDS are the leading killer diseases in Kenya.
"The government spends a lot of money to cure 20 million Kenyans who contract malaria annually," Ongeri said.
NAIROBI, June 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has granted Kenya 40 million U.S.
Dollars for the fight against AIDS over the next three years, the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
The project, which would run up to the year 2000, aims to enhance awareness of the dangers of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases throughout the eastern African country, said the report.
Some 70,000 AIDS cases have been reported in the country, according to statistics.

NAIROBI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Cholera and diarrhoea have killed more than 50 people in Mombasa and Malindi, Kenya's coastal regions, since the epidemic started over one month ago, the East African Standard reported today.
About 5,000 people from the area have been treated in various hospitals for the diseases, Coast Provincial medical Officer of Health S.K.
Shariff was quoted as saying.
Cholera-related cases are still increasing because of the contamination of drinking water following heavy rains in Mombasa, he noted, appealing to all Coast residents to boil drinking water.
He added that the ongoing nurses' strike which has crippled most public hospitals in the country since last Friday made the situation more dangerous.
NAIROBI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Health Ministry has warned that an upsurge in malaria cases is likely to happen in west Kenya due to the impending rainy season, the East African Standard daily reported on Friday.
The situation now is not worrying but things can deteriorate with the onset of the rains, Kenya's Director of Medical Service Richard Muga was quoted as saying on Thursday.
"We have put our staff on alert due to possibilities of an outbreak of the malaria epidemic," he said.
According to the official, medical supplies to contain the disease have been sent to the malaria-prone districts.
He said that a team of senior officials from the Health Ministry visited one malaria-prone district Thursday to assess the situation.
Malaria, one of the two top killer diseases in Africa, claims about one million lives in the continent each year, according to the World Health Organization.
NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two people have died of starvation in Fafi area of Garissa District in Kenya's North Eastern Province in the past week, according to six members of parliament from the province.
The six MPs, accompanied by 10 councilors from Garissa District, pleaded Wednesday that the government and the donor community send emergency relief food to the areas.
Addressing a press conference at the parliament building in Nairobi, the MPs asked the government to declare the province a disaster zone.
Barre Shill, one of the six MPs, told the press that some people in the area are dying of diarrhoea and "other diseases related to lack of food and water".
They accused the Provincial Commissioner Maurice Makhanu of misleading the government by denying that people were dying from starvation, saying there is a great famine in the province and people are dying.
Those local leaders also noted that the famine situation in the province was being aggravated by lack of medical supplies and poor communication.
NAIROBI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has declared war against any unhealthy imported used goods in a bid to prevent diseases spread and rescue local industries from collapse, the People Daily newspaper reported Thursday.
Managing Director Philip Okundi of the Kenya Bureau of Standards said here Wednesday that with effect from October 1, this year, imported used items which do not meet the requirements of his organization would be banned.
Okundi was quoted as saying that the code of practice for the importation of used shoes will require a health certificate from the country of origin to certifying that they are free from any skin disease or radioactive material.
The government also introduced a "fumigation certificate" on used shoes, as the ban on the importation of used inner garments became effective on June 30.
Inner garments include under wears, socks and vests.
It has established that the used items were causing diseases ranging from leprosy, anthrax and other fungal diseases, Okundi said.
He said following the order, already 60 trucks with unchecked footwear had been netted and are being held at a depot.
NAIROBI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 Kenyans and 7,500 animals have been displaced by the continuing flooding caused by the rising Lake Victoria waters.
About 8,200 acres of crop have been destroyed in Nyando, southwest Kenya alone, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
The lake, which burst its banks last week for the first time in three decades, has affected the entire shoreline in Busia, Siaya, Bondo, Kisumu, Nyando, Rachuonyo, Homa bay and Suba districts.
Many families are stranded with no food, livestock trapped by the floods and drowned, entire villages and schools swept away and other houses submerged as the lake waters engulf the mainland.
Efforts by the Kenyan government to rescue the displaced have been hampered by poor roads, made impassable by the floods, while lack of communication also worsens the situation.
Now rivers of Nyando, Sondu-Miriu, Yala and Nzoia, with the help of their tributaries, have swept into the lake large amounts of silt and vegetation from the catchment areas of the western highlands.
The flooding has raised fears of disease.
Last year, water-borne diseases such as typhoid, cholera and diarrhoea swept across the region, claiming scores of lives.
The lake supports some 25 million people, 10 million being in Kenya although the country only holds about six percent of the lake's 2,760 cubic km of water, with Tanzania taking up 49 percent and Uganda 45 percent.
The floods have also sparked heated debate about its causes which some experts argue are a result of siltation due to the blockage of river estuaries by the hyacinth weed.
Among other explanations from experts are the shrinking shoreline which has not been surveyed for more than 50 years and the heavy El Nino rains.
The Kenyan government has been asked to investigate a claim that a blocked outlet near the Owen Falls Dam in Jinja, Uganda could have caused the sudden rise in the levels of the lake water.
NAIROBI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Heart ailments have increased sharply in Kenya where estimatedly some 1.2 million people, five percent of the Kenya population are at risk, according to the latest statistics issued in Nairobi.
High on the list in the eastern African country are wealthy professionals who have adopted western lifestyles, the "East African" weekly newspaper reported today.
Statistics from Kenyatta National Hospital, the country's largest referral hospital, showed a 36-percent hike of in-patients with cardiac diseases between 1992 and 1996.
Heart failure alone accounted for a 47-percent rise from 279 in 1992 to 527 last year, said the report.
New bookings for treatment at the out-patient cardiology clinic total 1,541 for June to September this year.
There has also been a marked increase in public appeals to assist Kenyans in seeking specialist surgery abroad, notably the United States, Britain, India and South Africa.
There are three principal types of heart problems in Kenya, coronary artery disease which tends to afflict better-off people, rheumatic heart disease found mainly among the poor, and congenital conditions among children, such as a hole in the heart.
Kenya now has some 20 cardiologists for adult patients, fewer than 10 specializing in children and five heart surgeons, against one in the 1970s.
NAIROBI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Department of Public Health will this month install condom dispensing slots in all public places in Isiolo district in an effort to fight the spread of AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases.
The dispensing slots will be installed in bars, hotels and lodging houses free of charge, the Kenya News Agency reported this evening.
Local District Public Health officer Wilered Mwai said since Aids has become a threat in the district, the most effective way of fighting it is to avail condoms to the public.
He made the remarks during the opening of a two-day workshop for public health technicians in his district.
The theme of the workshop is "promotion and use of condoms to prevent AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases among rural communities".
Participants were challenged to educate rural people on proper usage of condoms because many cases are being reported in rural areas, the report said.
NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Japan International Agency (JICA) will provide an annual 90 million Kenya Shillings (1.5 million U.S.
Dollars) to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) under a five-year aid package starting from 1996.
An agreement to this effect was signed last Friday in Nairobi by the Director of KEMRI, Dr Davy Koech, and the head of the JICA implementation study team, Prof Shunzo Chiba.
The money will be used for the research and control of infectious diseases project which will focus on research on HIV/AIDS, acute respiratory infections and viral hepatitis.
The Japanese contribution in this project will involve the development of human resources, the transfer of technology from Japan and the strengthening of infrastructure and capacity for health research.
KEMRI has since its inception in 1979 received assistance from the government of Japan through JICA.
NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and the World Bank today jointly launched a multi-million dollar project for the control and prevention of sexually transmitted infection (STI) and the killer disease of AIDS in the east African state.
Launching the project in Nairobi today, the Kenyan Minister for Health Joshua Angatia said the government contributed 4.5 U.S. million dollars to the project, while the World Bank provided 40.5 million U.S. dollars of financial aid.
Angatia called on international aid institutions and donors countries to make further donations to the AIDS-ridden country, saying effective AIDS prevention in the country required an estimated 14 million U.S. dollars each year.
He gave credit to the Kenyan National Aids and STI Program in their efforts to control and prevent the spread of the diseases, but emphasised a change of unhealthy habits to check their spread.
The minister also urged various NGOs related to control and prevention of AIDs to continue supplementing the government efforts in reducing the AIDS cases in the country.
NAIROBI, January 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in leading Kenyan newspapers today.
Daily Nation -- Cases of typhoid, dysentery and other waterborne diseases are on the increase in parts of Nairobi, a doctor said yesterday.
Kenya Times -- Kenyan Police yesterday swung into full action as investigations into scandal-ridden Kenya Ports Authority intensified today in the country's largest sea-port town, Mombasa.
East African Standard -- An anti-corruption police squad from Nairobi yesterday swept through the Port of Mombasa and homes of officials as the investigation into the 1,288 cars that vanished from the docks intensified.
NAIROBI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Cases of heart attacks in Kenya have increased by almost tenfold in last 30 years, a Kenya cardiologist, Dr Daniel Gikonyo has said.
Dr Gikonyo, who did not disclosed the specific number of cases of heart attacks, said that the rising incidences of coronary artery diseases among Africans over the years have been noted and are a cause of growing concern.
Dr Gikonyo was speaking on Friday evening during the launch of a coronary heart disease (CHD) drug, Lescol, developed by Sandoz Pharma.
The drug was launched first in 1994 in the United States.
He blamed smoking, lack of exercises, excess body weight, psychological stress among other factors as the main contributors to the rising figures.
He said some of the risk factors are preventable.
Reports said road accidents, HIV infection which causes the killer disease of Aids account for the largest number of deaths in Africa.
JOHANNESBURG, February 5 (Xinhua) -- A five-member specialist team from South Africa left for Nairobi Thursday to help Kenyan authorities investigate the serious outbreak of Rift Valley fever in that country, South African Foreign Ministry said.
The experts from the South African Institute for Virology were expected to stay in Kenya for about a week to do field investigations and collect specimens to be sent back to South Africa for testing in specialist laboratories.
The Foreign Ministry decided to provide financial support for the team following a request from the Kenyan medical authorities and the World Health Organization, a statement of the ministry said.
It said the assistance was "a reflection of the commitment of the South African government to cooperate with fellow African countries in eradicating infectious diseases on our continent and thus ensuring a better quality of life for all its inhabitants".
Rift Valley viral/hemorrhagic fever broke out after heavy rains and floods in Kenya.
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has decided that chloroquin drugs will soon be phased out in favor of sulphur-based drugs as the first line of treatment for malaria, "The East African" reported today.
John Ouma, head of the Division of Vector Borne Diseases at the Health Ministry, was quoted as saying that a recent study in malaria-affected areas revealed "more than 50 percent total clinical failure after chloroquin drugs were used on patients".
Since April, one of the worst highland malaria in recent years broke out mainly in Rift Valley and Nyanza provinces, western Kenya, leading to a death toll of 333 people.
Ouma noted that a possible cause of the high death toll was resistance to chloroquin-based anti-malaria drugs.
The weekly paper quoted Davy Koech, director of the Kenya Medical Research Institute, as saying that malaria is a curable infection and the deaths could be as low as zero.
He warned that advertisements for chloroquin-based drugs may be misleading, adding that these messages have made people go for a product that is only going to suppress and not clear the parasite.
Chloroquin resistance first emerged in Tanzania in the 1970's after a mass chemo-therapy effort to eradicate the parasite using chloroquin failed and certain parasites survived.
Highland malaria, which occurs mainly in areas at around 2,000 meters above sea level, is caused by the plasmodium falciparum parasite transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito which thrives in the wet and humid conditions of such areas after the March-May long rains in the east African country.
NAIROBI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa Dr Ibrahim Samba has said that malaria, diarrhea, respiratory diseases and malnutrition are major killers of African people.
The visiting WHO official said that about 70 percent of people in Africa are afflicted by the four diseases, the local "Kenya Times" reported today.
He said malaria cases reported worldwide annually were 4 million out of which 3 million were in Africa.
He noted that malaria alone claims 2 million people in Africa annually.
The WHO Regional Director, who is on a mission to study the health situation in Africa, was meeting the Mombasa Town clerk, Mituma Angaine in Mombasa on Thursday.
Dr Ibrahim Samba said that his organization is committed to supporting the Kenyan government and the local communities in their efforts to provide health services to the local people.
NAIROBI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Out of 1,027,000 live births, 92,000 children under the age of five in Kenya die annually due malnutrition and attendant diseases, the East African Standard newspaper reported today.
And for every 1,000 births in east Africa's Uganda and Tanzania, 141 children die of the same causes, said Ratemo Michieka, Vice Chancellor of the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), at an ongoing international food workshop here.
Many parts of Africa had in recent years experienced acute food shortage and serious famine, leading to major cases of malnutrition, he said.
He noted that about 200 million children under the age of five in developing countries are malnourished and incapable of fighting diseases.
The three-day workshop, with the theme of "Formulation and Implementation of Nutrition Programs," is jointly organized by JKUAT and the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
More than 40 experts from Kenya, Tanzania, Namibia, Uganda, Chile, Malawi, Ethiopia, Zambia and FAO headquarters attended the meeting to which is to end tomorrow.
NAIROBI, January 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is reviewing its public health act in order to meet the challenges posed by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the People Daily said Tuesday.
The reviewed act will create an enabling and conducive environment in the fight against the killing disease, Kenyan Minister of Public Health Sam Onger Monday told a sub-regional meeting of the United Nations Theme Groups on International Partnership against HIV/AIDS in Africa.
The new act will address a wide range of issues concerning environmental, sanitary and housing problems, Onger was quoted as saying.
It will also address the current loopholes which encourage the spread of the deadly disease, the minister added.
Since the first case of AIDS was discovered in Kenya in 1984, 1.9 million of the over 30 million Kenyans have been affected by the virus.
It is estimated that some 500 Kenyans die of AIDS-related diseases every day.
NAIROBI, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti has said that 14 out of 100 Kenyans are infected by HIV, the virus which causes AIDS.
Kenya's productive age group is in danger of being wiped out by the disease, Saitoti said Monday at the opening of a workshop on advocacy and communication on HIV/AIDS in Eldoret, a city in west Kenya.
Saitoti told the participants that nearly 500 Kenyans die of AIDS everyday, making it the biggest killer of Kenyans in the productive age group of 15 to 49.
Media reports Tuesday quoted the vice-president as saying that 18 percent of girls aged between 15 and 19 are infected by the virus every year.
Saitoti urged teachers, parents and church leaders to inform the youth on the dangers of the disease.
Research by the National AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control indicates that more than 1.9 million adults and 100,000 children in Kenya are infected with HIV/AIDS.
He also noted that there are more than 700,000 children orphaned by AIDS in the country, saying "this figure could reach 1.5 million by 2005 given the current trends of AIDS-related death".
The vice-president said there is also a rise in mother-child transmission of HIV in Kenya, with 30 to 40 percent of the children born to the mothers with HIV being infected with the AIDS virus during breast feeding.
WASHINGTON, February 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States is concerned over more "terrorist" attacks by forces of Osama bin Laden, the man allegedly linked with last year's U.S. embassy bombings in Africa, CIA Director George Tenet said Tuesday.
"We have noted recent activity similar to what occurred prior to the African embassy bombings...
And I must tell you we are concerned that one or more of bin Laden's attacks could occur at any time," Tenet told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
"We are anticipating bombing attempts with conventional explosives, but his operatives are also capable of kidnappings and assassinations," he said.
Saudi suspect bin Laden is accused of plotting the bomb attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August that killed 250 people.
"There is not the slightest doubt that Osama bin Laden, his worldwide allies, and his sympathizers are planning further attacks against us," Tenet said.
The United States is offering up to 5 million dollars for information leading to bin Laden's arrest or conviction for his alleged role in the embassy bombings.
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Investigators in the Aug.
7 bombing of the American Embassy in Tanzania said Saturday they had made ``great strides,'' having already determined what the bomb was made of and who carried it to the embassy.
Police were also holding two suspects and three informants in custody, Tanzanian director of criminal investigation Rajabi Adadi said.
Kenneth Piernick, head of FBI investigators in Tanzania, said the investigation had made ``great strides''.
``Investigators have made extraordinary discoveries,'' Piernick added.
``They are now well aware of the composition of the bomb and are also well aware how the device was delivered and who delivered it''.
He refused to elaborate.
Adadi said one of the suspects arrested is Tanzanian and the other a foreigner.
He would not identify the foreigner or his nationality, but did not deny media reports that the suspect was Sudanese.
Twin bombings at U.S.
Embassies in Tanzania and the Kenyan capital Nairobi on Aug.
7 killed 257 people, 11 of them in Tanzania.
More than 5,400 people were injured in Kenya and more than 70 in the Tanzanian commercial capital Dar es Salaam.
``Police have some leads regarding the event,'' Adadi said, speaking in Swahili.
``They know who took the device to the embassay, and they also know some of the people responsible for the event and others whose roles have not yet been proven''.
He said the three informants had all participated in the preparations for the bombing, mostly unwittingly, and were now cooperating with the investigation.
Media reports in Tanzania have said the ingredients for the bombs had orignated in the Middle East, and were transferred by sea via the Comoros Islands to Tanzania.
Similar reports in Nairobi said components were also transported from Tanzania to Nairobi by road.
On Wednesday, police in the island archipelago off the Tanzanian coast raided two homes and searched for a suspect in the bombings identified as Abdallah Mohammed Fadhul, a Comorian Muslim who had lived with his wife in Sudan until shortly after the embassy bombings.
U.S. cruise missiles on Aug.
20 struck at targets in Sudan and Afghanistan that Washington linked to the bombings.
The missiles destroyed a pharmaceutical factory on the outskirts of Khartoum that Washington said stocked bomb-making materials, an allegation Khartoum has denied.
The missiles also targeted Afghan-based camps of Islamic militants supporting fugitive Osama bin Laden, who investigators believe was behind the bombings Two key suspects in the Kenya bombing, who have been linked to bin Laden, have been handed over to the United States for trial in the murders of 10 Americans at the Nairobi embassy.

DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Tanzania expelled five Iraqis and a Libyan who were questioned by the FBI and police in connection of the bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa last month, a newspaper reported Friday.
Immigration officials escorted the Libyan, Atif Issa Enhamed, to the airport and put him on a flight to an undisclosed Middle East destination, said Uhuru, or Freedom, a Swahili newspaper owned by the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party.
Five Iraqis, whose names were not disclosed, also were deported, the newspaper said.
It gave no reason for the expulsions and Tanzania's criminal investigation and immigration departments could not be reached for comment.
Nearly simultaneous bombings at U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, on Aug.
7 killed 258 people, including 12 Americans, and injured more than 5,500 people.
Of those killed, 11 were killed in Tanzania.
Two key suspects in the Kenya bombing have been handed over to the United States for trial.
American authorities allege the attacks were plotted by Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden.
On Sunday, Tanzanian police and FBI agents said they had made ``extraordinary discoveries,'' having determined what the Dar es Salaam bomb was made of and who carried it to the embassy.
They refused to provide details.
Media reports in Tanzania have said the ingredients for the bombs had originated in the Middle East and were transferred by sea via the Comoro Islands to Tanzania.
Reports in Kenya said the components of the bomb that exploded in Nairobi were transported by road from Tanzania to Kenya.
The East African nations share a long and mostly unguarded border.
On Sept.
2, police in the Comoros archipelago, off the Tanzanian coast, raided two homes and searched for a suspect in the bombings identified as Abdallah Mohammed Fadhul, a Comorian Muslim who had lived with his wife in Sudan until shortly after the bombings.

DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ The bomb outside the U.S.
Embassy in Tanzania was so powerful that it shook furniture in homes a mile away.
But the solid construction of the Israeli-built embassy may have prevented the carnage of a similar bomb in Kenya, an official said Saturday.
Another reason was the location _ a quiet tree-lined neighborhood.
The embassy away from the center of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's laid-back capital of swaying palms and sparse traffic, is largely free from the congestion that plagues most other major African cities.

DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Tanzania has expelled 14 foreigners questioned in connection with the Aug.
7 bombing of the U.S.
Embassy here.
Immigration Department spokesman Herbert Chilambo said Thursday that five Iraqis, five Sudanese, two Libyans, one Turk and another person whose nationality was not given were handed over by police to immigration authorities on Aug.
27 for expulsion.
``Lack of direct evidence to connect them to the bomb atttack at the U.S.
Embassy in the city was a major reason for their release,'' Chilambo said.
He did not say when the expulsions took place, but he did say that two of the Sudanese remained in his department's custody pending investigation to determine whether they will be declared prohibited immigrants.
The Aug.
7 blast at the embassy in a residential neighborhood killed 11 people.
In neighboring Kenya, an almost simultaneous explosion at the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi killed 247 people, 12 of them Americans.
Two men are in custody in the United States in connection with the murder of the 12 Americans in Nairobi, and a third is being sought.
In the northern city of Arusha Thursday, Adadi Rajabu, director of the police Criminal Investigations Division who is also the head of the task force looking into the bombing, said police are still holding two principal suspects _ a Tanzanian and a foreigner whose nationality he would not reveal.
Rajabu said three other people, including the owner of a metal workshop where the explosive device reportedly was attached to a vehicle, were in detention and helping police with the investigation. (rn/sl)
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Police said Saturday that seven people had been arrested in a sweep following the bombing of the U.S.
Embassy here three weeks ago, but did not say whether those detained were suspected in connection with the attack.
The seven were arrested earlier this week near the Tanzanian border port of Tunduma, on the Zambian frontier, said a police officer speaking on condition of anonymity.
Their identitities and nationalities were not disclosed.
The suspects were reportedly sent to the commercial capital of Dar es Salaam under heavy police escort.
Police had been staging a nationwide manhunt for suspects since the August 7 bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Dar es Salaam, which killed 11 people.

NAIROBI, Kenya _ Tanzania charged two men on Monday with 11 counts of murder in connection with the bombing of the U.S.
Embassy there on Aug.
7. The action contrasted markedly to a decision by Kenya, where the American Embassy was bombed on the same day.
Kenya has sent two suspects to the United States, where they have been indicted, and diplomats suggested that the Tanzanian decision set up a potential diplomatic conflict with the United States and might hamper the investigation.
In Kenya, 236 Kenyans and 12 Americans were killed.
Eleven people died in Tanzania.
With three FBI agents in court on Monday in Dar es Salaam, the Tanzanian capital, the government provided no details beyond the defendants' names.
But authorities in Kenya and diplomats said that one man, Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, was interrogated in the fall about terrorist activities in Kenya, including a plot to bomb the American Embassy, and that he was wanted in Egypt for terrorist activities.
While living in Kenya from 1994 to last year, Ahmed's life paralleled that of Wahid el Hage, who was indicted last week in New York and has been accused of working with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born financier whom the United States believes was behind the embassy bombings.
Ahmed and el Hage, of Arlington, Texas, arrived here in 1994 and went into gem trading.
They were interrogated in the fall, el Hage in the United States, shortly leaving Kenya, and Ahmed here.
It is not publicly known what prompted the interrogations, in which the two told of knowing bin Laden, officials said.
In his interrogation Ahmed provided details of a plot to attack the American Embassy using three vehicles, said a report last month in The Nation, a respected independent newspaper here.
An American diplomat said Monday that the threat had been dismissed as not serious.
In Tanzanian Magistrate's Court on Monday, Ahmed, an Egyptian, and the other defendant, Rashid Saleh Hemed, a Tanzanian, did not enter formal pleas.
Ahmed told the court that he did not understand how he could be charged because on the day of the bombings he was in Arusha, 300 miles north of the capital, on the border with Kenya.
One defendant indicted in the United States in the bombings, Mohamed Saddiq Odeh, has said an Egyptian named Mustafa had led the Tanzanian operation.
In a statement to authorities in Pakistan, Odeh, who was caught returning from Kenya on a false passport, also said he went to Kenya in 1994 on an invitation from Mustafa, according to a Pakistani summary of the interrogation.
In his interrogation by Kenyan officials in the fall, Ahmed said that he had grown up and gone to primary school in Zaire, later attending Al Azhar University in Cairo, where he received a degree in agricultural engineering.
He said he worked in Kuwait for the Defense Ministry from 1980 until August 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait.
He returned to Zaire to set up a gem business and did deals, he said, for Mobutu Sese Seko, the country's dictator, who was overthrown last year.
Ahmed moved here in 1994 and set up a branch of his gem business here, he told the police.
He also told the police that he was well acquainted with Islamic radicals and provided them with details about a plot to blow up the American and Israeli Embassies.
He said that three vehicles would be used to attack the American embassy, and that on Oct.
22, 1997, he and another man took pictures of both embassies.
The Kenyans passed that information to the embassy, information that the American diplomat, who insisted on anonymity, said was found not to be credible.
Egypt has a ``big criminal file'' on Ahmed, arising out of his terrorist activities there, said an official in Tanzania, who added, ``They have enough to bring him to trial in Egypt and in the United States''.
Egypt has not requested his extradition and is not very likely to, preferring to leave the issue to the United States, a person in the Egyptian Foreign Office said.
The American Embassy in Tanzania declined to answer whether the United States has or would request Ahmed's extradition.
Two senior diplomats accredited to Tanzania said they thought that Tanzania would resist efforts to have Ahmed or Hemed extradited.
Tanzania, they noted, has long sought to assert its independence from the United States and other world powers.
CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ An Australian man who was among 14 foreigners arrested in connection with the U.S.
Embassy bombing in Tanzania has been released, Australian officials said Wednesday.
Muhamed Hassan Qassim, a Somali-born Australian citizen, has been freed by Tanzanian authorities, said a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``The department can confirm he has been released,'' the spokesman said.
Qassim, believed to come from Sydney, had just arrived in Tanzania with his wife and five children to take up a position with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees when he was arrested by authorities investigating the blast.
``They've been checking identities and papers and he was caught up in that,'' the spokesman said.
UNHCR spokesman Paul Stromberg said Qassim was arrested for not carrying his passport in a security sweep following the blast.
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the Australian man was not a suspect in the blast.
``To the best of my knowledge this Australian has been detained because he didn't have on his person a passport when he was stopped,'' Downer said.
``He does somewhere have an Australian passport but he didn't happen to have the passport on his person at the time he was questioned.
``I understand in Tanzania a lot of people have been stopped and asked questions by authorities, but there isn't any indication that he had in any way any involvement whatsoever in the bombings that took place''.
The Tanzanian embassy bombing killed 10 people and injured 70, while a simultaneous bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Kenya killed at least 224 people and injured 5,000.
The other foreigners arrested in Tanzania over the bombing include six Iraqis, six Sudanese and a Turkish citizen.
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Two suspects held in connection with the Aug.
7 bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Tanzania will be charged in a local court next week, a newspaper said Saturday.
Omar Mahita, head of the Tanzanian police, told the Swahili-language daily Mtanzania that local detectives and FBI agents have completed preliminary investgations and have asked the Director of Public Prosecution to initiate criminal proceedings against the two.
``We shall prosecute these in Tanzania...
any time from next week, but not after Monday or Tuesday,'' Mahita told the newspaper.
Earlier this week, Adadi Rajabu, Tanzania's director of criminal investigation, said police were holding two principal suspects _ a Tanzanian and a foreigner whose nationality he would not reveal.
The blast at the U.S.
Embassy killed 11 people, all of them Tanzanians or other Africans.
A nearly simultaneuous blast at the U.S.
Embassy in neighboring Kenya killed 247 people, including 12 Americans.
The United States has formally charged two suspects for the murder of the 12 Americans and is seeking a third.
The two are being held in New York.
Over the last two weeks, Rajabu and his team have been involved in intensive consulations with the Attorney General's office and Rajabu in preparing the formal charges.
It is expected that the suspects will face charges of murder, conspiracy and bombing.
Mahita said others who are still in detention in connection with the bombing and who could not be linked with it will be released soon.
``There is no point to continue holding those we could not prove their involvement in the incident.
... We shall consult with our FBI partners to establish those we shall release,'' Mahita said.
Mahita did not name the two he said would be charged and would only identify them as a Tanzanian from Zanzibar and a foreigner.
Criminal investigation director Rajabu said the three people remaining in police custody possess what he called valuable information that would assist investigators in their task.
Among the three is a prominent Dar Es Salaam businessman, Thomas Lyimo, the owner of Tomy Spares Manufactures Ltd.
, a metal-working shop where part of the bomb is said to have been assembled.
Police said Lyimo was uncooperative with Tanzanian investigators and FBI agents when he was arrested and questioned during early stages of the investigation. (rn/sl)
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton Thursday condemned terrorist bomb attacks at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and vowed to find the bombers and bring them to justice.
"No matter what it takes, we must find those responsible for these evil acts and see that justice is done," Clinton said at the ceremony marking the return of remains of Americans who were killed in the Kenya embassy bombing.
The ceremony was held at Andrews Air Force Base, near Washington, where 10 of 12 American victims of the Kenya embassy bombing were brought back by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
Clinton said the United States will not retreat from the world because of terrorist attacks.
Albright, echoing the president, said the United States would "continue to be present around the world, wherever we have interests to defend".
"We will do all we can to protect our diplomatic and military peoples around the world," she said.
Clinton met with his top aides Wednesday in the White House to assess the situation following the twin bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which have killed more than 250 people and injured over 5,000, most of them Kenyans and Tanzanians.
Twelve Americans were killed in the Kenya embassy bombing.
Clinton ordered an assessment of what it would cost to rebuild the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the price tag for emergency response teams sent to the two countries.
He also asked for a "list of the priorities for improving security for U.S. facilities around the world".
The State Department and the Office of Management and Budget will jointly make the assessments "in the next few days," and the president will present the report to Congress for more emergency funding.
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A Tanzanian and an Egyptian face death by hanging after Tanzanian authorities charged the men with murder in connection with the U.S.
Embassy bombing in Tanzania.
Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed each were charged with 11 counts of murder.
The Aug.
7 bombing killed 11 people, all Africans.
Resident Magistrate Amiri Maneto said no bail was allowed.
A trial date will be set Oct.
5. Police and soldiers stood guard while the two men arrived at the courthouse, in the center of Dar es Salaam.
Three FBI agents also were present at the hearing.
Although no details were released in court, local media said traces of chemicals that could have been used to make the bomb had been found in Saleh's home and car.
Police, the reports said, also were seeking two unidentified men who had visited Saleh often before the bombing.
No information was available on why charges were filed against Ahmed, who authorities said also is known as Said Ahmed and Saleh Aben Alahales.
Ahmed told the court he couldn't understand why he was charged because he was not even in Dar es Salaam on the day of the bombing.
He said he was in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
Ahmed, a heavyset and bearded man, wore glasses, a gray T-shirt and faded slacks.
Saleh, slender and bearded, did not make a statement.
He is a native of Zanzibar, an island off Tanzania.
A nearly simultaneous bombing at the U.S.
Embassy in neighboring Kenya, killed 248 people.
The National Disaster Operation Center in Nairobi confirmed on Monday the death of a woman injured in the blast, bringing the death toll to 248.
Two men have been indicted in federal court in New York in the murders of the 12 Americans slain in the bombing in Kenya, and several other suspects were being sought.
Among them is Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, who allegedly runs al Qaida, a radical Islamic network accused of planning the bombings.
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A Yemeni citizen who is a suspect in the bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi has been flown to the United States, a newspaper reported Thursday.
The East African Standard, owned by a group of businessmen close to president Daniel arap Moi's Kenyan African National Union party, reported that unidentified sources said the FBI flew Khalid Salim to the United States on Wednesday night.
It was not immediately possible to obtain comment from the FBI, which has about 200 agents in Kenya investigating the Aug.
7 bombing.
Kenyan police also refused comment.
The powerful blast, believed to have been caused by a car bomb, killed 247 people, including 12 Americans in the embassy building.
A nearly simultaneous blast at the U.S.
Embassy in Tanzania killed 11 people.
Kenyan police and the FBI have said they are holding an unspecified number of people for questioning.
But no list of detainees has been made public and no charges appear to have been filed against anyone.
Last week, the local Daily Nation reported that Salim was among three jailed suspects who told police they ran a phony fishmongering business as a cover in preparing to bomb the embassy.
The newspaper also said the three suspects confessed to authorities that they had carried out surveillance prior to the attack.
Neither Kenyan police nor FBI officials investigating the bombing would comment on the report.
One of the suspects, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, was reportedly arrested in Karachi, Pakistan, on Aug.
7 as he arrived from Nairobi.
He was returned to Kenya on Aug.
14, and is said to be either a Jordanian or Palestinian who obtained Kenyan citizenship in 1994.
Local newspapers refer to him as the prime suspect in the bombing, but the FBI has refused all comment.
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Red Cross said Monday it is investigating complaints of harassment from relatives of those killed in the bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Kenya.
In particular, widows are falling prey to relatives who demand large shares of a 100,000 Kenyan shilling (dlrs 1,670) death benefit paid from a national fund as well as a share of marital property, it said.
Deprived of their rightful compensation, and even family property by relatives, some women report they are homeless, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said.
``Greed is global,'' said Al Panico, delegation chief in Nairobi.
``But it is extremely disturbing to hear from women already traumatized by the Nairobi tragedy, and now struggling to care for their children, that their plight is being worsened by those who would profit from their suffering''.
A total of 213 people, including a dozen Americans, were killed in the terrorist bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi on Aug.
7. Another 11 people were killed in the nearly simultaneous bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in neighboring Tanzania.
More than 5,500 people were injured.
A U.S. federal indictment alleges that four followers of Islamic extremist Osama bin Laden plotted a far-reaching terrorist campaign to kill Americans, including the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
Three suspects are in custody in New York, while a fourth is being sought.
The federation is supporting a Kenya Red Cross program to provide medical and social assistance to those disabled in the bombing, as well as immediate families of bombing victims.
About 1,000 people will be helped over the next year. (kjd)
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ An Egyptian formally charged in the Aug.
7 bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Dar es Salaam has been providing investigators with a lot of information but has been less than forthcoming about his role in the blast, sources close to the investigation say.
Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed were charged Sept.
21 in a Dar es Salaam magistrate's court with 11 counts of murder each in the bombing in which 11 people, all Africans, died.
On the same day at almost the same time in neighboring Kenya, a bomb exploded outside the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi, killing 213 people, including 12 Americans.
Ahmed has told investigators that he volunteered information on the Nairobi bombing on Aug.
8 to the British High Commission as well as the FBI and Tanzania's State Security agents.
But he denied having any information on or involvement in the Dar es Salaam bombing.
One source close to the investigation, who asked not to be further identified, said Ahmed seemed to know much more about international terrorism than an ordinary person would.
In an interview Tuesday, Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohamed likened Ahmed to a chameleon.
``He shows you a certain color, but ultimately you find it is not his true color,'' he said.
Investigators believe that Ahmed is linked to both bombings.
They say he and two men who are fugitives visited Tomy Spades Manufacturing in Dar es Salaam to inspect progress on the building of a gas cylinder that is suspected of having been part of the explosive device that blew up the embassy.
The owner of the plant, Thomas Lyimo, and other employees have reportedly identified Ahmed from photographs.
Ameir dismissed a report in the current issue of Newsweek magazine that members of Saudi businessman Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist group posing as U.S. informants had gone to both embassies with phony bomb warnings to learn how their security systems would react.
``Such information would definitely have been passed on to me by my assistants, but as it happens, I had no infomation of that kind at all,'' he said.
The FBI has linked bin Laden and Al Qaeda to both bombings.
Other sources close to the investigation said security at the Dar es Salaam embassy was not high and that the bombing had, in fact, caught security personnel off guard.
Ameir said the investigation has slowed down because the FBI has completely changed its team of agents in Tanzania.
But he did say that investigators have determine that the vehicle that carried the bomb into the embassy compound was a two-ton Japanese-made truck purchased from Jaba Tanzania Ltd.
, a local firm that specializes in second-hand vehicles.
Initial reports indicated the bomb could have been carried on a water tanker truck that periodically distributed water to the embassy and homes in the residential neighborhood. (rn/sl)
WASHINGTON _ Federal law enforcement officials said Saturday that they had obtained information tentatively linking an associate of Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi businessman who has vowed to wage a holy war against the United States, to the bombing of the American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
The officials declined to specify the nature of the evidence connecting Bin Laden to the bombings.
But Saturday's issue of Newsday reported that a witness had identified a Bin Laden associate as having been in the truck carrying the bomb that damaged the U.S.
Embassy in the capital of Kenya and killed more than 200 people.
The newspaper identified the witness as one of the two privately employed security guards working at the embassy gate at the time of the bombing.
In interviews Saturday, intelligence and law enforcement officials who asked not to be identified said there had not been positive identification of the suspect, who was described as a relatively low-level member of Bin Laden's circle.
But officials indicated that this was the first potential evidence leading to Bin Laden, whom the FBI and the CIA have suspected from the start was a key figure in the bombing plot.
American officials have cited him since the early hours of the investigation.
This year he renewed his vow to wage a holy war against the United States, and senior officials have said he has a network in Africa, with U.S. intelligence finding evidence that he has operatives in Kenya.
Although officials caution that there has been no hard evidence linking Bin Laden or his agents to the bombings, Americans point to the nearly simultaneous explosions on Aug.
7 as a sign that the attacks were carried out by sophisticated terrorists.
Bin Laden's network has the financial resources and the organization to have been the mastermind, the officials said.
Another group suspected by the United States is the Cairo-based Islamic Jihad, but it, too, is financed by Bin Laden, American officials said.
The son of a wealthy Saudi family that made its money in the construction business, Bin Laden is thought to have been involved in the bombings of two U.S. military installations in Saudi Arabia.
But for lack of evidence, the United States has never issued an arrest warrant for him.
Bin Laden lived for a time in the Sudan.
He is said to live in Afghanistan now, under the protection of the Taliban, the fundamentalist Islamic group that controls most of the country. &QL;
NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors charged Wednesday that the American Embassy in Tanzania was attacked by at least six men who detonated a bomb packed with car batteries and oxygen tanks, apparently to enhance the lethal force of the explosion.
One of the bombers died in the assault, which killed 11 people and wounded more than 80, while another photographed the destruction before fleeing, prosecutors asserted in a new indictment returned Wednesday.
The indictment provides the first detailed account of the bombing on Aug.
7 of the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
It accuses five men of conspiring with Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is suspected of organizing the simultaneous bomb attacks on the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya as well as other acts of terrorism against Americans abroad.
All five of the new suspects are at large, authorities said, and each faces charges for which he could, if eventually convicted, face the death penalty in the United States.
The government announced rewards of up to $5 million each for information leading to the arrest or capture of the new suspects, matching a similar amount being offered in the case of bin Laden and two other associates.
The indictment brings to 14 the number of men known to have been charged by federal prosecutors in their investigation of the embassy bombings and bin Laden's global organization.
Four of those are in custody in New York and two others are awaiting extradition from Germany and Britain.
``Today's charges reaffirm the mutual and unrelenting resolve of Tanzania and Kenya and American authorities to find, apprehend and prosecute every single person who participated in the murderous terrorist bombings in East Africa,'' Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said at a news conference.
Prosecutors did not charge the two men who are being held in Tanzania in connection with the bombing.
One of those men, Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, walked into the American embassy late last year and warned authorities about a plot to blow up the embassy in Nairobi.
American officials have declined to say why they are not seeking his extradition.
The government has previously charged bin Laden and associates with the bombing in Tanzania, but until now has provided few details.
Previous indictments in the case have been much more expansive about the bombing of the Nairobi embassy, which left more than 200 dead and thousands injured.
In the latest indictment, prosecutors suggest the two attacks were coordinated so as to occur almost simultaneously in the two countries, under the supervision of members of bin Laden's group.
For example, the indictment describes a meeting between one of the suspects in the Tanzania attack, Mustafa Mohamed Fadhil, an Egyptian in his early 20s, and Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, who has since been arrested and charged in the Kenya attack.
It says they discussed a fatwa, or religious opinion, in which bin Laden called for attacks against Americans.
In June, Fadhil and another suspect in Tanzania rented a villa in Dar es Salaam, which became the ``bomb factory,'' prosecutors charged..
Around that time, the indictment says, Odeh and other Kenya-based operatives were preparing in that country for the attack in Nairobi.
In June and July, the indictment says, the suspects in Tanzania bought a 1987 Nissan Atlas truck to carry the bomb to the embassy, and a white Suzuki Samurai, in which the suspects would flee.
The suspects arranged for welding and other mechanical work to be done on the truck, apparently to equip it to carry the bomb, the indictment says.
They also were said to have bought oxygen and acetylene tanks and two large truck batteries.
Experts say these are typically used to augment the ignition and explosion of a bomb.

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) On Aug.
5, two days before the bombings, one of the conspirators in Tanzania telephoned a counterpart in Nairobi, the indictment says.
Suspects in each country fled just before the bombings occurred, it says.
On Aug.
6, for example, the night before the attacks, Odeh flew on Pakistani International Airways Flight (NU)746 to Karachi, Pakistan, along with one of the suspects who helped to prepare the Tanzania attack, the indictment says.
It says the men left on instructions from other members of bin Laden's group.
On Aug.
7, a man described only as ``Ahmed the German'' detonated the explosive device in Dar es Salaam, which was being carried in the Nissan Atlas truck along with the tanks and batteries.
He died in the explosion.
Minutes later, another operative who was riding in the Suzuki Samurai photographed the embassy ruins as he left the scene, the indictment said.
In addition to Fadhil, the other four men charged Wednesday were two Tanzanians, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed and Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, each 24, and two Kenyans, Fahid Mohammed Ally Msalam, 22, and Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan, 29.
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Investigators in the Aug.
7 bombing of the American Embassy in Tanzania said Saturday they had made ``extraordinary discoveries,'' having determined what the bomb was made of and who carried it to the embassy.
Police were also holding two suspects and three informants in custody, Tanzanian director of criminal investigation Rajabi Adadi said.
``Investigators have made extraordinary discoveries,'' said Kenneth Piernick, head of FBI investigators in Tanzania.
``They are now well aware of the composition of the bomb and are also well aware how the device was delivered and who delivered it''.
He refused to elaborate.
Adadi said one of the suspects arrested is Tanzanian and the other is a foreigner.
He would not identify the foreigner or his nationality, but did not deny media reports that the suspect was Sudanese.
Twin bombings at U.S.
Embassies in Tanzania and the Kenyan capital Nairobi on Aug.
7 killed 257 people, 11 of them in Tanzania.
More than 5,400 people were injured in Kenya and more than 70 in the Tanzanian commercial capital Dar es Salaam.
``Police have some leads regarding the event,'' Adadi said, speaking in Swahili.
``They know who took the device to the embassy, and they also know some of the people responsible for the event and others whose roles have not yet been proven''.
He said the three informants had all participated in the preparations for the bombing, mostly unwittingly, and were now cooperating with the investigation.
Media reports in Tanzania have said the ingredients for the bombs had originated in the Middle East, and were transferred by sea via the Comoros Islands to Tanzania.
Similar reports in Nairobi said components were also transported from Tanzania to Nairobi by road.
On Wednesday, police in the island archipelago off the Tanzanian coast raided two homes and searched for a suspect in the bombings identified as Abdallah Mohammed Fadhul, a Comorian Muslim who had lived with his wife in Sudan until shortly after the embassy bombings.
U.S. cruise missiles on Aug.

The missiles destroyed a pharmaceutical factory on the outskirts of Khartoum that Washington said stocked bomb-making materials, an allegation Khartoum has denied.
The missiles also targeted Afghan-based camps of Islamic militants supporting fugitive Osama bin Laden, who investigators believe was behind the bombings Two key suspects in the Kenya bombing, who have been linked to bin Laden, have been handed over to the United States for trial in the murders of 10 Americans at the Nairobi embassy.
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Two suspects involved in the bombing of U.S. embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, have been brought to New York for trial, U.S. officials said on Thursday.
The first suspect, Khalid Salim, was flown by the FBI to New York, the officials said.
But the exact date of Salim's arrest was not known.
The U.S. federal prosecutors said they expected the suspect to be arraigned at midday in Manhattan federal court.
FBI Director Louis Freeh, Attorney General Janet Reno and other senior U.S. government officials will hold a news conference at 1 p.m.
EDT (1700GMT) at FBI headquarters in Washington "to announce developments in the investigation of the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania," the FBI said in a statement.
Salim is suspected of throwing a hand grenade to guards outside the Naairobi embassy at the start of the bombing attack, a U.S. law enforcement official said in Washington.
Another suspect, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, was also flown to New York, according to a diplomatic source in Nairobi.
Odeh has been held by Kenyan authorities since August 14, a week after his arrest in Karachi, Pakistan, on the day of the bombing.
The U.S. officials said others among the several suspects in custody in Kenya could also be sent to the United States for trial.
Kenyan officials were said to be eager to seek justice for the hundreds of Kenyan victims of the embassy bombing, but also wary that a trial for an attack on a U.S. target in Kenya might invite new terrorist assaults on Kenyan targets.
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A refrigerator truck transported the bomb that killed at least 11 people and extensively damaged the U.S.
Embassy in Dar es Salaam, the FBI said Friday.
The driver of the truck died in the Aug.
7 blast.
``From the evidence recovered during the crime scene search and subsequent follow-up, it is believed that a 1987 Nissan Atlas refrigeration truck...
was involved in the bombing,'' FBI agent Kenneth Maxwell said in a prepared statement.
Maxwell, who is in charge of the team of FBI investigators in Tanzania, said the cab of the truck was white or beige and the cargo box was silver.
Initial reports indicated the bomb could have been carried into the embassy compound on a water tanker truck that periodically distributed water to the embassy and homes in the residential neighborhood.
Maxwell read the statement as Adadi Rajab, head of the Tanzanian Police Criminal Investigation Department, looked on.
Neither took questions.
But as he was leaving, Rajab told reporters the driver of the refrigerator truck died in the blast, and the death toll could rise above the 11 dead, all Africans, who have been counted so far.
It was not clear whether the driver of the truck was among the 11 dead.
On the same day at almost the same time in neighboring Kenya, a bomb exploded outside the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi, killing 213 people, including 12 Americans.
``A significant amount of progress has been made in this combined effort, and the investigation is proceeding with diligence and speed,'' Maxwell said.
He said photographs of the refrigerator truck and a Suzuki Samurai car believed to have been used by bombing suspects are being circulated.
He asked people who might have noticed either vehicle to contact police.
``It is only through this type of alliance between law enforcement authorities and the citizens they protect that all our communities become safer places in which to live,'' Maxwell said.
Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed were charged Sept.
21 in a Dar es Salaam magistrate's court with 11 counts of murder each.
Investigators say Ahmed has been providing them with a lot of information but has been less than forthcoming about his role in the blast.
Ahmed has told investigators he volunteered information on the Nairobi bombing to the British High Commission in Dar es Salaam on Aug.
8 as well as to the FBI and Tanzania's State Security agents.
But investigators say he has denied having any information on or involvement in the Dar es Salaam bombing.
Investigators believe Ahmed is linked to both bombings.
They say he and two men who are fugitives visited Tomy Spades Manufacturing in Dar es Salaam to inspect progress on the building of a gas cylinder that is suspected of having been part of the explosive device that blew up the embassy.
The owner of the plant, Thomas Lyimo, and other employees have reportedly identified Ahmed from photographs.
The FBI has linked Saudi Arabia billionaire fugitive in Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda organization, to both bombings. (rn/cm/sl)
NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The man who hurled a grenade at security guards at the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi seconds before the deadly bomb exploded on August 7 has been positively identified as two more people arrested, Kenya's national newspapers said Friday.
Khalid Mohammed, a suspect held by the Kenyan-U.S.
joint probe team following the bomb raid, was picked out by three of eight witnesses Thursday, according to a report from the Daily Nation newspaper.
The report said it now appears that only two suicide bombers died in the blast, compared with earlier reports that all the three bombers who drove to the embassy died.
"The man who was positively identified was slightly injured by the August 7 blast but he escaped with minor wounds which have healed.
This is the man who jumped from the pick-up at the parking bay of the embassy, hurled a grenade at the guards before the bomb exploded," the report quoted a source as saying.
It said Khalid, who can not speak English or Kiswahili but only Arabic, was identified by a guard and a civilian worker at the embassy and a third witness.
The witnesses also sustained injuries from flying objects.
Director of the U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Louis Freech is expected to issue a statement about the bombing probe before he leaves Nairobi for Washington at noon Friday.
He came here Thursday evening after a one-day visit to Tanzania.
On Thursday, the investigators also raided offices of Mercy Relief International Agency, a non-governmental organization, in the Kenyan capital Thursday and arrested an Arab and a Sudanese, the East African Standard newspaper reported.
Local sources said the plan to bomb U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania took three months to complete and bombers destined for Kenya were dispatched through Somali and Rwanda.
A senior government official who saw the confessions of suspects was quoted by local media Friday as saying that an Egyptian Islamic Jihad group, linked with Saudi millionaire Osama Bin Laden, who now lives in Afghanistan, planned the attacks.
The car bomb attack at the u.s. embassy in Nairobi reportedly killed 253 people and injured some 5,000 more.
A nearly simultaneous car bombing outside the U.S. embassy in tanzania killed 10 people and wounded about 70 others.
U.S. President Bill Clinton Thursday ordered air raids on terror facilities allegedly used by Laden in Afghanistan and Sudan in a clear revenge attack for the bombings.
Earlier, the U.S.'s demand for Laden's extradition from Afghanistan has been refused by the Taliban government.
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ U.S.
Ambassador Prudence Bushnell wrapped up some unfinished business on Wednesday, meeting with Kenya's trade minister to finish talks that were interrupted by the car bombing of the embassy.
On Aug.
7, Bushnell, Trade Minister Joseph Kimotho and others had just ended a news conference in a building adjacent to the embassy.
They were talking when the bomb went off, killing 247 people and wounding more than 5,000 others.
On Wednesday, Bushnell and Kimotho met again to finish their discussion, Bushnell told Kenya Television.
The ambassador was cut on her lip and hands in the blast, which damaged the embassy, shattered the glass shell of the 22-story Cooperative Bank House and toppled the six-story Ufundi House.
Bushnell continued with her duties throughout the subsequent search and rescue at the blast scene, memorials for those slain, and the relocation to a temporary embassy.
Kimotho, who was hospitalized with a head wound, said he and Bushnell had been talking about the slated visit of U.S.
Commerce Secretary William Daley in September.
His trip is still on, the embassy said.
The blast in Nairobi occurred at almost exactly the same moment as an explosion ripped through the American Embassy in Tanzania's commercial capital Dar es Salaam.
The death toll in the Tanzania blast, initially 10, has risen to 12, hospital officials and family members said Wednesday.
That brought the toll for both bombings to 259.

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Kenyan government has detained several people in connection with the U.S.
Embassy bombing in Nairobi and U.S. law enforcement sources say two are considered suspects.
The detentions were the first in Kenya since Friday's bombing, which killed 247 people and injured more than 5,000.
Police in Tanzania earlier this week said they arrested 14 people in the almost simultaneous bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Dar es Salaam, which took 10 lives.
A Somali-born Australian was subsequently released, presidential spokesman Geoffrey Nkulu said Thursday.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A suspect in the recent bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania was arrested by Pakistani authorities and handed over to Kenya, a foreign ministry spokesman said Sunday.
The suspect, identified as Mohammad Sadik Howaida, was arrested in Karachi on August 7 soon after his arrival from Nairobi, the spokesman said in a statement.
The statement didn't give his nationality.
Howaida was interrogated by Pakistani authorities who decided to send him back to Kenya, the statement said.
Other details were not immediately known.
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents have returned to a white two-story house in a new development on the outskirts of Nairobi believed to be the one rented by a suspect in the U.S.
Embassy bombing in Kenya that killed 248 people, the new tenants said Saturday.
An American couple, who refused to give their names, said FBI agents, who had already searched the house shortly after the Aug.
7 bombing, returned Thursday but were only allowed to check the yard and the exterior of No.
43 in New Runda Estate on the northern edge of the Kenyan capital.
The New York Times reported Saturday that other residents in the estate identified the previous tenant as Haroun Fazil, one of four suspects charged with the murder of the 12 Americans who died in the blast.
According to a complaint filed Sept.
17 by the U.S.
Attorney's office in Manhattan, Fazil, a native of the Comoros Islands off East Africa, rented the house from May to August and was later joined by co-conspirator Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali.
No neighbors, other residents, security guards or household employees were around Saturday to discuss the FBI visit or Fazil's stay.
It was not possible to obtain comment from FBI agents in Nairobi investigating the bombing.
According to the complaint, the bomb that destroyed the embassy was built at the house rented by Fazil, who is a fugitive.
He is alleged to have driven a white pickup truck to the embassy on the day of the bombing to show the way to the vehicle that carried the bomb.
The house is about 12 kilometers (8 miles) from the embassy building in downtown Nairobi.
Fazil, Al-'Owhali and Mohamed Saddiq Odeh, the other suspect charged in the Kenyan bombing, are believed to be members of the al-Qaeda organization founded by Saudi exile Osama bin Laden.
The latter two are in custody in New York.
On Friday Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who was arrested Sept.
16 in Germany on an Iterpol warrant, was charged in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan with murder conspiracy and use of weapons of mass destruction in an international plot to kill U.S. citizens.
He was not charged specifically in the deaths of the Americans killed in the Nairobi bombing.
In an almost simultaneous blast Aug.
7, another bomb killed 11 people, all Africans, at the U.S.
Embassy in neighboring Tanzania.
Two suspects have been charged in the deaths and are being held by police in Dar es Salaam.
Adadi Rajabu, head of criminal investigations for the Tanzanian police, was quoted Saturday in the Swahili language daily Mtanzania saying that police were looking for two fugitives in connection with the bombing.
One of the suspects charged, Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, owned an import-export company in Nairobi and was reported Aug.
18 by the independent Kenyan newspaper, Daily Nation, to have informed the U.S. and Israeli embassies in Nairobi late last year of planned terrorist attacks against them.
Sources told the newspaper the Egyptian had met bin Laden in the mid 1980s.
Embassy officials have denied having prior knowledge of the attack. (gw/sl)
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A magistrate Monday granted a prosecution request to release into police custody one of two suspects charged in the bombing of the U.S.
Embassy to assist in the investigation for five days.
During a 10-minute hearing, Chief Resident Magistrate Projest Rugazia granted the prosecution request that Rashid Saleh Hemed be released into the custody of Asst.
Police Commissioner Robert Manumba.
Hemed, a Tanzanian from Zanzibar, and Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed were formally charged Sept.
21 in the Aug.
7 bombing of the embassy in which 11 people, all Africans, were killed.
Another 70 were injured.
In a nearly simultaneous bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi in neighboring Kenya, 248 people, 12 of them Americans, were killed.
Another 5,400 were injured.
After the hearing was adjourned, reporters were able to speak briefly with Ahmed, who told them he had gone to the British High Commission in Dar es Salaam the day after the bombing and told British diplomats and FBI agents there what he knew about the bombing.
``I told them all what I know before...
when the bombing happened, I was not in Dar es Salaam, I was in Arusha (northern Tanzania),'' he said before police took him away.
Ahmed repeated earlier claims that he had told both Tanzanian and Kenyan officials late last year about plans to bomb the embassy in Dar es Salaam.
It was not immediately possible to obtain confirmation from the British diplomatic mission that Ahmed had gone there three times, the last on Aug.
18, as he claimed.
Both men appeared in court dressed in the same clothes they were wearing at the Sept.
21 hearing, but their hair and beards had been trimmed.
Hemed appeared to be in his mid-20s, Ahmed in his late 30s.
Rugazia set the next hearing for Oct.
19. Two suspects have been indicted in a U.S. federal court in New York in connection with the Nairobi bombing, a third is a fugitive, a fourth is awaiting extradition in Germany and a fifth has been charged in New York with lying to investigations about his relationship to Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of the bombings.

NEW YORK _ Though he left in 1959, when he was 5, Thomas Grover Masters can recall vivid details of his childhood in Korea: The rationed powdered milk he used to eat because it was sweetened.
The three nights he spent sleeping next to his mother's body when, unable to care for her three children alone, she poisoned herself.
The yellow beret his uncle gave him when he was sent to the orphanage in the mountains.
After he was adopted and brought to America, some of his memories were edged out by new experiences: Catholic school and the track team, bacon and eggs.
His name, Suh Ung Ki, became Tommy; his new sister, a Korean girl his age who was adopted at the same time, was called Mary Jane.
English words blotted out Korean.
He forgot the names of his biological brother and sister.
He even forgot, almost, that he was Korean at all.
As Tommy and Mary Jane grew up in Wichita, Kan.
, their parents had no map to navigate the psychological journey from there to here; they did not know a word of the language their new children spoke.
They were advised that it was best to help Tommy and Mary Jane forget the shell-shattered world they had left behind.
Today, international adoptions are nothing like what Masters experienced.
Would-be parents are screened for cultural sensitivity.
They join adoption support groups.
Children go to culture camps, language lessons, and play groups for adopted kids.
At a conference in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., last weekend organized by a group for adopted Koreans and their families, race was the most prominent topic for the 400 families attending.
As children learned Korean-style brush painting in one part of the Hasbrouck Heights Hilton on Saturday, Masters advised parents on the importance of learning about their children's native culture.
``Parents need to realize that to the children, adoption is also a sense of loss,'' he explained.
``Loss of their roots, parts of their personal identity, their biological parents.
``For the most part, the children don't even realize that they have lost this part of themselves until much later''.
It is a speech Masters, 46, is making more and more often, at all kinds of adoption-related gatherings, not just those focused on Korea.
He also helped found Also Known As, a New York group of about 300 younger adults, adopted themselves, who now serve as mentors to adopted children.
Koreans his age have been the first to speak about growing up unprepared to face a world that perceived them as Asian when they saw themselves as American.
``One thing that Korean adoptees have taught the rest of the adoption community is that absence does not take away the importance of culture,'' said Margie Perscheid, an adoptive parent from Washington who helped organize the weekend conference.
``These adult adoptees can tell the adoption professionals who thought they knew it all that they were wrong''.
While adoption professionals are quick to point out that only a small fraction of the thousands of adoptive families in the United States participate in cultural awareness events and support groups, they say more and more parents are seeking guidance on how to handle the issue of race in their families.
Guy and Tina Lindgren came to the conference from the predominantly white town of Conway, Ark.
, hoping to get pointers from other adoptive parents on bringing up their adopted son, Andrew, 22 months.
``Andrew is not your average Arkansan, and pretty soon he's going to know that,'' Lindgren said.
The Lindgrens said they read about Korea regularly, and plan to take Andrew there when he is 4 or 5 to visit his old foster parents.
The family, including Andrew, is learning Korean from a Korean student attending a nearby college.
In the 1950's, adopting foreign children was so unusual that local newspapers often covered the event.
Many older adoptees growing up in small towns never saw another Asian, much less another adopted Korean.
Although scattered international adoptions took place after World War II, families in which the children looked markedly different from the parents began to appear after the Korean War.
Harry Holt, a deeply religious Oregon farmer, and his wife, Bertha, decided that the Lord intended for them to save Korean war orphans who had been fathered, and then deserted, by American GI's.
The Holts adopted eight babies.
And determined to find homes for hundreds more Korean children, they started an agency, Holt International Children's Services.
Between 1955 and 1960, 3,500 Korean children were adopted by American and European families.
While nowadays, more children are adopted each year from Russia and China, South Korea's system remains the model for international adoptions, and there are more than 100,000 adopted Koreans in the United States.
Last year, about 16,000 children were adopted from overseas, 2,000 from South Korea.
In the 1960s, Masters regularly fought with other children because he looked different, and his sister was taunted at school.
But he was proud when Mary Jane, as the only ``exotic'' beauty on the local modeling agency's roster, was hired to dress up as a Native American and hand out cigars, and to sit on the lap of Wichita's mayor as he rode in a rickshaw for Chinese New Year.
``As far as I was concerned, Korea, Japan, China _ those areas were all the same,'' Masters, 46, said in an interview in his apartment in East Brunswick, N.J.
After college, Masters worked as a Wichita police officer, then went to law school and became an agent at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
His sister, Mary Jane Brooks, now works as a nanny in Niceville, Fla.
In 1983, shortly after Masters was hird, the FBI sent him to Las Vegas, where he was invited to a Korean Lions Club dinner.
There, he said, he encountered a roomful of Koreans for the first time since leaving his native country.
``It completely destroyed all the stereotypes that I ever had of Asians,'' he said, remembering his shock at seeing his hosts drain tumblers of bourbon when he had been told that Asians were unable to handle alcohol _ a myth he believed even after he began drinking himself.
The experience prompted him to learn more about his roots.
For other adopted adults, curiosity about the past was kindled in different ways.
Dottie Enrico, 41, a New York journalist who grew up in Indiana, became interested as she recognized how she appeared to others.
``If people were going to see me as Asian,'' she said, ``it became really clear to me that I owed it to myself to know what that meant.
It was something that belonged to me that I missed having''.
Her first visit to Korea in 1997 led her to adopt a Korean child, Eleanor, now nearly 2.
The journey back to Korea, whether metaphorical or actual, can be rough.
In Korean society, adoptees are seen as victims of misfortune, and adoptees say Koreans there and here sometimes reject them for being too Western or for not speaking better Korean.
Meanwhile, some adoptees think adoptive parents can approach the job of educating their children with too much zeal.
Hollee McGinnis, 28, who founded Also Known As with Masters' help, said some parents clung to their children's ethnic identity as if it were their own, or treated their forays into Asian culture as an exotic adventure.
She cautioned against forcing culture camps and language lessons on a reluctant child.
She said she was glad that her parents had not talked openly about her ``Koreanness''.
``I spent half my life not having to think about being Asian,'' she said.
But adoptive parents say they want to give their children the tools to deal with who they are in a complex cultural landscape.
``Many adoptive families really do consider themselves to be the harbingers of a new way of looking at race,'' said Perscheid, the conference organizer.
But people like Masters and Enrico are not so sure.
They said that all else being equal, it would be less traumatic for children if they could find homes in their own countries.
At the same time, both were also quick to say that adoption gave them a better life than they would have if they had remained in Korea.
``I probably would be cleaning up the streets,'' said Masters, now a new-media and international-trade consultant.
``But,'' he added, ``it would have added so much more quality to my life, knowing that we weren't alone.''
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China will not impose more restrictions on Chinese children adopted by foreigners but will have more detailed and standardized adoption procedures, legislators said here today.
A draft of the Adoption Law has relaxed restrictions in many aspects for Chinese and foreigners who apply for adoptions, according to a member of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, Wan Shaofen, who was debating the draft.
In a report submitted to the 4th meeting of the 9th NPC Standing Committee last Monday, Doje Cering, minister of civil affairs, said that the draft has stricter requirements on adoption of Chinese children by foreigners, but Wan pointed out today that "requirements" means adoption procedures.
She said that new procedures could help protect the safety and interests of children who are up for adoption and prevent international crimes.
One of the members, Chen Junliang, said that adoption procedures should be simplified with fewer restrictions for foreigners.
From 1992 to 1997, there were 2,403 adoptions in Liaoning Province, only five of which were by foreigners.
The first commandment for couples wanting to adopt babies is: Put yourselves across.
And they do, in spunky performances on videotapes, in lush scrapbooks and in professional portraiture smiling on the Internet.
Many speak on the Web pages that crowd electronic registries of ``waiting families''.
Gloyd and Penny, for example, say, ``We pray daily for our birth mother and baby _ whoever and wherever they are''.
David and Paula promise, ``This child will be overwhelmed by love and affection''.
Rex and Carol wait, after 14 years of marriage, with a spaniel named Brittney and a vacation home four miles from Disney World.
This is the essence of demand _ unhappily infertile couples _ competing for a smaller and smaller supply of white American-born infants.
It is an imbalance that professionals in the adoption world are calling a crisis, allowing money to play a defining role in determining who will succeed in this desperate quest for that which cannot be legally bought or sold.
Many couples in search of a child are already depleted, emotionally and financially, by drawn-out fertility treatments.
Still, they will pay $15,000 to $20,000 on average, even if they have to mortgage their futures, to find their babies.
Some will spend much more before the day they appear in court to take legal custody of their children.
And a few, people who have the money for intermediaries to do the work, pay up to $100,000 to bring home a newborn.
Adoption is, in a rough analogy to organ transplants, a legal transfer not subject to purchase or bidding.
Nowhere in the United States is it legal to sell a child, and few say it should be.
Nor can anyone sell the right to be an adoptive parent: that is conferred by the state, based on home studies conducted by social workers.
But scarcity has created a cast of thousands of intermediaries, who can and do sell access to the young women who might relinquish babies.
``Everywhere the baby boomers set their feet, a cottage industry springs up,'' said Bernie Riff, an adoptive father.
Riff and his wife, Vicki Young, adopted their daughter, Jessi, 2 1/2, with the help of a facilitator after waiting a long time with an agency that gave them, in Ms.
Young's words, ``nothing but a binder''.
``There are consultants and facilitators,'' Riff said.
``There are photographers, there are all these little marketing things.
People do videos.
There's no limit to what you can spend on these things if you're inclined to and have the resources''.
The process, while hardly simple, is basically the same everywhere.
Every adopting couple typically begins with a home study.
If parents adopt independently, they will probably advertise, although about a dozen states prohibit it.
Pregnant women who respond or are referred to them are screened, and adoptive and biological parents exchange basic biographies.
If all goes well, the adoptive parents pay modest pregnancy-related expenses for the birth mother and, shortly after birth, she legally relinquishes the child.
(If all does not go well, the biological mother decides not to place the child, or, worse, tries to revoke her consent later, the adoptive parents have gambled and lost).
Six months to a year later, a court finalizes the adoption.
An agency will bundle these services, with employees making matches, counseling both biological parents and adopting couples, coordinating medical care and legal services.
The costs for domestic infant adoptions range widely.
Some people adopt infants, joyously and quickly, for $5,000 or $10,000.
They might, in an independent adoption, locate a woman in their own state who has minimal expenses and is certain she wants to place her child; without any legal or medical complications, the total cost might be several thousand dollars.
Placements by state agencies often cost nothing.
Then there are couples who pay sums approaching $100,000 for a closed adoption of a white newborn.
These gray-market placements, which usually involve questionable payments to birth mothers and the brokers who find them, have prompted much legislation and public attention; still, they are a tiny percentage of adoptions.
Finally, the stamp of the marketplace is apparent in one troubling fact: In the baby bazaar, with children of varying colors, cultures and conditions, something resembling a price schedule has emerged.
At many agencies, race determines fees, said William Pierce, president of the National Council for Adoption, an advocacy group for agencies.
``If you have 40 white couples chasing every white newborn, you don't need a lesson in economics,'' Pierce said.
``The only way to stay afloat is to reduce your charge for a black baby and charge more for the white ones''.
A generation ago, unmarried, pregnant women did not have many options.
Some went to places like the Gladney Center in Fort Worth, Texas or the Salvation Army's Booth homes, where they awaited birth while social workers chose adoptive parents.
Before 1973, the year that abortion was legalized, about 9 percent of births to unmarried women in the United States resulted in adoptions.
By 1981 that percentage dropped to 4 percent, and by 1988 to 2 percent.
While the number of unmarried women giving birth has risen each year at least since 1965, the net result is a slight decline in the number of American-born infants available for adoption.
At the same time, according to a rough estimate by the adoption council, about 1 million families are seeking to adopt.
The old-line agencies tried to adapt by letting birth mothers choose adoptive parents.
But in the late 1970s, would-be parents began defecting to lawyers who could help them adopt independently if they _ or the lawyers _ could find a birth mother directly.
The scramble also invited a new type of adoption agency, promising some kind of edge.
American Adoptions of Overland Park, Kan.
, for example, has a ``traditional program'' in which pregnant women choose from an array of profiles of families, but it advises many clients to sign up instead for another program in which parents pay directly for advertisements, and young women who respond are shown the profile of that family first.
In its letter to applicants, the agency says: ``Most traditional adoption programs provide the birth parents with the opportunity to select their `ideal' family.
Where does that leave you''?
Marketing came naturally to Arty Elgart, who started a facilitation service after he adopted his son (from Gladney) 20 years ago.
It was a matter of enthusiasm and altruism: Working out of his auto-parts warehouse in Philadelphia, he made matches as a favor for couples he knew, or friends of friends.
By most accounts, including his own, no one had seen anything quite like it before.
Elgart placed a small newspaper ad that asked, ``PREGNANT?
Young couple wishes to adopt baby.
Call Mary, 289-2229''.
In the view of the sedate nonprofits that dominated the adoption community, this crossed a line of propriety.
Elgart's matchmaking was legal, since he charged no fee and advertising was not prohibited in Pennsylvania.
But his marketing, which progressed to benches, buses and Burger King tray liners, was called everything from unusual to appalling.
Elgart has long since turned his mission into a full-service licensed adoption agency, named Golden Cradle, now in Cherry Hill, N.J.
&UR; BC-ABR-ADOPTION-ECONOMICS-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR; &QL; &UR; UNDATED: Cherry Hill, N.J.
&LR; &QL; ``Golden Cradle started something,'' said Maxine Chalker, executive director of Adoptions from the Heart, of Wynnewood, Pa.
When she started her agency in 1984, she said, ``in the phone book there were maybe three ads under Adoption Services.
Now there must be 40''.
A modest display ad for Adoptions From the Heart is among them.
The agency also advertises on bus shelters and in malls, and has tried radio and television, though the response was disappointing.
``We're always trying to find new things,'' Ms.
Chalker said.
``It gets harder every year because of the competition''.
Some of the competition comes from lawyers who handle independent adoptions: ``Now everybody thinks adoption is easy money, especially the attorneys,'' Ms.
Chalker said.
``Now they're hiring counselors to work in their offices, and setting up as agencies without being licensed''.
The frontier state for the adoption business is California.
The state has long permitted lawyers to recruit pregnant women.
Now, facilitation services, which are unlicensed, are also recruiting and screening birth parents, as well as coaching prospective parents and finding them professional help.
Facilitators operate in many states.
While their activities often come close to legal definitions of child placement, they are generally too new or too few to prompt regulation.
But in California, legislation enacted last year to clarify their role ended up legitimizing a whole new class of entrepreneurs.
Lil Snee, a facilitator in Los Gatos who co-founded an informal trade organization, estimates that 40 to 50 are operating in the state.
For Ellen Roseman, a facilitator in San Anselmo, the main job is coaching prospective parents.
``I make them read everything,'' she said.
``It's like taking a college course''.
Then she helps them piece together deals with pregnant women, lawyers and agencies, often in other states.
She charges a flat fee of $3,450.
At a recent support-group meeting at Ms.
Roseman's house on a winding lane in Marin County, casually dressed current and former clients, many with babies in hand, exchanged stories of false starts and disappointments.
``I think it will get easier with time as people know what to expect, but for now, it's a free-for-all,'' said Riff, the father from Berkeley said over the potluck dinner that followed.
For Ms.
Roseman, a former flight attendant and representative in union negotiations, the enterprise is more like putting together a business deal.
``You sit down and move around the pieces to do two things,'' she said, ``to make sure it's legal and to save money''.
Randall Hicks, an adoption lawyer in Riverside, Calif.
, and the author of ``Adopting in America'' (Wordslinger Press, 1995) calls facilitators ``a garage industry,'' he said, ``not licensed nor trained to do anything''.
He also finds their fees, which can exceed $12,000, out of line.
``They find a baby for you,'' he said, ``then they have to turn it over to a lawyer or an agency''.
Ms. Snee, who lobbied for a licensing system to give facilitators credibility, accepts that that only lawyers can transact the actual adoption.
But she argues: ``We get so bashed.
We provide a service, and just because it involves adoption doesn't mean we should be the saviors of the world and do everything for free''.
For the old-line agencies, ``there are Catch-22's everywhere,'' said Pierce of the National Council for Adoption.
They are torn between the principle that children should not be discounted by race or disability and the reality that that is how one creates a larger pool of parents.
They are torn between the principle that parenthood should not be charged for and the reality that social services are expensive.
At the Gladney Center, fees do not come close to covering costs.
Thanks to its endowment and its large campus, where about half its birth mothers live, Gladney can offer an array of services: three dormitories, a health clinic, chapel, dining hall, swimming pool and greenhouse, as well as high school and community college courses, vocational training, legal representation and counseling to be available for the rest of the birth mothers' lives.
All of this costs the agency, on average, $32,000 per resident.
But Ms.
Smith, the marketing coordinator, said the average placement fee is $20,000.
Many agencies, including Gladney, use sliding scales to accommodate lower-income families.
Still, Pierce said, ``the economics of adoption is going to cause you to prefer the people who pay the higher fee''.
High fees help subsidize the work necessary to find homes for hard-to-place children, at least in the agencies that undertake the job, he said, adding that, in some states, agencies receive ``bounties'' to recruit adoptive families for children in foster care or to place disabled children who are costly to the state.
``Say you have a kid who's HIV-positive in the hospital costing $1,000 a day,'' Pierce said.
``To pay someone to find adoptive parents is entirely reasonable, but what does that look like to the public''?
It may also look terrible to charge less to place minority or special-needs children, but many agencies say they have little choice.
Gladney, for one, has a lower-cost program for African-American and biracial children.
``Unfortunately, we had to create a separate program because adoptive parents were simply not coming forward,'' Ms.
Smith said.
Under that program, the agency charges $8,000.
In international adoption, the scramble is entirely different: it is for parents.
The Adoptive Families of America's current ``Guide to Adoption'' contains ads for 35 agencies, 33 of which advertise foreign programs.
``Your child is waiting for you,'' the headline on one announces.
``We go with you to China''!
Most of the long-established agencies involved in international adoptions have ``an altruistic, mission-driven sense that every child deserves a family,'' Ms.
Harder said.
``Now, with additional programs opening up in Russia and China in particular, folks are seeing it as an entrepreneurial venture''.
Adoption experts say international adoptions have generated lots of new businesses, from charitable, church-affiliated agencies to walkup offices run by people who make money change hands in Bulgaria.
Fees to foreign expediters, translators, lawyers and orphanages are usually beyond the control of the American-based agencies that make the placements.
Still, many prospective parents, not wanting the uncertainty of dealing with birth mothers, never even consider domestic adoption seriously.
Adoptions from foreign countries are expected to approach 15,000 this year.
Even so, the supply in foreign countries now exceeds the demand here.
Susan Soon-Keum Cox, director of public policy at Holt International Children's Services in Eugene, Ore.
, said the increase comes largely from Eastern Europe and China.
Russia, which had no program five years ago, placed more children last year than any other country, she said.
``As recently as five or ten years ago, there were many more parents waiting to adopt than there were children,'' said Ms.
Cox, whose agency has placed more than 100,000 children.
``Now that's entirely turned around.
We're searching for families''.
Barbara Irvin, state director of Family Adoption Consultants in Macedonia, Ohio, is uneasy about having more children than families waiting for placement.
``There are some real tensions now between the child focus and the consumer orientation, the human services model and the market forces,'' she said.
``Some families start looking for the cheapest, the fastest, the `we promise you a child that meets your quote-unquote specifications in so many months'.
Some of us who have been in the field for 20 years get worried about this shift.''
All over the country, people like Alison Doane are growing more nervous by the day.
Some have waited weeks, others months for the Russian child whose picture they gaze at incessantly, and who they have been promised will soon become their own.
Now, suddenly, adoption agencies are telling them that they can't be sure when they'll get their children.
``I would say that we, as a group, are scared,'' Doane, a musician from Malden, Mass.
, says.
``We're optimistic the adoptions will eventually go through...
but the uncertainty makes people agitated, and the ones in line the longest are up in arms''.
The anxiety among prospective parents -- and among adoption practitioners throughout the United States -- stems from a series of new laws in Russia that promise to radically alter adoption practices within that country and, as a result, possibly change the face of international adoption.
The impact of Russia's actions is potentially huge because it provides more children for adoption abroad than any other country, and the vast majority of those adoptees go to the United States.
Significantly, at a time when most children adopted abroad by white Americans are of a different race, Russia also is the largest foreign source of Caucasian children.
Russian's new laws were signed last week as decrees by President-elect Vladimir Putin, but they were barely reported by the world's media.
The statutes appear designed, in part, to show the incoming leader's nationalistic stripes, but they are principally intended to halt bribery, child-selling, and other illegal activities allegedly occurring during the course of placing Russian orphans in US adoptive homes.
In particular, bribes of thousands of dollars are regularly doled out to judges, orphanage officials and, most frequently and generously, to bilingual intermediaries who guide would-be parents through often-confusing bureaucratic and judicial systems.
Nearly all the intermediaries are Russian nationals who work simultaneously for several agencies, attorneys, and adoption facilitators in the United States -- making the operatives' loyalties suspect and their operations difficult to monitor.
And some officials in Washington and Moscow believe members of the Russian Mafia are involved in adoption procedures there.
Putin aims to clean up the process by imposing numerous reforms, effective immediately.
The most important are banning intermediaries; allowing only nonprofit, accredited adoption agencies with a minimum of five years' experience to function; ordering each agency to open its own office with separate, salaried employees; and mandating that all involved report on their activities and pay taxes on income received.
Currently, all of the estimated 160 to 180 US agencies conducting business in Russia employ intermediaries, and none are accredited because it has never been a requirement before.
So none can initiate new adoptions until specific operating guidelines are established, primarily by the Ministry of Education but with input from five additional government departments as well.
Adoptions already in the pipeline are being allowed to proceed, but at the discretion of individual judges in local jurisdictions around Russia.
It also is legal for prospective parents to navigate that nation's legal and governmental adoption bureaucracies without the assistance of an agency or intermediary, although generally with the help of a Russian lawyer.
``We tell applicants to stand by, because it's not possible to know how long all of this will take to resolve,'' said Filis Casey, executive director of the Alliance for Children in Wellesley, one of the largest adoption agencies in New England.
``We don't think Russian adoptions will stop, but when something like this happens, it sends shivers through the adoption community, because you can't know for sure what will happen''.
Like most of the adoption professionals interviewed thius week, Casey said she didn't expect the delays in Russia to last more than a few months.
But other practitioners predicted that, given Moscow's notoriously slow bureaucracies and some of the entrenched problems in the adoption system, it could take a year or more for the new procedures to be fully implemented.
All those involved said they were worried about the children who will remain longer in orphanages while the new laws are being put in place.
However much good the changes might eventually do, many of those facilities are badly run, lack funds, and are staffed by personnel who mistreat the boys and girls living within them; experts agree that the longer children remain in such institutions, the greater the emotional and developmental damage they incur.
Those interviewed, however, pointed out that every nation that allows its children to be adopted abroad has periodically revised its rules, especially during changes in government.
Most notably, that happened several times during the 1990s in China, which ranked at the top of ``sending'' adoption nations until Russia assumed that standing a few years ago.
According to the latest State Department tally, Americans adopted 4,348 children from Russia in 1999, compared to 4,101 from China.
The reforms instituted by Beijing over the years have made that country's adoption process perhaps the least-corrupt in the world; the third-highest source nation, South Korea (with 2,008 adoptees leaving last year), also runs operations that professionals believe is very clean.
So, if Russia is able to follow through on its promises, it would mean the lopsided majority of adoptions in the world will be done ethically and with a minimum of shady activity.
Almost 16,400 children from all nations, including some where such crimes as bribery, coercion, and baby theft are frequently reported, were adopted into the United States last year.
``It certainly has the potential to slow down the process, but we believe that will be temporary.
And in the long run we're hoping it's a beneficial change because it makes the process more credible and provides assurances to prospective parents about the people they're working with, as well as to the Russian federation,'' said Mike Walsh, a vice president for Lutheran Social Services of New England.
Jennifer Goodbody, head of the Russian adoption section of Spence-Chapin in New York -- one of the nation's largest adoption agencies -- said Putin's changes could have ripple effects.
As would-be parents look elsewhere, for instance, she said it is likely other nations will be swamped with applications that could also slow down their processes.
Maureen Hogan, president of Adopt America Advocates and studies adoption in Eastern Europe, said the Russian reforms also will have another certain effect: persuading other nations to follow suit.
Hogan, who returned from a fact-finding tour of Romania last week, said that country already is studing Moscow's actions and is likely to institute similar reforms soon.
``These countries are saying, `We know there's a pressing need to find homes for all these children,' '' said Hogan, a vocal proponent of squeezing financial corruption out of the adoption process.
``But they're not willing to sacrifice these kids on the alter of commercialism.''
MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin Saturday signed a revised adoption law that would tighten control over foreign adoptions and encourage more Russians to adopt children.
The amendments to Russia's adoption law were approved by the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, on June 5 and passed by the upper house, the Federation Council, on June 10.
The Kremlin press office said Yeltsin signed the amendments to the law to give the state more control over adoptions and ``to insure the rights and interests of children in adoptions''.
The original version of the law introduced in parliament earlier in the year said that Russia must sign agreements with other countries to codify adoption procedures by Sept.
1, 1999.
The amended version of the bill contained no time limit for the prospective international agreements to be signed, meaning pending adoptions will not be stalled by the measure.
The bill allows foreign adoption agencies to operate in Russia only after their country signs an agreement with Russia setting out the rules.
In the interim, prospective foreign parents can use the services of proxies as they do now.
According to parliamentary estimates, there are about 80 foreign adoption agencies, mostly American, currently operating in Russia, usually through Russian intermediaries. (jai)
Yvette Weilacker sits in the kitchen of a small house in Buffalo, N.Y., waiting for the contractions to begin.
Her baby, already named Nicholas Lee by his anxious parents, was due days ago, and he shows scant signs of being ready to be born.
The waiting is all the more tense because the kitchen she waits in is not hers, and the baby she waits for is in another woman's body.
Kim Elniskey and her fiance, Jorge Rosario, have chosen Mrs.
Weilacker and husband, Paul, to adopt their son and the two families have gotten to know each other well these past few months, by telephone, letter and now in person as the birth nears.
Since she flew in from her home in Riverside, Calif.
, four weeks earlier, Mrs.
Weilacker has been staying with Ms.
Elniskey and Rosario and helping care for their three other children.
``I want you to feel that this is your baby, your family,'' Ms.
Elniskey told Mrs.
Weilacker. Ms.
Elniskey has kept the Weilackers involved throughout her pregnancy, sharing ultrasound pictures and updates about the baby's intra-uterine acrobatics.
``Your son kicked me a lot today,'' Ms.
Elniskey reported in one of many telephone conversations.
The Weilackers have promised that they will be just as open as Nicholas grows: what he wears on his first Halloween, when he loses his first tooth and learns to read.
When the boy is ready, Ms.
Elniskey and Rosario plan to visit him.
The intimacy between these two families would have been rare just a few years ago and unthinkable a generation ago.
But such open contact between adoptive parents and biological parents is one of the many ways that adoption has evolved from a secretive, closed process weighed down by dark stigmas and painful misconceptions into an infinitely more transparent experience.
How many children are adopted each year is an elusive number, since no one keeps complete statistics.
The most recent data, from 1992, show 127,441 children adopted that year, a slight increase from 118,000 five years earlier.
About 42 percent of those adoptions were by stepparents and other relatives.
The most sought-after children for adoption are, as they have been for generations, domestic white infants _ known among parents and professionals in the adoption loop as DWI's _ but those babies are scarcer because of the easier availability of birth control, the legalization of abortion and the growing acceptance of single mothers raising children alone.
Experts estimate that there are fewer than 20,000 a year.
As a result, the biggest increase in adoptions has been children adopted from other countries.
Because they require visas, there are up-to-date statistics for these adoptions and since 1990, their numbers have nearly doubled, to 13,620 in 1997 from 7,093.
So while the overall increase in the number of children adopted has been subtle, the increase in visibility has been dramatic, enhanced by those children adopted from other countries whose physical differences from their parents make their adoption an obvious fact.
In the last decade, adoption has gone public in much the same manner that divorce did in the 1970s.
Increasingly children are told, even before they can fully understand, how they came to their families and that story is shared with relatives, friends, teachers, sometimes even strangers.
``My birth mother gave me this doll,'' Sasha Saidman, a 6-year-old who was adopted, told a clerk at the video store near her home in Wheaton, Md.
, as her family prepared for a visit from the woman who had borne her.
Like most adopted children, Sasha used the term that has replaced such loaded phrases as ``real mother'' and ``natural mother''.
Where once children hid their adoption from friends, if they even knew of it, adopted children today can belong to play groups made up entirely of adopted children.
They can buy storybooks about being adopted, go to summer camps for children adopted from particular foreign countries, and if they face emotional difficulties, get treated by a therapist who specializes in adoption.
In some cities, like New York, San Francisco and Boston, playgrounds are peppered with parents of various races and nationalities chasing children of other races.
Many of those families are headed by single people, people in their '40s or older and gay people, men and women who, in years past, would have been rejected as unsuitable adoptive parents.
Once the ``other'' option for becoming parents, adoption is now one of many ways that men and women create families.
The panorama of the American family now includes children born through advanced reproductive technology, some conceived with donated sperm and eggs; families broken apart by divorce then blended through remarriage; families created by single parents and by gay men who have hired a surrogate to bear a child.
``We are seeing an explosion of different family forms which make adoption seem downright mainstream and conservative,'' said Madelyn Freundlich, executive director of the Evan B.
Donaldson Adoption Institute, a research group in New York.
In the last few years, the media have focused on global dramas highlighting the plight of children needing homes: Chinese girls abandoned in markets by parents encumbered by the country's one-child policy and its preference for boys; Romanian children orphaned by revolution or left in understaffed institutions by their impoverished parents; Russian children stranded in dismal state orphanages, in a society that widely stigmatizes adoption.
In the 1990s, it became a kind of social phenomenon to adopt a child from abroad.
Last summer, Vanity Fair magazine quipped that a Chinese baby was the season's hot accessory in the Hamptons.
The experience, however, is not limited to wealthy neighborhoods.
Suburban American and rural towns are also home to children adopted from Shanghai, Murmansk, Guatemala City, Bucharest.
Many people turning to international adoption, and indeed adoption in general, are baby boomers who put off starting families, then confronted infertility problems and finally opted out of the world of assisted reproductive technology that many call the ``Ovarian Olympics''.
Further raising the profile are the celebrities who have spoken happily about being adoptive parents, including: Nicole Kidman and her husband, Tom Cruise; Rosie O'Donnell, and Jamie Lee Curtis, who wrote a popular children's book on the subject, ``Tell Me Again About the Night I Was Born''.
In bookstores, that book shares shelf space with an expanding selection of adoption-related titles from large publishers and from niche publishers like R-Squared Press in Ann Arbor, Mich.
, a small family-run business that focuses on adoption. nn
BURLINGTON, Vt.
_ Michael Stamatis spent his formative years being tormented in one of the world's cruelest institutions.
Then, two years ago, everything changed: He was removed from an orphanage in Romania, adopted by a couple in Vermont, and began to recover from the psychic wounds any child would incur if subjected to sustained emotional and sexual abuse.
But the 17-year-old boy's journey from nightmare to dream didn't last long.
The people who took Michael in have dissolved the adoption, relinquished their erstwhile son into state custody, and accused him of sexual assault _ a felony charge for which the state plans to prosecute him as an adult.
Michael's saga is about to spark an international incident.
Outraged Romanian Embassy officials in Washington already have drafted a letter to legal and social-service authorities in Vermont warning their treatment of Michael could determine the future of all adoptions by Americans from his country.
Moreover, some adoption specialists worry this case could have even wider repercussions, inducing more governments to reconsider their policies on placing children with US families.
``When other countries see Americans adopting their children, then dissolving the adoptions and prosecuting the children, they wonder whether to get involved with us at all,'' said Maureen Hogan, who as president of Adopt America has been working to improve conditions in Romanian orphanages.
Vermont officials say they understand that Michael went through hell in Romania, but insist that they are doing everything possible to help him.
``Our recommendations have to be based on the standard of `best interests of the child'. . . and not on international relations, on any effect on adoptions generally . . . or on any other political considerations,'' said William Young, the state's commissioner of Social and Rehabilitation Services.
Constantine, as Michael was named in his native country, spent his first 15 years at the Siret Neuropsychiatric Institution in the northeast corner of Romania.
The facility is widely known as one of the worst legacies of Nicholae Ceausescu,the longtime dictator who was deposed in late 1989.
As many as 200,000 boys and girls were institutionalized during Ceausescu's regime, the majority because their parents were too poor to care for them.
Most were abused and deprived of the affection or personal contact necessary to develop normally.
While the current Romanian government has markedly improved conditions, and has begun deinstitutionalization programs, its orphanages generally remain damaging places for children to grow up.
The one in Siret, where about 500 children now live, by all accounts is among the most horrific.
Before children from Siret are deemed ready for adoption by Americans, they undergo years of therapy and behavioral training by a team of US physicians and mental-health professionals who travel to Romania.
The team is led by Ron Federici, a Virginia psychiatrist who is an authority on institutionalization and has adopted four children from Siret himself.
In the case of Constantine and two Romania girls adopted with him, Federici also intensively screened the parental applicants to assess whether they could cope with the difficulties inherent in raising such challenging children.
He approved Lisa and Tim Stamatis of Burlington, who had received high marks for their rearing of five special-needs children they had already adopted.
For the first year, by all accounts, the three Romanian children made substantial progress and everyone seemed happy with the new family arrangement.
But then, for reasons that haven't been explained publicly, something changed dramatically.
Michael, the name the Stamatises gave their son, began to slip.
The boy had a less-than-normal intelligence level and spoke no English, so he'd always had a hard time communicating.
Now he was growing unresponsive to educational efforts and the sexual acting out that he had done initially _ a frequent behavior for sexually abused children who haven't learned other ways of making physical connections _ began to recur, according to a detective's report filed in the case.
At the same time, the Stamatises' willingness or ability to deal with their children's problems changed, too.
In the last several months, they have moved to legally dissolve their adoptions of Michael, one of his Romanian sisters, and a severely disabled child they had adopted years earlier.
The couple, whose lawyer did not respond to requests for interviews, also filed a complaint alleging Michael had inappropriately fondled the genitalia of both Romanian girls adopted with him.
Federici and others familiar with the case described the parents' decision to initiate criminal proceedings, rather than to seek treatment, as unusual.
They claim it might have been at least partly a financial move by the Stamatises, who would have been responsible for some child-support payments since they voluntarily relinquished their son into state custody.
When the minor involved is the object of criminal charges, such costs are absorbed by the state.
Michael is currently being treated at a facility in southern Vermont, and no court dates have been set for him.
Vermont officials declined to discuss why they decided to prosecute him as an adult as well as a juvenile.
Federici, Hogan, and the Romanian government insist the boy's language, cultural, and institutional problems are not being taken sufficiently into account.
``Imagine how lonely he feels, whatever they are trying to do for him; he doesn't speak the language and he knows nobody around him,'' said Federici, who is fluent in Romanian and has tried to become a party to the court cases involving Michael.
He has been rebuffed both by the judge and other state officials.
They have not said why they have excluded the psychiatrist's participation as an expert witness or as a therapist, though he has volunteered to play either role at his own expense.
Federici said he is so concerned about Michael's welfare he has offered take the boy and his adoptive sisters off of Vermont's hands altogether, again at his own expense.
He wants to find other homes for the girls and to place Michael in a specialized treatment facility in Baltimore, where there are other onetime Romanian orphans with whom Michael is friends and with whom he has seen during reunions arranged by Federici.
The press and science attache at the Romanian Embassy, Stefan Maier, has drafted a letter, which the ambassador is now reviewing, praising Federici's efforts and asking Vermont officials to reconsider the psychiatrist's participation.
This episode, writes Maier, could ``trigger a mechanism with the potential of bringing damage to international adoption by US citizens from Romania''.
Michael's prosecution, Maier added in a telephone interview, could hurt future adoptions from Romania.
``This way of dealing with this boy doesn't serve anyone,'' Maier said.
``Not the children who need families . . . or the Americans who want children.
This way, there are only losers.''
Bertha Holt, whose family's struggle to adopt Korean orphans in the 1950s led to a movement that found American homes for thousands of children from overseas, died on Monday at her home in Creswell, Ore.
, after a stroke on July 24.
She was 96.
Holt first attracted national attention when she and her husband, Harry, adopted eight abandoned children whose fathers were American soldiers.
In 1954, Holt, a nurse, and her husband, who was a farmer and a lumberjack, went to a high school auditorium in Eugene, Ore.
, to watch a film about Amerasian children in Korean orphanages.
``We had never heard of such poverty and despair,'' Holt later wrote in ``The Seed from the East,'' one of her four books on adoption.
``We had never seen such emaciated arms and legs, such bloated starvation-stomachs and such wistful little faces searching for someone to care''.
At first, the Holts sent money to Korean orphanages, but soon decided that the children needed families.
They were both about 50 years old, and had already reared six biological children.
Each wanted to adopt eight Korean children, Holt later recalled, but each was afraid it would be difficult to persuade the other to take so many.
At the time, federal law prevented any family from adopting more than two foreign-born children.
But in 1955, Congress passed the Bill for Relief of Certain War Orphans, specifically to allow the Holts to adopt four boys and four girls, ranging in age from infancy to 3 1/2.
Adoption laws were eventually changed to make the process easier.
At the Holt house, soon there were children lined up to get a daily dose of vitamins, and the washing machine ran day and night.
Harry Holt returned to Korea for more children, while Holt found families in the United States willing to take them.
In 1956, the Holts founded the agency that would become Holt International Children's Services.
At the time, there was no system in place for international adoptions.
The Korean-American children were the first such large group to be adopted.
The Holts, who were Baptist, believed, with missionary fervor, that the world's orphans were the responsibility of American families.
Holt International now handles about 1,000 international adoptions each year from 12 countries.
In all, 16,000 foreign-born children were adopted in the United States last year.
Until days before her death, Grandma Holt, as she came to be known, was active in the agency.
One of her daughters, Molly Holt, works for the Holt agency in Korea.
Holt is also survived by nine other children, Barbara Chambers, Suzanne Peterson, Linda Pack, Robert Holt, Mary Last, Christine Russell, Helen Stampe, Paul Holt and Betty Blankenship; three sisters, Beulah Stronczek, Katherine Stanger and Grace Fisher; a brother, William L.
Holt; 19 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.
Though the poverty they had seen in the Korean film footage shocked them, the Holts had seen hard times themselves.
Bertha Marian Holt was born on Feb.
5, 1904, in Des Moines.
Her father was a schoolteacher and a mail carrier.
She received a degree in nursing in 1926, and the next year married a cousin, Harry Holt.
The couple moved to South Dakota, where they became ``custom farmers,'' working land owned by others until they had saved enough to buy their own.
In the face of drought and poor farming conditions, Harry Holt also milled flour and mined lignite coal.
But during the Depression, the Holts left their farm for taxes owed and moved to the Willamette Valley in Oregon.
There the Holts prospered, eventually owning a lumber mill, but in 1950 Harry Holt suffered a heart attack.
The Holts turned to prayer, asking God to give them a mission and allow Holt more time to live.
The orphans, they believed, were that mission.
While in Korea in 1964, Harry Holt suffered another heart attack and died.
Many thought the agency would close, but his wife took over, traveling endlessly.
Holt also worked to improve conditions at the Il San Center in Korea, built by the Holts as an orphanage and now home to 300 disabled children, and she lobbied other countries to set up adoption programs.
``She would say, `You know, I'm just a grandma, but here's what I think,''' said Susan Soon-Keum Cox, who was adopted through the Holt agency and now works there as a vice president.
In 1966, President Johnson named Holt the National Mother of the Year, and in 1995, she became the only non-Korean to receive the Korea National Merit Award.
But, Cox said, Holt liked to say that she preferred the photographs that children sent from all over the world.
``She championed the idea that love and a safe, permanent home could transcend differences of nationality, race and ethnic background,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement after Holt's death.
In letters to agency employees, adopted children and adoptive families, Holt spoke frequently of the Lord and quoted the Bible, which she said she had read 40 times.
Those who knew her said she seemed to have enormous energy.
In 1996, she set the world record for the 400 meter race in the over-90 age group at the Hayward Classic in Eugene.
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A number of U.S. adoptive parents and groups involving in adopting children from China refuted reports in the Western media about the so-called abuse of children in Chinese orphanages.
In their letters faxed to the Chinese ambassador to the U.S., they said the recent news and TV coverage about Chinese orphanages is unbelievable.
They also commended China for their efforts to improve the welfare of its orphans.
Donna Taylor and Belinda Durham at Catholic Charities said in their fax that "we have been very upset by the recent news and TV coverage about Chinese orphanages".
"One person's report, who happened to be a Chinese doctor, who was denied a US visa, cannot be reasonable enough to believe," they said.
"This of course does not reflect our feelings of the Chinese, the experiences of all of my families who have wonderful daughters from China, and those who are planning trips in the near future".
Sharon R.
Grasflin said she and her husband have filed an adoption petition with the People's Republic of China in hopes of adopting a precious little girl.
She said her adoption agency, China's Children, allowed her and her husband to look through a notebook in the past month, "full of beautiful, smiling, happy and well cared for Chinese children who are waiting to be adopted".
"Those children were from many different orphanages throughout China.
I believe that the faces of these adorable Chinese children provide a true testimony about the care and love that they receive while waiting to be adopted," she said in her fax to the Chinese Ambassador.
Cudy Herdson at Tennessee office of China's Children under the Children's Hope International, said that "we...
are very concerned over the recent media publicity about Chinese orphanages.
We just wanted to briefly relay our concern and outrage at the US media for covering such a story".
"We have many families who have adopted from China, and they always have very wonderful remarks about the Chinese and their experience in China ...
not to mention that the joy of their lives -- a child has come from your land."
A landmark treaty on international adoptions appeared headed for enactment by the United States, with House passage Tuesday of legislation to implement the pact and an announcement that the Senate's lone holdout now supports ratification.
The treaty, called the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoptions, is considered by adoption professionals and politicians active on the issue to be the most ambitious effort ever attempted to reform adoption, streamline the process, and weed out corruption worldwide.
``I honestly believe the enactment of this treaty will, to a large degree, eliminate the abuses that currently exist,'' said US Rep.
William D.
Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat, who was instrumental in winning passage of the House measure.
``The lack of ratification was going to have disastrous consequences for all Americans who are interested in international adoptions''.
Among its major provisions, the treaty would: establish the first global standards intended to protect children from being sold and improve procedures for finding them homes; prevent coercion of birth parents by unscrupulous practitioners who want their children; and set guidelines to cut red tape and otherwise steamline the process for adoptive parents.
Sources on Capitol Hill and within the US adoption community predicted enactment of the implementing legislation and of the treaty itself could be completed before Congress adjourns for its August recess.
US ratification was delayed partly because the process is lengthy, but also because some American politicians wanted to amend the agreement in ways that were so controversial that they stalled its consideration.
In recent months, as a carefully crafted compromise draft of the implementing legislation appeared close to passage, one lawmaker in the Senate and one in the House threatened to use parliamentary maneuvers to prevent the treaty's ratification if their concerns weren't addressed.
Representative Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey, had wanted the implementing legislation to preclude adoptions by homosexuals, unmarried Americans, and others with ``promiscuous lifestyles''.
Senator Sam Brownback, a Republican from Kansas, said he feared the proposed rules would increase costs for adoptive parents and impose cumbersome standards that would drive small practitioners out of business.
Smith finally gave his okay to the House measure after it some changes that appear to give him some of what he wanted.
The implementing language requires each ratifying country to establish a ``central authority'' to deal with international adoptions.
The revision obtained by Smith dictates that the US central authority will notify American practitioners of the criteria set by other countries for prospective adoptive parents.
Because China and some other nations are averse to adoption of their children by gay and single adults, many would-be parents could be excluded.
But there's a loophole: The ``sending'' country would have to formally notify the US central authority of any restrictions _ which may not happen because it's in the interest of those countries to find families for thousands of orphaned and homeless children.
Similarly subtle concessions appear to have been made to win over Brownback.
Asked during a telephone interview whether the senator was now ready to support passage of the Hague Convention, his spokesman, Erik Hotmire, replied: ``He now supports the legislation.
... The deal is done''.
One ``improvement'' cited by Hotmire is that individual states, in addition to the federal government, will be able to establish entities like central authorities that could set guidelines and accredit adoption practitioners.
Many if not most states, however, would probably leave such undertakings to the State Department _ which currently has jurisdiction over international adoptions and would be the home of America's central authority.
The other revision obtained by Brownback, who with his wife adopted a daughter from China last December, was to insert language giving extra time for small and medium agencies to meet the treaty's standards and gain accreditation.
This was not a major sticking point for any of the pact's negotiators.
The final product, said William Pierce, the former president of the National Council for Adoption and the organization's consultant on the Hague Convention, ``clearly shows a lot of subtle, nuanced negotiations between people like Mr.
Smith and Mr.
Delahunt''. He added: ``It is a win for everyone''.
The most important immediate result, according to nearly everyone interviewed, is that nations with concerns about American adoption practices _ most pointedly Russia and Romania, which have recently halted the adoption of their children _ will be reassured about the US commitment to reform.
The Hague Convention, named for the Netherlands capital where it was drafted, was completed in May 1993.
Since then, 40 nations have enacted it.
The United States is by far the largest ``receiving'' nation of international adoptees.
Last year, 16,396 adoptees came to this country from abroad, more than double the number of just a decade earlier.
BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese couples will find it easier and foreigners perhaps more difficult to adopt children under a revised adoption law approved by China's legislature Wednesday, state media reported.
The changes are designed to alleviate overcrowding in cash-strapped state orphanages and find more orphans homes.
Abandonment, especially of baby girls, has soared under strict family planning controls that limit most Chinese couples to having one child.
Passed by the standing committee of the National People's Congress, the revised law reduces the age of prospective Chinese parents from 35 to 30 years, drops a restriction that couples be childless and allows for multiple adoptions, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
The restrictions were originally intended to make sure Chinese families did not orchestrate adoptions to circumvent the one-child limit.
Tight laws at home and a rise in abandonment also helped turn China into a popular place for Westerners, especially Americans, looking to adopt.
Fearing further international condemnation of its much criticized family planning policies, the Chinese government has never said how many children are in state care.
Foreigners adopted 4,191 Chinese children in the 12 months ending in September.
Xinhua reported that the revised law requires prospective adoptive parents from abroad to provide extensive information on their background _ all notarized by authorities in their home countries.
Foreigners will also have to sign agreements with the person or institution offering the adoption and register it with the Chinese government, Xinhua said.
The report did not indicate how the changes for foreigners differ from current procedures.
The new law also sets out fines and other punishments for people who abandon or sell children, Xinhua said, without elaborating.
CHESTER, Vt.
_ Rocking her granddaughter to sleep, Jayne Gallagher could hear the raspy, televised voice of Vermont's governor above the infant's soft breathing: ``Vermont has long been known as the least diverse state in the nation.
That is rapidly changing''.
Governor Howard Dean's words last year, part of a plea for enlightened attitudes after several race-related incidents, must have stirred something in Gallagher, who is white, because soon she was overseeing an unusual merger of two very different worlds _ one white and rural, the other African and war-torn.
From the small town of Chester, where residents can drive along country roads all their lives without encountering a black person, Gallagher started the Ethiopian Adoption Project.
Dozens of families from across the whitest state in the nation have agreed to adopt 60 children orphaned by Ethiopia's war with neighboring Eritrea.
Gallagher expects the first group of children to begin arriving in Vermont by December.
``I thought: What a loving way to diversify Vermont,'' Gallagher said.
Her mission of mercy, though, has rekindled an emotional debate over whether children are hurt when they are adopted across racial and cultural lines.
To Gallagher, it matters only that the children, who have seen their parents die in what is being dubbed as the world's bloodiest war, have a home and love.
But Rudolph Smith, president of the Association of Black Social Workers, fears that Ethiopians being brought to live in a culture as white as Vermont will be stripped of their self-identity.
``Ethiopia is an African culture with black Africans, and Vermont is a lily, lily white state,'' he said.
``You are going to have a whole bunch of black children running around who don't know who they are''.
Vermont's black population of an estimated 3,102 in 1997, which has never tipped over 1 percent, could easily fit in Boston University's Walter Brown Arena with room to spare.
But as the state experiences a small but noticeable increase of black and Asian residents within the past decade, it has also begun to grapple with race-related issues.
``It won't be easy,'' said Joe Kroll, whose adopted Korean daughter Mei Lin, now 22, gives speeches on how hard it was to grow up in a white world and retain her self-identity.
Kroll, executive director of the North American Council of Adoptable Children, based in St.
Paul, said Vermont parents will struggle with protecting their children and teaching them to embrace their own culture.
``The sign of a successful interracial placement is if the child has a strong and healthy self-esteem and identity toward their own culture or race,'' he said.
Despite skepticism, even from adoption agencies that warned that white families do not normally adopt African children, Gallagher received dozens of responses within days of placing ads in the newspaper.
Charlene Chatot was one of those callers.
For three years, Chatot and her husband, Paul, a nurse, have wanted to adopt a child, but finances have prevented them from doing so.
But shortly after Chatot, 40, the mother of two teenagers, read in the newspaper about Gallagher's efforts and the low cost of the adoption, she accompanied Gallagher on a plane to Ethiopia.
``We felt it was the right thing to do,'' said Chatot of her plans to adopt a 4-year-old Ethiopian boy.
Although Chatot, Gallagher, and school officials say they do not see the color of a person's skin, Smith and even multiracial adoption proponents say it is because they never had to: Most of the schools in Chester have few if any minority children.
``Vermont is not Utopia.
There is a resistance and the lack of acknowledgment that it could be racist,'' said one white mother whose adopted daughter is black.
The woman, who asked not to be identified for fear of her daughter being taunted more, said the child has had problems in the school district.
She said the family is considering moving from Windsor County to a more diversified area.
Black and Asian students have always stood out in Vermont.
Nearly 15 years ago, when 18 black basketball players from Boston got off a bus at Green Mountain Union High School in Chester, it sent dozens of white children to the school window in awe, said Jim Collins, one of the school's administrators.
Gallagher said her goal is to find adoptive families in Ethiopia for the 20,000 orphans.
Meanwhile, communities such as Chester, Norwich, Brattleboro, and White River Junction, as well as some New Hampshire towns, are working to bring a piece of Ethiopia to northern New England.
International festivals are being planned, a local therapist has volunteered to counsel the families, and local Ethiopians have agreed to make frequent visits to provide lessons on the African culture, such as how to cook injera, an Ethiopian staple that resembles a spongy bread.
So far, 23 of nearly 60 Vermont families _ professionals, working-class, and single parents _ have completed a state and immigration process to adopt 29 children.
Gallagher, who has used her own money to set up the program and for travel, has a local adoption agency called Adoption Advocates Inc.
as the international license holder.
She is awaiting a license from The Children and Youth Administration in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
According to an Ethiopian government spokesman, Ethiopians prefer that their children remain within their own culture.
``But I think we have to look at it from the interest of the babies.
In Ethiopia we have one policy: Adoptions are done for children that do not have any choices,'' said Tsegay Wolde-Georgis of the Ethiopian Embassy in Washington.
``The option between being adopted by a loving family, whoever he is, and being a street child is a very easy answer''.
But Kevin Christie, the only black school administrator in Vermont and a resident of White River Junction, said racism can be subtle and the old ways of thinking can be hard to shake.
``It will probably be difficult for them,'' he said.
But Collins, the administrator who may soon have two Ethiopians at the high school, which has only one black student registered this fall, thinks it will help open the minds of the isolated rural students who often hold stereotypes of people different from them.
When Chatot, who works for a pregnancy program, traveled to Ethiopia, she said the only difference she saw between Vermont and Ethiopia was the extreme poverty.
The children, who are living in an orphanage in Tigre, have survived bombings but have watched their parents become victims of the war.
To remind herself of their plight, Gallagher brought the tattered clothing of some of the orphans who struggle daily to keep warm and fed.
In Vermont, where many families make their living from farming, the next day's meal can be as close as the backyard chicken coop.
``In my opinion, a fat child would be more discriminated against than a person of a different race,'' said Gallagher, who will take in two teenage boys.
While that statement might seem naive in a country seemingly obsessed with race, state officials such as Kathy Huit of the governor's office said the comment embraces the accepting spirit that has long been part of Vermont's history, the first state to ban slavery in its constitution.
``Vermont has prided itself on its history of tolerance,'' she said.
``And the governor is making sure we look at the issue of diversity.
He's made it his commitment''.
``I think Vermont can be accepting, but there is still that element of ignorance,'' Christie said.
The adoptive parents ``will need support''.
Recently he had several students prosecuted at Randolph Area Vocation Center, where he is the administrator, for spray-painting racial epithets on the walls.
Christie, whose wife is white, has 26 years of living in Vermont to teach him how to survive in an all-white environment.
He picks his battles, and matter-of-factly drives three hours to his native Hartford, Conn.
, to buy black hair-care products.
Those skills were passed along to his daughter, and he hopes Vermonters will pass them to the new immigrants.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation needed to implement an international treaty on foreign adoptions passed the House on Tuesday after months of gridlock over whether it would allow gay adoptions.
The treaty, known as the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, was created to establish guidelines for international adoptions and include provisions to end smuggling and fraud.
The bill the House passed would give various federal agencies the authority to implement the treaty once it is ratified by two-thirds of the Senate.
The United States signed the measure in 1994.
Senate aides say lawmakers there may take up the measure soon and even ratify it before Congress leaves for its August recess.
''We hope this Intercountry Adoption Act will not only demonstrate America's commitment to the child...
but will enable those adoptions to go more smoothly and more rapidly,'' said Rep.
Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.
The measure had hit a snag in recent months as lawmakers debated whether it would allow gay adoptions.
Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J.
, successfully lobbied for a provision that requires the United States to adhere to the laws of countries that may have marriage requirements or guidelines dealing with sexual orientation.
Several countries, such as China, Romania and Bulgaria, prohibit gay adoptions.
Supporters have said international guidelines on adoptions are needed to ease and streamline the adoption process as well as prevent abuses like trafficking, misrepresentation of a child's medical condition and fraud.
''Documented abuses range from the charging of exorbitant fees by so-called 'facilitators' in some countries to child kidnapping,'' said Rep.
William Delahunt, D-Mass.
and the father of a daughter who came to the United States from Vietnam in the early 1970s, before the fall of Saigon.
''This bill will help ensure that adoptions are safe, that they are in the best interest of the child, the birth parent and the adoptive parent,'' said Rep.
Dave Camp, R-Mich.
More than 15,000 international adoptions are expected to take place this year.
The majority of children adopted in the United States will come from China, official said.
In addition to giving authority to various federal agencies to implement the treaty, the House measure also includes guidelines for federal authorities to begin accrediting adoption agencies that work internationally.
------ On the Net: http://thomas.loc.gov The bill is H.R. 2909
Two lawmakers in Washington, rejecting the advice of adoption professionals across the ideological spectrum, threaten to prevent US approval of a landmark international treaty intended to improve the treatment of children, streamline adoption practices worldwide, and curtail corruption in the process.
Leaders of the American adoption community and sources on Capitol Hill said the two Republicans _ Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas and Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey _ are the sole roadblocks to passage of legislation implementing the treaty, called the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption.
It has already been approved by 40 other countries.
Brownback last week used a maneuver called a ``hold'' to stall consideration of the measure.
He said his opposition to the implementing legislation stems largely from the advice of Laura Cecere, the operator of a Cambridge, Mass.
adoption service who helped him adopt a daughter from China last December.
Brownback maintained in an interview that the bill would raise adoption costs and impose standards that could drive small firms like Cecere's out of business.
Smith did not respond to requests for an interview.
But, according to people in and out of Washington who have helped to draft the implementing legislation, he is holding out mainly because he wants to include language precluding homosexuals and other Americans with ``promiscuous lifestyles'' from adopting.
The Hague Convention is being debated as the number of international adoptions by Americans, as well as interest in adoption generally, have soared to an all-time high.
Last year, 16,396 adoptees came to this country from abroad, more than double the number of just 10 years earlier.
``It's an amazing time for the institution,'' said Madelyn Freundlich, executive director of the Evan B.
Donaldson Adoption Institute in New York.
``I think that's one reason the time is right for this treaty now and why it's so very important''.
Even if Brownback's ``hold'' were lifted, both he and Smith have indicated a willingness to impede passage of the legislation as currently written by introducing potentially fractious amendments and using other parliamentary maneuvers that could tie up the House and Senate at a time when most members are anxious to complete their business as quickly as possible so they can go home to campaign.
``The leadership doesn't want a protracted, potentially divisive floor fight, so a single, determined congressman can block the entire bill,'' said Fred Greenman, the legal adviser to the American Adoption Congress.
The fight over bringing the bill to the floor of Congress _ it has already been approved by pertinent committees in both houses _ is most striking because the measure enjoys the backing of an unusually wide array of ideological factions on Capitol Hill and in the adoption world.
After months of delicate negotiations, the end product won the support of politicians ranging from Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who is its primary sponsor, to Representative William D.
Delahunt, a liberal Massachusetts Democrat who has been instrumental in putting together the broad congressional coalition.
At the same time, the measure is backed by the US umbrella organizations for international adoption agencies and adoption attorneys, as well as by disparate national groups representing adoptees, adoptive parents, and birth parents.
Some of these activists, like the American Adoption Congress and the National Council for Adoption, vehemently disagree on nearly every other topic relating to adoption practices but have decided to put aside their lingering differences about some of the treaty's details because they view its overall purpose as so important.
``This is a historic document that will protect needy kids and increase the chances for them to be adopted.
Not passing it would be a major embarrassment for the United States and an enormous human-rights setback for the children,'' said Maureen Hogan, president of Adopt America Advocates, which finds homes for special-needs children nationwide.
The Hague Convention was completed in May 1993.
Since then, 29 nations have ratified the treaty and 11 others have accepted it by a process called accession.
The United States is among 11 original signatories to the pact that have not ratified it.
In this country, only the Senate can approve a treaty, but both chambers must approve legislation spelling out how it will be implemented.
The fight in Congress is over that legislation.
The treaty would require firms operating abroad to radically alter some of their practices, which currently receive little regulation or monitoring and which have always been the nearly exclusive purview of state governments.
The pact calls for each member nation to create a ``central authority'' _ meaning a significant federal role _ to deal with issues that include breaking down procedural and legal barriers among participants, preventing practitioners from exploiting birth parents or making improper financial gains, and upgrading the conditions and protecting the rights of institutionalized children.
Assuming they adhered to the letter of the treaty, participants would be obliged to toughen some of their laws and regulations.
Perhaps most significantly, the central authorities would have to certify agencies that want to operate in other Hague treaty nations, and would be required to set rigorous standards by which those agencies would be legally bound to abide.
By all accounts, the treaty's implementation would lead to unprecedented changes for agencies, lawyers, and facilitators who now function with minimal and often-haphazard rules, particularly abroad.
Adoption-reform organizations say this climate invites illegalities and dubious practices, ranging from bribery and coercion of birth parents to obtain their babies, to the establishment of adoption businesses by people who have little or no experience but want to cash in on the thousands of American individuals and couples who each pay tens of thousands of dollars for overseas adoptions annually.
``I think once the United States passes this, it will make a real difference,'' said Delahunt.
While he and other proponents emphasized that they did not expect extensive improvements overnight, they asserted that the treaty is an essential step toward cleaning up existing abuses, enhancing adoption's image, and leading more Americans to adopt as a result.
Delahunt said that partly because this country takes in about 80 percent of the world's adoptees, US ratification also would serve as a global model and would apply pressure even on nations not under the treaty to raise their standards and improve their treatment of children.
People on all sides of the congressional debate stressed they agreed with the goals Delahunt outlined and said they believed reforms of the type envisioned in the Hague Convention will go a long way toward achieving them.
Sources familiar with Smith's views said he feels strongly about promoting ``family values'' at the same time, however, and Brownback insisted he only wants to ensure that the implementing legislation doesn't cause harm even as it attempts to do good.
``I'm hopeful we can get this through,'' the senator said from his home in Kansas Friday, ``but I have a fundamental concern that, without some fixing, this could actually reduce the number of international adoptions rather than grow it''.
Brownback said that could happen largely because an American central authority would add a layer of bureaucracy to the current international adoption process.
The resulting procedures and regulations for agencies, he said, would increase costs that could drive some prospective parents out of the market.
He added that small agencies, in particular, would find it administratively difficult and expensive to adhere to rule-changes, and therefore could be forced out of business.
The implementing legislation, in response to concerns from Cecere, does give small firms such as hers an additional two years to comply with any new mandates, but Brownback said that would not be sufficient.
Brownback said he favors making the central authority in this country a body that would maintain a registry of adoption practitioners, but would not certify them or establish rules.
It's unclear whether that would comply with the treaty itself.
Harvey L.
Cripps and Toshie T.
Cripps said "it is grossly unfair to suggest China has a policy of letting children die in the orphanages based on one person's dated and uncorroborated report on one orphanage".
"The mass media or one organization does not represent the American people, either.
We feel the reports or TV's news make an unfair impression," they said.
John and Elaine Carrillo from Arizona, who are in the last stage of our adoption process, voiced their similar viewpoints.
Ken and Brenda Barker, who have adopted a child in 1992 from Changsha City in central China's Hunan Province, said "our experience was very different than that of the recent newspaper articles, and we visited the orphanage as well".
"Our daughter, Joy, is the greatest gift that we could have ever asked for.
Everyone who meets here absolutely adores her.
She is full of 'joy'," they said.
"We would love to adopt again, it was such a wonderful experience.
We also loved the people, culture, and land of China," they added.
A statement issued by the Families with Children From China (FCC), a national support group for adoptive families of Chinese children, said the Chinese orphanages operate with very limited resources, and conditions in the institutions often are Spartan at best, as they are in many other sections of the Chinese economy.
"It should be noted, however, that over the last four-five years the Chinese government has developed a very successful international adoption program, allowing about 5,000 children to be adopted abroad," it added.
"It has been the observation of almost all of the thousands of adopting parents that have visited dozens of different orphanages that the care provided for their children was as good as possible, given resource constraints".
"The orphanage staffs are faced with the daily challenge of providing care to growing numbers of children with limited basic resources, such as formula, clothing and medical supplies," the statement said.
The statement went on to say that "in general, we commend the Chinese government for their efforts to improve the outcome of institutionalization for a growing number of children through their program of foreign adoption."
OTTAWA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Children's Bridge, an international adoption agency in Canada said in a memorandum that Chinese orphanages including the disabled children are "well fed and well cared for".
The memorandum dated January 12 and available here today forms a sharp contrast with the allegations of abuse and deliberate neglect resulting in death in Chinese orphanages as reported in the British documentary, "The Dying Room" and recent reports from the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch.
It said the Children's Bridge has been actively involved in adoptions of Chinese children since 1991.
"In the course of those adoptions, approximately 200 persons involved with the Children's Bridge have visited 18 orphanages in Central China.
Several of our parents have been health care professionals," it said.
The memorandum said "our parents have freely taken between 50 and 60 hours of videotape and hundreds of photographs.
In the course of their visits, they have had little or no restraints in terms of their tours through the orphanages".
"In our involvement with these Chinese orphanages not one of our parents has reported or filmed any evidence of mistreatment of any of the children at any time," it said.
The memorandum said "over the course of these visits, we have encountered many disabled children who appear clean, well fed and well cared for".
The Children's Bridge has become increasingly concerned with the allegations reported by the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Human Rights Watch, the memorandum said.
"It is essential that our hundreds of positive contacts with Chinese orphanages be balanced against the two reports".
It said "our interactions with the doctors, directors, nurses and nannies associated directly with the orphanages and with the officials of the China welfare ministry have, without exception, been very positive and characterized by their genuine concern with the well being and welfare of the children in their charge."
GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemala's attorney general said Thursday that he wants to suspend all adoptions by foreigners after complaints that unscrupulous lawyers were taking advantage of poor women.
Attorney General Carlos Garcia Regas urged the public magistrate and the Supreme Court to suspend foreign adoptions of Guatemalan children while new regulations are drafted to better regulated the process.
Human rights groups have denounced what they say is the widespread practice of lawyers coercing women into giving up their babies so they can collect a high adoption fee, usually about dlrs 15,000.
Ricardo Alvarado, president of the Guatemalan Lawyers Association, said his group doesn't oppose the suspension of foreign adoptions, adding that only a small group of bad lawyers are to blame for the abuses.
In a nation of 10 million people, the attorney general's office reviews between 170 and 200 adoption cases a month, almost all involving foreigners.
This year, the U.S.
Embassy expects 1,000 children to be adopted by U.S. citizens alone.
OTTAWA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today announced the ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.
The convention, which was finalized on May 29, 1993, and came into force on May 1, 1995, seeks to establish safeguards so that international adoptions are carried out in the best interests of the children.
It is estimated that there are approximately 20,000 intercountry adoptions around the world every year, of which 2,000 involve Canadians.
"The convention is an essential tool, as it sets out an agreement to cooperate at the international level in order to harmonize the practices of different countries.
This cooperation will help promote the rights of children in the world," said Canadian Secretary of State Christine Stewart, who made the announcement today.
In Canada, adoption falls within the jurisdiction of the provinces and territories, which must pass legislation to apply the convention.
To date, five provinces have passed implementing legislation.
They are British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan.
The convention will come into force in these provinces on April 1, 1997.
The ratification of the convention has also made it necessary to amend the federal immigration regulations.
The amendments should come into force on April 1, 1997, Stewart said.
Sixty-six states participated in the drafting of the convention, which has been already ratified by 13 countries, including Canada.
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- After months at a Bogota adoption center at the center of a bizarre custody battle, a pair of 8-month-old twins will be returned to their Indian tribe after its elders promised not to hurt the children.
Customarily, the U'wa tribe abandons newborn twins in the forest or tosses them into rivers, believing they are ill-equipped for life and bring bad luck.
Juan and Keila Aguablanca were spared that fate when their parents left them in a public health clinic three days after their Feb.
11 birth.
Their case drew attention to customs many Colombians consider barbaric and put the U'wa once again in the public spotlight.
The combative 8,000-member tribe threatened mass suicide in 1997 in a successful protest to stop oil drilling on their lands and has become a cause celebre among many U.S. environmentalists and indigenous rights groups.
Stung by the negative publicity in the Aguablanca twin case, the group decided to fight the adoption process and demand the children's return.
The director of Colombia's Institute for Family Welfare, Juan Manuel Urrutia, said Thursday that the government had decided to return the twins to the U'wa after the tribe ``agreed to place the rights of these two children above their cultural beliefs''.
He said the babies would be returned within 10 days.
The U'wa's legal adviser, Ebaristo Tegria, said the tribe's leaders had met and agreed to make an exception to the people's tradition.
``Most important now is that the youngsters return to the community,'' Tegria said in a telephone interview from Cubara, a town 200 miles northeast of Bogota just outside the U'wa reservation.
Tribal spokesman Jose Cobaria said Juan and Keila's parents had been isolated from the rest of the community so they could be cleansed of impurities linked to the birth.
For four years, he said, they could not visit other houses or share food with neighbors.
Tribal leaders said the children would be returned to their parents.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation needed to implement an international treaty on foreign adoptions unanimously passed the Senate on Thursday.
The treaty, known as the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, was created to establish guidelines for international adoptions and include provisions to end smuggling and fraud.
The bill would give various federal agencies the authority to implement the treaty once it is ratified by two-thirds of the Senate.
The United States signed the measure in 1994.
Senate aides say lawmakers expect the House to ''move swiftly'' in final passage of the implementing language.
Once that is completed, the Senate will consider ratification of the treaty, although lawmakers have given no indication when that may happen.
Supporters have said international guidelines on adoptions are needed to ease and streamline the adoption process as well as prevent abuses like trafficking, misrepresentation of a child's medical condition and fraud.
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the legislation ''is intended to bring some accountability into agencies that provide intercountry adoption services in the United States''.
The American Academy of Adoption Attorneys released a statement saying the measure ''holds tremendous potential to correct some significantly flawed international adoption practices''.
In addition to giving authority to various federal agencies to implement the treaty, the measure also includes guidelines for federal authorities to begin accrediting adoption agencies that work internationally.

PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Cambodian politicians aren't the only ones rushing around before elections Sunday.
Foreign couples, especially Americans, are scrambling to adopt children in case a new government tightens adoption rules.
``We went from the airport to the orphanage to the embassy.
I never even got a chance to shave,'' said Joe Balcerak, of Rochester, New York.
He arrived in Phnom Penh on Wednesday, picked up an 18-month-old girl he named Jana Lynn, and they left the country Friday.
At least 22 American families came to adopt babies in the past week, many with less than four days' notice.
Some Europeans also are adopting, but Americans seem to be the most active.
The last couples left town Friday with their new children.
After waiting months, sometimes years, to adopt children, couples were told that if they could collect the children before the elections, there would be no wait.
Many had never considered adopting a Cambodian child before last week.
Giddy parents congregated at the Sunway Hotel with their new Cambodian children, rocking them in soft new baby blankets and dressing them in fuzzy outfits.
``We cleaned out (a nearby orphanage) pretty well,'' Balcerak said.
``There are maybe only a half dozen left''.
Civil war during the 1980s left Cambodia with a surfeit of orphans and an economy too shattered to care for them.
Orphanages would have perhaps one wet-nurse for eight babies _ meaning most starved.
Cambodia first opened its doors to international adoptions in 1989, and they skyrocketed after a U.N. peacekeeping mission arrived in 1991.
But the country halted foreign adoptions in 1992 for fear that the adoptions could not adequately be monitored.
Adoptions began to resume slowly in 1993, under strict government control.
Fewer orphans have lost both parents because of war; instead, many come from families that cannot afford them.
The doors to foreign adoptions have swung wide open amid the political turmoil that followed a bloody coup last year when strongman Hun Sen deposed his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
The Ministry of Social Action and Veterans Affairs decided that if prospective parents could prove that they met the adoption requirements of their host countries, Cambodia would quickly approve the requests.
A U.S.-based agency, Maine Adoption Placement, which has been active in matching American couples with orphans, pushed to have a batch of adoptions arranged before July 25.
``I think they are afraid that the adoption policy might change'' with Sunday's elections, said Sandy Nickels, the proud new mother of a two-month-old baby girl, Grace Vandy.
Most families said they paid between dlrs 10,000 and dlrs 15,000, about a third of which goes to pay ``processing fees'' to the Cambodian government.
Critics suspect the children are being rushed out of Cambodia by greedy officials who want to line their own pockets in case the elections put their jobs in jeopardy.
The new parents appeared dazed by the whirlwind of events.
``We had 48 hours to throw together two months of paperwork,'' said Michael Shantzis of San Francisco, the new father of an 18-month-old girl named Theany.
Theany spent her last few hours in Cambodia sleeping on a bench in the hotel's restaurant.
Theany's mother, abandoned by her husband, was forced to give her up because she could not afford to raise her, the new parents said.
They hope to find some way to give money to the family.
WASHINGTON _ Their names are McGowan and Smith, Isaacs and Svendsen.
They are Christian and Jewish, conservative and liberal.
They were raised in Boston or Texas or Los Angeles.
This weekend, for the first time in history, they gathered to celebrate their physical similarities, their common heritage, and their shared personal experiences.
More than 400 of them, all born in South Korea and nearly all adopted by white parents in the United States.
``It's very powerful, very meaningful, very exciting,'' said Anne Hai Ja Curtis, 32, who grew up in Quincy, Mass.
, and works for the National Park Service in Brookline, Mass.
``I wanted to be here to feel what it is to be among my own.
.. . But I also wanted to be a part of history, to say that I am part of the generation that started all this''.
``All this'' is international adoption, a phenomenon that has helped to alter the way Americans perceive their country and the means by which they build their families.
Almost half a century ago, Korea became the first nation from which US citizens began systematically to adopt children who were not only born abroad, but also looked unmistakably different from themselves.
The three-day meeting in Washington, which ends with a march to the Korean War monument Sunday morning, is the largest-scale effort ever to bring together adults adopted from another nation.
As a result, for researchers and others concerned with the subject, it offers an opportunity to gain unique insights into adoption practices, biracial and multicultural issues, and the integration of untraditional families into the American social fabric.
``For many of us working professionally in the field, it lets us examine what intercountry adoption has looked like and what it will look like for the years to come.
. . . And we can learn a great deal from that,'' Madelyn Freundlich, a leading expert on adoption in the United States, said Saturday.
``This is an important way of finding out what we need to do to make adoption the best that it can be for the future''.
While those attending recognized the broader significance of the ``Gathering of the First Generation of Korean Adoptees,'' as it was called, their motives were anything but clinical.
Nearly all of them grew up in white families, frequently as the only minorities in their schools or their communities.
Moreover, race and ethnicity added layers of intensity and complexity to the already complicated issues of adoption that helped to shape their self-perceptions.
The meeting this weekend represented the first opportunity most of these adults have had to feel what it's like to be in the majority.
Even more pointedly, it gave them the chance to interact with an array of people who not only share their skin color, their facial structure, and their national origin, but also their sensibilities as adoptees.
``It's something like an emotional rush to be with so many people I have so much in common with,'' Mark Leibowitz, 27, a retail store manager from Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., said Saturday.
``A lot of people probably don't understand how big a deal that is, but that's because . . . it's normal for them.
They're with people just like them all the time.
We're not''.
The gathering's sponsors were a group called also-known-as, which is a national organization of Korean adoptees; Holt International Children's Services, the US adoption agency that started Korean adoptions in the mid-1950s after the war there; the Evan B.
Donaldson Adoption Institute, a New York-based research center that Freundlich heads; and the Korea Society.
The fact that the event took place at all, organizers said, demonstrated how far adoption has come in the last few decades _ metamorphosing from a secretive institution that was tainted by shame for generations, to a process that is increasingly open and even celebrated Sunday.
They said the addition of a racial component provided yet another dimension of significance for a country that is becoming increasingly multiethnic and multicultural.
``Intercountry adoption split wide open the notion of secrecy, because people couldn't pretend anymore that they couldn't see the differences between parents and their children,'' said Susan Soon-Keum Cox, a Holt International vice president who in 1956 became one of the first Korean orphans to be adopted by Americans.
``Now I think we're coming to realize that when you talk about the world in a global context, we are the ultimate global citizens''.
While the focus of the meeting was commonality, and the mood was decidedly upbeat and optimistic, there was no effort to gloss over the problems of either adoption or race.
Nearly everyone interviewed said they had encountered racial bias, but insisted they were not scarred by it; similarly, some said they'd had negative adoption experiences, but the vast majority described their lives and adoptive parents in positive terms.
Virtually everyone made a point that experts agree is indicative of an increasingly public attitude among adoptees of all types.
The Korean-born adults said that, as they get older, they have more and more interest in their biological and ethnic roots _ along with a greater and greater desire to search for their birth parents, even if only to see them once.
Many participants, of all ages, said they were so fully immersed in their white worlds growing up that they perceived themselves as being just like the people they always saw.
``It's like I was a Caucasian trapped in a Korean body,'' said Kylee Harrington, 27, a marketing coordinator from Oak Hill, Ill.
The older adoptees, in particular, described being raised by parents who tried so hard to transform them into ``full-fledged Americans'' that they made them feel insecure or ashamed of the part of them that was Korean, and couldn't understand the alienation and discrimination they endured.
``I love my parents dearly . . . but they didn't get that they were contributing to my becoming a wreck inside,'' said Mi Ok Song Bruining, 38, an artist from Cambridge.
Eileen Thompson-Isaacs, 44, a social worker in Somerville, echoed those views and laid much of the blame on adoption agencies that, at the time, counseled prospective parents to put aside their children's pasts and assimilate them into US culture as thoroughly as possible.
One of the radical turn-abouts in adoption Sunday is that adoptive parents are given the opposite advice: to embrace their children's background and incorporate it into their lives.
Indeed, the younger the adoptees in Washington this weekend, the more likely they were to describe childhoods filled with education about Korea, summer camps that stressed ethnic pride, and homes in which the artwork and foods of their homeland were common.
``I've gotten so much that I just didn't feel that there's a void or anything more I needed to complete myself,'' said Sara Hurley, 26, who lives in Bartlett, N.H., and works for the Appalachian Mountain Club.
But she added that a few intense days with her fellow adoptees have had an effect: ``I used to say I don't want to go back to Korea.
Now I'm not so sure.''
Doje said countries throughout the world attach great attention to transnationals adoptions, and noted that rigorous stipulations are not only in full accord with international practices, but will also provide greater protection for adopted children.
He said the purposed relaxing restrictions on domestic adoptions are to provide more orphans with access to family warmth and ensure healthy growth.
The existing law on adoption placed excessive restrictions on people who are fully capable and willing to adopt children, and prolonged overcrowding in government institutions for orphans and handicapped minors, according to Doje.
"Welfare institutions are less than ideal places to promote the healthy growth of unfortunate children because of poor living conditions and the lack of family warm," said the minister.
The existing law stipulates that people seeking to adopt must be childless, and can only adopt one orphaned or handicapped child.
The new draft excludes the limitation that requires people to be childless or to adopt only one child.
The draft also lowers the minimum age required for adopting people from 35 to 30, and removes restrictions on people unable to bear a child.
It also permits some people to adopt children over the age of 14.
The draft stipulates that all domestic adoptions be registered with the government, and notes relationships take effect upon registration and are protected by law.
Until he was 3 years old, Ryan Golden had his own understanding of race: boys were white like him, he figured, and girls, like his African-American sister, Nikki, had dark skin.
``All of a sudden, one day, he was in the bath with Nikki and another girl and he had the realization: not all girls are black,'' said Ryan's mother, Kathy Golden, whose North Olmstead, Ohio, family has grown to include two younger Hispanic girls, Abby and Jenna.
Now, at 15 and 16, Ryan and Nikki are far more sophisticated about race, but still casual about the differences between them.
``I'm so used to being a minority in a white school, it's not a big deal,'' said Nikki, the outgoing one.
``Some people make comments, like `You act like you're white'.
And I say, `That's really dumb.
You can't act like a color'''.
``Good answer,'' said Ryan, smiling approvingly at his sister.
When Bernie and Kathy Golden first contacted adoption agencies, in 1981, they were told that the wait for a healthy white infant would be eight years _ but much less for a child from another country, or of another race.
``We started down the track for a child from India, expecting to get a child in February 1982, but instead, the agency called and told us about Nikki,'' said Ms.
Golden, 40.
``I was pregnant with Ryan when we got the call, but I didn't tell them, because I knew we wanted Nikki.
Race was never an issue for us.
I don't know why, given that we're both Irish Catholics brought up in a very white world.
But we just thought, yeah, we can do this.
My parents were less comfortable with the idea, but that vanished the minute we stopped by their house on the way home with Nikki and opened up the baby blanket''.
While multiracial living is almost a hallmark of the Tiger Woods generation, it is families like the Goldens, with children of a different heritage from their parents, that play it out on the most intimate level.
Such families are both a measure of, and a response to, a changing social climate that has begun to melt some of the boundaries that define racial territory.
The proportion of interracial and interethnic marriages has been rising steadily for decades, according to the Census Bureau, and in a test of new forms allowing people to check more than one race, many people under 18 used that option.
``Maybe the whole notion of race is becoming more fluid,'' said Claudette Bennett, chief of the bureau's racial statistics branch.
But the process of choosing a child _ and which categories of children to consider _ spotlights a family's deepest feelings about race and culture.
So it should be no surprise that race shapes the adoption marketplace, as witness the bald fact that white children usually cost more than black children, and that in the world of international adoptions, Africa is almost ignored.
Last year, more than 5,000 children were adopted from Europe, more than 6,000 from Asia and exactly 182 from Africa.
``There's a variety of reasons why people go to China for a child,'' said Randall Kennedy, a Harvard Law School professor who often writes about race.
``Part of it is that they can close their eyes and imagine themselves the parents of a little Chinese girl, but not of Shaniqua with the kinky hair.
But another part, which I've had white friends talk about, was the worry that given the debate over transracial adoption, they'd be looked at coldly by African-Americans if they adopted a black child''.
Race also plays a role in decisions regarding the largest pool of adoptable children, the 100,000 children in foster care in the United States who need new parents.
The black children who make up, on average, 44 percent of those in state care are slower to be adopted than the 41 percent who are white.
``We have families who say I'll take Hispanic, American Indian, anything but black,'' said Joyce Wadlington, who is in charge of recruiting adoptive families at the Cleveland child-welfare agency.
``I don't know exact numbers, but I'd say only about 5 percent of the white families coming in are interested in black children''.
There are many reasons that American families turn to international adoption rather than the public agencies that handle foster care.
For one, foster children are generally older, and most people are looking for infants.
Then, too, many foster children come with siblings.
Some white families say they have been discouraged from seeking to adopt foster children of another race.
And many would-be parents worry about the lingering effects of the abuse or neglect that landed the child in state custody, and the possibility of the biological family's reappearance.
It is almost as though the universe of adoption comprises two worlds _ one filled with couples looking for a healthy infant to make them a family, and the other with older children in foster care looking for parents _ whose orbits rarely connect.
In recent years, there has been increasing recognition that children benefit from feeling connected with their heritage.
But when the child's background is different from the parents', that is a more complicated, and more self-conscious process.
Though every adopted child must deal with individual identity questions, those who are adopted across race or culture lines also grapple with the issue of group identity.
The issues range from the cosmic to the quotidian: What if a child adopted from Guatemala avoids the two other Hispanic children in his class and says he hates the Spanish-speaking stores and restaurants his adoptive parents seek out?
Will a Chicago synagogue be a comfortable place for a Chinese girl's bat mitzvah?
Or, for the Goldens, who live in a mostly white suburb west of Cleveland and run a wholesale window-covering business, how does a white family learn about black hair care?
``When Nikki was a little baby, with little curls all over,'' Ms.
Golden said, ``I took her downtown to a black hair shop, put her down and said, `You have to help me learn'.
They taught me about oiling the hair, they taught me everything I needed to know.
By now, I can do extensions''.
The deeper questions of racial identity are not so easily answered.
For the children adopted from overseas, there are new institutions to bolster that connection.
Korean adoptees can take their pick of support groups, culture camps and guided homeland tours of their birthplace.
For American black and Hispanic children adopted into white families, there are fewer formal supports.
``You have to do it yourself,'' said Ms.
Golden, whose family provided foster care three years ago for a biracial brother and sister, until the sister's behavior problems became too disruptive.
``When Nikki was little, we would get together informally with other white families who had black kids.
And even now that they're teen-agers, they stay in touch.
It is important to have a racial identity.
Nikki was 4 or 5 when she started calling herself black.
We'd never told her she should call herself black, but she identified that way very early''. nn
Two lawmakers in Washington, rejecting the advice of adoption professionals across the ideological spectrum, threaten to prevent US approval of a landmark international treaty intended to improve the treatment of children, streamline adoption practices worldwide, and curtail corruption in the process.
Leaders of the American adoption community and sources on Capitol Hill said the two Republicans _ Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas and Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey _ are the sole roadblocks to passage of legislation implementing the treaty, called the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption.
It has already been approved by 40 other countries.
Brownback last week used a maneuver called a ``hold'' to stall consideration of the measure.
He said his opposition to the implementing legislation stems largely from the advice of Laura Cecere, the operator of a Cambridge, Mass.
adoption service who helped him adopt a daughter from China last December.
Brownback maintained in an interview that the bill would raise adoption costs and impose standards that could drive small firms like Cecere's out of business.
Smith did not respond to requests for an interview.
But, according to people in and out of Washington who have helped to draft the implementing legislation, he is holding out mainly because he wants to include language precluding homosexuals and other Americans with ``promiscuous lifestyles'' from adopting.
The Hague Convention is being debated as the number of international adoptions by Americans, as well as interest in adoption generally, have soared to an all-time high.
Last year, 16,396 adoptees came to this country from abroad, more than double the number of just 10 years earlier.
``It's an amazing time for the institution,'' said Madelyn Freundlich, executive director of the Evan B.
Donaldson Adoption Institute in New York.
``I think that's one reason the time is right for this treaty now and why it's so very important''.
Even if Brownback's ``hold'' were lifted, both he and Smith have indicated a willingness to impede passage of the legislation as currently written by introducing potentially fractious amendments and using other parliamentary maneuvers that could tie up the House and Senate at a time when most members are anxious to complete their business as quickly as possible so they can go home to campaign.
``The leadership doesn't want a protracted, potentially divisive floor fight, so a single, determined congressman can block the entire bill,'' said Fred Greenman, the legal adviser to the American Adoption Congress.
The fight over bringing the bill to the floor of Congress _ it has already been approved by pertinent committees in both houses _ is most striking because the measure enjoys the backing of an unusually wide array of ideological factions on Capitol Hill and in the adoption world.
After months of delicate negotiations, the end product won the support of politicians ranging from Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who is its primary sponsor, to Representative William D.
Delahunt, a liberal Massachusetts Democrat who has been instrumental in putting together the broad congressional coalition.
At the same time, the measure is backed by the US umbrella organizations for international adoption agencies and adoption attorneys, as well as by disparate national groups representing adoptees, adoptive parents, and birth parents.
Some of these activists, like the American Adoption Congress and the National Council for Adoption, vehemently disagree on nearly every other topic relating to adoption practices but have decided to put aside their lingering differences about some of the treaty's details because they view its overall purpose as so important.
``This is a historic document that will protect needy kids and increase the chances for them to be adopted.
Not passing it would be a major embarrassment for the United States and an enormous human-rights setback for the children,'' said Maureen Hogan, president of Adopt America Advocates, which finds homes for special-needs children nationwide.
The Hague Convention was completed in May 1993.
Since then, 29 nations have ratified the treaty and 11 others have accepted it by a process called accession.
The United States is among 11 original signatories to the pact that have not ratified it.
In this country, only the Senate can approve a treaty, but both chambers must approve legislation spelling out how it will be implemented.
The fight in Congress is over that legislation.
The treaty would require firms operating abroad to radically alter some of their practices, which currently receive little regulation or monitoring and which have always been the nearly exclusive purview of state governments.
The pact calls for each member nation to create a ``central authority'' _ meaning a significant federal role _ to deal with issues that include breaking down procedural and legal barriers among participants, preventing practitioners from exploiting birth parents or making improper financial gains, and upgrading the conditions and protecting the rights of institutionalized children.
Assuming they adhered to the letter of the treaty, participants would be obliged to toughen some of their laws and regulations.
Perhaps most significantly, the central authorities would have to certify agencies that want to operate in other Hague treaty nations, and would be required to set rigorous standards by which those agencies would be legally bound to abide.
By all accounts, the treaty's implementation would lead to unprecedented changes for agencies, lawyers, and facilitators who now function with minimal and often-haphazard rules, particularly abroad.
Adoption-reform organizations say this climate invites illegalities and dubious practices, ranging from bribery and coercion of birth parents to obtain their babies, to the establishment of adoption businesses by people who have little or no experience but want to cash in on the thousands of American individuals and couples who each pay tens of thousands of dollars for overseas adoptions annually.
``I think once the United States passes this, it will make a real difference,'' said Delahunt.
While he and other proponents emphasized that they did not expect extensive improvements overnight, they asserted that the treaty is an essential step toward cleaning up existing abuses, enhancing adoption's image, and leading more Americans to adopt as a result.
Delahunt said that partly because this country takes in about 80 percent of the world's adoptees, US ratification also would serve as a global model and would apply pressure even on nations not under the treaty to raise their standards and improve their treatment of children.
People on all sides of the congressional debate stressed they agreed with the goals Delahunt outlined and said they believed reforms of the type envisioned in the Hague Convention will go a long way toward achieving them.
Sources familiar with Smith's views said he feels strongly about promoting ``family values'' at the same time, however, and Brownback insisted he only wants to ensure that the implementing legislation doesn't cause harm even as it attempts to do good.
``I'm hopeful we can get this through,'' the senator said from his home in Kansas Friday, ``but I have a fundamental concern that, without some fixing, this could actually reduce the number of international adoptions rather than grow it''.
Brownback said that could happen largely because an American central authority would add a layer of bureaucracy to the current international adoption process.
The resulting procedures and regulations for agencies, he said, would increase costs that could drive some prospective parents out of the market.
He added that small agencies, in particular, would find it administratively difficult and expensive to adhere to rule-changes, and therefore could be forced out of business.
The implementing legislation, in response to concerns from Cecere, does give small firms such as hers an additional two years to comply with any new mandates, but Brownback said that would not be sufficient.
Brownback said he favors making the central authority in this country a body that would maintain a registry of adoption practitioners, but would not certify them or establish rules.
It's unclear whether that would comply with the treaty itself.

MOVED. AIDS-TEEN _ ATLANTA _ 15-year-old Dylan Edwards doesn't have HIV, but he is just as much a casualty of the AIDS epidemic as those who are infected with the virus.
Dylan's life has been dominated by AIDS since he was 3 years old, when both of his parents and his younger brother were found to be HIV-positive.
His father died of AIDS 9 years ago; his 12-year-old brother Chris died last month.
Aside from a serious bout with shingles in 1994, his mother has been healthy _ but she's not on any AIDS drugs right now.
Dylan has grown up in the shadow of his brother's illness.
He starred on the freshman football team this season, but no one from his family came to the games _ his mom was at Scottish Rite Hospital with Chris.
Dylan is a bright, well-spoken boy, but does poorly in school and seethes with barely concealed anger and frustration.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.
_ As an adult looking back on a life lived at high speed, Ronald Furman describes himself as always wanting to leap off the edge.
A hustler, a risk-taker, a danger-seeker.
The 53 year old, who recently moved to North Palm Beach, was married three times _ twice to the same woman _ took five years to get through high school, drank excessively, craved high speeds, and, in short, sought anything that would make him ``high''.
Eventually, his life of dares and uncontrolled behavior landed him in jail for a year for cocaine possession.
``I wanted anything that would deliver stimulation to me,'' he said.
``I was self-medicating and I didn't know it''.
What Furman was treating himself for, he found out, was a psychiatric condition most often associated with children _ attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
ADHD has only within the last few years been recognized as a legitimate adult diagnosis.
``A lot of people were trained that people outgrew ADHD,'' said Dr.
Russell Barkley, director of psychology and professor of psychiatry and neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.
``We now know that's not true.
Somewhere between 15-20 percent may outgrow it, but 65-75 percent continue to have symptoms that impair them markedly as adults''.
ADHD is a neurological and genetic disorder that, Barkley said, is the most widely inherited trait of any psychiatric disorder.
Estimates are that 2 million to 5 million adults have ADHD.
It is almost impossible to acquire the syndrome in adulthood, except through trauma to the head.
Most cases of adult diagnosis occur in those whose childhood disorder was not identified.
And Barkley believes that the majority of adults with it ``remain undiagnosed at this time''.
He is studying 240 adults to try to better define the symptoms and the way they affect an adult.
The overriding signs are impulsivity and inattentiveness, and lack of inhibition and self-control.
This can translate into multiple marriages, substance abuse, speeding violations and risky driving, poor job histories, difficulties in school and criminal behavior.
Furman is almost a textbook example.
But diagnosis is difficult, said psychologist Myles Cooley, who is treating the North Palm Beach man.
He says it is absolutely essential that a history of such behavior date back to early childhood for a diagnosis to be on target.
``If I can't find any evidence through high school or college, I'm going to really question what's going on here,'' he said.
Because of the difficulties in getting details from ADHD patients, he said, he often questions spouses and parents, or even goes as far as asking for report cards if they're available.
``The cards are likely to have notations from teachers about the child speaking out in class or being disruptive,'' he said.
Furman said he began to question himself when he spent some time living with his mother and heard stories about his hell-raising as a child.
When a friend with a similar history was diagnosed, he said it prodded his interest.
``People don't realize how debilitating it is.
I want to be a stable individual, hold a job for a long period of time.
The longest I've ever been employed is a year and a half,'' he said.
He is currently being evaluated for medication.
Drugs such as Ritalin, a stimulant, or antidepressants may be prescribed for adults, as they are sometimes for children.
Patients are also trained to control their behaviors and focus better on tasks.
``I feel like somebody took a large backpack filled with rocks off my back,'' Furman said of his diagnosis.
``If someone else out there feels the same as I do, I'd like to have them realize they can still get help''.

SAN DIEGO (AP) _ About a million miles (kilometers) away and fixed in a spot where the Earth and the sun's gravitational tug is balanced, a satellite will study how much energy Earth absorbs from sunlight and how that affects the climate.
Francisco P.J.
Valero, a scientist from Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, will lead the new NASA program.
It uses a satellite in a fixed location _ known as L1 _ that will allow it to have a continuous view of Earth in sunlight.
The satellite ``Triana,'' named after the sailor on Columbus' ship who spotted the ``New World,'' will be launched in 2000 aboard a space shuttle.
Scientists plan for Triana to be the first satellite at the L1 point dedicated to observing Earth.
Another satellite is now there observing activity of the sun.
Valero, who works in Scripps' Atmospheric Research Laboratory, was selected over eight others to lead the research.
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland will develop and manage the mission.
&UR; ___ &UR; Study shows Ritalin is effective in helping children with ADHD ANAHEIM, California (AP) _ Behavior in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder improves dramatically when they take the controversial drug Ritalin, according to a study.
The study's early findings showed that the children who took the drug improved far more than children who were treated with only therapy.
It should quiet some of the criticism of drugs such as Ritalin and encourage doctors to stop blaming ``bad parents'' and teachers, said Peter Jensen of the National Institute of Mental Health, one of the authors.
The authors, from six medical centers including the University of California, Irvine, presented their preliminary results recently at the American College of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry meeting in Anaheim.
They believe it is the largest study of the disorder.
ADHD affects 3 percent to 9 percent of all children, limiting their ability to focus, and accounts for one-third to one-half of referrals for mental health services for kids.
Critics say doctors are too quick to diagnose ADHD and over-prescribe drugs for children.
But Jensen said the problem is that thousands of children aren't treated and more than one-half of children with the disorder have not been diagnosed.
The 600 children in the study, ages 7 to 9, were randomly placed in one of four groups: medication; psychosocial (behavior-modification therapy, social-skill building and summer programs); combination medication and psychosocial; and referral back to the community doctor.
After 14 months of treatment, 12 to 15 percent of kids on medication or combined therapy were diagnosed with ADHD, and 32 to 35 percent of children on psychosocial or community-based treatment still had the disorder.
For social skills, however, combined treatment was best.
&UR; ___ &UR; Concussions dangerous, hard to define WASHINGTON (AP) _ Concussions are the hidden dangers of contact sports.
There are 82,000 brain injuries a year reported in sports, according to the American Academy of Neurology.
In football alone, a brain injury occurs once in every 3.5 games, it said.
What happens inside the skull after a hard hit is difficult to diagnose, even if the player is willing to report it _ which the player sometimes is not.
Doctors are struggling to find a way to tell those players who can go back in the game from those who must wait and those who will never play again.
``A lot of times, we don't recognize it because the player does not want to tell us they have suffered a concussion,'' said Dr.
Bryan Smith, head team physician at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
``There's a long tradition in college and high school where players accept injury as part of the risk of playing,'' said sports agent Leigh Steinberg of Newport Beach, California.
``Tough players are stoic and don't talk a lot about injury or pain.
You have a fair amount of denial going on''.
The brain is the most complex organ in the body, Smith said.
``Even though we have certain symptoms and signs, they are quite variable and they don't always occur in each person that's been concussed''.
Some immediate symptoms are clear.
A player may be dazed, dizzy, have trouble focusing attention or remembering, and even black out.
Long-term damage can range from no effect to a loss of coordination or thinking ability to death.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of American children take drugs daily to calm hyperactivity, but medical science has been uncertain how the drugs affect the brain.
New research in mice suggests that drugs such as Ritalin quiet hyperactivity by boosting the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter, in the brain.
A study appears Friday in the journal Science.
Between 3 and 6 percent of American school-age children suffer from a condition called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
These children are restless and impulsive and have difficulty concentrating.
Drugs such as Ritalin and Dexedrine have a calming effect, but their action has been poorly understood.
Howard Hughes Medical Institute researchers at Duke University discovered the serotonin action of Ritalin by eliminating the possibility that the drug was acting on other brain chemicals.
They used a laboratory mouse strain that had been genetically manipulated to lack a key protein in the processing of dopamine, another neurotransmitter.
Such mice have symptoms similar to those of ADHD.
When the mice lacking normal dopamine were given Ritalin, they were calmed, proving that the drug was not acting on dopamine.
The researchers then blocked the effects of norepinephrine, another brain chemical, but this had no effect on the ADHD symptoms.
Finally, the researchers gave the mice Prozac, a drug that inhibits the action of serotonin.
The ADHD symptoms declined dramatically in the mice.
The results, said the researchers, show that Ritalin acts on the serotonin levels in the brain by restoring a proper balance between serotonin and other natural brain chemicals.
WASHINGTON _ Using a radioactive ``label,'' scientists have demonstrated abnormally high concentrations of a key brain protein in seven adults who had been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder.
The test suggests that parents of children suspected of having the learning and behavioral problem may someday be able to have their children tested before deciding whether to have them take potent and controversial drugs such as Ritalin and other stimulants.
But Bertha Madras, one of the Harvard Medical School researchers who performed the initial test, said many more experiments must be performed before such a test is available.
``The initial data is robust,'' she said Thursday in a telephone interview, ``but a cascade of experiments have to be done before we can say we have a diagnostic tool''.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric illness that is believed to affect between 3 and 5 percent of children in the United States.
In general, it affects such functions as working memory, self-control and motivation.
Madras, a professor of biopsychology at the medical school, said the test showed that the seven adults diagnosed with attention deficit disorder had on average a 70 percent elevation in concentrations of a brain protein called the dopamine transporter.
By linking a radioactive iodine molecule to a substance that locks onto the dopamine transporter, the researchers were able to use imaging instruments to directly measure the concentrations of transporter.
The study is described in a report being published Friday in the British medical journal, the Lancet.
The finding appears to confirm theories about the way ADHD affects its victims, but Madras said tests on larger populations of adults and later on children must be performed.
The researchers have applied for Food and Drug Administration approval for a second test with a larger group of adults, she said.
(Story can end here.
Optional add follows).
Psychologists and psychiatrists say the condition seems to affect girls and boys differently.
Most girls with ADHD have a form known as Type A, which is characterized primarily by inattentiveness and distractibility, and less by hyperactivity and impulsive behavior.
The most common form among boys is known as Type B.
Rather than flightiness, persons with this form tend to be hyperactive and impulsive.
A Type C involves symptoms of both Types A and B.
And Type D patients have symptoms that can disrupt everyday life, but none that clearly fit the other three forms.
Studies have shown that academic performance of 90 percent of the school-age patients improves with stimulant medication, principally the drug methylphenidate, marketed as Ritalin.
However, the treatment is controversial, since methylphenidate shares many of the pharmacological effects of cocaine and is addictive to test animals.
It also is one of the most commonly diverted and stolen substances in America, and more high school students are reported to abuse it than receive it under prescription.
Moreover, the diagnosis of ADHD is based on behavioral studies and can involve often-subjective judgements on the part of therapists.
A consensus development panel convened last year by the National Institutes of Health recommended continued use of stimulant drugs for ADHD, but also called for more research toward understanding the nature of the disease and developing a more precise diagnostic procedures.
Although the chemical reasons for ADHD are not clearly understood, scientists have speculated that the brain's failure to control the activity of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that relays signals between nerve cells, is involved.
Specifically, some researchers believe the transporter protein _ the ``truck'' that moves dopamine from one cell to the next _ is key to the condition.
Normally, the transporter protein gathers up the dopamine after it has stimulated its target cells and returns it to the cells that released it.
Methyphenidate, cocaine and other stimulant drugs are known to inhibit the transporter protein.
By taking the ``trucks'' off the highway, the drugs cause dopamine to build up and continue to stimulate its targeted nerve cells, Madras explained.
This has the paradoxical effect of calming persons with ADHD.
Some researchers think this is because their condition stems from a deficiency of target cells or of the cell receptors that react with dopamine.

&LR; &QC; &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR; &QC; QUESTION: My 9-year-old son is in the gifted and talented program at school.
Though he excels in music and arts and his intelligence level is way beyond his years, he is easily frustrated, cries frequently and does not do what he is told.
His teachers call me all the time, telling me he is a discipline problem and will not finish his work.
He also does not seem to get along with other children and is very unorganized.
Could he be ADHD _ even though he makes straight A's when he chooses to do his work?
_ R.H., Guilford, Ind.
DR. BRAZELTON: The diagnosis of ADHD _ Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder _ doesn't occur to me.
Too many adults (teachers and parents) use it as a sort of wastebasket diagnosis.
Instead, I would think that your son is feeling too much pressure to perform.
He may be a perfectionist and may not want to take chances on being anything but perfect.
The gifted program may be too pressured an environment for an already inner-pressured child.
Hearing that other children shun him and that he is disorganized worries me.
I urge you to have your son evaluated by a child psychologist or therapist.
It sounds as if he may be feeling overwhelmed or depressed.
QUESTION: Our 26-month-old son is very loving and well-behaved, but when he gets mad or frustrated he acts out by hitting, kicking or throwing things.
What would you suggest we do?
When we put him in timeout, he gets frantic and more out of control _ not calmer.
_ R.H., Missouri City, Texas DR.
BRAZELTON: His out-of-control, hurting behaviors are a mark of how frightening it is to lose control.
He needs you to help him regain control and to help him understand his behavior.
Hold him or contain him when he gets out of control (a timeout is just for that purpose).
As soon as you break the cycle, tell him that you understand how upset he is but that you also want to help him learn to control himself.
It's too frightening to everyone (including him) when he loses it.
QUESTION: When my 4-year-old son wakes up at night, he comes into our bed, saying he is afraid.
We welcome him with open arms and do not take him back to his bed.
My question: By allowing him to come into our bed, are we preventing him from learning to overcome his fears and anxieties?
Or is he learning a sense of love, security and self-importance from us?
_ M.J.M., Boca Raton, Fla.
DR. BRAZELTON: Both.
You are certainly offering him security by accepting him.
But you aren't helping him overcome his age-appropriate fears and nightmares.
These are normal at his age, when he is learning about his own aggressive feelings.
During the day, he will need your help with those fears and your understanding.
He will best learn how to handle angry and aggressive feelings from you and your spouse by modeling on you both as you handle your own feelings.
I won't tell you when to begin helping him go back to his own bed, but it should be a goal.
He'd be proud if he could learn to handle his own fears.
QUESTION: I am very upset about my 4 1/2-year-old grandson.
He is a bright, happy, verbal youngster at home.
However, in daycare/nursery school, he will not speak with the children or teacher.
This has been the problem since he started daycare at 2 1/2.
His parents have been going with him to therapy for 16 months _ with two different therapists.
He still won't speak in school, though he participates in all activities.
What are your thoughts?
_ R.W., Baltimore, Md.
DR. BRAZELTON: I assume that his parents have gotten an evaluation from the therapists about whether your grandson has a hypersensitive hearing problem or a sensory integration problem, which can lead to an autistic-like interference in handling complex environments.
If he hasn't been evaluated, he should be.
But if your grandson is not plagued with such a problem, he may just be a child who participates visually.
I have seen children who are part of the group without ever participating openly.
If no one pushes him, he'll probably start communicating on his own.

BINGHAMTON, N.Y.
(AP) - A psychologist says he and a partner in Tennessee may be on to a biological test for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Vincent J.
Monastra of the FBI Attention Disorders Clinic in the suburb of Endicott and Joel F.
Lubar of the University of Tennessee say the disorder can be diagnosed by monitoring activity in the front region of the brain.
They have developed a test they say is 90 percent effective.
If approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration, it would be the first laboratory procedure for diagnosing ADHD.
ADHD is currently diagnosed according to a set of guidelines written by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
CHICAGO (AP) -- Hyperactive boys treated with drugs such as Ritalin were much less likely to abuse alcohol and other drugs as teen-agers than similar boys who had not been treated, researchers say.
Some experts not involved in the study said it was flawed and too small to reach meaningful conclusions.
But authors of the study -- which involved 212 boys, including 75 with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD -- said the findings should help allay concerns that giving children potentially addictive drugs such as Ritalin may promote harmful habits later.
An estimated 3 million school-age children have ADHD, and as many as half may be taking Ritalin or other stimulants, past research indicates.
``There has been a mythology that the use of these medications could `prime' children to become addicts in the future or could develop `a culture of drug taking,''' said Dr.
Joseph Biederman of Massachusetts General Hospital, lead author of the study.
It is published in the August issue of Pediatrics' ``electronic pages,'' an Internet extension of the journal published by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
``We believe that children with ADHD who are medically treated will have fewer problems resulting from their disorder and more successful lives, probably giving them fewer reasons to experiment with substance abuse,'' he said.
Ritalin acts on dopamine, a brain chemical that helps regulate thinking.
It is believed to calm hyperactivity by helping children's brains disregard distracting stimuli, such as classroom noise, so they can focus on learning.
The subjects for the research were part of a previous study of families with an ADHD child and families with no ADHD children.
The children and their mothers were interviewed on three occasions -- when they entered the study, one year later and four years after enrollment.
The authors studied 56 ADHD patients who were on medication, 19 ADHD patients not on medication and 137 patients without the disorder.
At the study's end, 75 percent of the unmedicated ADHD subjects had substance abuse disorders, compared with 25 percent of the medicated subjects.
Abused substances included alcohol, marijuana, hallucinogens, cocaine and other stimulants.
Eighteen percent of the non-ADHD subjects were substance abusers.
A critic of the study, psychologist Nadine Lambert of the University of California at Berkeley, said it was too small to show significant differences in rates of drug abuse.
Her own research involving more than 200 ADHD subjects tracked for more than 20 years shows that those who took stimulant medication were more likely to be cocaine and tobacco abusers as adults than non-medicated subjects, she said.
Lambert said she is not opposed to treating ADHD youngsters with stimulants because the benefits have been shown clearly, but she believes there are risks and they should be acknowledged.
WASHINGTON _ When a little green pill turns a miserable, rowdy, troublemaking kid into an attentive, quiet and apparently happy youngster, it is either correcting an imbalance of brain chemistry or suppressing the child's natural spontaneity and innovative impulses.
It depends on who's describing it.
But sales of the pill, the stimulant methylphenidate, which is marketed under the trade name Ritalin, have more than doubled in the past decade as more and more parents, teachers and therapists turn to the drug to treat a condition known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
While the drug, which acts on the brain in much the same way as cocaine, is increasingly used to make better students out of elementary school children deemed to have ``developmental disorders,'' a growing number of specialists has begun to question the wisdom of using the drug.
In addition to methylphenidate, stimulates such as amphetamines are sometimes used to treat ADHD, but to a lesser extent.
A committee of psychiatrists, neurologists, pediatricians, pharmacologists and educators will listen to experts on different sides of the controversy before attempting Wednesday to issue a ``consensus statement'' on ADHD and its treatment.
The panel, assembled by the National Institutes of Health, heard its first presentations Monday.
``We are taking away their vitality with psychostimulants that can cause irreversible brain damage,'' Dr.
Peter Breggin, a Maryland psychiatrist, told the panel Monday.
But referring to findings from sophisticated brain-imaging equipment, other experts insisted people with ADHD suffer from identifiable brain disorders.
Certain areas appear to be smaller than normal and are less active during mental tests.
Theories about the cause range from genetics to injuries suffered during fetal development.
For such conditions and the chemical imbalances that develop because of them, some experts said, methylphenidate is the best treatment currently available.
People with behavioral patterns that cause them to be diagnosed as having ADHD _ impulsiveness, inability to concentrate, difficulty learning _ appear to have a deficiency in certain brain receptors involved in processing the neurotransmitter dopamine, according to this view.
Like cocaine, methylphenidate inhibits a brain chemical that removes dopamine from certain areas of the brain.
In effect, it increases the time the reduced number of receptors is exposed to dopamine.
But that may not be as simple as it sounds.
For one thing, while ADHD has been thought of as a temporary condition that children ``grow out of,'' recent findings suggest it may be a chronic condition that can last a lifetime.
And while the Food and Drug Administration has approved the sale of methylphenidate on the basis of short-term studies of its safety and effectiveness, no one knows the impact of long-range use of the drug.
``Between 1990 and 1995, there was a 2 1/2-fold increase in sales of methylphenidate,'' said Andrew Rowland, a researcher at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.
``We need to generate long-term data on the safety and effectiveness of this drug''.
After listening to other researchers Tuesday morning, the panel is to discuss the ADHD-drug issue privately in the afternoon and issue a consensus panel Wednesday.
Specific questions the consensus committee is charged with answering include: _ Whether ADHD is, in fact, a disorder.
_ What impact it has on individuals, families and society.
_ What are the effective treatments?
_ What are their risks?
_ What directions should future research take?

BISMARCK, N.D.
(AP) -- Ten days after he began taking a widely used medicine called Adderall to control his attention deficit disorder and help him with his college studies, Ryan Ehlis slipped into a psychotic fog and killed his infant daughter.
God, he said, told him to do it.
Today, the 24-year-old University of North Dakota student is out of jail and back in school, acquitted of murder by a judge who ruled his psychotic state was an extremely rare side effect of Adderall.
Medical experts and the drug's manufacturer say that despite the slaying, Adderall remains a safe and effective drug for controlling attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
Within days after taking the medicine in January, Ehlis started hearing voices.
He believed God was telling him to leave his body and bring his daughter with him to save the world, said his lawyer, John Thelen.
His conditioned worsened until, on Jan.
30, Ehlis killed his 5-week-old daughter, Tara, with a shotgun, then shot himself in the abdomen.
He recovered from the wound and was charged with murder.
Earlier this month, psychiatrists testified before a judge that the shootings happened solely because of a psychotic state caused by the prescription drug.
Judge Debbie Kleven agreed, ruling that Ehlis lacked the capacity to understand what he was doing.
Ehlis has declined comment on the case but said he returned to normal days after he stopped taking the medication.
He is back home with his common-law wife and three other children.
``I'm doing very well, and my family is doing pretty good, too, considering the circumstances,'' he said.
The drug's labeling warns that in very rare cirumstances, it can cause ``psychotic episodes at recommended doses''.
``We have always been aware there was a very slight risk of psychotic side effects with this drug, but this was the most severe case that's ever occurred,'' said Stefan Antonsson, vice president of marketing for Shire Richwood Inc.
, the Florence, Ky.
, maker of the drug.
Since Adderall was made available on a widespread basis in 1996, the company has received 10 reports of ``general psychotic events'' from the drug's use, Antonsson said.
``They all seemed to resolve without significant injury to the user or other people,'' he said.
More than a million Adderall prescriptions were written in 1997, Antonsson said.
That figure rose to 2.3 million in 1998, and in the first nine months of this year the number has increased to 2.7 million, he said.
During clinical trials of the drug, Antonsson said, there were no reported instances of psychotic disorders.
Doctors are advised to prescribe it under close medical supervision.
Ehlis did not seek medical attention, apparently because he did not realize he was having a psychotic event.
Dr. James Swanson, a professor at the University of California at Irvine who has studied Adderall, said he was surprised to hear of Ehlis' violent reaction.
``I knew that in high doses this would be a real concern, but not at the typical doses that are prescribed for clinical treatment,'' Swanson said.
Thelen said the drug was prescribed to Ehlis by a psychiatrist, and Ehlis was taking the prescribed dosage.
As a boy, Ehlis had been diagnosed with ADHD and had taken Ritalin.
Adderall is considered similar to Ritalin but is thought to be more effective in some cases for ADHD.
Ritalin also carries a warning about potential psychosis in extremely rare cases.
In one of 10 extreme reactions to Adderall known by the company, Antonsson described how a 7-year-old boy became aggressive and defiant.
When the boy quit using the drug, he improved, Antonsson said.
Ehlis is taking no medication for his ADHD, his lawyer said.
&LR; &QL; A study associates high vitamin C levels in blood with decreased high blood-lead levels.
But while the research, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, established the inverse relationship, the authors found in questioning study participants that there was no ``significant relationship'' between the amount of vitamin C that people ate and their blood-lead levels.
Researchers from the University of California at San Francisco studied data collected from 19,578 participants, ages 6 through 90, who did not have a history of lead poisoning.
The participants had taken part in a national health survey from 1988 to 1994.
Co-author of the study, Dr.
Joel S.
Simon, said that previous studies have found increased dietary amounts of vitamin C linked with lower blood-lead levels.
He said that his and his colleagues' inability to find a dietary relationship may have been attributable to ``imprecise'' questionnaire wording.
He also suggested that high lead levels flush ascorbic acid out of the system more quickly, lowering the ascorbic acid level in the blood.
&QL; &QL; &UR; Ouch-free monitor device promising for diabetics &LR; &QL; Checking the body's blood sugar levels at home could get less painful for people with diabetes.
GlucoWatch biographer, an experimental watch-like device, has been shown to be as effective as current self-monitoring techniques that require pricking a finger to get blood samples, according to a report released Tuesday at the American Diabetes Association meeting in San Diego.
The device, which is worn on the arm, electrochemically measures the glucose levels in tiny amounts of fluid found between cells beneath the skin's surface.
A AAA battery attached to the GlucoWatch releases an electric current into the skin that enlarges the pores and causes the fluid to seep out.
When the fluid reacts with an enzyme on a small disposable pad, a glucose measurement can be made.
The device would allow people with diabetes to check their glucose levels up to 36 times a day.
The results of the readings were nearly identical with those done by pricking the finger to draw blood.
GlucoWatch awaits US Food and Drug Administration approval, and is unlikely to be made commercially available for at least a year.
The device could cost about $300 and the disposable sensor pads about $4.
&QL; &QL; &UR; ADHD report promotes treating with stimulants &LR; &QL; Stimulants, such as Ritalin, that are prescribed for youths with attention-deficit hyperactivitiy disorder may be underprescribed, according to a new study, and not overprescribed, as suggested by media reports and public opinion.
The study, led by Peter S.
Jensen, a child and adolescent psychiatrist from the National Institute of Mental Health, found that fewer than one in eight children with ADHD were prescribed the stimulant medications.
It will appear in the July 1999 Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
The results came from a 1992 sample of nearly 1,300 children and their parents in Atlanta, New Haven, Westchester, N.Y., and San Juan.
About 5 percent of the children met all the criteria of ADHD, and 12 percent of those ADHD-diagnosed children had been treated with stimulant drugs in the past year.
The report found that ADHD children were generally more likely to receive other forms of treatment, such as in-school services or mental health counseling, than medication.
Stimulants are considered the best treatment, according to Jensen's study.
His report acknowledges that there have been well-documented studies showing that the number of children receiving stimulants is increasing, although little information is known as to why that is occurring.
But his report suggests that there are ``many children with ADHD going unidentified and untreated.''
Experts estimate that 1.5 million to 2.4 million (or 3 percent to 5 percent) of schoolchildren in the United States have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
And tens of thousands are regularly given drugs like Ritalin to combat it.
But in Britain the diagnosis is made for fewer than 1 percent of the schoolchildren.
Ken Jacobson, a doctoral candidate in anthropology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, decided to investigate why.
He says he believes his is the first cross-cultural study of the disorder.
His findings are sure to contribute to debate over whether attention deficit disorder is the result of biology, as most experts now believe, or the creation of a society addicted to speed.
Examining 10- and 11-year-olds in Oxfordshire and in western Massachusetts, Jacobson found that there was little difference between the behavior of children in whom the disorder is diagnosed and those found to be normal.
Both groups surpassed the average for inappropriate behavior associated with ADHD, including restlessness, difficulty staying seated, interrupting, not listening and fidgeting.
``The default condition that children will revert to is ADHD,'' Jacobson concluded.
Though he holds master's degrees in neuroscience and anthropology, he is skeptical of the theories that the disorder is due to an absence of neurotransmitters in the brain or abnormal glucose metabolism.
``If you are inclined to diagnose a child as ADHD,'' he said, ``you have ample opportunity.
And if you are inclined not to diagnose a child, you also have ample opportunity''.
The difficulty of identifying the disorder has been recognized for years.
In 1998 a panel of experts commissioned by the National Institutes of Health found that a consistent diagnostic method for the disorder had proved elusive.
In December, a landmark study by the national institutes on treatment of the disorder found that the drug Ritalin was more effective than behavioral-modification therapy, which is what is primarily used in Britain.
Some people might use Jacobson's preliminary findings, which he presented at the Society for Psychological Anthropology in New Mexico in September and again at the American Anthropological Association in Chicago in November, to conclude that the disorder is simply widely underdiagnosed in Britain.
Jacobson recognizes this and says he has to do more work on why the British rate is so low.
But he is convinced by his study, which should be completed in the spring, that the direct connection made between attention deficit disorder and learning disabilities is false.
``I think something else is the cause of the problem that kids don't learn up to level that they are being compared to,'' he said.
``All children have talents, and all children have needs.
What we are doing by focusing on ADHD is focusing on a few kids' needs.
So we have a whole group of kids who have special needs and are not getting attention.''
CHICAGO (AP) -- The nation's pediatricians are being asked to take an active role in diagnosing attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder amid concern that merely rambunctious children are being given unnecessary medication.
The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday issued its first guidelines for ADHD, hoping to eliminate incorrect diagnoses and make sure untreated children get the help they need.
The guidelines are for children 6 through 12.
Most ADHD research has involved that age group, and the academy also said it recognizes that some symptoms can be chalked up to normal rambunctiousness and contrariness in preschoolers.
However, recent research shows dramatic increases in the use of drugs like Ritalin to treat children with ADHD, suggesting the disorder is either becoming more common or is being overdiagnosed.
The academy, the nation's largest group of pediatricians, said it is unclear whether the disorder is being overdiagnosed, because doctors' definitions and treatment of it varies widely.
The academy said it believes the new guidelines will standardize the diagnosis and make it easier to identify which children really need help.
Guidelines for treating ADHD are still being developed.
''We'd like to help us all (diagnose) more accurately,'' said Dr.
James Perrin, an author of the guidelines and an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
Between 4 percent and 12 percent of school-age children -- or an average of about 2.5 million, most of them boys -- are believed to have ADHD.
Symptoms include short attention span, impulsive behavior and difficulty focusing and sitting still.
Ritalin is often prescribed to increase a child's alertness.
But many experts have pointed out that its long-term effects on children are unknown.
For a diagnosis of ADHD under the new guidelines, a child must exhibit symptoms in at least two settings, such as at home and at school.
The symptoms must harm the child's academic or social functioning for at least six months.
This is the first time the academy has drawn up guidelines for a behavioral ailment.
The academy began developing them three years ago, said Dr.
Martin Stein, co-author and a pediatrics professor at the University of California at San Diego.
The guidelines also suggest that pediatricians and family doctors take a leading role in addressing the disorder, with information about the child's behavior from parents and teachers.
Doctors also should use criteria from the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic manual of mental disorders.
Involving pediatricians in the diagnosis of ADHD is ''really exciting because they're seeing these kids more than child psychiatrists,'' said Dr.
Karen Pierce, a child psychiatrist in Chicago who helped develop the standards.
''It will add a new dimension and actually be able to help a lot more kids''.

SAN FRANCISCO _ The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved a one-a-day pill for attention-deficit disorder that is easier to take and possibly more effective than current three-a-day versions of the commonly prescribed drug Ritalin.
The FDA decision is a commercial boost for Mountain View, Calif.'s Alza Corp.
, which can now enter the $700 million-a-year market for drugs that treat attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder.
ADHD makes it difficult for children to concentrate in class and in many instances makes them hyperactive and unruly.
``This is the time of year when parents are making the decision to use or not use ADHD medications,'' said Alza chief executive Dr.
Ernest Mario.
Mario said the company will immediately start promoting its one-a-day capsule to pediatricians.
He said Alza could ship the first pills out of its Vacaville factory ``in a matter of days''.
The Alza pill is based on the drug methylphenidate, the generic version of Ritalin, which has been used since the 1950s to control ADHD.
For the 3 to 5 percent of schoolchildren, mainly boys, who are believed to have ADHD, pediatricians routinely prescribe Ritalin or generic alternatives two or three times a day, generally around mealtimes.
Although Novartis, the Swiss drug firm that invented Ritalin, brought out a sustained-release version in 1984, that single-dose pill has not been widely used by physicians.
Dr. Ami Goodman, a pediatrician with Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco, said doctors typically prescribe the multiple-dose versions because they think they work better.
Goodman said doctors have been hoping for an effective one-a-day version because fewer children will forget to take the drug.
He said a one-a-day pill would remove the stigma that attaches to kids who must slip off to the school nurse's office for a noon booster.
``It's a matter of trying to keep ADHD a more private affair,'' said Goodman, who had no opinion about whether the new Alza formula would be any more effective than Novartis' little-used sustained-release pill.
But Dr.
Glen Elliot, a psychiatrist at the University of California at San Francisco and an Alza consultant, said the clinical studies leading up to the FDA's approval suggest that Alza has found the time-release technology that works.
Alza's secret is the pill itself, which is about the size of a Tic Tac candy.
The pill's outer coating is actually a dose of the drug, which dissolves quickly and begins circulating through the child's bloodstream when the pill is taken before or after breakfast.
But it is what is inside the pill that counts.
The outer shell dissolves to reveal a tiny plastic pump filled with a 12-hour dose.
The pump works by osmosis.
It absorbs water from the body.
The water liquifies tiny amounts of drug and pushes the liquified drug out a microscopic hole in the pump at a rate calculated to exhaust the medicine just as the child is finishing homework.
The availability of an easy-to-use pill is sure to fuel the debate about whether ADHD is overdiagnosed _ and whether Ritalin or its generic alternatives are overprescribed.
Stephen Hinshaw, a psychiatrist at the University of California at Berkeley and an ADHD specialist, was part of a recent National Institutes of Health study that endorsed the effectiveness of Ritalin for controlling ADHD.
But, said Hinshaw, who is also an Alza consultant, the problem is that ADHD can be misdiagnosed in two ways: labeling boys with the condition simply because they are rambunctious, while missing girls who may have a form of ADHD that shortens their attention span without making them unruly in class.
``The problem is that you can't evaluate ADHD in 10 minutes, but in some places that's all the time you get with your physician,'' Hinshaw said.

In her new job as a recruiter for a telecommunications company in Herndon, Va.
, Alicia Dennis was told to sign up for a weeklong training session.
Dennis, who has attention deficit disorder, promptly panicked.
``I knew I'd never make it through,'' she said.
``It's very technical information.
You're sitting in a lecture with 25 or 30 people looking at black-and-white slide presentations.
I wouldn't be able to concentrate.
I'd zone out, and then I'd be lost''.
A decade ago, Dennis probably would have forced herself to go to the seminar, struggled through the classes and returned a nervous wreck.
She might not have even known she suffered from ADD _ or would have tried to keep it secret if she did know.
But times have changed.
Publicity about ADD and its cousin, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, has made many people with the disorders more aware of their condition.
They also have new legal protections against job discrimination and access to new treatments.
As a result, they have become much more open about forming strategies for dealing with the disability on the job.
More of them are also getting advice from personal coaches.
The International Coach Federation says it found in an informal survey of its members that the number of their clients with ADD had grown by an average of two-thirds in the last three years.
Dennis is one such client.
She told her supervisors about her condition before going to the training conference last year, and they agreed to let her take breaks from classes as needed and return later for makeup sessions.
She has since hired a coach, Jodi Sleeper-Triplett, who, like other career coaches who specialize in attention disorders, says training can do wonders.
``My clients don't know where to start,'' Sleeper-Triplett said.
``They call me to ask: `How do I figure out what time to get up in the morning so I can get to the office by 9?
How do I set up a filing system so I can find things'?
Managers and co-workers think the person doesn't care, or is rude.
It really is a lack of knowledge and training''.
Sleeper-Triplett helps them develop systems to be better organized, like keeping detailed daily planners, setting alarms and beepers to remind them of appointments and color-coding their files.
She also asks them to send her their to-do lists every day by e-mail, and she makes sure they have set aside enough time to complete each task.
Nancy Ratey, a coach from Wellesley, Mass.
, who herself has ADHD, once counseled a doctor with the disorder who had performed well until his practice was taken over by managed care and he was forced to see many more patients.
Overwhelmed, he took to chaining his foot to his desk to force himself to dictate revisions in patients' charts.
Still, he fell behind with a backlog of more than 300 charts and was close to losing his job.
Ratey advised him to stand up and move around while he dictated patient notes and to minimize interruptions by closing his office door and having papers put in a box outside the office.
Within days, he had caught up.
Wilma Fellman, a career counselor in Troy, Mich.
, reports a similar rescue mission.
She was working with a criminal lawyer with ADD who was crumbling under the strain of juggling several cases at once.
She persuaded him to switch to another specialty, real estate.
``He needed to work on one thing until he completed it,'' Fellman said.
``This area let him work on a case for a relatively short period of time and close it.
He loved it''.
Experts say employers have everything to gain from the new openness about attention disorders, which are biochemical imbalances in the brain with symptoms that include procrastination, impulsiveness, disorganization, hyperactivity, lack of motivation and an inability to manage time.
Once considered to afflict only children, the disorders are now said to have been diagnosed in 3 percent to 5 percent of adults, too.
Half are women, who tend to feel the loss of self-esteem more keenly than men and who are often shunted into low-level administrative positions for which they are ill-suited, according to Dr.
Kathleen Nadeau, a clinical psychologist in Silver Spring, Md.
Many counselors and other specialists say that in most cases, little things can make a big difference.
Patricia H.
Latham, a lawyer in Washington and co-founder of the National Center for Law and Learning Disabilities, says ADD sufferers can negotiate minor accommodations in the workplace without disclosing that they have the disorder.
They can ask for flexible start times, for example, or the right to close the office door if they are distracted by noise.
Nessa Miller, 40, an operations specialist for the Social Security Administration in Baltimore, decided to tell her employer of her ADHD diagnosis to help explain why she had temper tantrums so severe that she sometimes put her fists through walls.
Her boss granted her extra breaks so she could get up from her desk and walk around for several minutes once an hour, and he began sending her memos with widely spaced paragraphs following up and summarizing his spoken instructions.
Now, she says, she has learned to have a sense of humor about her condition.
``You have to learn it's not your fault,'' she said.
If fine-tuning the office routine does not work, specialists say, people with the disorders might want to think about switching careers.
They tend to adapt well to jobs that require a lot of action, give immediate feedback and have clear deadlines, like sales, teaching, coaching sports, journalism, police work and acting, the specialists say.
But they can become frustrated in jobs that require great attention to detail or sitting at a desk all day.
``Because ADD people have trouble motivating themselves, they use external deadlines like Damocles' sword,'' said Dr.
Barry Garfinkel, a child and adolescent psychiatrist in Minneapolis.
Often, the simple act of finding that the discomfort of a lifetime has a name is enough to start on the path to recovery.
``All my life I was a bad person,'' said John Schumacher, 53, a chef and hotel owner in New Prague, Minn.
``My nickname in school was Johnny Nothing.
I was so frustrated, so ashamed, I'd put my head in my desk and cry''.
That changed after he was told that he had ADHD and was treated with medication.
``I have a whole new world,'' he said.
``I'm excited about life.''
BERNE, N.Y.
(AP) - Kyle Carroll was past his twos and still not talking.
Or rather, he was speaking, but in a language that seemed all his own.
It was the first hint Jill and Michael Carroll had that something was different about their son.
In kindergarten, it became clear Kyle wasn't about to focus in the classroom.
A pediatrician diagnosed Kyle with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and prescribed a trial run of Ritalin.
That trial has lasted three years now, in the Carroll's view long enough.
But at the end of a torturous yearlong battle with the Berne-Knox-Westerlo school district, they learned they don't have the choice of stopping it, despite their arguments the drug is wiping out sectors of their son's personality and turning him into a sickly, staring, insomniac.
Under a consent order signed by Albany County Family Court Judge Gerald Maney in May, the couple must continue administering medications prescribed by a physician meeting court approval.
That means unless they find a doctor who recommends taking their child off medication, and they haven't yet, they must continue giving Kyle Ritalin or risk losing him on grounds of neglect.
What makes the order landmark is that Ritalin is a different kind of medicine, part of an emerging class of pills that treat behavior rather than disease.
The Carroll's case is believed to be the first in which the state has mandated a chemical change in personality in a child who's not deemed homicidal or suicidal.
It raises a national question - whose decision is it to administer behavior-modifying drugs?
To Dr.
Peter Breggin, consultant in a class-action suit accusing the American Psychiatric Association (APA) of conspiring with Novartis (the pharmaceutical company that makes Ritalin) to sell as much of the drug as possible - the ruling speaks of the loss of the most basic of constitutional rights, of mind control, of Big Brother.
Only now, he says, Big Brother is Big Business.
And by introducing youths to the notion there are biological defects in their brains and capitalizing on the idea of a quick-fix cure, Breggin says, the drug companies are no better than the cigarette manufacturers now paying out millions for encouraging addiction to their product.
On the flip side is the possibility raised by Ritalin's many defendants - that millions of children are part of the first generation of humans to have a medicine that allows them to focus and succeed, both in the classroom and the schoolyard, the microcosms of the professional world and society.
Stimulant medications can then seem as progressive as insulin or penicillin.
Yet even the staunchest proponents of stimulant medications such as Ritalin, the APA is one proponent, express surprise at Maney's ruling.
''It's an unusual case up there,'' said Dr.
Richard Harding, professor of clinical sociology and pediatrics at the University of South Carolina and president-elect of the APA.
Ideally, Harding said, the decision will be made jointly between parents and doctors, never forced.
Breggin, author of several books on the subject, crusades against psychotropic drugs as a whole, and calls Attention Deficit Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ''a fabrication''.
''The diagnosis is if the kid squirms in his chair, interrupts, is sloppy - a list of things that annoy teachers and make it hard to teach,'' he said.
There's no real diagnostic evidence of ADD, he says, none of the different colored brain clusters one sees in cases of Alzheimer's Disease or strokes.
Jeffrey Schaler, a psychologist who teaches at American University's School of Public Affairs, agrees.
''There's no deficiency that Ritalin is fixing,'' he says, ''what it's doing is changing a behavior so the child complies with expectations and behaviors expected of him.
You drug the child and get him to comply by drugging''.
Albany County Family Court, Schaler says, has invaded the Carroll's privacy.
Beyond that, he sees the decision as a fearsome precedent, an entry into a new gray area socially, with consequences no one can even guess at.
''Psychologists and psychiatrists are going back over history saying just about every great person, every person who had some great contribution to society had some sort of mental problem.
If you gave all those people drugs would that have stopped''?
Shaler asks.
Schaler, however, thinks it's wrong to blame the companies, who are simply making a product, rather than the mindset of ''thou shalt not have any difficulty in your life''.
''The bottom line is studying's hard work,'' he says.
''The bottom line is you just have to focus and discipline yourself''.
It's an argument Jordan Lippman, a 22-year-old student at Union College in Schenectady, has grown tired of.
Until 11th grade, when he was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADD and prescribed a cocktail of the stimulant Adderall and the anti-depressant Welbutrin, Lippman was miserable.
''I always knew I was different because I was always in detention for forgetting my pens, forgetting my assignments,'' he says.
''I knew I was intelligent, yet it didn't correspond to anything.
I knew the material but I couldn't make it translate into anything like good grades''.
Lippman's parents were well-off enough to send him to a private high school near their home in Tenafly, N.J., where he received plenty of one-on-one attention.
On the strength of a personal interview and an award-winning senior year project on Attention Deficit Disorder (the success he says started his momentum), he was accepted to Union College, a highly selective private college in Schenectady.
When a test was pulled away from him before he could finish it, Lippman realized he wasn't cutting it.
He has since built a support group for students with ADD and ADHD, and lobbied deans and the college president.
In effect, he has changed the campus climate for those with ADD.
His peers have been the hardest to convince.
In a written debate with Lippman that played out in the campus newspaper, Concordiensis, a former suite mate wrote ''one of the aspects of Union that makes it a desirable college, is that not everyone can attend here.
If a student cannot keep up with his or her peers in the classroom, perhaps Union is not the ideal college for him or her''.
Lippman replied in part, ''you know that I work just as hard, and three to four times as long as most other students here at Union.
My strengths are abstract verbal reasoning, but it is extremely difficult for me to do the initial processing of written language''.
He says ADD is misnamed because it's not an attention disorder but rather a control disorder, in which the part of the brain that organizes and plans isn't working.
He says his medication combined with self-awareness and awareness on the part of the college has helped him succeed.
Lippman is now completing an internship with the New York City-based International Dyslexic Association, boasting a 3.676 finish for the last term, and meeting with editors from the Princeton Review to modify listings of services for the disabled listed by colleges.
He's impressed faculty and developed mentors, including Dr.
Rudy Nydegger, a clinical psychologist who teaches management and psychology at the college.
In his own practice, Nydegger advocates a therapy that frequently includes writing prescriptions for stimulant medications.
''I don't look at solving problems by throwing drugs at them, but if we can get those kids calmed down and focused then we can help them learn techniques for managing their behavior,'' he says.
And he for one is convinced ADD and ADHD have long existed.
''We called it other things,'' he says.
''We called kids stupid, underachievers''.

The Clinton administration vows to tackle a question that's been on the minds of physicians for a while: is America overmedicating its children with psychiatric drugs?
Sparked by an alarming increase in the use of such drugs as Ritalin and Prozac among preschoolers and other youngsters, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton says $5 million will be spent at the National Institute of Mental Health to study the impact of psychiatric drugs on children younger than 7 years old.
In addition, the US Food and Drug Administration will start a process to improve the labeling of some of these drugs.
Last month a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found a steep rise in the number of children receiving prescriptions for psychiatric drugs, such as a 200 percent increase of the number of pre-schoolers on antidepressants between 1991 and 1995.
And the number of children younger than 5 taking clonidine, used for treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or those exhibiting disruptive behavior, increased 28-fold.
While Boston-area psychiatrists were encouraged by the extra spending on more studies, some cautioned not to bash psychiatrists for overmedicating young children and said that when used properly, the drugs help.
While there are instances when mistakes are made, ``many children are dramatically helped by treatment with medications not technically approved or labeled in their age group,'' said Dr.
Joseph Gold, who is the clinical director of child and adolescent psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.
``That's not just Ritalin.
It's almost across the board in child psychiatry,'' said Gold.
``The urgency of providing relief for an individual child can be great, for the child and the family, and can't wait years for it to be studied,'' said Gold.
Gold said that part of the difficulty of diagnosis of a psychiatric disease, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is that there are other kinds of problems that cause children to have problems sitting still or to concentrate, such as environmental exposure to lead, stressful household situations and in most extreme case, response to abuse.
Severe marital stress or financial stress in the household can affect the child, and other psychiatric problems can overlap or mimic ADHD, such as severe anxiety.
``One of the key questions in the evaluation is has the child always had difficulty sitting still, sustaining attention to a task, or is this something new,'' said Gold, who added that often behavioral and other educational help is tried first before approaching medication.
But Joni Ketter, of the American Federation of Teachers, said that many school nurses have told her that they are surprised at the large number of children taking the medications.
Ketter said she spoke to one elementary school nurse from Philadelphia who reported administering Ritalin to 44 students each day.
``Teachers and nurses are concerned about the use of the drugs,'' said Ketter.
Dr. Edward Hallowell, a child psychiatrist, said the funding dedicated to looking at young children is good.
``We know a lot more about the brain in the last 10 years and have developed wonderful new medications, but the bad news is that there's not been nearly enough funding and research in children,'' said Hallowell.
``One of the big problems is that we don't have data''.
While psychiatrists said that there are cases of overmedication and undermedication, part of the problem is that psychiatric disorders are diagnosed clinically, which means that decisions are based on the history of clinical signs and symptoms.
No simple diagnostic blood test tells doctors or parents that their children may have a serious psychiatric disorder.
Another issue is insurance, and its tendency to pay for medications instead of therapy or time spent with a patient.
``If someone is expected to see more patients then the tendency is to give medications, hoping that it will provide a quick answer, instead of giving something comprehensive''.
Any physician can prescribe psychiatric drugs, not just psychiatrists.
``We have a number of very effective treatment regimens for childhood problems that do not involve medications that insurance won't pay for,'' said Hallowell.
Brain scans have identified a clear-cut chemical abnormality in people with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, a problem that makes life difficult for an estimated 3 to 5 percent of US schoolchildren, scientists say..
It could be a first step toward a long-sought objective test for ADHD, say researchers at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital.
Such a test would go far to resolve a continuing and intense dispute about whether stimulant medications like Ritalin are being overprescribed as a treatment for ADHD.
In addition, it could reveal whether there are different forms of ADHD that respond better or worse to specific drugs.
``It is an interesting, promising, beginning,'' said Dr.
Edward Hallowell, a psychiatrist and author of ``Driven to Distraction,'' a book about ADHD.
He was not involved in the study.
A test would be welcome, he said, ``because now it's based on the person's history and psychological testing, so there's an element of ambiguity'' about the diagnosis.
People with ADHD tend to be overly active, distractible, unfocused, and impulsive, and as a result have a difficult time in school, social life and careers.
Previously suspected causes such as family surroundings, diet and allergies have largely been discarded as mounting evidence implicates brain abnormalities probably due to altered genes, said Russell A.
Barkley, an ADHD researcher in the psychology and psychiatry departments of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.
The brain scanning experiment found a chemical imbalance, which had been previously suspected, in a part of the brain that uses the nerve messenger dopamine.
Dopamine helps regulate attention and inhibits impulsive behavior.
Six adult patients who had been diagnosed with ADHD with standard tests had on average 70 percent more of a protein called the dopamine transporter than did a group of 30 normal volunteers, said the researchers.
``I think it's very exciting,'' said Dr.
Thomas Spencer, an MGH researcher and an author of the study.
``It was stunning that a problem in their brain corresponded to their symptoms'' in all six ADHD patients.
A report on the study will be published Saturday as a letter in the British journal Lancet.
In the brief article, the Massachusetts researchers described injecting patients with a radioactively tagged chemical agent called Altropane, which accumulated in dramatically higher levels in a particular part of the dopamine system in the brains of the ADHD patients.
The disorder varies a great deal among people, so the new method will have to prove itself able to diagnose a wide range of ADHD types, and also needs confirmation in children, the researchers cautioned.
``This is certainly not yet a diagnostic test'' because it involved a ``very refined sample'' of ADHD patients who aren't representative of the entire spectrum of those who have it, said Barkley.
But if confirmed, he added, the test could help answer skeptics who question whether ADHD is a real disorder, and not just a poorly defined label placed on very active, normally rebellious chldren.
Barkley noted, though, that gene tests for ADHD may arrive at the same time or even more quickly than the scanning test.
Part of the research being described in the Lancet report was supported by Boston Life Sciences, Inc.
, which says it intends to develop Altropane as an ADHD test.
It has already made a test using Altropane to detect early signs of Parkinson disease, the degenerative brain disorder caused by a loss of dopamine-containing nerve cells that leads to movement and gait disabilities.
Altropane, said Dr.
Alan J.
Fischman, an MGH nuclear medicine specialist and senior author of the study, is a synthetic analogue of cocaine.
Its molecules bind very tightly to molecules in the brain known as dopamine transporters, which regulate the amount of dopamine in certain parts of the brain.
(People injected with Altropane for the imaging tests don't feel any cocaine-like effects because the amount is so small, Fischman said).
Altropane was designed by Bertha K.
Madras of Harvard's New England Regional Primate Center in Southboro, Mass.
, who first had the idea of measuring the dopamine transporter in Parkinson disease and ADHD.
``The idea came from a study I had done in the 1980s showing that Ritalin targets the dopamine transporter'' and binds to it tightly, said Madras.
She suggested that the dopamine transporter might be a key player in ADHD, and if so, measuring the amount of the molecules could serve as a test.
After showing that Altropane homed in on different dopamine structures in Parkinson disease and was developed as a test for it, the researchers, in an alliance with Boston Life Sciences, turned to ADHD.
The experimental test required the volunteers to have Altropane injected intravenously.
As it flowed through the brain, Altropane accumulated in the dopamine transporter molecules of the patients with ADHD and the difference between them and the normal patients was detected with an instrument known as a SPECT scanner.
It took 30 to 45 minutes for the instrument to make the measurement.
The researchers are in the process of designing larger studies, probably involving hundreds of patients, to determine how reliable and accurate the method will prove to be.
Testing the Altropane technique on children can come only after ethics review boards are convinced that it is safe, said the scientists.
CHICAGO (AP) -- Its street names include ''Vitamin R'' and ''R-Ball,'' and federal drug enforcers list it among the ADHD.
Authorities fear Ritalin is becoming increasingly popular as a recreational drug among teens and pre-teens.
''It's an area of concern,'' said Rogene Waite, a spokeswoman for the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration.
''It has the potential for abuse, so we would be looking at that and we'll continue to monitor it''.
Some psychiatrists point out that there are no definitive studies on the extent of any abuse and that Ritalin is milder than other stimulants.
Even so, the DEA lists Ritalin, also known as methylphenidate or MPH, as one the agency's ''drugs of concern''.
''A significant amount of data from school surveys, emergency room reports, poison control centers, adolescent drug treatment and law enforcement encounters all indicate a growing problem with the abuse of MPH among school children,'' Gretchen Feussner, a DEA pharmacologist, wrote in a recent report.
Administrators at Lake Zurich Middle School North had heard about Ritalin abuse in the community for almost three years, Principal Philip Zarob said.
But they did not know of abuse within the school until a teacher spotted two students passing something in a restroom last month.
Since then, 15 students have been suspended.
The case is not uncommon, according to the DEA.
The agency cited a 1997 Indiana University survey of 44,232 students that included a question about the non-medical use of Ritalin.
Nearly 7 percent of high school students surveyed reported using Ritalin recreationally at least once in the previous year, and 2.5 percent reported using it monthly or more often.
The DEA also counted nearly 2,000 cases of methylphenidate theft from January 1990 to May 1995 -- ranking the drug among the top 10 controlled pharmaceuticals most frequently reported stolen.
In addition, emergency room admissions studied by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found that in 1995 and 1996, patients ages 10 to 14 were just as likely to mention methylphenidate as cocaine in a drug-related emergency room episode.
Nearly 75 percent said they had been using the drug for psychic effects or recreation.
Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.
, the maker of Ritalin, said in a statement that millions of ADHD patients have been treated safely using the drug.

As a very young child, Alex Fenyn, now 7, exasperated his parents and teachers and intimidated peers with his hyperactive and aggressive behavior.
He was extremely cranky as an infant and had a bloodcurdling scream that made him sound like he was being tortured, says his mother, Tracy McNair, 42, a consultant from New York City.
His parents even gave him the nickname ``Mr.
Intensity''. In preschool and kindergarten, he was impulsive and unable to sit down.
Because Alex's classmates found his behavior so frightening, he was usually left to play by himself.
The turning point in Alex's life came at age 5, with a clinical diagnosis of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and a prescription for Ritalin, which his mother describes as a ``miracle drug''.
``The effect was immediate,'' she says.
``He had less trouble going from one activity to the next and would negotiate for a toy instead of grabbing it.
After three weeks, his classmates started to warm up to him, which is what I was hoping for.
I wanted him to gain some self-esteem''.
In what many see as a kind of vast, national experiment, millions of children in the United States are taking drugs prescribed by doctors to help manage mental and emotional health problems at ever-younger ages.
And the number of kids on medication is rising.
A study by Dr.
Julie Magno Zito at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy in Baltimore found that as many as 1.5 percent of American children between the ages of 2 and 4 are taking stimulants such as Ritalin, as well as antidepressants and antipsychotics.
According to Zito's findings, stimulant use in this age group (Ritalin in 90 percent of the cases) rose two- to threefold from 1991 to 1995, while the rate of antidepressant prescriptions nearly doubled during the same time period.
As more and more kids begin taking medications for psychiatric problems, the lack of safety data is becoming an urgent problem, especially in younger age groups, says Dr.
Harold S.
Koplewicz, vice chairman of the department of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine in New York City.
``We have a critical need to conduct further studies of the long-term safety of these medications in children,'' he says.
Dr. Jerry Rushton, a pediatrician at the University of Michigan School of Medicine in Ann Arbor, says that clinicians simply know more about childhood mental illnesses now than they did in the past _ and with this knowledge has come a rise in the number of diagnoses and prescriptions.
According to Rushton, heightened awareness among clinicians stems in part from mental health research conducted during the 1990s, which provided evidence that identifiable, biologically-based mental illnesses, such as depression, can occur in children as young as 2 or 3 years old.
Another factor underlying the rise in prescriptions, says Rushton, is the emergence of a new class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil, which have fewer, less serious side effects than the previous generation of antidepressants.
They have been increasingly prescribed over the last decade by pediatricians for treating depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety in children.
Does the rising use of medications indicate that rates of mental illnesses are actually increasing among children?
``For over a decade there have been observations among teachers and pediatricians of increasing behavioral disturbances in children,'' says Dr.
Barry Zuckerman, chairman of the department of pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine.
``We don't know if it has to do with changing communities, family structure, TV video games or anything else, but there is a perception that behavioral disturbances are on the rise''.
A case in point is ADHD, which has become increasingly common in the years since it was first described by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980.
In 1987, the APA redefined the criteria for diagnosing ADHD to include individuals with either hyperactivity or impulsive behavior, and not necessarily both, as was previously the case.
The result was a skyrocketing increase in the number of ADHD diagnoses.
Figures released by the APA in May indicate that anywhere from 4 percent to 12 percent of all American children _ some 2.5 million _ are now thought to have the disorder, making it the most common pediatric mental illness in the United States.
And according to Zito, the dramatic rise in prescriptions for Ritalin can be linked directly to the increased national caseload of pediatric ADHD.
Parents who consult a professional about their child's behavior will likely confront a managed care system widely viewed by clinicians and patients as inadequate or unresponsive where mental health coverage is concerned.
``There is no doubt that when it comes to mental illness, managed care interferes with diagnosis,'' says Dr.
Alan Wachtel, a clinical associate professor at New York University Medical Center in New York City and author of ``The Attention Deficit Disorder Answer Book''.
Many insurance companies restrict access to psychiatric specialists, limit the number of visits for psychotherapy and encourage primary care physicians to prescribe medications rather than to try longer-term psychosocial interventions.
And, according to Koplewicz, most children are evaluated for mental illness not by child psychiatrists, but by pediatricians, many of whom have little training in mental health.
By refusing to cover the cost of psychiatric referrals, managed care companies are limiting the resources available to pediatricians, he says, which may add pressure to reach for the prescription pad.
Experts, including Koplewicz, say that children with mental illness who don't get treatment are likely to suffer from negative self-esteem and poor relationships with others, and are at a much higher risk of delinquency, occupational problems and suicide later on in life.
If you are worried that your pediatrician cannot devote the time needed to conduct a comprehensive mental health evaluation because of an overwhelming schedule, ask for a recommendation to a qualified expert who can conduct a thorough assessment, which should include in-depth interviews with the child, parents and teachers, and a review of school records and family history.
Unfortunately, many pediatricians feel pressure to prescribe medications for mental and emotional health problems simply as a way to do something for a child in light of the limitations managed care places on physicians, says Dr.
Peter Jensen, the director of the Center for the Advancement of Children's Mental Health at the Columbia University School of Medicine in New York City.
But, he says, the decision to medicate should be based on the severity of the child's illness as determined by a comprehensive evaluation that takes into account the age and developmental maturity of the child.
In one of the largest studies of its kind ever conducted, a team of researchers at six sites around the country, led by Jensen, followed 579 children with ADHD for 14 months to assess their progress with various forms of treatment.
The researchers found that medication was substantially more effective than behavior-modification therapy in treating children with ADHD alone.
In cases where children had problems in addition to ADHD, such as depression or anxiety, combining medication with behavior therapy provided an advantage.
Medical knowledge surrounding the most effective treatment of mental illnesses in children is still evolving.
Because so few of these studies have been completed, a consensus among experts on the benefits of medication over psychosocial approaches has yet to emerge.
Ultimately, parents need to discuss all the available treatment options with their pediatrician so they can make an informed decision about what will be best for their child, says Koplewicz.
After the evaluation, he says, ``the critical thing is that you as a parent understand the diagnosis, as well as the benefits and risks of each treatment option under consideration''.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Trade Commission charged a New York company Wednesday with making unsubstantiated claims that its dietary supplement can treat children with attention disorders.
Natural Organics Inc.
, of Melville, N.Y., claims in advertising that its Pedi-Active A.D.D. supplement can alleviate symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and improve the attention span of children who have difficulty focusing on schoolwork, the FTC said in a statement.
''ADHD is a serious condition, and parents who are concerned about it should talk to their children's doctors about appropriate treatment,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection.
She asserted that the company's ads prey on parents seeking alternative treatments.
Physician-prescribed stimulants and behavior therapy are the most common treatment for ADHD, which affects up to 2.5 million school-age children in the United States.
Natural Organics did not immediately return calls seeking comment.
The company, which does business as ''Nature's Plus,'' markets and sells a variety of dietary supplements through independent retail stores.
Sixty tablets of Pedi-Active A.D.D. sell for $12.56.
This is the FTC's fifth action involving products marketed to treat ADHD.
While the commission's complaint begins a legal process seeking to stop future unsupported claims, it doesn't mean any laws have been broken.

NEWARK, N.J.
(AP) - Two lawsuits filed this week accuse the makers of the drug Ritalin and the American Psychiatric Association of encouraging overdiagnosis of behavioral disorders in children to boost sales of the drug.
Novartis Pharmaceutical Corp.
and the American Psychiatric Association promoted the belief that a large number of children need to take Ritalin for attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the lawsuits filed in New Jersey and California allege.
A similar suit against the East Hanover, N.J.-based maker of the drug and the American Psychiatric Association was filed earlier this year in Texas.
The latest suits were filed Wednesday in state Superior Court in Hackensack and in San Diego federal court by some of the same attorneys who filed huge lawsuits against gun makers and the tobacco industry.
Novartis and Ciba-Geigy Corp.
, which produced Ritalin before it merged to form Novartis in 1996, also donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to an organization of members with attention deficit or hyperactivity disorder, the lawsuits say.
And the companies and the American Psychiatric Association worked together to include the diagnosis of the two disorders and list it in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1980, creating a huge market for the drug, the lawsuits say.
The companies released misleading sales literature about Ritalin's effectiveness, ''without ever advising...
that Ritalin usage would not stimulate or improve academic performance and/or have any long-term effect on the symptoms associated with ADD or and/or ADHD,'' the California lawsuit says.
Novartis released a statement Friday calling the charges ''unfounded and preposterous'' and noted that attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder has been recognized by medical experts worldwide.
The American Psychiatric Association also denied the allegations.
''The APA will defend itself vigorously by presenting a mountain of scientific evidence to refute these meritless allegations and we are confident that we will prevail,'' the association said in a statement.
Between 4 percent and 12 percent of school-age children - about 3 million, mostly boys - are believed to have attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
The symptoms of short attention span, impulsive behavior and difficulty sitting still are also associated with youthful rambunctiousness, which has raised questions of whether youngsters are being overmedicated.
Congressional hearings recently examined whether Ritalin, a brand name for the stimulant methylphenidate, is overprescribed for the disorders.
The American Academy of Pediatrics issued its first guidelines earlier this year for diagnosing the disorders, stating that a child must show symptoms in two settings for at least six months.
The lawsuits, filed on behalf of boys who took the drug in both New Jersey and California, say that Ciba-Geigy Corp.
began a conspiracy to boost the Ritalin market in the mid-1950s, leading to the creation of the ADD diagnosis in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual.
In 1987, the diagnosis was expanded to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
The lawsuits say that the drug's makers gave $748,000 to the California advocacy group Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder between 1991 and 1994 to help promote Ritalin sales .
NORFOLK, Va.
(AP) -- Doctors may be overdiagnosing some groups of children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder and overprescribing drugs to treat the condition, according to a new study published Wednesday.
Researchers examined about 30,000 grade-school children in two districts in southeastern Virginia and found that pupils took drugs for ADHD in school at two to three times the expected rate, according to the study in the American Journal of Public Health.
ADHD is characterized by impulsive behavior and difficulty in paying attention and keeping still.
About 90 percent of patients take Ritalin, a mild central nervous system stimulant believed to calm hyperactivity by helping the brain disregard distracting stimuli.
ADHD has been estimated to affect 3 percent to 5 percent of school-age children nationwide, with less than 3 percent actually receiving medication, said Gretchen LeFever, a pediatric psychologist and lead author of the study.
By comparison, her research found that 8 percent to 10 percent of children in second through fifth grades routinely took ADHD medication in school during the 1995-96 school year.
``It's hard to believe this many children have the specific brain-related problem called ADHD,'' said Ms.
LeFever, assistant professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the Center for Pediatric Research.
The center is a joint program of Eastern Virginia Medical School and Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters.
Ms. LeFever said there probably are regions across the country with similar trends, indicating more research is needed.
``That's a very high rate of ADHD, by anyone's estimate,'' said psychologist Nadine M.
Lambert of the University of California at Berkeley, a longtime ADHD researcher who was not involved in the current study.
In the study, researchers reviewed records of pupils enrolled in the second through fifth grades in Portsmouth and Virginia Beach.
They chose those two cities because they were the most diverse in southeastern Virginia, Ms.
LeFever said.
Portsmouth is a small, urban, poor, mostly black district while Virginia Beach is a larger, wealthy and mostly white.
Researchers also found that ADHD medication was used by three times as many boys as girls and twice as many whites as blacks.
Use of the medication increased as children aged.
By the fifth grade, 19 percent to 20 percent of white boys received ADHD drugs.
Dr. Louis H.
McCormick, a faculty member in the family medicine department at Louisiana State University medical school, said the study confirms what he has long suspected in his own 20-year practice, that kids are being overdiagnosed with ADHD.
The problem is that other conditions, such as anxiety or depression, can mimic the symptoms of ADHD, said McCormick, a family doctor in Franklin, La.
, who has given seminars on ADHD.
He also is a member of the American Academy of Family Physicians.
``We don't have a blood test to evaluate ADHD.
ADHD is an educated guess,'' McCormick said.
``... You need better data from all 50 states to really get a handle on the prevalence.''
SAN ANTONIO _ A study directed by a physician at the University of Texas Health Science Center has concluded that a drug called Adderall might be a better choice for some hyperactive children than the more widely prescribed Ritalin.
Most of the children in the study took only a single dose of Adderall daily, and researchers said its overall performance was better than methylphenidate, the generic version of Ritalin.
Dr. Steven Pliszka, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Texas Health Science Center, was the lead investigator in the study published this month in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
Funding for the research came from Shire Richwood Inc.
, a subsidiary of Adderall manufacturer Shire Pharmaceuticals.
An estimated 2 million children in the United States have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is marked by symptoms that include inattention, distractibility and hyperactivity.
Stimulant-based medication long has been the primary treatment for the disorder, and methylphenidate has accounted for 80 percent of the prescriptions written during the past decade.
Adderall, a mixture of two types of amphetamines, initially was developed as a weight loss drug in the 1960s and later fell out of use.
The manufacturer revived it several years ago after tests showed it was effective in treating ADHD.
It has been used largely for children who don't respond to methylphenidate.
Pliszka's study is part of an effort by doctors to compare the two drugs in controlled tests.
``It shows that we can use Adderall first,'' Pliszka said.
``Physicians and families should feel very comfortable about using it.
That's the main finding of this study''.
The study involved 58 children who got Adderall, methylphenidate or a placebo _ a harmless, unmedicated preparation _ for three weeks.
During that time, the children were evaluated periodically by teachers and parents, using a scale that assessed whether their behavior and attention problems were improving.
Pliszka said the research showed both medications were superior to the placebo and that Adderall performed better than methylphenidate.
Seventy percent of the children on Adderall also were able to get by on one dose a day, eliminating the need for midday medication, Pliszka said.
That finding could be an important point for Shire, because new drugs are entering the marketplace that are designed for once-a-day dosing.
Pharmaceutical giant Johnson &AMP; Johnson is seeking federal approval for its new drug, Concerta, which will offer single-dose convenience.
The company expects to begin marketing the drug later this year.
Ritalin is manufactured by CIBA-Geigy Corp.

BERNE, N.Y.
_ Like thousands of children, 7-year-old Kyle Carroll takes Ritalin for a diagnosis of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
And like thousands of parents, Michael and Jill Carroll worry about the drug's side effects, including sleeplessness and loss of appetite.
But they keep their child on the medication, in part because they fear child welfare workers will take him away if they don't.
Earlier this year, administrators from the school district called Albany County Child Protective Services, alleging child abuse when the Carrolls said they wanted to take Kyle off the drug.
As a result, the Carrolls are now on a statewide list of alleged child abusers, and they have been thrust into an Orwellian family court battle to clear their name and to ensure their child isn't removed from their home.
``It's beyond the point of whether he should be on it.
Now it's the point of them telling us what we're going to do,'' said Michael Carroll.
``They're telling me how to raise my child''.
The Carroll's dilemma is not unique.
While there are no reliable statistics on the phenomenon, observers say public schools are increasingly accusing parents of child abuse and neglect if they balk at giving their children medication such as Ritalin, a stimulant being prescribed to an increasing number of students.
According to a recent report from the American Academy of Pediatrics, as many as 3.8 million school children, mostly boys, have ADHD.
The disorder is characterized by a short attention span, jumpiness and impulsive behavior.
But many cases are misdiagnosed, the study found.
Additionally, at least a million children take Ritalin and the use of the drug has risen many times more during the past few years.
Along with that increase, schools are using some heavy-handed tactics on parents who may balk at the medication.
``The schools are now using child protective services to enforce their own desires and their own policies,'' said David Lansner, a New York City lawyer who has seen cases similar to the Carrolls'.
``This thing is so scary,'' remarked Patricia Weathers, of Millbrook, N.Y., a suburb of Poughkeepsie.
Officials at the Millbrook school district called police and child protective services when she took her 9-year-old son, Michael Mozer, off medications earlier this year.
She said a drug cocktail including Ritalin, the anti-depressant Paxil and Dexedrine, a stimulant like Ritalin, caused her boy to hallucinate.
``My son was a guinea pig,'' said Weathers, who now sends the child to a private school.
``This is relatively new but it's happening,'' said Peter Breggin, a Bethesda, Md.
, psychiatrist, of the school districts' legal tactics.
Breggin opposes the use of Ritalin.
Albany's child protective services didn't return phone calls seeking comment.
``We feel we are unable to give our side of the story due to confidentiality,'' said Steven Schrade, the school district superintendent here.
Schrade noted that schools do not prescribe medication such as Ritalin.
Any drug prescription has to come from a physician, although school nurses can administer the drug and school officials can recommend it.
Kyle Carroll started taking Ritalin last year, after he fell behind in his schoolwork.
Teachers drew up an Individualized Education Plan, a standard course of action for children with special needs, and they started giving him speech therapy and extra reading help.
He also went to summer school.
But last fall, when Kyle started second grade, the Ritalin and extra help didn't seem to do much good.
The Carrolls grew concerned when Kyle was only sleeping about five hours a night and eating just one meal a day.
So they told school officials they wanted to take Kyle off Ritalin for two weeks to see if that helped.
That's when they got a call, then a visit, from a Child Protective Services worker.
The visit led to a family court appearance in April, which was continued to later this month.
The hearing will give the Carrolls a chance to clear their name _ to some extent.
If cleared, their case in the state register of alleged abusers will be sealed, but it could be opened in the future if there are other allegations of abuse.
Jill Carroll is particularly concerned because she's training to become a childcare worker.
Being in the state register could keep her from working in that field.
Moreover, the Carrolls still don't know all the details of the charges against them.
The ``intake report'' on their case states that ``Fa (father) is refusing to give the ch (child) the Ritalin''.
But several lines on the report are blacked out with a marking pen.
It's roughly analogous to a criminal facing charges but not being told what they are.
Complaints to Child Protective Services are also anonymous, so suspects don't know who has leveled the charges.
In this case, however, the Carrolls say they were told that a school guidance counselor made the complaint.
Michael Carroll noted this wasn't his first brush with Child Protective Services.
Last year, he said, a social worker checked on an anonymous rumor that he had gotten drunk and struck family members, but the allegations turned out to be groundless.
No charges were filed, and the Carrolls were not ``indicated,'' or written up in the state register like they were for the Ritalin episode.
Since meeting with the services' workers this year, the Carrolls have taken their boy to another pediatrician for a second opinion.
The doctor recommended staying with the Ritalin, and the Carrolls have reluctantly agreed.
``He's in school.
He's on the Ritalin.
He dislikes school very much,'' Michael Carroll said.
PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A new computer virus can allow documents to be e-mailed to other people without warning, a potential security breach that should worry businesses and governments, an expert at Carnegie Mellon University said Saturday.
The ``Melissa macro'' or W97M--Melissa virus spreads via infected e-mail and attacks computers loaded with Microsoft's widely used Word 97 or Word 2000 programs, according to CERT -- or Computer Emergency Response Team -- Carnegie Mellon's Department of Defense-funded computer security team.
CERT first heard of the virus Friday afternoon and its members worked through the night to analyze the virus and develop a fix, CERT manager Katherine Fithen said.
``We're getting so many reports from across the world, that we know this is going to be a huge problem come Monday,'' Fithen said.
She noted that since CERT was founded 10 years ago, this is only the second time it has considered a virus important enough to warrant a public announcement.
The first, in 1994, warned of a virus that allowed computer burglars to collect passwords.
CERT has not determined where the Melissa virus originated.
Fithen said she is not allowed to say whether any governmental agency has suffered a security breach as the result of Melissa.
Microsoft spokesman Adam Sohn said company programmers worked with CERT and manufacturers of anti-virus programs to develop an antidote.
If a computer user opens an infected Word-format document, the virus propagates itself by reading the user's e-mail address book and sending an infected message to the first 50 entries, CERT said.
The message can include the contents of any Word document that is open on the computer, Fithen said.
Also, the virus reproduces and sends so much unwanted e-mail that the volume can overload some mail servers, the computers that distribute e-mail.
However, it apparently causes no direct damage to a computer's memory or programs.
Infected documents are sent as attachments to e-mails most frequently bearing a header: ``Subject: Important Message From'' the name of person whose computer relayed the virus.
The body of the message says ``Here is that document you asked for...
don't show it to anyone else ;-)''.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A former computer engineering student was identified by his college today as the author of the Chernobyl virus -- the menace that caused hundreds of thousands of computer meltdowns around the world this week.
The Tatung Institute of Technology had punished Chen Ing-hau last April when the virus he wrote as a student began to cause damage in an inter-college data system, according to Lee Chee-chen, the institute's dean of student affairs.
Chen, who was a senior at the time, was given a demerit but not expelled.
The Chernobyl virus is known in Taiwan as the CIH, using Chen's initials.
The college did not mete out a more severe punishment because Chen had warned fellow students not to spread the virus, Lee said.
Chen did not come up with an anti-virus program, Lee said.
Lee said he was not sure how the virus ended up causing so much destruction a year later.
Chen graduated from the college last summer and now is serving Taiwan's two-year compulsory military service, Lee said.
Officials of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation said they would seek permission to question Chen.
The unusually destructive virus -- timed to strike on April 26, the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster -- tries to erase a computer's hard drive and write gibberish into its system settings to prevent the machine from being restarted.
Turkey and South Korea each reported 300,000 computers damaged Monday, and there were more elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East.
Fewer than 10,000 of the 50 million computers in the United States were affected.
JOHANNESBURG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The highly destructive Hare KRSNA computer virus is poised to strike on August 22, said sources obtained here today.
According to South Africa's Computer Virus Helpline Co-ordinator Ian Melamed, Hare KRSNA is at present the most widely reported computer virus in the country and could wipe out all information stored on the hard drives of infected computers on that date.
The European Institute for Computer Anti-Virus has warned earlier that the virus was spreading world-wide through the internet.
The warning also mentioned specifically infected files on the Internet News Groups Alt.Sex.
Technically, the Hare KRSNA Virus is a multi-partite, stealth, slow polymorphic virus which makes it particularly destructive, according to experts.
The helpline is offering a free, 24-hour advisory service countrywide for the detection and removal programme of the virus, the local sources said.
The disk from the helpline would detect and remove more than 9400 other computer viruses.
NEW YORK (AP) -- Several mutations of the fast-moving computer virus called Melissa surfaced in cyberspace Tuesday, but researchers said none seems to be as effective as the original in clogging e-mail systems.
Separately, an executive of a small software company in Cambridge, Mass.
, said he had found clues linking the virus to a still-unidentified writer who uses the computer handle ``VicodinES''.
Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software, a firm that makes operating systems and software tools, said he thinks the virus writer distributed it using an account stolen from America Online 15 months ago.
Melissa showed up Friday and spread rapidly around the world on Monday like a malicious chain letter, causing affected computers to fire off dozens of infected messages to friends and colleagues and swamping e-mail systems.
While there have been no reports of permanent damage from the virus, it disrupted the operations of thousands of companies and government agencies whose employees were temporarily unable to communicate by e-mail.
The virus arrives to its victims disguised as an e-mail from a friend, with a note in the subject line saying that an important document is attached.
The attachment is a document in Microsoft's Word format that lists Internet pornography sites.
Once the user opens that file, the virus digs into the user's address book and sends infected documents to the first 50 addresses.
One of the variations that appeared Tuesday -- carrying the name Melissa.A -- leaves the subject line blank, a change that can foil electronic filters that are designed to detect and delete the original message, said Dan Schrader, director of product marketing for Trend Micro Inc.
, an anti-virus company in Cupertino, Calif.
Another variant, ``Papa,'' appeared Monday afternoon.
It attaches a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet document which, when opened, sends out 60 e-mails, however Papa has bugs that sometimes prevent it from working.
``From our analysis we don't feel it's anywhere near the threat that Melissa is,'' said Steve Trilling, a director of research at Symantec, a maker of virus detection software.
A third virus, called ``Mad Cow Joke'' has also appeared, Schrader said, and works like Melissa, sending itself to 20 people in the victim's e-mail address book.
The danger of all the variants is that virus writers will find them on the Internet, correct the bugs and distribute them further.
Smith, the amateur cybersleuth who has apparently gotten close to finding the author, is the same man who a month ago revealed that the popular Microsoft Office software applications place a secret serial number in documents that can be used to identify a particular computer user.
Smith theorized that this ``digital fingerprint'' might be useful in finding the author of the virus.
Smith posted this theory on an Internet discussion group Friday and received an e-mail from a Stockholm University student, who pointed out similarities between the work of a known virus writer who used the computer name VicodinES and Melissa.
Smith also discovered that in December 1997, the same America Online account that sent out Melissa had posted a similar virus.
Smith found digital fingerprints linking the virus writer called VicodinES to that virus.
He directed reporters to call the owner of the VicodinES Web site, who have since told him they may have actually talked to VicodinES and who described him as a teenage boy.
Smith passed his information onto the FBI, which has declined to comment, although it is investigating the case.
VicodinES also is the name of a narcotic painkiller made by Knoll Laboratories.
At company headquarters in Mount Olive, N.J., spokeswoman Linda Mayer said Tuesday that all she knows about Melissa is what she's read in newspapers.
Melissa is a new and spectacularly promiscuous computer virus, one that has infected tens of thousands of computers worldwide since its discovery less than a week ago.
It has already cost millions of dollars in lost productivity, experts estimate.
And what a bargain it has been, because Melissa is relatively sweet, as viruses go.
The next time around _ and there will be a next time _ a Melissa-type virus could be much more damaging.
Melissa has focused the computing world's attention on the rapidly growing threat of computer viruses in the Internet era and underscored the need of all PC users to take virus protection seriously.
Melissa, as the new viral vixen was named by its creator _ as yet unknown _ combines elements of both a computer virus (spreading from file to file) and a worm program (spreading from computer to computer over a network).
It is only one of several recent viruses designed to prey on an otherwise useful feature of Microsoft Word that enables macro programs _ automated scripts that trigger one or more actions in the host computer _ to be started from within a file.
Melissa is mainly a nuisance.
It will not erase your files, demagnetize the stripes on your credit cards, reset your VCR clock to flash 12:00, remove your mattress tags or hide your car keys.
It is not destructive, except to the extent that it clogs e-mail systems and forces system administrators to spend most of their time cleansing the virus from their computers.
Although relatively benign, easy to detect and simple to disable, at least in its current form, Melissa is alarming to many virus experts because it represents the first worm program to sweep through common desktop computers.
Melissa typically enters a computer hidden in a Microsoft Word 97 or Word 2000 file attached to an electronic mail message.
It can also travel via diskettes and downloaded files, but electronic mail is an exquisitely more efficient carrier, given the millions of e-mail messages that traverse computer networks every day.
This particular worm virus' preferred mode of travel is Microsoft Outlook 98, the part of the popular Office suite that handles electronic messages.
Computers without Outlook 98 can be infected, but they cannot pass along the virus to others except on disk.
If Outlook is installed but is not the user's primary e-mail program, Melissa will try to seduce Outlook into helping it along.
No matter how it arrives, Melissa can infect any computer that uses Microsoft Word, including Macintoshes (but Macs cannot pass it along via Outlook).
Once in the computer it will infect any Word files that the owner opens or creates, and it will rifle through his or her Outlook address book and send a copy of itself, embedded in a Word document, to the first 50 people or groups on the list.
If the victim is unfortunate enough to open or create a sensitive file using Word 97 when Melissa kicks in, it will surreptitiously send that file, infected with the virus, to those 50 addresses.
Each of those who open the document could potentially send it to 50 others, and so on.
The damage is amplified if any of the addresses are to mailing lists, like ``A-team,'' ``book club'' or another list early in the alphabet.
The recipients will receive a message with the subject line ``Important message from (your name)'' and the message ``Here is the document you asked for.
... don't show anyone else ;-)''.
An infected Word file is attached to the message.
The original virus file was called list.doc and was a list of passwords to pornographic Web sites.
As the virus spreads, the file certainly will change.
Keep in mind that computer viruses can mutate quickly and alter their modus operandi.
There is already evidence that Melissa variants are in circulation.
Opening the attachment triggers the virus, unless an updated antivirus program is on guard to stop it.
Dont open it.
And if the program asks whether you want to allow macros to run, just say no.
If Melissa succeeds in infecting the computer, once an hour it can insert a snippet of dialogue from a ``Simpsons'' television episode into any Word 97 document that is open at the time: ``Twenty-two points, plus triple-word-score, plus 50 points for using all my letters.
Game's over.
I'm outta here''.
nn With some simple modification, Melissa could have copied critical data from the victim's computer and sent it to Bulgaria, reformatted the hard disk, changed random zeros to ones in a spreadsheet and perhaps even erased any trace that it had been there.
But it didn't.
Because Melissa is not destructive, there might be a temptation to shrug it off as a transient blip in Internet security.
Instead, it ought to highlight how vulnerable all computers are to viruses as the world's communications and commerce systems become more dependent on the Internet each year.
So the first rule is to install a tough antivirus program.
No computer connected to the Internet should be without one.
An antivirus program is designed to recognize telltale virus signatures and to intercept and destroy the rogue code before it has a chance to infect the computer.
But such programs are useful only on viruses the software has been trained to catch.
When a new virus like Melissa appears, it could slip past any antivirus program that has not been updated to catch it.
The two best antivirus programs I have used are Norton Antivirus 5.0 from the Symantec Corp.
(www.symantec.com) and Virus Scan from the McAfee division of Network Associates (www.nai.com).
Both are about $50 and include a one-year subscription for online updates, and both quickly posted Melissa updates on their sites.
The second rule is to update the software frequently.
New viruses are being created all the time.
Jeffrey Carpenter, team leader at the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) at Carnegie Mellon University, said reports of virus attacks have increased significantly since last August.
Almost all of the major antivirus programs can easily be updated over the Internet, through a relatively quick download that updates the program's database of known virus signatures.
In some cases the user does not have to do anything; the downloads are performed automatically.
Not using this feature in effect defeats the purpose of the software.
The third rule is more Draconian: Never open e-mail attachments or download files unless you are absolutely confident of their contents, even if they are not Word files.
It would be trivial for a malicious programmer to modify Melissa to affect Excel files, for example, and apparently someone has done just that, in a new virus called Papa.
The conventional advice is never to open any attachment sent by a stranger, but with Melissa, and with several other new viruses designed to propagate via e-mail, the files almost always come from acquaintances, even friends.
If you use Word 97, go to the Word toolbar and click Tools, then Options, then General, then make sure there is a check mark in the box labeled ``Macro virus protection''.

It might be a good idea to bookmark them, because Melissa is unlikely to be the last such virus we will see.
``It is by far the most prolific threat I've seen in a long time,'' said Carey Nachenberg, chief researcher at the Symantec Antivirus Research Center in Santa Monica, Calif.
, adding that future virus worms will spread faster as more PC users connect to the Internet through always-connected high-speed phone lines and cable modems.
But he expressed hope that once Melissa's author is identified and tied to the whipping post, others will be deterred from releasing such viruses into the world.
BEIJING, December 7 (Xinhua) -- China's leading anti-virus company, the Rising Computer Technology, warned computer users that a killer virus dubbed "THUS" may attack computer hard drives on December 13.
Liu Xu, an anti-virus expert, suggested computer users delete the virus with anti-virus software before December 13 or change the date.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- A virus that can erase a computer's hard-drive and prevent the equipment from restarting is poised to strike on Monday, but experts say off-the-shelf antivirus software can prevent infection, and several companies are offering free inoculation tools on their Web sites.
The virus has been dubbed Chernobyl because its most common version was programmed to activate on computers using Windows 95 and Windows 98 on Monday, the 13th anniversary of the nuclear disaster in Ukraine.
Another, less common, version, strikes computers on the 26th day of any month.
``It's pretty much just another virus.
It's been around for quite a while,'' said Kathy Fithen, manager of the Computer Emergency Response Team, or CERT, at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
``As long as people stay current with their antivirus software, they should be in good shape''.
The viruses, believed to originate in Taiwan, attempt to erase a computer's hard-drive and write gibberish to the computer's system settings, called its Bios, preventing the machine from being restarted.
But warnings from many experts lacked any sense of panic or impending doom because the virus was discovered last summer, giving antivirus companies many months to develop free software updates to identify and destroy it.
Users of those products will be protected only if they've retrieved the free updates.
Network Associates Inc.
, for example, said its popular McAfee software recognized Chernobyl as early as June 1998, and Symantec Corp.
said its Norton Antivirus program identified Chernobyl before August.
CERT issued a warning this week about the virus because of questions from computer users.
``We're getting requests for information about it rather than reports of machines infected with it,'' Fithen said.
``This has been around so long that the antivirus vendors have picked this up''.
Unlike the recent ``Melissa'' scare, which automatically propagated via e-mail, this virus doesn't spread as quickly because it requires a person to launch an infected program file to contaminate a computer.
Carey Nachenberg, chief researcher at Symantec's Antivirus Research Center, said one big risk stems from a potential infection on a company's computer network, which could then spread to individual computers.
``If it gets on a corporate network and the volumes are not protected, it could spread very, very rapidly,'' Nachenberg said.
Gene Hodges, a vice president for security at Network Associates, said the company was hoping for the best but bracing for the worse.
``It can be fairly significant,'' he said.
``You don't know until the bomb actually goes off.''
BUCHAREST, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Computer network of the Romanian presidential office has been out of gear for two days under the attack of a computer virus, the Romanian Press Agency reported Wednesday.
The presidential office did not specify what kind of computer virus disturbed its daily work.
But the press report said that the virus had entered the network through an E-mail message several days ago and broke out on Monday, December 13.
According to local media, it was on December 13 that a vicious macro-virus named Killer C-Disc THUS broke out.
The virus deletes all the documents that are not in use on C-Disc, and paralyzes the entire window system.
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government asked the congress Tuesday to pass a law that would impose stiff penalties on cyber crimes following a delay in the arrest of the suspected creators of the "love bug" computer virus.
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora underscored this need in a radio interview as he pointed out that the "Iloveyou" virus, which was allegedly launched in the Philippines, caused much damage not just here but around the world.
Zamora quoted reports as saying the computer virus, which was allegedly created by a Philippine couple using Internet access cards,has caused up to 2.6 billion U.S. dollars in damage to computer systems in more than 20 countries in Asia, America and Europe.
"It is clear that the virus caused much damage.
We were not affected that much, but the Philippines was used as the base to launch the virus," said Zamora.
The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has acted swiftly on the case, and with the cooperation of Internet service providers, was able to pinpoint the suspected origin of the virus.
However, the authorities had to dig up a legal basis for the arrest of the suspects and finally came up with the 1988 Access Device Act,which aims to protect consumers from scams involving the use of credit cards or personal identification numbers.
Zamora said it is urgent that the congress comes up with an anti-cyber crime measure to shield the business community from hackers who may attempt to cripple the country's computer systems.
On his part, NBI Director Federico Opinion said it is not clear whether the Philippines will allow foreign governments whose computers were damaged by the virus to pursue civil liabilities against the suspects.
"The crime was committed here.
We have no law for this particular offense.
We have to examine all facts pertaining to the case," he said.
The Philippine couple, Rommel Lamores and Irene de Guzman, who were allegedly responsible for the spread of the virus, have not been charged yet.
The suspects, employees of two separate banks in Manila, were nabbed one after the other in NBI operations Monday.
NEW YORK (AP) -- The close-knit underground of computer virus creators split into two camps at the news that one of their own may have been arrested for releasing malicious Melissa.
``The whole community has really been shaken up by this,'' said B.K.
Delong, who follows the virus scene.
``The first group is one that wants a better reputation.
Then there's the community that wants to retaliate and come up with even more destructive viruses''.
Virus creators gather at the Virus Exchange Underground, a computer chat area where they swap ideas and gossip.
Most are programmers interested in viruses and computer bugs.
They often write viruses and swap them among themselves, Delong said.
They refer to themselves as ``Black Hats,'' interested in doing damage, and ``White Hats,'' often crack programmers looking for possible security hazards.
The Black Hats sometimes release viruses through e-mail or Usenet newsgroups.
In a statement released on behalf of the VX Underground, as it's often called, the group warned the media and investigators not to quickly condemn the author of Melissa.
``Instead they should be more interested in the person who released the bug which caused the spread of the virus,'' said the statement, which was e-mailed to The Associated Press.
Melissa was originally posted on two sex discussion groups a week ago Friday, according to an online search.
The VX Underground said it was highly unlikely those two posts out of thousands could have led to Melissa's vicious cascade.
``However, once released others posted the Melissa source code to additional newsgroups, Web sites and listservs (mailing lists), which meant anyone could turn it into the virus and continue to spread it,'' the statement continued.
David L.
Smith, 30, of Aberdeen, N.J., was arrested Friday and charged with originating the destructive Melissa, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers and swamped hundreds of companies' e-mail systems.
Computer experts used unique identification numbers embedded in Microsoft Word documents to trace Melissa back to a well-known virus writer who calls himself VicodinES.
Rita Malley, spokeswoman for the New Jersey state attorney general's office said Smith was ``definitely not'' the person known by that handle.
Instead, Smith took two viruses, one of which came from VicodinES, and combined them with another virus to create Melissa, she said.
``They (the Black Hat programmers) are looking for someone to blame,'' said Delong.
They resent the treatment VicodinES supposedly received at the hands of the media, and they're rallying around their own.
They said he is a really nice guy.''
NEW YORK (AP) -- The FBI on Friday tried to track the author of a file-destroying computer virus that has hit some of the nation's biggest corporations and infected tens of thousands of machines.
Software companies posted new virus-killing programs on their Web sites to attack the Worm.Explore.Zip virus, which enters machines in almost the same way as the recent Melissa virus -- by disguising itself as a friendly piece of e-mail.
Melissa infected hundreds of thousands of computers, but there were signs Friday that the new virus may not be spreading as quickly.
Still, it hit systems at leading technology companies such as Compaq Computer and Motorola and other major companies, including AT&AMP;T, Boeing and General Electric.
The FBI would not reveal the methods of its investigation or provide a more specific estimate of how many computers were infected.
``This program is deleting files, and for people who did not have back-ups, they could be lost for good,'' said Mark Zajicek, member of the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
First detected in Israel early this week, Worm.Explore.Zip masquerades as a message from a friend or acquaintance: ``Hi (Recipient Name)!
I received your e-mail and I shall send you a reply ASAP.
Till then, take a look at the attached zipped docs''.
The message is harmless unless the recipient opens an attached file.
That unleashes a program that can wipe out the contents of documents, spreadsheets, graphic presentations and other important files created by Microsoft programs.
It also contaminates a computer's e-mail program and sends a copy of itself as a reply to any incoming e-mail.
That is particularly threatening for companies where workers regularly zip e-mails back and forth.
``Once the virus has started within an organization, it embeds itself into the system,'' said Jan Kaminski, president of FastLane Technologies, a Canadian software company.
``There's nothing you can do until you actually remove some files from the machine''.
But, thanks to the run-ins with the Melissa and Chernobyl viruses earlier this spring, computer systems managers reacted more quickly when word of Worm.Explore.Zip began to spread.
``We continue to get direct reports, but they're not increasing at the rate it might have, so we're encouraged by that,'' said Zajicek.
Zajicek warned, however, that computer users still need to be cautious about any e-mail with an attachment.
``It's too early to tell how far it's already spread and difficult to tell how far it will spread in the coming days and weeks,'' he said.
The FBI issued a warning on its Web site.
``Users should exercise caution when reading their e-mail for the next few days and bring unusual messages to the attention of their system administrator,'' said Michael A.
Vatis, director of the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center.
``The transmission of a virus can be a criminal matter, and the FBI is investigating''.
Worm.Explore.Zip is the third major bug to sweep across the Internet since late March, when the Melissa virus overwhelmed systems with floods of e-mail.
A more damaging virus named Chernobyl struck in late April, but did most of its harm overseas.
The new bug is only known to attack computers using Microsoft operating systems Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT.
Rival operating systems such as Macintosh and Unix apparently are not vulnerable.
Early warnings helped AT&AMP;T, Compaq and GE contain the damage Thursday when their computer systems were infected, while Microsoft said it shut down its corporate e-mail system for two hours as a precaution.
At Boeing, the company shut down an e-mail system that links 160,000 computers.
``We're hopeful we got things shut down fast enough so it will minimize the loss of any documents,'' said spokesman Dave Suffia.
At Lucent Technologies, which makes telecommunications equipment, strange messages began appearing on computers on Thursday morning, said spokesman John Skalko, who inadvertently activated Worm.Explore.Zip on his computer.
``That was enough.
I lost all my (Microsoft Word) files,'' said Skalko, estimating that 150 documents were destroyed.
At least 20 to 30 other computers were stricken by the virus before Lucent technicians shut down the e-mail system and inoculated it.
``I think we nipped it in the bud,'' said Skalko.
Because of the way it works, Worm.Explore.Zip actually does not fit the technical definition of a computer virus.
Instead, software experts said, the bug should be classified as a ``Trojan Horse'' -- a name borrowed from an ancient battle in which Greek soldiers hid inside a wooden horse to launch a surprise attack on the city of Troy.
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Computer anti-virus experts in Jerusalem Sunday expressed their suspicion that a new, but even dangerous type of "I Love You" virus may have originated in Israel.
Network Associates, an Israeli hi-tech start-up company, reportedly was hit by the virus on Thursday, which is earlier than any other reports of such virus throughout the world, according to a company spokesman.
Thus, the company had begun its internal investigation to check whether an employee of the company had written the virus code and distributing it, currently known as "NewLove Bug".
The previous "Love Bug" rapidly spread throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States earlier this month, affecting thousands of computers and causing disastrous damages.
The "NewLove Bug", a modified type of "Love Bug", is using the same mechanism to spread itself by sending e-mails to persons in Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express software's address book.
At first look, the only difference appeared that the new bug randomly chose its attachment filename but always has a.vbs extension.
In a more sophisticated examination, however, it is found that the new offshoot of the virus is much more dangerous as it will attaches itself to every file on the victims' computer drivers, while the previous bug reportedly written by a Filipino only attacked selected multimedia files.
The destructive move could be accomplished between 20 seconds to one minute, wiping out all files and only leaving a user with a blank hard disc once attempting to reboot.
Moreover, the new deadly virus will also mutates and adds lines of code to itself upon each infection in order to prevent anti- virus software's detection.
All these characters had made computer security experts put the lethality of such "NewLove Bug" at the dangerous end on the scale of 1 to 10.
In contrast, the original "Love Bug" only ranks at 5 on this scale.
Numerous experts had issued warnings here that anybody should be very watchful when he wants to open an e-mail attachment, especially with a .vbs, .vps, or .vns extension filename.
There were already infection reports in the United States, while U.S. experts had said that the most critical time will be Monday.
Only if the damage does not prove to be too severe by then, could the computer business breathe a sigh of relief .
NEW YORK (AP) -- Proving even more virulent than first believed, the computer virus Worm.Explore.Zip sprang back from a deceptively quiet weekend amid warnings that it uses more than just e-mail trickery to spread.
Computer support lines were inundated Monday with calls about new outbreaks of the file-killing virus, which experts now say was also designed to spread within an organization through computer network links that enable co-workers to share files on each others' machines.
As the epidemic first picked up steam last week, infecting tens of thousands of computers at major corporations, the primary mode of transmission had seemed to be a friendly e-mail that tricks the recipient into opening a contaminated file.
By eliminating the need for a helping human hand, the Worm.Explore.Zip could prove more difficult to irradicate than the Melissa and Chernobyl viruses that struck earlier this spring by e-mail only.
``As time goes on, the programs intruders are using are becoming more complex,'' said Mark Zajicek, a member of the government-chartered Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
Over the weekend, the team found during tests that the virus would reappear seconds after being removed from a computer -- if that machine was linked by a network to another machine that was still infected.
Most major corporations, universities and government agencies link thousands of personal computers in networks, helping people work together, but also making their machines vulnerable to the bug.
``It only takes one opening, one infected computer within a company, to rapidly spread within that company,'' said Zajicek.
``That helps explain what we've been seeing -- that the program wasn't spreading from site to site as quickly as it was within a site''.
The additional mode of contamination may also render some of the cures posted on the Internet by software companies last week less effective, said Zajicek ``Based on the symptoms we've seen in our own test lab, we have seen cases where such fixes would not be effective,'' he said.
Although nervous calls to computer support lines dropped off sharply over the weekend, a support technician for the anti-virus software maker Network Associates said Monday's call volume was even heavier than on Thursday and Friday, with 30 to 40 callers waiting on hold at any one time.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation was trying to track down the author of the virus, but the agency declined to provide any updates on the probe over the weekend.
It took only days earlier this spring for authorities to trace the digital footprints of Melissa and the Chernobyl virus that struck in late April.
Worm.Explore.Zip, first detected in Israel about a week ago, began spreading rapidly on Thursday and Friday, infecting computer systems at many big corporations including AT&AMP;T, Boeing, General Electric and even Microsoft.
On Monday, the crafty bug's victims even included one maker of anti-virus software.
``It happened here to our chief operating officer, who was running anti-virus software, practicing safe computing,'' said Dan Schrader, vice president of new technology at Trend Micro, noting that the executive had forgotten about a single link he'd established months ago to share his files with another worker.
``He went to open a PowerPoint (slide) presentation and it was empty''.
Worm.Explore.Zip targets computers using Microsoft Windows operating systems.
The virus arrives in a person's e-mail box as a timely reply from an acquaintance.
It then invites the recipient to open an attached file that will unleash a two-pronged attack, sending a copy of itself to the address of any arriving e-mail and destroying files stored on a person's machine.
Among the files destroyed are those created by the writing program Microsoft Word, the spreadsheet program Excel and PowerPoint, which is used to create graphic presentations.
Monday's new revelation about the way the bug works also fueled more debate about what terms to use to describe it.
Because of the way it replicates, Worm.Explore.Zip actually does not fit the technical definition of a computer virus.
Based on the e-mail mode of contamination, it best would classified as a ``Trojan Horse'' -- a name borrowed from an ancient battle in which Greek soldiers hid inside a wooden horse to launch a surprise attack on the city of Troy.
But based on the file-sharing method of infection, it would more aptly be described as a ``worm.''
As physicians are wont to tell us when we drag ourselves to the infirmary suffering from something they can't diagnose, there's a nasty bug going around.
It got into my computer's sinus cavities numerous times in the past week or two, and eventually caused me considerable grief.
This particular infection arrives via the Internet in a program called Happy99.exe.
If you spend much time in cyberspace, you've almost certainly heard about it even if you haven't contracted it.
It generally gets into your computer by way of an attachment to an e-mail.
It is not technically a virus, but a worm.
Most of us don't care whether it's a virus or a worm or a garter snake; to non-technical weenies it's basically a problem.
Theoretically at least, it can't hurt you unless you execute it.
If you do execute it, it quietly insinuates itself amongst your Internet programs and attaches itself to every message you send.
You don't know it's doing this, of course.
Happy99 is not, apparently, destructive, but it has certainly created a ruckus on some mailing lists to which I belong.
Folks kept passing it back and forth.
Joe had no sooner got his system free of the thing than Phil sent it to him.
Joe got enraged with Phil, who of course didn't know he had the thing in the first place, let alone had passed it on.
Joe didn't know he had gotten it from Phil until he received an outraged message from Howard.
My mail program, Eudora Pro, downloads attachments into a specified directory automatically.
It got to where I went to that directory immediately after closing Eudora and looked for ol' Happy.
Sometimes I found two or three iterations of it.
I simply deleted them and went on my way.
After a while, though, things got more sinister.
One evening Eudora was downloading a boatload of mail and I was watching the process, slack-jawed and half asleep.
I had barely noticed it was downloading Happy when half my monitor went to black and the rest to a gaudy pinstriped pattern and the entire machine seized up like a rusty engine.
Annoyed, I rebooted, started up Windows Explorer and went to my download directory to find Happy and delete it.
The instant the program scrolled into view, the machine seized up again.
Rebooting again, I tried the Quickfind feature.
No sooner did it find Happy99.exe than the machine froze.
I've never heard of such a thing.
After the next reboot, I turned Norton Antivirus loose on it.
When it found Happy99, it singled the thing out as a virus, but could not repair it.
It was able to delete the thing.
The agony was not over, however.
It seems Eudora, having been abruptly thwarted in its download, decided it hadn't downloaded anything.
It started from the top again, and when it got to that infernal file, it seized up the computer.
Tech support at my ISP, MindSpring, could look into my mailbox, but they couldn't tell which message had Happy attached to it.
Rather than dump the entire box full of mail, the tech rep steered me to http://www.mailstart.com.
If you provide this site your mail address and password, it will go to your mailbox and present you with a list of your mail.
It doesn't download any of it, however, until told to do so.
Thus I was able to poke around and get whatever mail looked like it might be of interest, and then dump the whole lot of it.
If you slog around on the Internet and indulge in e-mail, you might want to make a note of www.mailstart.com.
In the meantime, I'm going to see about updating Eudora.

NEW YORK (AP) -- A computer virus timed to strike Windows PCs on Christmas Day has yet to pose a significant threat because of its low prevalence, but anti-virus software makers are gearing up to help computer users combat it.
The new virus, named W32/Kriz.3862, is designed to damage Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT machines.
The virus overwrites data on hard drives and destroys the memory that stores a computer's setup, sometimes making a computer unbootable.
Only two cases of the virus have been detected ``in the wild'' so far, said Sal Viveros, group marketing manager in the virus defense division of Santa-Clara, Calif.-based Network Associates, maker of the McAfee virus protection software.
Network Associates ranks the virus as a ``medium risk'' because of its low prevalence.
Viveros said Network Associates would upgrade the assessment if more cases of the virus are reported.
The virus contains a profane, anti-religious message, Viveros said Thursday.
``That could be why it may hit on Christmas,'' he said.
Another maker of virus protection software, Central Command Inc.
, said the W32/Kriz virus is more destructive than the Chernobyl virus that recently attacked 300,000 computers in Asia and the Middle East.
That virus did not affect Windows NT machines, used by businesses, as the W32/Kriz virus does.
``This virus contains lethal instructions,'' said Keith Peer, president of Medina, Ohio-based Central Command.
``Unlike the Chernobyl virus, it can infiltrate a business environment''.
Both companies have developed software that detects and disables the virus.
FREEHOLD, N.J.
(AP) -- The man accused of spreading the so-called ``Melissa'' computer virus appeared in court for the first time Thursday, answering the judge's questions with a nod of the head or ``Yes, sir''.
The judge advised David L.
Smith, 30, of the charges against him and informed him of his rights.
``You are charged with some serious offenses,'' Judge John A.
Ricciardi said.
Smith, a former computer programmer, was arrested last week and charged with originating Melissa from his New Jersey apartment.
Authorities say the virus, which clogged e-mail accounts and shut down computer networks worldwide, was named after a topless dancer in Florida.
He is charged with interruption of public communications, conspiracy and theft of computer service.
The maximum penalty for the offense is 40 years in prison.
He remains free on $100,000 bail.
Smith did not answer questions as he entered and left the courthouse.
His lawyer, however, spoke with reporters and questioned whether the virus was as destructive as authorities allege.
``Is this more akin to a graffiti artist or an international cyber terrorist''? said Edward F.
Borden Jr.
``Whoever authored the Melissa virus probably fits the former rather than the latter.''
&QL; We are entering the plague years of computer viruses.
In recent weeks a number of new, malicious and destructive viruses have been detected on the Internet and in the networks of several large organizations.
Last week, the director of the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center, Michael A.
Vatis, said the agency was on alert for a possible flurry of computer attacks, including viruses, timed to coincide with the already difficult year 2000 transition.
``It's natural to expect there might be people doing stupid things with computers,'' Vatis said.
Kathy Fithen, manager of the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University, a project that receives part of its financing from the Department of Defense, said: ``We are anticipating a lot of date-triggered viruses because of Jan.
1. This is really a time to be diligent'' in following standard antivirus procedures, Ms.
Fithen said, ``but it's not a time for panic''.
The team maintains a computer security Web page at www.cert.org/y2kinfo.
Several of the newer threats, including viruses called Prilissa and Mypics, are scheduled to do their nastiest work in coming weeks, in Prilissa's case when someone opens an infected e-mail attachment on Christmas Day, and when Mypics detects the computer's clock changing to 2000.
Other viruses are expected to emerge in coming weeks as their twisted creators try to capitalize on Y2K-related confusion.
Some of these viruses can reformat your hard disk drive, permanently erasing all the files on it.
Some can mail themselves to your friends and associates by commandeering your e-mail address book.
There is even one that can alter your system and notify the hacker via e-mail when your computer is vulnerable to further attacks.
So, it is time for a refresher on viruses and the simple, prudent precautions you can take to minimize the chances of your computer becoming infected.
Although the risk of receiving a virus is relatively small for home computer users, there is a risk.
Viruses are frightening to many novice computer users in part because they are relatively rare and not well understood.
(Viruses are also frightening to many experienced computer users who understand viruses all too well, not because they are particularly dangerous, but rather because they are a major pain to deal with).
There is no need to panic.
There are plenty of unavoidable annoyances that come with computers these days, so it seems a shame to waste more time and energy on viruses and worms, which are so easily avoided.
Here we go.
For people who have no reason to believe their systems have been infected: 1.
Back up (make copies of) all your important files.
2. Get in the habit of making regular backups.
3. Get an anti-virus program and use it.
4. Update the program frequently by downloading new virus signature files from the software maker's Web site.
People who suspect their computer may be infected should start with steps 3 and 4, make sure their systems are virus-free, and then do steps 1 and 2.
In anticipation of a surge in virus hoaxes in coming weeks, many of the world's anti-virus software makers are offering fully functional, 90-day trial versions of their programs, including free updates, until Dec.
31. The Microsoft Corp.
has assembled links to these free programs on a Web page at www.microsoft.com/y2k/antivirus/antivirus.htm.
Many new computers come from the factory loaded with an anti-virus program, so you may not need to buy one.
But whether the program comes already installed or from a store shelf, it should be updated quickly.
In the last month, several significant viruses and worms have been detected for the first time, including Prilissa, Babylonia and Worm.Explore.Zip(pack), alias the MiniZip worm, which is particularly nasty.
Many people install an anti-virus program and assume, erroneously, that they are safe from future infection.
This is like installing smoke detectors in your home and then never changing the batteries.
I use Symantec's Norton Antivirus for both my Windows and Macintosh computers.
(While early disk-based viruses typically targeted one type of computer or another, newer e-mail-based viruses attack different kinds of computers impartially).
Norton Antivirus 2000 version 6.0 for Windows costs $39.95 and the Macintosh version 6.0 is $69.95; they can be downloaded from Symantec's Web site (www.symantec.com).
Another highly regarded anti-virus program for is McAfee's VirusScan 4.0, which costs $29.95 and is available at www.mcafee.com/centers/anti-virus/).
The most prevalent villains on the virus scene are so-called macro viruses, which typically arrive in e-mail attachments.
Virus writers seem to be particularly fond of Microsoft products, including Windows, Word, Outlook and Outlook Express, so users of those programs should be especially vigilant.
In general, simply reading an e-mail message will not infect your computer, even if the subject line of the message says, ``There is a mean, ugly, nasty virus hidden in this message''.
The real danger is in opening file attachments that come appended to e-mail messages.
You should never, ever, under any circumstances, open an attached file unless you are absolutely sure you know from whom it comes, what it does and that the person who sent it intended to send it to you.
If the attachment contains one of these macro viruses, opening the file can cause the infection.
If there is any doubt whatsoever about the nature of the attachment, just dump it in the trash.
Then empty the trash.
Second, turn off the functions in your computer that open so-called macro applications automatically.
Your software manual will tell you how to do it.
Although most of the newer viruses arrive as e-mail attachments, viruses can come from any number of sources, including commercial, shrink-wrapped software.
It is prudent to check all new software before installing it.
It is annoying, but not nearly as annoying as losing files and rebuilding a hard disk.
There. That wasn't so hard.
nn Now, copy this article and send it immediately to the first 50 people in your address book, and tell them all to do the same.
If it reaches two million people by Jan.
1, Bill Gates will send $1,000 and free tickets to Disneyland to everyone on the forwarding lists.
Stop! This is a hoax, and it is one of the most common stupid things people do with computers.
Gates is one of the most generous philanthropists of our time, but he does not pay people to clog the Internet with inane e-mail messages that replicate like computer viruses.
As a home computer user you are far more likely to be the recipient of a virus hoax than you are to be the recipient of a virus.
The typical hoax letter says that there is a new and particularly nasty virus on the loose, confirmed by (insert the name of some completely irrelevant organization like the Federal Communications Commission), and that if you open an e-mail message with a certain subject line, a virus will delete all the files on your hard drive.
In almost all cases, the hoax letter will urge the recipient to pass this important message along to as many people as possible.
Don't do it.
Instead, go to the Internet site ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html, which lists the most common hoaxes in circulation.
Finally, remember that computers can do weird things and mess up your files without the aid of a virus.
I have a friend who immediately suspects computer viruses whenever the printer stops working or her system crashes.
As far as I can tell, the only thing that is infecting her computer is Windows 98.
MADRID, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Spanish computer experts have discovered a computer virus set to become active on July 12, the day of the World Cup finals in Paris.
A spokesman for the Panda Software company said Thursday that the virus was "very complex and destructive" and could erase all data on the hard disk and automatically print unwanted documents to printers.
The virus, which targets Microsoft Office 97 Word documents, will show a flashing banner of "Vive la coupe de monde"!
(Long live the World Cup)! on the screens of infected computers when a user tries to open an MS Word file.
A dialogue window will then pop up and the user will be asked to choose which football team will win the game, while the virus will be working in the background.
The company spokesman added that the virus was probably created in France as all of its files were written in French.
NEW YORK (AP) -- Proving more destructive than expected, the Chernobyl virus caused hundreds of thousands of computer meltdowns around the world, though the effects were far worse overseas than in the United States.
The unusually destructive virus -- timed to strike on April 26, the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster -- tries to erase a computer's hard drive and write gibberish into its system settings to prevent the machine from being restarted.
While experts were still tallying numbers, Turkey and South Korea each reported 300,000 computers damaged Monday, and there were more elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East.
Officials said warnings there weren't heeded.
``Arguably, this is the most malicious computer virus,'' said Dan Schrader, director of product marketing at Trend Micro Inc.
, which manufactures antivirus software.
Other experts disagreed over whether it was the most destructive virus ever.
But many were caught off guard by the amount of damage and said it was much worse than the Melissa virus early this month.
Before Chernobyl hit, several experts were quoted as saying they didn't expect it to cause much trouble.
The United States suffered far less than other nations, and experts credited widespread warnings and updated antivirus programs with helping avert problems in the corporate world.
Home users were hit harder.
About 100 student computers were wiped out at Princeton University about two weeks before term papers were due.
``The computers were affected to a point where the hard drives were rendered useless,'' Princeton spokesman Justin Harmon said Tuesday.
At Boston College, the virus affected only those students who did not install antivirus software distributed by the university last fall, spokesman Jack Dunn said.
Bill Pollak, spokesman for the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said there were reports of at least 2,328 computers damaged in the United States.
But the numbers could be higher, since no company or computer user is required to report a virus attack, he said.
The virus is believed to have originated in Taiwan and attacks Windows 95 and Windows 98 computers.
A company unknowingly distributed software infected with the virus over the Internet.
When the software was downloaded, computer users infected other files on their hard drive.
If an infected program was sent in an e-mail, the virus was passed on to the recipient.
``Turkey was caught unprepared,'' said Mustafa Ucoklar, an electronics engineer in Turkey, where the virus infected computers at banks, an airport and state-run radio and TV stations, according to Turkey's Radikal newspaper.
``The warnings were there, but nobody took any notice of them''.
South Korean officials also reported about 300,000 computers were hit in government offices, schools and businesses -- about 4 percent of the nation's computers -- in the worst attack of its kind in the country.
``We have been careless and lacked an understanding of this virus,'' said Ahn Byung-yop, vice minister of information and communications.
``We need to strengthen our alert system and public education on computer viruses''.
Schrader said the countries hardest hit have widespread use of pirated software and lack recent virus software.
Chernobyl's existence has been known since last summer, and every major antivirus software package can detect and protect against it.
Also, the Melissa virus last month served as a ``very effective wakeup call'' in the United States, Schrader said.
Many U.S. users aggressively updated their software and began to take computer viruses seriously.
``Elsewhere it wasn't taken as seriously,'' he said.
In India, at least 10,000 computer owners reported being infected.
Businesses, banks and publishing houses in India were shut down and information worth millions of dollars was lost, the Indian Express newspaper reported.
Local media reported that up to 10 percent of all computer users in the United Arab Emirates were affected; at least 10,000 computers were struck in Bangladesh; reports in China varied from 7,600 computers damaged to 100,000.
``This was the country's worst computer disaster,'' said Ahmed Hasan, general secretary of the Computer Society in Bangladesh.
NEW YORK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The rate of computer virus infection in corporate America has nearly tripled in the past year despite a significant increase in the usage of anti-virus products.
This was indicated by the results of a survey released today by the National Computer Security Association (NCSA).
The survey also found that electronic mail is now one of the leading methods of transmitting viruses.
Virtually all medium and large organizations in North America experienced at least one computer virus infection firsthand, and the survey indicated about 40 percent of all computers used in the surveyed companies would experience a virus infection within a year.
Macro viruses carried in common word processing documents and spreadsheets were the biggest problem, representing 80 percent of all infections, compared to 49 percent a year ago, and the NCSA survey indicated the instances of macro virus infection had doubled about every four months over the past year.
The No.
1 virus encountered, by far, was the Word-Concept, which caused almost half of all infections reported.
The Wazzu virus, another macro virus that infects Word documents, was responsible for about one-fifth of all infections.
Of the 300 survey respondents representing more than 700,000 desktop computers and 24,000 servers, the infection rate was found to be about 33 of 1,000 machines infected in any given month, and 406 of 1,000 machines infected in a given year.
This is a significant increase from 1995, when the chance of experiencing a computer virus was about 10 out of every 1,000 PCs per month, the survey found.
While reporting the growing likelihood of computer virus infections in corporate America, the NCSA's annual Virus Prevalence Survey also reported that use of anti-virus software had grown from 60 percent of the machines included in the 1996 survey to 73 percent in 1997.
Computer users apparently agree.
Nearly 43 percent of respondents thought the computer virus problem had gotten worse this year.
The first virus known to hit personal computers was called the Brain.
Distributed via floppy disks in the mid-1980's, the Brain was relatively innocuous and easy to track.
Today, there are an estimated 40,000 computer viruses, many far more harmful.
Here are some recent viruses; all of them can be blocked by anti-virus software.
Chernobyl HOW IT WORKS: Gets in via e-mail, floppies or downloaded software.
The virus attacks Windows 95 and 98 files, overwriting a computer's hard drive.
The date April 26 _ the Chernobyl disaster anniversary _ triggers it.
IMPACT: As many as one million computers in Southeast Asia were hit by Chernobyl on April 26.
Hundreds of attacks were reported in the United States.
Many more computers may have since picked up the virus.
STATUS: Authorities in Taiwan identified a computer-engineering student at the Tatung Institute of Technology as the virus' author.
His college punished him by giving him demerits, but he has not been charged with any crime.
Melissa HOW IT WORKS: Makes its way into computers as an e-mail attachment and then sends itself around the Internet using addresses found in a recipient's computerized address book.
Can infect Word and Excel documents.
IMPACT: More than 100,000 computers affected worldwide.
STATUS: Prosecutors in New Jersey have accused David L.
Smith, a computer programmer from Aberdeen, N.J., of writing and sending out the virus.
Smith has pleaded not guilty.
Happy99 HOW IT WORKS: Often arrives via e-mail, infecting computers once it is executed or run.
To the user, the program looks like an animated fireworks graphic.
But it can destroy data and make public confidential files from your computer.
IMPACT: Possibly tens of thousands of computers affected.
Steven Trilling, director of research for Symantec's Antivirus Research Center, said his center had more than 3,000 messages from people submitting the virus.
STATUS: Author unknown.
DHAKA, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Home-made computer viruses are not new in Bangladesh, as the country's first locally-produced virus, the Dhaka Virus, was created in 1991, The Daily Star newspaper reported Monday.
The virus, which was created by a local programmer and later renamed T-virus, was not destructive but intended to disturb the MS-Word working environment on the screen.
The virus used to erase the screen for a few seconds and then an instruction box appeared to suggest pressing T to go back to the working environment.
Businessmen were quoted as saying the virus had affected computers of several organizations.
Some young programmers later developed remedial programs to get rid of the virus.
Another local virus, the White Lion, which spread during 1992- 93, was destructive as it erased document files in the MS-Word environment.
The local viruses have faded out of people's mind because of their less-destructive nature and the frequent invasion of international viruses, the report said.
But computer experts feared that more locally-created viruses would affect machines across the country as more students enrolled in computer courses.
"It will soon be a reality in Bangladesh where the local virus creators would reign," computer expert Anko Shohel was quoted as saying.
TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- The author of the Chernobyl computer virus told investigators that he created the bug hoping to humiliate and take revenge on what he called incompetent antivirus software providers, police said today.
But he admitted he didn't expect it to cause worldwide damage, a police statement said.
Chen Ing-hau, 24, looked nervous and was speechless when he was mobbed by reporters after being summoned for police questioning on his involvement in a case that caused at least 600,000 computer meltdowns.
The Chernobyl virus -- known in Taiwan as the CIH, for Chen's initials -- had even pressed the Chinese People's Liberation Army to study antivirus programs to prevent it from invading its computers, the police statement said.
Chen created the virus last April when he was still a student of computer engineering at the Institute of Technology.
Chen has since graduated and has been undergoing Taiwan's mandatory two-year military service.
Chen had spent long hours playing computer games since entering college and was a frequent victim of computer viruses when downloading video games and other software from the Internet, the police statement said.
``He said he created the highly vicious virus that could avoid detection by available antivirus programs in order to make a fool of the software providers, from whom he had bought antivirus programs that proved useless,'' the statement said.
``He did not expect the virus to cause such a great impact.
He regretted his deeds and apologize to all its victims''.
The unusually destructive virus -- timed to strike on April 26, the 13th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster -- tries to erase a computer's hard drive and write gibberish into its system settings to prevent the machine from being restarted.
Under Taiwanese law, someone convicted of spreading computer viruses can face up to three years in prison.
Police did not say whether Chen will be charged.
Computer experts said Chen might not be charged because he did not intend to spread the virus.
But they said Chen might face lawsuits seeking millions of dollars of damage compensation.
On Monday, Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software Inc.
in Cambridge, Mass.
, made a phone call to the FBI.
Smith thought he'd figured out the identity of an electronic criminal _ the malevolent hacker who'd created the notorious Melissa computer virus.
Smith wasn't absolutely certain of the virus writer's identity, but after long hours of investigation he'd come up with two names.
One of them was that of a man he'd never met and certainly wasn't related to _ David L.
Smith. Late Thursday night, the FBI reached the same conclusion, arresting 30-year-old computer programmer David L.
Smith of Aberdeen, N.J., and alleging that he distributed the Melissa virus.
Federal agents and New Jersey State Police tracked David Smith to his brother's house in Eatontown, New Jersey, and charged him Friday with interruption of public communications, conspiracy, and third-degree theft of computer service.
After his arrest, David Smith was released on $100,000 bond.
He is scheduled for arraignment on Monday.
If convicted, Smith could receive up to 40 years in prison.
``If he is tried and successfully convicted, he will do hard time,'' said New Jersey Attorney General Peter Verniero.
That should sit well with computer network administrators across the country who've spend the past week scrambling to stave off the effects of Melissa.
Disguised as a list of pornographic Internet sites and allegedly named after a stripper David Smith once knew, Melissa is a ``macro virus,'' a document with a malignant computer program built in.
People who read the document using Microsoft Word, the popular word-processing program made by Microsoft Corp.
, could infect their computers.
If the infected machine had a copy of Microsoft's Outlook e-mail program, Melissa would send a copy of itself to the first 50 people in the Outlook address book.
Since both Word and Outlook are so widely used, the Melissa virus spread with shocking speed.
It first appeared on a sex-related Internet bulletin board last Friday.
By Saturday, major corporations such as Intel Corp.
and Microsoft Corp.
were shutting down their Internet access to cope with torrents of unwanted mail, or simply to ensure their machines didn't get infected.
Driven by sheer curiosity, Richard Smith has spent the last week in the hunt for Melissa's author.
But the FBI apparently didn't need his help.
The agency tracked down David Smith with the aid of America Online, the nation's largest Internet service provider, computer network, and with old-fashioned police procedure.
Richard Smith had hoped to use a more radical approach.
Last month, Smith shocked privacy advocates by finding a secret serial number, called a GUID, embedded in documents created by Microsoft Word.
Since the Melissa virus lurks inside a Microsoft Word document, Smith hoped he could identify its author by reading Melissa's serial number.
A tip from a Swedish computer expert sent Richard Smith to a Web site run by a virus writer who identified himself with the screen name of VicodenES.
Smith downloaded copies of the viruses posted on the site.
Then he used a ``hex editor,'' a piece of software that lets programmers read the raw data hidden inside a computer file.
Smith planned to use the ``hex dumps'' of the VicodenES files to check for the file's GUID.
Sure enough, he found that some of these files had the same serial number as Melissa.
But along the way, he also checked a feature of Microsoft Word that stores the names of people who create or modify files.
A number of names appeared again and again.
Some were plainly phony ones, like Ben Dover.
But others seemed more believable.
And in three separate files, he found the name David Smith, or the initials DLS.
A spokeswoman for the New Jersey attorney general's office said Friday that David Smith was ``definitely not'' VicodenES.
Investigators believe he took one virus from VicodinES and combined it with another virus to create Melissa.
Richard Smith's examination of the Microsoft GUID serial number led him to the same conclusion.
Richard Smith got an e-mail Wednesday from Rishi Khan, a 19-year-old senior in computer engineering at the University of Delaware.
Khan told him that the contents of the Melissa file were nearly identical to a virus called Shiver that was released sometime last year by someone calling himself Alt-F11.
Smith and Khan found that Shiver and Melissa had the same Microsoft serial number, and even the same list of pornographic Web sites.
The implication was obvious to Smith.
Melissa's creator started out with Shiver, then modified it _ a common practice among virus writers.
``He wrote the Melissa virus in a separate file,'' said Richard Smith.
``When it was all written, he needed some bait to catch people with''.
Richard Smith believes that the virus writer merely removed the polluted code in Shiver and replaced it with his own.
Richard Smith has no idea whether Alt-F11 and the creator of Melissa worked together, or if they're only connected by their love of virus-writing.
But he hopes the FBI will try to find out.
``There's someone else running around who may be material to this case,'' Smith said.
Smith says he neglected his successful software business and stayed up into the wee hours in an effort to track down the author of Melissa.
The FBI had it somewhat easier _ it had more manpower and the cooperation of America Online.
The Melissa virus had been posted onto the Internet using an AOL account belonging to Scott Steinmetz, a civil engineer in Lynnwood, Wash.
Steinmetz proclaimed his innocence and AOL concluded that someone had stolen access to his account.
Together AOL, the FBI, and New Jersey law enforcement officials traced the identity theft back to David Smith.
FBI and AOL officials won't say how they did it, but Richard Smith suspects that AOL uses a Caller ID system that tracks the source of all incoming calls.
Richard Smith wasn't quite able to nail down the identity of Melissa's creator, but he got pretty close.
Now Smith hopes the information he's gathered will enable the government to build an airtight case against David Smith.
Meanwhile, Richard Smith's company is trying to get some new industrial control software out the door, and he plans to focus on that for awhile.
``I've got a real day job, which has been sadly neglected this week,'' he said.
&QL; (Wire service material was used to prepare this report.)
When last we talked, my computer was beset by the Happy99 virus/worm, which was being passed back and forth on one of my mailing lists like a cold in a grade school class.
If you just tuned in, and don't spend much time on the Internet, Happy99 is a relatively benign virus in that it doesn't destroy anything.
It mainly wriggles into your Internet software and joins every message you send as an attachment.
You, however, are unware of this until you begin getting angry messages from your e-mail recipients.
Like any virus, it is an executable program, and isn't supposed to work at all unless you execute it.
To the best of my knowledge, I never did that, but the thing suddenly turned into a kind of hand grenade; every time it came wafting into my computer by way of e-mail, as soon as it was downloaded, it caused the computer to seize up.
Nor could I erase it by any normal means; only Norton AntiVirus was able to get rid of it.
And I had to use a painfully slow Web-based mail program to get into my mailbox and throw it out.
Eventually, it dawned on me that Norton ought to be able to catch the thing creeping into my system and stomp on it right there.
So, going into the Norton configuration program, I changed a couple of settings.
Instead of telling it to alert me when it found a virus, it was ordered to delete the thing on sight.
And instead of examining only.EXE files, it was told to examine everything.
I'm not sure which of these changes did the trick _ maybe both were required _ but upon downloading a group of messages which I knew contained the virus somewhere, everything went fine.
No lockup.
Upon examining the messages, the Happy99.exe attachment brought in by one of them was covered with a bright red X.
I relate this mainly as a lesson in trying to make a program do something you think it ought to be able to do.
It doesn't always work, but nowadays programs are so flexible and have so many user-changeable parameters, it's always worth trying.
Another example is my recent test drive of Explorer.
It wasn't presenting pictures and other images at Web sites I knew had graphics.
A quick check showed it was set to refuse graphics to speed up operations.
This, however archaic, was apparently the default setting.
If incidentally, you have executed the Happy99 virus, it's not hard to get rid of.
There are lots of places on the Web with instructions, among them http://www.geocities.com /SiliconValley/Heights/3652 /SKA.HTM.
During all the unHappy furor, I installed the latest upgrade to Eudora Pro, the outstanding e-mail program published by Qualcomm.
I had been using Version 3.0; the latest is 4.1.
It's a very worthwhile upgrade.
The program hasn't changed drastically, but lots of things work better.
The main screen is divided into two windows now.
The top window shows a list of your mail, and merely by bringing the cursor to any message, the text appears instantly in the lower window.
No more tiresome double-clicking, and the presentation is much faster.
Additionally, Eudora now makes the mail available in batches.
If you have 200 messages waiting, it gives them to you 20 or so at a time so you don't have to wait for the entire mailbox to download so you can begin reading.
I have yet to see a mail program I like as well.
Story Filed By Cox Newspapers For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service &QL; NYT-03-01-99 1110EST &QL;
SEATTLE (AP) -- Sandwiched between coffee bars and vintage clothing shops, the Fremont Place Book Co.
has provided the city's hip, young Fremont neighborhood with everything from obscure titles to bestsellers for more than a decade.
But a sign in the window warns of an uncertain future: ``This bookstore is endangered''.
The owners of the store, like hundreds who run independent bookstores nationwide, fear being wiped out by chain-owned megastores and cyber shops that offer virtually limitless titles.
The latest threat is the proposed acquisition by Barnes &AMP; Noble -- the country's largest bookstore chain -- of Ingram Book Co.
, the world's largest book distributor.
For independent booksellers, the $600 million deal is the last straw.
``We were all just aghast when we heard about the deal,'' says Carol Santoro, co-owner of Fremont Place.
``It's becoming more and more of a dynasty''.
Smaller booksellers worry the merger will allow Barnes &AMP; Noble to learn what others are buying.
Santoro has responded by shifting orders to other suppliers.
But independent booksellers are not the only ones worried about self-preservation in a changing industry.
Even a giant in the business like Ingram says it cannot overlook the impact of chain stores and online retailers in the market.
Online book sales are expected to account for 10 percent of all transactions by 2002.
At the urging of several members of Congress, including Democratic Sen.
Ron Wyden of Oregon, and independent booksellers, the Federal Trade Commission is looking into the deal between Ingram and Barnes &AMP; Noble.
The state attorney general in California -- home to many independent booksellers -- also is investigating.
Wyden took up the cause because of personal exposure to the tough circumstances facing small booksellers.
His father was an author and ran his own publishing house for some years.
``I was raised being skeptical about what is happening in the bookselling business,'' Wyden said.
He supports conditions to the merger so all booksellers have equal access to published material.
He also favors ``firewalls'' to prevent information sharing.
Without such conditions, Wyden believes the deal could be the death of the small stores.
``I think this really is a survival issue for them,'' Wyden said.
Independent bookstores have been on the offensive since the dawn of the mega bookstore, when giants like Borders and Barnes &AMP; Noble opened up triple decker shops stocked with thousands of book titles, CDs and even cappuccino bars.
Because of their high volume, these stores were able to slash prices.
Then came Amazon.com.
The online retail giant has revolutionized the market, enabling shoppers to buy, send and special-order books with a click of the mouse.
In March, the American Booksellers Association and other independent bookstores filed suit against the two retail book chains, saying they have used their clout to secure illegal deals and preferential treatment from publishing houses.
Another suit filed by independent booksellers in August also names Amazon.com and BarnesandNoble.com.
The ABA argues that the proposed deal between Ingram and Barnes &AMP; Noble will add to the stranglehold on independent booksellers and reduce the diversity of materials.
``You wind up with a smaller and smaller group of people deciding who to publish,'' said Len Vlahos of the ABA, based in Tarrytown, N.Y.
While there will always be the John Grishams and other big moneymakers, bookstores also need to make room for lesser known names.
``You like to think artistic content matters,'' says Santoro.
``Not just the bottom line''.
Ingram says it is reaching out to its clients to assure them of confidentiality in their transactions.
Predictions that the merger will reduce the variety of books available are just not true, says Mary Ellen Keating of Barnes &AMP; Noble.
``We are going to make every book available,'' she said.
But Wyden says independent bookstores do more than just sell books, and often function as community centers.
``The small stores help make rural life more vibrant,'' Wyden said.
Patrons agree.
``There's just a flavor that you're looking for,'' said Diane Kerner of Seattle, making her purchases at Fremont Place one rainy morning.
``People love their neighborhood bookstores.''
On the eve of its annual national convention, the bookselling business has never seemed more like a business.
In the past 12 months, the German conglomerate Bertelsmann AG completed its purchase of Random House, Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.
announced it would buy the world's largest wholesaler, the Ingram Book Group, and Bertelsmann and Barnes &AMP; Noble announced a joint investment in the on-line seller barnesandnoble.com.
Meanwhile, as big business gets bigger, smaller business simply disappears.
Since the early 1990s, bookseller membership in the American Booksellers Association has dropped from 5,200 to less than 3,500, much of that almost surely the result of superstore expansion.
Perhaps a few parties, and some California sun, will make it all go away.
Booksellers, publishers, agents and authors are gathering at the Los Angeles Convention Center for this year's BookExpo America.
The three-day exhibition and trade show, which starts Friday, ends May 2.
``The book business has never been more difficult nor more uncertain than it is now,'' said Richard Howorth, ABA president and owner of Square Books in Oxford, Miss.
``While it's still a wonderful occupation, it's awfully scary''.
In 1997, about 25 percent of adult book purchases were made at Barnes &AMP; Noble and other chains while just over 17 percent were made at independent stores.
In 1991, independents received 32.5 percent of sales and chains 22 percent.
Online book sales are expected to account for 10 percent of all transactions by 2002.
BEA won't turn that around, but for a few days it gives independent sellers a chance to meet, commiserate and plan.
One proposed change is to reduce the ABA's board of directors, from 20 to nine.
``We're trying to make the board more responsive, more nimble and able to react quickly,'' said Howorth, ``because everything is changing so fast''.
Losing customers both in cyberspace and in their neighborhoods, independents are fighting back any way they can.
The ABA is suing Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders for antitrust violations and is among those opposing the proposed Ingram sale, which the Federal Trade Commission is reviewing.
The booksellers association is also creating its own on-line selling site, BookSense.com, scheduled to be ready by late summer.
``This is all being done out of necessity.
You can't just sit around and be a guy in the shop and think life is going to go on the way it's been,'' Howorth said.
Publishers face a problem directly related to the convention: introducing their fall books, their main reason for coming to BookExpo.
Because of scheduling conflicts at the Convention Center, this year's meeting will take place a month earlier than usual.
Not everyone is ready.
``Frankly, we haven't seen enough of our manuscripts to really feel comfortable,'' said Laurie Brown, vice president of marketing for Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux.
``We're cataloguing books we're not even sure are going to be ready on schedule''.
But once in Los Angeles, there will be plenty of time for promotions, parties and seminars.
And, at least around meal times, the industry will pause and let the writers talk.
Featured speakers include Nobelist Elie Wiesel, Pulitzer Prize winners Frank McCourt and Jorie Graham, as well as Robert Stone, Ward Just, David Guterson and Nikki Giovanni.
Salman Rushdie, on his first full-fledged book tour since being sentenced to death 10 years ago by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, is expected to appear.
But Rushdie is likely the only writer who will draw as big a crowd as the weekend's most quotable ``author,'' Bill Murray, the undoubtedly proud papa of ``A Cinderella Story: My Life in Golf''.
Those looking forward to seeing the merry Murray bear-hugging the sad-eyed Wiesel will be disappointed.
Murray will not share the dais with Wiesel or any Pulitzer winners.
Instead, his fellow breakfast speakers will include Frances Mayes, a California-based poet who writes about Italy, and a celebrity whom Dan Aykroyd, Murray's ``Saturday Night Live'' co-star, once parodied so well, Julia Child.
Bon appetit.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Independent bookseller Patrice Wynne knew it was going to take a lot more than meditation to save her spiritually oriented bookstore when sales dipped for the first time in its 12 years.
So Ms.
Wynne is asking her customers to help save her Berkeley bookstore by making an investment that offers no material return.
``We do not want the books sold in Berkeley to be mediated by corporate chains, Barnes &AMP; Noble and Amazon.com,'' Ms.
Wynne said.
``We're saying, 'You're a Main Street investor that has a social and cultural return on your investment by making a donation'.
... It's a model of reciprocity''.
Using just $2,000, Ms.
Wynne, who comes from a family of small-business owners, launched GAIA bookstore with her husband in 1987 and immediately began turning a profit.
With its sunny, comfortable interior, GAIA eventually become one of the nation's largest spiritual bookstores with 250 author events annually, and took in a $63,000 profit in 1997.
But GAIA, which the city of Berkeley has officially designated a cultural institution, will have to close at the end of March if Ms.
Wynne can't raise the $300,000 needed to get out of debt, plus an additional $100,000 to keep running.
Though she would not provide detailed figures, sales were down $200,000 in 1998 and she expects a significant loss.
It started last year, as she watched her customers gravitate to the Internet.
Each month sales were down 20 percent from the same time the year before.
The red ink crested in November, with a 37 percent drop.
She announced in December that she was shutting down, but within days an anonymous, longtime Berkeley resident stepped forward.
The person offered to match up to $200,000 donated by other patrons.
Ms. Wynne passed the word and the calls started coming in.
As of Friday, GAIA had pulled in $45,000 in donations from as far away as New York and Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc.
in Vermont.
About 10 writers have volunteered to match proceeds brought in by their readings at GAIA.
``We were just deluged with customers saying, 'What can we do to help keep you open'''?
Ms. Wynne said recently while taking a break at an American Booksellers Association meeting in San Francisco.
Avin Mark Domnitz, the chief executive of the ABA, said the only similar case he could think of was that of an anonymous donor who gave $1 million to a struggling South Carolina bookstore.
And unlike other companies that looked to investors for help, Ms.
Wynee isn't selling shares in GAIA.
``I think that this kind of expression of support from a community you may see more and more of as customers see the independent bookstore is threatened by outside bookstores,'' Domnitz said.
``The threats keep coming''.
Of the so-called ``bricks and mortar'' bookstores that captured about 50 percent of the market in the second quarter of 1998, more than half of sales were generated in four chain stores.
Warehouse clubs like Costco and Kmart, which also offer big discounts, took another 49 percent, according to the ABA.
And although online sellers currently have only a tiny 1 1/2 percent of the $12.3 billion retail book market, independent store owners believe they're making a significant dent.
Even GAIA, part of which functions as a nonprofit community center, is developing a Web site that will allow its techno-savvy customers to buy online.
Not everyone in the industry expects independent stores to stay alive by running a capital campaign.
``I think this is pretty much a one-of-a-kind occurrence.
I can't see it happening very often,'' said Kevin Howell, an editor at trade magazine Publisher's Weekly.
``Maybe those customers are a little more loyal.
It's very much a niche store as opposed to if it were just a general (interest)''.
Wellington's, an independent bookstore in the technology-saturated Research Triangle Park area of North Carolina, was sold two years ago to 18 ``techies,'' stay-at-home moms and retirees concerned about the 40,000 square-foot Barnes &AMP; Noble against which the owner felt it would eventually become impossible to compete.
Her prediction ultimately came true.
With Borders and Bookstar stores also in an area populated by a wealth of online 25- to 34-year-olds, Wellington's closed its doors in Cary on Feb. 5.
Independent booksellers are a famously fractious group, as the name suggests.
In their two-decades war against chain stores and, more recently, online booksellers, they have shared little beyond common enemies _ Barnes &AMP; Noble, Borders, Amazon, the price clubs _ and a will to survive.
Isolated from one another in neighborhoods across America, they have fought a guerrilla war with discouraging results.
Nearly half the independent booksellers have disappeared since 1994, according to the American Booksellers Association.
Now the Internet, the site of so much recent loss for the independents, will take on greater importance as a battleground in the next two months.
Set to debut are two large-scale Web sites that seek to promote the independents.
But many wonder whether the sites are jumping in too late and can compete with the customer service of the online giants Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
On June 6, the booksellers association will begin to unveil Booksense.com, a site turning the independents into ``local store dot-com, closed but open 24 hours a day,'' says Michael Hoynes, the program's marketing officer.
Next to come, in early July, is Contentville, a site produced by Steven T.
Brill, which will, according to its senior vice president and e-publisher, Annik LaFarge, make some 40 of the most respected booksellers in the country the ``heart and soul'' of its book retailing area.
The sites hope to showcase the independents as stores run by booksellers with personalities as unique and marketable as their books.
But they are built on very different business models.
Booksense.com is a ``hub site'' for hundreds of individual Web sites created and maintained by local stores.
Each will have its own Web address and set its own prices.
What is unusual about Contentville's relationship with the independent booksellers it has recruited _ Glenn Goldman of Book Soup in Los Angeles, Neal Sofman of A Clean Well Lighted Place in San Francisco and a former ABA president, Ed Morrow of Northshire Bookstore in Manchester Center, Vt.
, among others _ is that the independents will not actually be selling books on Contentville.
Instead, they will provide editorial content for a fee and will get an equity stake in the company should Contentville go public.
Sara Farley, an e-commerce analyst at PaineWebber, believes the biggest issue for the new sites lies in customer service, exactly the territory the independents in Booksense.com, in particular, will have the least control over.
``The trick,'' she says, ``is providing a great customer experience.
Amazon has spent five years developing a complicated and hopefully very robust distribution and fulfillment network.
They didn't snap their fingers''.
To meet the challenge, the sites have established alliances with Baker &AMP; Taylor and Ingram, wholesalers that have traditionally dealt in bulk orders to booksellers and now face the challenge of shipping smaller orders directly to consumers' homes.
Ingram, for example, has worked over the last two years to improve its ability to ship smaller orders to more customers, and over the last year has developed this operation in earnest delivering books for Barnesandnoble.com and Buy.com, the two largest of 20 such clients it works with.
Ingram has a cash investment in Contentville, which ``gives us reassurance they'll do it right,'' said Brill.
Booksense.com has reached similar distribution agreements with Baker &AMP; Taylor and other wholesalers.
The wholesalers' ability to deliver on their promises is crucial, says Lorraine Shanley, a publishing consultant at Market Partners.
``The online component of bookselling is difficult for people without the resources and organizational savvy of Amazon,'' she said.
``ABA is a trade organization''.
The obstacle, she says, is the same as it was for Barnes &AMP; Noble when it went online.
``They are trying to jerry-rig entrenched systems, as opposed to building a Web-based transactional business, which is what Amazon did,'' she said.
Len Vlahos, director of Booksense.com, says customer service will be the strength of the program.
``The local store itself will be point of customer contact,'' he said.
``There's an actual person in the store, which has many more years of customer service experience than Amazon''.
But the question still remains whether the Internet plays to the independents' strengths as retailers.
Online booksellers can't replicate the experience of browsing and buying books in a store, says Jeffrey Fieler, consumer Internet analyst at Bear Stearns.
Though he acknowledges that ``the independents have to do something or they will be marginalized'' even further, he is skeptical that a niche retailer can develop a significant market share in a category already well-served on the Web.
Last year, according to Fieler, people visited an average of 15 sites a month.
This year, he says, the number has shrunk to 10.
``People are finding the places that meet their needs,'' he says.
``The larger sites in each area are adding functionality so that people don't need to go to other sites''.
Booksense.com, which has been delayed since the fall by technical problems, grows out of Booksense, a ``national marketing umbrella'' launched by the booksellers association for its beleaguered members in February 1999.
In the last 16 months, Booksense has attracted 1,154 stores across the country to its offline program.
It offers, among other features, a bestseller list drawn from members' stores, gift certificates redeemable at any affiliated store (allowing direct competition with the ubiquity of the chains) and national advertising promoting independents' reading recommendations.
Booksense.com charges participants a set-up fee, a monthly maintenance fee and takes 4.5 percent in commissions on orders shipped from wholesale partners.
The association has earmarked more than $2 million for promotion.
Farley said Amazon had spent $40.6 million in advertising, promotion and public relations in the last quarter alone, though Amazon sells more than books.
Local marketing by the independents themselves, together with significant in-store promotion of the individual Web sites, is seen as key to Booksense's viability.
Fieler also sees risks in this limited approach.
``Partnerships with other sites that command large shares'' of Internet traffic, such as Barnes and Noble's relationship with AOL, or Amazon's relationship with Yahoo, will be crucial for the venture, he said.
Research from the American Booksellers Association shows, Hoynes says, that the typical customer of an independent bookstore buys an average of 20 books a year, but only eight of those at an independent store.
Booksense's goal is to build the independents' share to 10 or 11.
(MORE) &QL; nn Contentville has significantly more marketing clout and will sell more than books: content from newspapers and magazines, as well as e-books, dissertations and other material.
It will spend $75 million in advertising over the next two years, according to Brill, who estimates that books will account for 25 to 30 percent of the site's total revenue.
Both NBC and CBS have invested in Contentville, and the site will be advertised on the networks beginning in July in some markets.
The Contentville independents will create a variety of editorial features, including recommended ``libraries'' of essential books in various categories, ``If You Ask Me'' endorsements of books they love and new books they are enthusiastic about.
There will also be store bestseller lists and ``Buzz on the Floor'' notes on local happenings that have helped sales of certain titles.
But Shanley questions whether the local flavor will help on the Web, where ``virtual communities are more important than land-based ones''.
The new sites are complementary _ Contentville will have pages that point back to Web sites that may be part of Booksense.
This may be an advantage for the booksellers involved in the programs.
Roxanne Coady of R.J.
Julia Books in Madison, Conn.
, who is participating in both sites, said: ``Booksense as a branding campaign, Booksense.com and Contentville can all act to remind consumers that independent booksellers have a valuable voice.
That alone is a big deal.''
After struggling through a drought in the mid-1990s, when readers bought fewer copies of consumer books, the publishing industry posted gains of more than 4 percent last year and is poised for more modest increases despite the rapid emergence of online booksellers.
In its annual snapshot of the word trade, the Book Industry Study Group issued cautious sales projections for the glamour side of trade publishing, which produces novels and nonfiction, and a more radiant view of the future for college textbooks and business titles.
The unit sales of adult trade books are projected to grow more than 2 percent annually through the year 2003 _ an indication that online sales are not expected to increase the market for popular books.
``We don't see the total market expanding in any dramatic shape for five years,'' said Albert Greco, an associate professor of business at Fordham University who helped prepare the projections.
``If you say 10 years, it might be even more modest.
I think people are reading less, and I just don't see that we're going to turn the corner and become a nation of readers''.
In 1998, the sales of adult hard-cover and trade paperback books _ the top moneymakers for trade publishers _ rose by more than 4 percent from a year earlier, to 497 million copies.
It was the second year of growth in unit sales after a two-period ending in 1996 when consumers cut back on their purchases.
Children's books also made gains, emerging from a 1997 slump to sell more than 364 million copies in 1998, a gain of 6 percent.
The study does not include figures for 1999, but several top publishers say they are experiencing a surge in sales that encompasses not only popular fare like ``Hannibal'' by Thomas Harris or the ``Harry Potter'' children's series by J.K.
Rowling but also histories like John Keegan's ``The First World War''.
``We've seen a strong market since last summer _ all publishing divisions, all formats, all categories,'' said Peter Olson, the chief executive of Random House, the Bertelsmann AG unit that is the largest trade publisher in the United States.
Olson gave credit for some of the strength to online retailers that now account for roughly 4 to 5 percent of the company's sales.
Olson said that the company's worldwide sales of $1.6 billion for the fiscal year that ended in June had exceeded expectations.
The North American side of the company _ in the United States and Canada _ accounted for about 80 percent of all sales.
``I think that the attention that Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com have generated has increased interest in books in general, and that has led to buying not just online, but in stores,'' Olson said.
Using consumer diaries of book purchases, an earlier industry study this year found that Americans bought fewer copies of books in the same period last year.
But the trade organization speculates that the discrepancy may be because that study did not include acquisitions made by libraries.
Though the industry study does not predict an expansion of the market because of online sales, its current sales figures indicate that electronic publishing and bookselling are reshaping the market in other ways.
For example, the unit sales of books about science and technology declined from a peak of 80 million copies in 1995, falling 8 percent to 74 million copies last year.
And those drops are expected to continue, the result of a shift to electronic publishing _ that is, distribution of books by disk, CD-ROM or over the Internet _ by technical publishers like Bertelsmann's Springer Verlag unit in New York.
In the last few weeks, Springer has transformed ``Prokaryotes,'' a four-volume $2,000 set of books about bacteria, into an electronic version that will sell for less than half that price.
Ruediger Gebauer, Springer's chief executive, said that no one was sure yet whether electronic publishing would expand the market.
But he expected that the electronic versions would make such books accessible to many more people.
``The libraries, in theory, keep information to everybody,'' he said.
``But in reality it's only the people who go to the library.
Online publishing opens it up to virtually everybody''.
The Book Industry Study Group report also suggests that the Internet and online book sales may figure in the continuing fall-off in mail-order purchases, which has dropped 26 percent from a high of 105 million copies in 1993.
But the Internet does not affect all categories.
Religious books, for instance, are not sold in high volumes by electronic booksellers, but sales in that category continue to improve, increasing almost 16 percent, to 170 million copies since 1993.
And those numbers do not include sales figures from thriving fundamentalist Christian publishers.
``You've got an aging population, and I think as people go on in life they turn to more spiritual matters,'' said Eric Major, director of the Doubleday religious division for Random House.
``Oddly enough, we've seen a surge in books about the lives of saints or books about people's religious experiences.
The great thing about this area of religion publishing is that it now includes business books, parenting books, dieting books and relationships books''.
The sales of textbooks for college and elementary students also continue to grow.
At the university level sales grew more than 19 percent, to 176 million copies, between 1993 and 1998.
But those trends have not necessarily raised sales by the 80 or so university presses in the United States.
The sales of university books grew by almost 4 percent to 18.5 million copies from a year earlier.
And the report projects only modest increases for the next five years.
``That's an indication of a mature market,'' said Peter Givler, executive director of the Association of American University Presses, a trade organization.
``I think that it is very much a market in turmoil.
The sales for university presses have been flat for a couple of years, and the presses are looking for new sources of revenues''.
Some university presses are starting to experiment by publishing electronic journals, he said, but to date it is unclear to the members whether online bookselling and electronic publishing will be a boon.
``Online bookselling has had this extraordinary growth,'' Givler said, ``but nobody knows how that is going to play out.
It seems that everybody thinks this is a logical way to purchase books and there ought to be some way to work it out, but we haven't found a way to do it.''
OXFORD, Miss.
_ In the 1960s, when William Faulkner still walked the land while Eudora Welty produced some of her finest work and Willie Morris moved ``North Toward Home,'' their native state was known as a place where more people wrote books than read them.
Books in Mississippi were sold in pharmacies equipped with rotating racks featuring Mickey Spillane thrillers, or sometimes in department store nooks displaying Bibles and inspirational ``literature''.
But in recent years, a crop of small bookstores catering to serious readers grew up in the state, and Mississippi's independent booksellers now find themselves in the middle of an escalating national feud with superstores such as Barnes &AMP; Noble, Borders, and Books-A-Million.
After nurturing their shops into a profitable existence, local entrepreneurs in Mississippi and other points around the country are struggling against chain stores offering cheaper prices.
As Richard Howorth, owner of Square Books in Oxford and president of the American Booksellers Association says, ``In 1991, when Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders began to expand, there were 5,200 members of the ABA.
Today, there are 3,300''.
The plaint is a variation of the Wal-Mart syndrome: cut-rate behemoths drive mom-and-pop stores out of existence.
But rather than return to the days before bookstores flourished, the independent booksellers are fighting back.
The ABA, which represents private bookstore owners, filed an antitrust suit against Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders last March, charging the chains with undercutting the independent booksellers through ``secret and illegal deals'' with publishing houses.
By obtaining ``disproportionate discounting and additional credit'' unavailable to the independents, Howorth said, the chains are able to offer more attractive prices.
For example, Tom Wolfe's new novel, ``A Man in Full,'' listed at $28.95, sells for only $20 at the superstores.
The situation was exacerbated last month by revelations that Barnes &AMP; Noble, the nation's biggest bookseller, planned to purchase the country's leading wholesale distributor, Ingram Book Group.
(Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat sympathetic to the independents, last week called for the Justice Department to investigate the antitrust implications of the merger).
In an interview at his store overlooking the historic courthouse square that Faulkner immortalized, Howorth said that if the Barnes &AMP; Noble acquisition goes through, small booksellers who buy from Ingram would be faced with ``the realistic threat of doing business with a company showing a desire to put everyone else out of business''.
Since Square Books was established in 1979, the store has helped transform downtown Oxford from a rural outpost into a cosmopolitan center with a busy nightlife.
The store is on the major league circuit for authors promoting new books.
While reluctant to divulge his revenue, Howorth estimates that he sells an average of six books per year for every man, woman, and child in the town of 12,000 residents.
Yet the University of Mississippi here awarded Barnes &AMP; Noble a franchise for a campus bookstore a couple of years ago.
``I felt betrayed by the university,'' Howorth said.
As a result, he withheld Square Book's support for an annual book conference that draws many writers to Oxford each spring.
After it became apparent that the campus store concentrated on textbooks and had a minimal operation for ``trade books,'' a designation for quality fiction and non-fiction, Howorth renewed his support for the conference this year.
Nevertheless, he said, ``after years of growth our sales have been flat since Barnes &AMP; Noble has been here.
It's hard to say whether it's them or sales gravitating to Amazon.com,'' the Internet outlet involved in its own advertising war with Barnes &AMP; Noble's online ``bookstore''.
``The independents may someday have the opportunity to develop sales over the Internet, but not if we're obliterated from the retail face of the earth,'' Howorth said.
He added: ``All corporate bookstores are, to one extent or another, predators''.
Lemuria, a thriving independent book store in Jackson, Miss.
, has become a prime target for ``predatory activity,'' says its proprietor, John Evans, who was frustrated by his inability to find good books in his hometown and started the store more than 20 years ago.
After outgrowing its original site, Lemuria is now in a handsome building just off an interstate highway.
It is no coincidence, Evans says, that Books-A-Million, a Southeastern chain selling at cut-rate prices, set up a store across the interstate from Lemuria a few years ago.
Or that Barnes &AMP; Noble recently opened its own store a couple of minutes away.
``What they try to do is to go and find a store to prey on,'' Evans said.
``There's no way I can sell books at 40 percent off''.
Lemuria is one of 26 plaintiffs in the action against Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders.
According to the independent booksellers' lawsuit, ``the rapid growth of national chains, fueled by secret and illegal deals, threatens the survival of independent bookstores and the diversity of American bookselling''.
Small-town enterprises such as Favorites Book Store, which sponsors readings for children and book-signing garden parties that have brought life to a neighborhood in Ocean Springs on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, are in jeopardy.
Marilyn Lunceford, the store's owner, has told friends she fears her business will be ruined by a Barnes &AMP; Noble store projected for a new mall in nearby Gulfport.
Though the ABA suit was filed in California, which has state laws regarding unfair trade practices and serves as the home for large number of independent booksellers, it has strong support from members in Mississippi.
Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders formally responded to the suit in July by steadfastly denying allegations of deal-making.
The litigation is still in preliminary stages, but Howorth said he was encouraged by a 1994 consent agreement involving the ABA, Penguin Books, and other publishers.
After the ABA complained about unfair trade practices, the publishers agreed to pay the booksellers $25 million.
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Unhappy with an author they once honored, independent booksellers overwhelmingly approved a resolution criticizing Frank McCourt for appearing in a television ad for the on-line superstore barnesandnoble.com.
The American Booksellers Association, with a core membership of some 3,300 independent stores, voted Saturday at BookExpo America to draft a letter to McCourt expressing disappointment.
He is the author of the hugely popular ``Angela's Ashes'' and the upcoming sequel ``Tis''.
``I've never asked for an apology in my life and I've never given one.
What I do I do.
... If I get a letter from them it'll go back unopened,'' said McCourt, a featured speaker at BEA.
The expo, a three-day exhibition and trade show that ended Sunday, is the publishing industry's annual national convention.
It was held at the Los Angeles Convention Center.
The ABA's letter will be sent to a beloved writer, and not just with readers.
Two years ago, the association presented McCourt its annual ABBY award, given to the author whose book they most enjoyed selling.
His memoir was a surprise success and he has given a lot of the credit to independents.
``If they (independent stores) had wanted me to do a commercial I would have done one for them, too.
I'm not a politician.
I just did what my publisher requested,'' McCourt said Sunday.
The resolution is actually far lighter than the original proposed by independent seller Andy Ross, owner of Cody's Books Inc.
in Berkeley.
Ross, condemning the ``hypocrisy of writers and intellectuals,'' had wanted the ABA to call for McCourt to give back his ABBY award.
The booksellers overwhelmingly rejected that idea as too harsh.
``I really offered this resolution in a spirit to generate discussion,'' Ross said.
``They (writers) talk about independent booksellers at cocktail parties, but they're afraid to speak up.
The chains have become so powerful''.
Other writers appearing in ads for barnesandnoble.com include Tom Clancy and Stephen King, another vocal supporter of independents.
``In retrospect, I understand how they feel, but I never really anticipated it,'' said Susan Moldow, vice president and publisher of Scribner, an imprint of Simon &AMP; Schuster that publishes both McCourt and King.
Asked if he'd do another superstore ad, McCourt said ``I'd be very careful the next time.
From now on, I probably won't do anything''.
The ABA action highlighted a weekend of tough talk.
The association aggressively promoted its answer to Amazon.com and other on-line sellers, BookSense.com, to be open for business late summer.
And individual members accused Barnes &AMP; Noble, Amazon.com and other ``bad corporate citizens'' of everything from false advertising to stealing customers.
``We are fighting for our lives,'' said ABA president Richard Howorth.
Booksellers received both bad news and good news at BEA.
A new consumer survey said that adults in the U.S. bought 30 million fewer books in 1998 than the year before.
The apparent culprit was an odd one: A good economy.
``In good times, consumers seem to spend their money on other kinds of entertainment or on more expensive durable goods.
In tighter economic times, consumers once again think about books,'' said Sandra Paul, managing agent of the Book Industry Study Group, which conducted the survey.
But the ABA, which has lost nearly 2,000 stores over the past decade, also reported a long-hoped for statistic.
In March of this year, the number of stores increased slightly, the first monthly improvement in recent memory.
``It's been going against us for a long time, but it's going to go the other way,'' said Avin Mark Domnitz, the ABA's chief executive officer.
Meanwhile, there was still plenty of time to talk about books.
Major upcoming releases include McCourt's new book; ``Dutch,'' Edmund Morris' long-awaited memoir about former President Ronald Reagan; Sue Grafton's latest lettered mystery, ``O is For Outlaw,'' and ``Hannibal,'' Thomas Harris' sequel to ``The Silence of the Lambs.''
Five months after Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.
rattled the book industry with the seismic announcement of its acquisition of the nation's largest wholesaler, Ingram Book Group, the proposed merger is undergoing intense federal scrutiny and is now being investigated by the California attorney general's office.
When the $600 million purchase was announced in early November, Barnes &AMP; Noble's top executives confidently predicted that the merger of the nation's largest bookseller and wholesaler would be completed in 35 to 45 days, but the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust review has lingered longer than expected.
Independent booksellers, meanwhile, have organized one of the most elaborate opposition campaigns in the recent history of the book industry, with so many petitions, e-mails and telephone appeals to the FTC that the agency has set aside a special line just to record calls about the Ingram deal.
(``If your call is in reference to the proposed Barnes &AMP; Noble-Ingram merger, please press one,'' its voice-mail system tells callers).
Barnes &AMP; Noble's acquisition of Ingram, a unit of Ingram Industries, is undergoing a level of scrutiny from the FTC that is known as a ``second request review,'' in general a rare move that allows the agency to extend its examination of the competitive impact of a proposed deal.
The length and type of the review does not necessarily mean the merger is in deep trouble.
Other recent book industry deals have faced intense reviews from Federal regulators but still were eventually approved.
The British media group Pearson PLC faced this extra round of inspection for its purchase of Simon &AMP; Schuster's education unit, which was ultimately approved.
Bertelsmann AG's successful acquisitions of Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell also received additional attention.
The Ingram deal has galvanized strong opposition from booksellers in California.
There, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general said Friday that the agency was reviewing the deal.
``We're investigating,'' said the spokeswoman Sandra Michioku, the director of public affairs for the attorney general, Bill Lockyer.
``The process is to look at what would be the impact of the merger and to make a decision whether it's anticompetitive''.
Even if the FTC approves the merger, California can ask a federal judge to block it, said Ms.
Michioku, who declined to comment on what prompted the state to get involved.
She said she knew of no other state that was investigating the merger.
The Connecticut attorney general's office is monitoring the FTC review, although it is not conducting one itself.
Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &AMP; Noble in New York, said the company was not aware of the California investigation, although it did receive a letter from the state requesting information that the bookstore chain was providing to Federal investigators.
``It's really not uncommon for a state attorney general to be interested in a transaction like this, because there have been concerns raised about this,'' Ms.
Keating said.
She noted that the company was ``confident that this acquisition will be approved''.
In a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts, Barnes &AMP; Noble's chairman and chief executive, Leonard Riggio, said that he expected a decision by the FTC in 60 to 90 days, which would be sometime in June.
Ingram, based in Nashville, is the dominant force in book distribution.
Privately held, it does not disclose its market share.
Barnes &AMP; Noble's sales account for about 14 percent of the consumer book market.
In general, the merger's opponents are worried that the Ingram purchase will give Barnes &AMP; Noble access to the sales data of independent competitors or allow it to stock its stores with popular books that might be in short supply while making a competitor like Amazon.com wait for the same title.
After the many recent mergers in the book industry, some opponents of the Barnes &AMP; Noble-Ingram deal said they believed it was getting more serious attention because they were being asked by the FTC to provide formal declarations of opposition.
The agency declined to comment on the status of its review.
``This is the first time that we've been asked for declarations, and nothing like this has happened before with the struggle with Simon &AMP; Schuster and Bertelsmann and Random House,'' said Letty Cottin Pogrebin, the president of the Authors Guild in New York, which challenged the other mergers.
J. Michael Cooper, a Washington antitrust specialist who is not involved in the case, said the request for declarations indicated that the federal review had reached a new level.
``It suggests that they did reach a stage where they have problems and they are willing to go ahead and seek a preliminary injunction,'' Cooper said.
``I think that they have problems and they're trying to work those out''.
He noted that declarations are normally collected in preparation for an injunction request or for use in persuading FTC commissioners to block a merger.
Some opponents of the merger took comfort from Ingram's announcement in March of a stategic alliance with Entertainment Marketing Information Services.
Through its Book Scan unit, EMIS will take over the collection of sales data from independent bookstores that were previously polled by Ingram.
This move, in the opponents' view, represents an effort to address the concern that Ingram might pass along information about independent booksellers to Barnes &AMP; Noble.
Led by the American Booksellers Association in Tarrytown, N.Y., independent booksellers have conducted a letter-writing campaign against the merger that has delivered the signatures of more than 115,000 book buyers to the FTC.
The independent booksellers also have held meetings with elected officials, which have resulted in letters from officials like Sen.
Michael DeWine, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, urging the federal agency to review the merger closely.
The City Council in Berkeley, Calif.
, passed a resolution supporting the effort of independent booksellers to block the merger.
In San Francisco, a long-distance telephone and credit card company, Working Assets, organized a telephone campaign by its customers that resulted in 35,000 calls to the FTC to oppose the merger, according to Janet Nudelman, a director at the company.
``Booksellers are not a particularly political group of folks,'' said Oren Teicher, who has been organizing the opposition for the American Booksellers Association.
``They tend not to be involved in this kind of lobbying.
But in this case we have found the inverse to be true.
Booksellers are enormously responsive.''
BOSTON _ Inside the Avenue Victor Hugo Bookshop, the e-commerce revolution seems improbable, like a setting ripped from a Robert Louis Stevenson novel on the store's dusty shelves.
Owner Vincent McCaffrey would have it no other way.
Hence, the resident cat, Blue, who sleeps in the front window, the classical music, and the hand-scrawled sign that says ``Please Touch The Books''.
However, the charming store encloses a hidden world, one where touching the books is impossible, where silence reigns, and where Blue is nothing more than a flickering image.
It's called AvenueVictorHugoBooks.com, and last year, it generated 6 percent of McCaffrey's sales.
``For us to survive, it's very simple: We have to have the Web,'' said McCaffrey, peering down nearly empty aisles on a recent afternoon.
``I've got 150,000 books here, and I might offend the typical Bostonian by saying this, but there aren't enough people here who read.
That's just how the world is now''.
Battered by chain stores and the on-line giant Amazon.com, one out of every three of New England's independent booksellers has created sophisticated yet quirky Web sites in the past two years in an effort to lure patrons and keep their doors open.
To their happy surprise, the reluctant on-line entrepreneurs are finding cyberspace fertile beyond their wildest hopes, as readers in Australia and Japan purchase what locals ignore.
Many owners now admit that the Internet may mean the salvation, and not the destruction, of their brick-and-mortar book nooks after all.
At the same time, however, these famously disorganized capitalists are finding out how tough it is to balance the digital and the down-to-earth.
Successful Internet ventures have begun to distract owners from the business of selling books to walk-in customers, eroding the character and charm that made independents unique, many proprietors fear.
``I don't want my bookstore to be the Wal-Mart of the Web,'' said Frank Kramer, owner of the esteemed Harvard Book Store in Cambridge.
``We want the Web to drive people to our store, that's the goal.
The fact is, we have tremendous potential on the Internet and could increase our sales tremendously, but we enjoy physical retailing''.
Ken Gloss, owner of the historic Brattle Book Shop, in downtown Boston, takes great pains to ensure that walk-in customers get treated as well as his on-line patrons, whose mounting orders take more and more time to process.
``Any books we put on the Web site we make sure to make available in the store first,'' Gloss said.
``We don't want our in-store customers to feel like they're left out''.
What many proprietors are finding out is that loyal customers were waiting for their chance to enjoy the convenience of on-line shopping without having to buy books from the massive corporate Web sellers like Barnes &AMP; Noble's on-line store bn.com.
``I shop on line because it's convenient, because I have to,'' said Frances Burke, a professor emeritus at Suffolk University, as she bought a book at Avenue Victor Hugo Bookshop.
``But whenever I get the chance, I come to the bookstore.
I need to touch and smell the books''.
As a cradle of the high-tech economy, the Boston area was perhaps destined for the vanguard of on-line book selling.
Wordsworth.com, created in 1993, was the world's second on-line bookstore, followed closely by Harvard.com, BrooklineBooksmith.com, and a few others.
But the movement was slow to take off, as shopkeepers either could not afford to create a Web site or saw the creation of one as a violation of their store's identity.
In January 1996, only 10 shops in the region had Web sites, and two years later, 10 more had joined them.
Today, however, nearly 150 of the region's 470 independent booksellers, many teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, have Web sites, according to the New England Booksellers Association (NEBA).
That compares with 65 of the 325 stores in the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association, the nation's other storied association of bookstore proprietors.
``We've seen a six-fold increase in the past two years,'' said Wayne ``Rusty'' Drugan, the NEBA's executive director.
``It's a groundswell''.
For some shops, the high-tech effort consists of little more than a few pretty photographs, directions to the store, a telephone number, and some staff recommendations of good reads.
``I'd have to have a crew of 20 people working constantly to get all my books on the Web site,'' said Gloss, whose site holds just a smattering of his collection.
Lacking the resources to offer millions of titles like Amazon.com, some owners have instead focused on recreating the intangible qualities of their shops on-line.
McCaffrey has a page devoted to Blue, for instance.
Gloss offers photos of handsome, leatherbound tomes.
The virtual bookstores, they admit, are pathetic by comparison with the real thing.
On ``the computer screen, there's no texture, no depth,'' Kramer said.
``I don't care how many graphics you have, it doesn't compare to the table, the shelves, the overstock area, the books at the front counter.
That has a dimension computer screens cannot accomplish''.
To make up for the physical shortcomings of the Internet, many storeowners have invested in Web sites that offer depth of stock, on-line ordering, and other conveniences.
Most now offer search engines that allow surfers to comb entire store inventories, or even to tap into databases of every book in print.
In effect, many tiny shops on the corner now have the capability of offerring the same number of books as the massive retail chains like Barnes &AMP; Noble, Borders, or Amazon.com.
Wordsworth's general manager, Sanj Kharbanda, said his store's Web site now holds about 1.2 million titles, enough variety to bring in about 125 on-line sales a day.
That converts to roughly 9 percent of total sales on a given day, he said.
``In this day and age, the minimum expectation is that we would have a Web site, and being a bookstore, a search function has become a necessary convenience,'' Kharbanda said.
And at the Boston Book Company, which occupies a less-than-glamorous second-floor stie in the city's Jamaica Plain neighborhood, Internet sales now account for half the shop's sales, co-owner Helen Kelly said.
The reason, she said, is the plentiful title list on the store's Web site.
Even the slickest home pages, however, seem hopelessly grounded in the physical world, no matter how virtual the shopping experience.
Few independent booksellers take the time to create customer profiles, or track shoppers' habits, and even fewer have employees dedicated solely to working with on-line customers.
As Richard Howorth, president of the American Booksellers Association and owner of a small bookstore in Mississippi, said, ``I have no idea how many hits I get''.
Such apparent disdain for mimicking the widely imitated strategies of Amazon.com is apparent in other ways.
Anirvan Chatterjee, founder of Bookfinder.com, where on-line book buyers browse inventories of thousands of independent bookshops around the world, said on-line book indexes like his have helped independents offer books that appear nowhere on their shelves.
With such resources available to booksellers who go on-line, there's plenty of financial sense in shuttering storefronts and doing business solely in cyberspace, Chatterjee said.
But so far, most have kept a foot in the physical world.
``A lot of sellers are finding that their on-line presence subsidizes their storefront; that just warms my heart,'' Chatterjee said.
``Book-selling is a great, historic tradition.
Amazon.com is not going to come along and change all that.''
CHICAGO (AP) -- When bookstore owner Michael Powell arrived at BookExpo America his schedule included leading a seminar on electronic publishing.
He soon discovered he was the one who needed leading.
''I figured I knew as much as anybody about it,'' Powell said.
''On Wednesday we had the seminar.
By Friday, I realized everything I said was wrong.
Fortunately, everything everybody else said was wrong, too''.
If you listened carefully the past few days at McCormick Place you could hear the sound of heads being scratched, eyes opening and minds processing it all.
BookExpo America, which ended Sunday, both confirmed and continued the rise of digital media in the publishing industry.
Lectures and panel discussions on e-books, electronic rights and related issues attracted standing-room-only crowds.
The most talked about speaker wasn't a writer but the founder and CEO of Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos.
Companies either ignored or nonexistent two years ago found themselves with all the attention they could handle.
''There seems to be a 'dot' in every sentence now,'' said Stephen Corrick, a literary agent based in Chicago.
''It's been around the fringes, but this is the first time it's gotten to the middle of the discussion.
It's a period of great excitement and confusion''.
After a year marked by Stephen King's electronic novella ''Riding the Bullet'' and multimillion dollar investments by everyone from Microsoft to Random House, few were doubting that online bookselling and print on-demand would catch on.
The question was when.
Some said in a decade, or three years, or six months.
''I think people will see this as one of the most significant moments in publishing history,'' Powell said.
''It's coming down the road at lightning speed''.
Statistics released over the weekend confirmed how quickly the market is changing.
A study reported that books sold online tripled their market share between 1998 and 1999, from 1.9 percent to 5.4 percent.
More than 50 million titles were purchased by adults and no one doubts that number will increase significantly next year.
''There is nothing we can imagine slowing down that trend,'' said Barrie Rappaport of NPD Group Inc.
, whose firm did the study.
So far, the ones most in danger of being damaged by Internet sales appear to be independent stores, which already have been hurt badly by superstore chains.
Their market share dropped from 16.6 percent to 15.2 percent in 1999, less than half of what they controlled 10 years ago.
The CEO of the American Booksellers Association, which represents thousands of independent sellers, predicted the Internet would also benefit his group's members.
Avin Mark Domnitz said that BookSense.com, a home page providing links to independent stores, should be ready by the end of the summer.
''You're going to see real changes,'' he said.
Meanwhile, the industry also talked books, the paper kind.
Many a bookseller (and journalist) visited the booth of Scholastic, Inc.
, seeking in vain an early copy of the next Harry Potter story.
The fourth in author J.K.
Rowling's series, title and content both still a mystery, is due July 8.
Anticipated titles for the fall include Margaret Atwood's novel ''The Blind Assassin''; ''The Island of Lost Maps,'' a nonfiction work by Miles Harvey about cartographic crime, and new books from Jane Hamilton, Caleb Carr and David Baldacci.
''We don't know which medium will be carrying the message, but I still think paper will be carrying the vast bulk for a long time,'' said Wendy J.
Strothman, an executive vice president at Houghton Mifflin.
''The Internet is very exciting, but you miss that opportunity for customers to browse, that serendipity of finding a book on the front table of an independent bookstore.''
In an escalating battle of the books, Amazon.com Inc.
, the online retailer, cut the prices on best-selling books by 50 percent Monday, a move that was matched hours later by its Internet rivals, Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com, all of whom will almost certainly lose money on the bargain rates.
Amazon's price-cutting comes during a rather auspicious time for its No.
2 rival, Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.
, which has imminent plans for a public offering of its Internet unit within the next few weeks.
But a company spokesman for Seattle-based Amazon.com said the timing of its discounts on books from The New York Times best-seller lists was a matter of coincidence.
``There are three things that drive this business,'' said Bill Curry, a spokesman for Amazon.
``It's selection, price and convenience.
And we are constantly working on all three of these things.
We've added convenience with distribution centers that will get merchandise faster to customers.
And this is an opportunity to do something with price''.
With a flurry of announcements on Monday, the three electronic booksellers announced virtually identical plans to cut the prices of hardcovers and paperbacks appearing on The Times best-seller lists.
That amounts to deep discounts on about 70 titles in any given week.
Generally, publishers offer books to retailers for less than half of the list price, which means that the electronic rivals will be losing money with these discounts on best sellers.
But that did not seem to deter the major booksellers, who offered similar reasons for plunging ahead.
``We intend to remain competitive in the marketplace,'' said Leonard Riggio, the chairman and chief executive of Barnes &AMP; Noble, who added that Amazon has ``changed their prices in the middle of a public offering for Barnesandnoble.com and that speaks for itself''.
With a certain element of distaste, Borders.com, a unit of Borders Group Inc.
, also announced a price-cut.
``I have to tell you that this is not the battlefield that we think we're going to win on in the long run,'' said Rich Fahle, a spokesman for Borders.com.
``But we're not going to let this distinguish us from the competition''.
None of the booksellers set any particular time limits on the 50 percent discounts.
And, in fact, Amazon was issuing refunds on the difference in price to customers who bought best-selling books shortly before its announcement of the discounts.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Kate Delhagen, director of online retail strategies for Forrester Research Inc.
, a technology research firm, said the outbreak of discounting was not particularly surprising given new competitive pressures.
There are a number of new companies that are helping book buyers to compare prices through Web site services such as Add All that instantly list shipping and title costs for major booksellers.
For example, Monday that site compared the prices for more than 24 bookstores and prominently listed Amazon for offering the best price for the best-selling children's novel, ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone''.
The list price is $16.95, but with the discount and a shipping charge, Amazon was selling the title for $12.43.
``People are using these comparison tools,'' Ms.
Delhagen said.
``And what Amazon is doing is making sure that they are there.
It's definitely a defensive strategy being deployed, but it's also part of their increasing energy to add customers to their database''.
Curry, Amazon's spokesman, declined to say whether the company would lose money on the 50 percent discounts.
``We're just not talking about whether we're selling at a profit or a loss,'' he said.
However, Curry said Amazon has decreased its reliance on book distributors and was dealing more directly with publishers.
Those efficiencies have resulted in increased savings that Amazon is now passing along to its customers, he said.
He insisted that the discounts were not a reaction to the activities of competitors.
``We don't fancy ourselves with the competition,'' he said.
``We're focused on our customers as opposed to what the competition is doing''.
&QL; NYT-05-17-99 1920EDT &QL;
SAN FRANCISCO _ A coalition of California booksellers is urging the state to be more forceful in collecting taxes from on-line bookstores.
At a gathering in San Francisco, the group of independent shopkeepers took specific aim at three giants of e-commerce: Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com.
``We demand the state's Board of Equalization collects sales tax as existing law requires,'' said Hut Landon, owner of Landon Books in Corte Madera.
``This is an instance where the state is handing major retailers a huge advantage''.
The request to the state agency was made by the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association and the American Booksellers Association.
``It's clearly discriminatory,'' said Neal Sofman, who hosted the event at his own store, A Clean Well Lighted Place for Books on Van Ness Avenue.
``If this imbalance remains, we'll lose our tax base''.
When asked about the request of the bookstore owners, Board of Equalization Chairman Johan Klehs said the state is, indeed, enforcing the existing tax code.
``In California, the rules for e-commerce are the same as catalog selling,'' Klehs said.
``If you have a nexus in California, or employees in California, you're required to collect sales tax''.
The U.S.
Advisory Committee on Electronic Commerce is considering whether to tax transactions that take place on the Internet.
The 1998 law creating the study commission placed a three-year moratorium on new taxes targeting Internet services or Internet access services.
The law does not exempt e-commerce companies from having to pay state sales taxes.
Andy Ross, who owns Cody's Books in Berkeley, said he first complained to the state in July and has received little satisfaction from the Board of Equalization so far.
``Tax policy should not be politicized,'' said Ross, who went on to accuse the Board of Equalization of bowing to Silicon Valley pressure.
``Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com are not collecting taxes in clear violation of the law.
It's bad policy and bad politics''.
The state and national booksellers associations maintain that the three on-line booksellers have a formidable presence in California and that should count as an established nexus.
``The idea that these are not California businesses is just nonsense,'' said Bill Petrocelli, owner of Book Passage in Corte Madera.
``Large Internet commerce people are being given a free ride.
That's simply wrong''.
Rich Prem, a tax partner with the accounting firm of Deloitte &AMP; Touche in San Francisco, sides with the on-line retailers, saying they are doing nothing wrong.
``The way the current tax laws work, the position that Amazon, Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders are taking is legal,'' Prem said.
``The fact that they're not collecting sales tax is perfectly legal.
The companies have set up subsidiaries for on-line retailing''.
Prem said a little-known or enforced tax, called the ``use tax,'' could be the answer to the Internet taxation riddle.
``It's a tax that's imposed on a purchaser that buys something from out of state and brings it into the state to use it,'' Prem said.
``It's been on the books in California since the 1930s, but is seldom enforced.''
BRITISH AIRWAYS IN EARLY TALKS WITH KLM &QL; Amid renewed pressure in the airline industry to consolidate, British Airways has had informal merger talks with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, executives close to both companies said.
While the executives stressed that the discussions are preliminary, it underscores the frenzy among airline operators to seek partners hoping to increase profit in an industry that has seen its margins steadily erode.
The informal talks take place amid the proposed acquisition of US Airways by UAL for $4.3 billion and overtures from AMR to Northwest about combining their businesses.
IBM IN VENTURE WITH SALESFORCE &QL; IBM and Salesforce.com, which offers software for managing sales data like contacts, leads and follow-ups, as a subscription service from its Web site, plan to announce a partnership intended to help small businesses transform themselves into e-businesses.
TECHNOLOGY'S BAD DEALS &QL; In no sector of the technology business have more companies with less revenue been acquired for richer sums than in communications equipment.
On the surface, many of these deals look good for everyone, and they often are.
But not every deal can be a success, and as the pace of acquisitions grows, so may the number of bad deals.
SEPARATING INTERNET OPERATIONS &QL; Many traditional retailers have vowed that by integrating their Web operations into their physical stores, they will eventually bury Internet-only merchants.
But even as these companies preach the gospel of Internet integration to the public, some of the best-known merchants are telling government regulators that their Internet and physical-world operations are distinct and separate businesses _ and therefore should enjoy the tax advantages of maintaining separate operations.
MOVIE TO BE TRANSMITTED DIGITALLY &QL; On Tuesday, for the first time ever, a movie will be digitally transmitted across the country over the Internet and then digitally projected to a cinema audience, going from the studio in Hollywood to a theater in Atlanta without ever touching film.
The idea is to demonstrate the potential of digital distribution _ which many think will one day supplant traditional canisters of celluloid.
TELEWEST IN TALKS FOR CHELLO STAKE Telewest Communications, Britain's second-biggest cable company, is in talks to acquire about 10 percent of Chello Broadband, a unit of United Pan-Europe Communications.
SMALL BOOKSELLERS TAKE FIGHT TO WEB &QL; Independent booksellers, which have fought a two-decades war against chains and, more recently, online booksellers, are seeking to gain ground on the Internet with two large-scale Web sites.
On June 6, the American Booksellers Association will introduce Booksense.com, a ``hub site'' for hundreds of individual sites created and maintained by local stores.
Next to come, in early July, is Contentville, in which about 40 of the most respected booksellers will provide editorial content.
``Booksense.com and Contentville can all act to remind consumers that independent booksellers have a valuable voice,'' said Roxanne Coady of R.J.
Julia Books in Madison, Conn.
, who is participating in both sites.
A `MILLIONAIRE'-`SURVIVOR' REMATCH After uncertainty about the possible consequences, ABC will again pit the hottest show of the season, ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' against CBS's highly promising newcomer ``Survivor'' on Wednesday night.
SALON'S REDESIGN Of ITS REDESIGN &QL; Hoping to soothe ruffled readers, the online magazine Salon pulled back its site redesign, which had elicited an immediate chorus of e-mail boos and hisses from readers, and introduced another new design.
The flat, sprawling warehouses of Nashville are leagues away from a New York literary lunch and repartee with a prominent author, but this prosaic side of the nation's $8 billion consumer book market _ packing, shipping and delivery _ has become a key to its future.
With the industry roiled by consolidation and the growth of Internet bookstores, gentle readers are now the focus of a frantic effort to deliver them the literary equivalent of steaming Big Macs: fast, cheap and wrapped to go.
The announcement this month that the nation's leading bookseller, Barnes &AMP; Noble, will buy the leading wholesaler, the Ingram Book Group, for $600 million is just the latest move in a shifting field of distribution networks.
There is a basic explanation for the dazzle of distribution.
With sales growth projected at less than 5 percent a year, the conglomerates that own the big publishing houses are trying to squeeze as much savings as possible from back-office functions.
Such top booksellers as Barnes &AMP; Noble and Amazon.com are looking for ways to make electronic commerce profitable and competitive by sending more of their orders through their own distribution centers.
For consumers, this means that delivery will become swifter, setting a standard of 24-hour service for online bookstores, but also increasing the speed at which special orders are filled by stores on terra firma.
While top publishers troll for new alliances to share distribution, regional distributors are on a spree of buying smaller independent publishers to spread their costs and to secure a customer base.
Daily there is speculation that Amazon.com, the e-commerce pioneer, is preparing to buy a wholesaler of its own.
Meanwhile, the Yankee Group, a technology research organization, forecasts that online sales of books will climb to $700 million by the end of this year.
Worried that they will be left by the wayside, restive independent booksellers fret that a wholesaler owned by Barnes &AMP; Noble could be manipulated to reduce service to them or to tap into their records.
``They'll be able to find out what our sales are, what the profit margin is and then find out just how vulnerable these stores are and then move in,'' said William Petrocelli, the co-owner of Book Passage, an independent store in Corte Madera, Calif.
, just north of San Francisco.
He is circulating a letter among booksellers to challenge the sale with regulators.
The Borders Group bookstore chain started building up its distribution network long ago and now owns nine centers, including four new ones in Nashville.
Last week it also announced the hiring of a new chief executive, Philip Pfeffer, who, when he was chief executive of Ingram Distribution Group, presided over the expansion of the company into the largest wholesale distributor of trade books in the world.
The book and distribution groups are both owned by Ingram Industries.
``We have always viewed distribution as a strategic asset, but frankly we used to get hammered for it because our competition didn't pay much attention to it,'' said Robert F.
DiRomualdo, chairman of the Borders Group.
``We've got to become more efficient as an industry, so I'm not surprised that everyone is moving in that direction''.
Barnes &AMP; Noble's purchase of Ingram is just the most visible example of the industry shift.
According to several top publishing executives, Amazon.com had also been talking with Nashville-based Ingram about a sale and remains interested in a purchase of Baker &AMP; Taylor, the No.
2 wholesaler, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., and has 5 distribution sites to Ingram's 11.
In response to such speculation, Baker &AMP; Taylor president James Ulsamer said, ``Anyone at the right time at the right price is for sale''.
But he added, ``There is nothing in the works''.
Amazon was just as cryptic.
``We neither confirm nor deny rumors, speculation or chitchat about what we may be or may not be doing,'' said Bill Curry, a spokesman.
One top publishing executive said Amazon had moved to cut its ties with Ingram, but John Ingram, chairman of Ingram Book Group, said that to his knowledge no such break had occurred.
Last week he sent out more than 5,000 letters to independent booksellers urging them to trust in the company's history of integrity and commitment to treat all customers equally.
``We've never shared information,'' Ingram said.
``I wouldn't have done the deal without those assurances.
Ingram people will continue to run our business with the same high degree of integrity as we've always done.
Barnes &AMP; Noble would expect nothing less''.
Barnes &AMP; Noble chairman and chief executive Leonard Riggio said his company would ``never, ever'' ask for information from Ingram about a competitor.
``From my point of view, we're actually rooting for them and every other good bookstore in America,'' he said, noting that his company needed the support of other booksellers for Ingram to grow.
``We don't see this as a Darwinian struggle.
So we see our interests lining up with them''.
It is unlikely that many booksellers will break with the company as they approach Christmas, their busiest and most profitable season.
But Ingram's pledge gives little comfort to the American Booksellers Association, which is deeply distrustful of Barnes &AMP; Noble and has sued the company in San Francisco, accusing it of unfair trade practices.
``I'm having a difficult time finding solace,'' said Avin Mark Domnitz, the chief executive of the trade group.
``It's like putting the fox in the henhouse and taking his word that he's not going to eat the chickens''.
Despite the almost visceral hostility from independent booksellers, said Albert Greco, an associate business professor at Fordham University who follows publishing, Barnes &AMP; Noble's move was born out of its need to remain competitive in ``the face of potentially damaging market inroads made by online book operators, which will transform the selling of books''.
Most publishers and distributors are already proceeding as if the Barnes &AMP; Noble purchase is a fait accompli, yet antitrust lawyers and even Wall Street analysts are more cautious about how federal regulators will regard the deal.
They predict that it will probably take much longer for the purchase to be approved than the 30 to 45 days foreseen by Barnes &AMP; Noble executives.
Pearson PLC's purchase of Simon &AMP; Schuster's education division, announced in May, remains tied up in a second round of review by the Justice Department, although the company keeps saying approval could come any day.
nn ``We think the deal was expensive and may be difficult to close because of regulatory concerns,'' Danielle Turnoff Fox, an analyst for J.P.
Morgan Securities, said of the Ingram acquisition.
Ms. Fox said that unless Barnes &AMP; Noble set up some system of fire walls, as the new owner of Ingram it would have access to extensive information about Amazon.com's actual unit sales of books online.
``There are competitive issues that are likely to come under intense scrutiny,'' she added.
J. Michael Cooper, a lawyer who specializes in antitrust cases at the Washington firm Bryan Cave, said the Federal Trade Commission would be likely to review the deal because of its experience analyzing other mergers in the book industry.
``If there are any real issues when they do their first look, this could take some time,'' he said, adding that he expected the Ingram purchase to face a second round of intensive review that could take up to six months.
Meantime, others in the industry are sizing up ways they can use distribution to overcome sluggish growth.
Last year, sales of consumer, or popular, books grew only 1 percent from 1996, which means they did not even keep pace with population growth.
During the summer, Time Warner's trade book division and HarperCollins, which is owned by News Corp.
were in talks about forming a joint distribution network, but they failed to come to an agreement, said two top publishing executives who insisted on anonymity.
This month, Random House Inc.
, now owned by Bertelsmann AG, announced a multimillion-dollar investment to expand its book distribution center in Westminster, Md.
, while also setting a date to close its warehouse in Des Plaines, Ill.
, near Chicago.
After opening a $30 million center near Charlottesville, Va.
, last year, the German media conglomerate Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck is still in the process of adding its publishing houses to the network.
While publishers strive to streamline distribution networks, regional distributors that serve independent publishers have in turn started buying up some of those publishing houses, partly to secure their customer base and to spread the costs of back-office functions.
Two leading distributors, Publishers Group West in California and the National Book Network in Maryland, are buying heavily these days.
``We're looking at perhaps three or four different deals,'' said Charles Winton, chief executive of Publishers Group West, which in the last three years has acquired four publishers through its parent company, Publishers Group Inc.
``Right now I have eight different prospectuses sitting on my desk.
It's amazing how much activity there is''.
He said he expected to double revenue from its publishing companies to nearly $20 million within 12 months.
The pace of change has been dizzying to publishers, booksellers and distributors, who talk about these recent shifts and the spate of mergers and consolidations as a sea change in the industry.
``The whole process has sped up dramatically,'' said National Book Network president Jed Lyons.
``In the past, it would take maybe two or three weeks and the book would arrive.
Today consumers aren't willing to wait two or three weeks.
They want it tomorrow.''
NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnes &AMP; Noble, the world's largest bookstore chain, called off its $600 million purchase of the world's biggest book distributor Wednesday because of opposition from antitrust regulators.
Barnes &AMP; Noble and Ingram Book Group said they worried that their businesses would suffer during a prolonged review by the Federal Trade Commission.
Some FTC staff members had concluded that the merger could give Barnes &AMP; Noble an unfair competitive position.
``The review process has been disappointing to us,'' Ingram chairman John R.
Ingram said.
``The events of the last several days have made it clear that some staff hold an outdated view of the marketplace, making an objective analysis of the transaction impossible''.
The deal has been under fire since it was announced in November.
Critics said it could allow Barnes &AMP; Noble to delay delivery of best sellers to independent stores and big rivals such as Borders, or gain access to its competitors' buying practices.
Barnes &AMP; Noble, however, had said the acquisition would have allowed Ingram to distribute a wider selection of titles and Barnes &AMP; Noble to deliver books faster and at lower cost.
The American Booksellers Association, which represents 3,400 independent bookstore companies, had been the most vocal opponent of the proposed merger.
``This shows that David can beat Goliath sometimes,'' said Oren Teicher, chief operating officer of the booksellers group.
``When this proposed deal was first announced, virtually nobody predicted that this deal could be stopped.
Small booksellers wrote letters, made phone calls, did everything to raise awareness of this issue, and against extraordinary odds, they have succeeded''.
FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky did not deny that the commission was considering blocking the deal.
He cited concerns about whether small bookstores and Internet merchants would be injured if the merger were permitted.
Barnes &AMP; Noble isn't the only company looking to expand its distribution network.
Many booksellers, including Amazon.com, are building and acquiring centers around the country to make it easier and faster to get any book to any customer.
Ingram, a subsidiary of privately held Ingram Industries Inc.
of Nashville, Tenn.
, distributes trade books, audio tapes, textbooks and specialty magazines through 11 distribution centers around the nation.
It ships 115 million titles every year.
Barnes &AMP; Noble said it will use the $600 million it had earmarked for the merger for other investments and acquisitions.
It will also go forward with plans to build two new distribution centers of its own, one in Reno, Nev.
, the other in Memphis, Tenn.
NEW YORK _ With competition intensifying among electronic booksellers, Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.
announced Thursday that it would sell shares to the public of its money-losing online venture, which trails in sales behind the pioneering leader, Amazon.com.
Barnes &AMP; Noble, the nation's largest bookstore chain, intends to sell 20 percent of the online venture, Barnesandnoble.com, which generated $14 million in sales last year in contrast to Amazon's $147.8 million.
The initial public offering could take place in the next 30 days, the company said.
``They're using the IPO to televise that they have online capability, and secondly to enrich the value of Barnes &AMP; Noble stock, which is going to retain 80 percent'' of the online venture, said Linda Killian, portfolio manager for Renaissance Capital Corp.
in Greenwich, Conn.
Shares of Barnes &AMP; Noble rose 7.5 percent Thursday, or $2.8125, to $40.0625, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
While the overall stock market has recently slumped, some new issues of Web-based businesses, like Geocities, have risen sharply.
At the same time Barnes &AMP; Noble announced its plans for a public offering, the company said that its loss for the second quarter tripled, primarily because of a $23 million loss from the online venture.
Barnes &AMP; Noble reported a loss of $5.7 million, or 8 cents a share fully diluted, compared with a loss of $1.37 million, or 2 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
Revenue rose 9.3 percent, to $675 million.
The results were in line with Wall Street analysts' forecasts.
Citing Security and Exchange Commission restrictions, Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &AMP; Noble in New York, declined to answer questions about why the company intends to make the offering or how the proceeds would be used.
Typically, when a company spins off a division it could mean that the unit's executives will get more independence and stock option incentives that give them more of a stake in the company, Ms.
Killian of Renaissance Capital said.
``It would make them more competitive with Amazon.com,'' she said.
During the summer, Barnes &AMP; Noble hired several top executives for the online venture, including a new chief financial officer, and two vice presidents in marketing and international strategies.
One of the new executives, John Rindlaub Jr.
, comes with marketing experience from Shoplink Inc.
, a PC-based grocery shopping and home delivery company.
The chief executive of the online venture will remain Stephen Riggio, the vice chairman of Barnes &AMP; Noble, whose roots are in traditional bookselling.
The number of users of the company's Web site (www.barnesandnoble.com) has continued to grow, with 720,000 customers by early August, compared with 500,000 last May.
These gains come as the company redesigned its Web site to offer one-click ordering.
The online division is also preparing to introduce a new advertising campaign in the fall with a projected 1998 advertising budget of $35 million to $40 million.
The New York office of TBWA Chiat/Day was named last month to handle the account.
But the competition among online bookstores could intensify with the entry of the German media conglomerate, Bertelsmann AG, which is expected to open its online store, Booksonline, in Europe and the United States in the fall.
The Borders Group Inc.
started its online bookstore earlier this year although the company, the second-largest bookstore retailer, has been concentrating more on overseas expansion with the opening of conventional bookstores in London and Singapore.
NEW YORK (AP) -- Challenging Barnesandnoble.com's claim that ``If we don't have your book nobody does,'' a division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus has called for the online bookseller to discontinue or modify the slogan.
``If you were to interpret the slogan literally, it would discourage searches from other sources,'' Nicholas Vianna, advertising review specialist with the group's National Advertising Division, said Tuesday.
``In the book industry there are private books, local publishers, all kinds of books.
Some of the independent sellers make their livelihood on that special niche market''.
The American Booksellers Association, which filed a complaint last December, compiled a list of 100 out-of-print titles and found 24 that were available only through competitors of Barnesandnoble.com.
They included such obscure works as ``Cartels, Combines &AMP; Trusts in Post-War Germany'' and ``Studies in Machiavellianism''.
``A lot of independent booksellers complained because that slogan just wasn't accurate,'' said Richard Howorth, president of the ABA, whose membership consists overwhelmingly of independent stores.
Although Barnesandnoble.com agreed to comply with last week's decision, as of Tuesday the slogan still appeared on its Web site.
``We disagreed with the NAD's recommendation but chose to comply because we were moving away from that advertising slogan,'' said Mary Ellen Keating, a spokesperson for Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.
``We agreed to remove or modify the slogan over the next several months''.
Vianna had hoped for a quicker response.
``We would hope the changes would happen as soon as possible,'' Vianna said.
``The agreement calls for compliance within a reasonable period of time.
And several months seems too long, especially in the case of a Web site''.
The National Advertising Division is a self-regulating body established by the advertising industry.
Compliance with NAD decisions is voluntary, but some cases end up referred to the Federal Trade Commission.
LOS ANGELES _ There was no new John Grisham, no new Anne Rice, no new Tom Wolfe either.
But there was, thank goodness, a new Michael Crichton, a new Scott Turow, a new William Least Heat-Moon, plus Frank McCourt's eagerly anticipated sequel to ``Angela's Ashes'' and Thomas Harris' long-awaited sequel to ``The Silence of the Lambs''.
So as the country's independent booksellers and publishers gathered last weekend for their annual prom _ now called BookExpo America _ there was reason for hope about upcoming books and the selling seasons ahead.
Hope, but hardly ecstasy.
But then, this is a national convention where the main commodity these days is irony.
Major publishers mounted massive displays that filled two halls of the mammoth Los Angeles Convention Center, but found themselves hawking wares to an ever-diminishing sector of the marketplace.
Independent booksellers have been assaulted first by chain superstores, then Internet purveyors led by Seattle's Amazon.com, so the ``indies'' have seen their portion of the book market cut in half (to 16.6 percent) during this decade and membership in their trade organization drop from 5,200 to 3,500.
The convention's first day also included the distressing announcement of a national study that found that, despite a booming economy, sales of books sold to adults dropped 3 percent last year.
Chain stores claimed 25 percent of sales, while Internet purveyors (measured for the first time) claimed 2 percent, as indie share continued its decline.
Things have gotten so grim for independents that they come to the annual confab of the American Booksellers Association wondering about the latest book stores killed in action and, as bookseller John Barrigner of Charlotte, N.C., put it, ``which of our good friends we won't see this year''.
Worries about their fate have reached such a state that booksellers in their official annual meeting portion of the convention found themselves debating whether to censure McCourt, winner of the Pulitzer Prize and one of the country's best-selling authors.
The phenomenal success of ``Angela's Ashes'' had paid many bookseller bills since publication, and it had been given an annual prize (the ABBY award) as the book that independents most enjoyed selling.
But McCourt had gone on to commit what some independents considered a traitorous act.
He had appeared in a TV commercial extolling the virtues of the Web site of Barnes &AMP; Noble.
So a handful of upstart independents urged a censure of McCourt and a request that he return his ABBY.
The motion failed handily Saturday afternoon, but only after a spirited and sometimes heated debate.
``I'm not political, I don't know the details of the bookseller war,'' McCourt said the next morning.
``If I had known, I might have thought twice about appearing in that ad.
I am in favor of independents, but the big boys sell books, too.
A writer's real job is to write books.
But if you look at the stores where I appeared on behalf of `Angela's Ashes,' it was probably 15 to 1 in favor of independents.
My conscience is clear''.
The McCourt imbroglio was one of the few contentious moments at a convention repeatedly described as ``businesslike''.
It may have been held in the city that defines glitz, but the three-day proceedings had a workmanlike air, perhaps in part because the weather outside the hall was chilly and gray and offered little temptation.
Even a cocktail party at the Playboy Mansion to celebrate Grove/Atlantic's upcoming publication of ``The Century of Sex'' _ undoubtedly the weekend's hottest ticket _ seemed deflated by the weather.
At poolside, chairman Hugh Hefner looked distinctly chilly in his trademark smoking jacket and silk pajama pants, and the two statuesque Playboy Bunnies in their skimpy costumes seemed in real danger of contracting chest colds.
The convention's estimated 29,000 visitors were encouraged by some marketplace moves by the ABA, highlighted by the unveiling of the new Web site BookSense.com, which will allow individual independent stores to have their own customized presence on the Internet.
It will draw upon the strength of bookseller numbers and process orders from customers.
This may not terrify Amazon.com, but it did excite independents.
Throughout the weekend, they crowded around demos of the Web site, expected to be running within six months, and a poster was often updated with the number of BookSense enrollees, up to a robust 865 booksellers by Sunday afternoon.
Avin Domnitz, ABA executive director, was ecstatic.
``When we started introducing BookSense at regional meetings, we hoped to come to this convention with 300 stores enrolled so that it would be a legitimate program,'' Domnitz said.
``And we thought that if we left the convention with 500 stores, we would have reached critical mass''.
On the book front, this fall's offerings seemed solid, although no one book seemed to spark the kind of buzz that some books have enjoyed at past conventions.
Strong non-fiction titles include memoirs by astronaut John Glenn (Bantam), Sen.
John McCain (Random House) and McCourt (Scribner); and biographies of Hillary Clinton by Gail Sheehy (Random House), Jack Dempsey by Roger Kahn (Harcourt Brace) and Nelson Mandela by Anthony Sampson (Knopf).
There is also William Least Heat-Moon's river journey across America (Houghton Mifflin); Richard Rhodes' timely examination of why people commit violent crimes (Knopf); John Nathan's inside look at the rise and fall of Sony (Houghton Mifflin); Seattle author Erik Larson's recreation of a 1900 Texas hurricane, ``Isaac's Storm'' (Ballantine); Susan Faludi's look at the plight of the American male, ``Stiffed'' (Morrow); and Michael ``Liar's Poker'' Lewis' Silicon Valley saga, ``The New New Thing'' (Norton).
Strong fiction titles include Turow's ``Personal Injuries'' (Farrar Straus), Crichton's ``Timeline'' (Knopf), Claire Messud's ``The Last Life'' (Harcourt Brace), Brian Herbert and Kevin J.
Anderson's prequel to ``Dune'' titled ``Dune: House Atreides'' (Bantam), and Harris' ``Lambs'' sequel, ``Hannibal'' (Dell).
The most eagerly awaited fall children's book, hands down, is the second Harry Potter book by British author J.K.
Rowling, ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' (Scholastic).
The already published British edition has prompted an Internet shopping frenzy across borders.
AUSTIN _ Abe Zimmerman had not been to a trade show in years, and never to one for booksellers.
But as the new president of Book People, he flew to Chicago for a quick, total immersion at Book Expo.
He took along experienced guides: the Austin store's buying director Tracey Tarlton and marketing manager David Hutts, a veteran of the Book Expos that serve as the American Bookseller Association's annual conventions.
By Saturday night Zimmerman was eating dinner with author Tim O'Brien, swapping golf stories and talking about store events.
But he found the atmosphere at the convention perplexing.
``This is an industry that's changing dramatically right now,'' Zimmerman said, ``and I'm not so sure how many people know what's going on and how to react''.
A businessman who helped start Katz's Delicatessen and was part of a hi-tech start-up company called Technology Works, he said he found the energy at Book Expo less than dynamic.
``I felt like these were people who weren't in control of their fate any more''.
Independent booksellers face tough times.
Those who have lasted through changes in the business continue to quietly look for ways to do better and more efficiently what they have a reputation for doing: providing personal service.
``I did feel everyone understands the importance of independent stores,'' Zimmerman said.
``As an independent, I felt well received (by publishers)''.
Last year several top publishing houses, including Random House, skipped the convention because of tensions with the ABA, which had sued them for making discount deals with chains.
This year most large publishers came back, though in reduced numbers, and used less exhibit space.
The convention attracted 1,500 exhibitors, with 400 authors promoting their books.
In this era when a recent newsletter from the famed Tattered Cover bookstore in Denver warned that the big chains are ringing the independents with stores, attempting to squeeze them out, and when books are sold at Randalls and Sam's, not to mention on the Internet, Austin independents face a clear challenge.
A consumer purchasing report released by the Book Industry Study Group shows that independent booksellers experienced a 1.4 percent market-share decline last year, down to 17 percent of the books purchased.
Chains accounted for 25 percent.
Most books are now sold in nontraditional outlets _ everywhere from car washes to discount stores _ or through book clubs and electronic bookstores.
``It's important for independent bookstores to have a distinctive flavor and still cover the bases,'' said Tarlton, ``to also carry the bestsellers people expect to see''.
She spent much of her time gathering galleys from better smaller presses.
At Toad Hall, children's events including author readings and special lunches have been a priority to bring customers to the Austin store, which is owned by Barbara Bonds Thomas, outgoing president of the ABA.
This year the store was singled out at Book Expo and awarded the Pannell Award for innovative children's events.
More and more, independent booksellers appear to be facing the reality that increased service _ the more specific the better _ is their best chance of keeping customers at a time when sales have been disheartening.
In the last seven years, membership in the ABA dropped by almost half, to 3,500 this year, as independent bookstores closed.
Sales were flat last year and consumer spending on adult fiction and non-fiction increased by less than 1 percent.
An independent bookseller manager in Missouri said that she realized that with 55 churches in her area the residents had a deep interest in religion.
She came to the convention to check out religious titles.
``Our customers still don't trust the Internet to send them books,'' the bookseller said.
``They'll come into the store with a list they've printed off Amazon.com and want us to get the books for them''.
Now she is looking at a process introduced at the convention by Ingram Distributors called Lightning Print.
It allows books to be stored digitally and printed one at a time on demand.
Although conglomerates increasingly control publishing, there is still room for specialized service, and individual stores.
``One bookstore that's enthusiastic can make a book of poetry,'' said Michael Wiegers, managing editor of the award-winning Copper Canyon Press in Port Townsend, Wash.
, though he says such a store might be part of a chain or an independent.
The bookseller of the year for the African American booksellers' group, Blackboard, Michele Lewis of New Orleans started a store in her mid-20s.
She has seen her business grow in a few years to a second store and stresses personal service to a niche market.
Accepting the award, she thanked God, her mother, and her family and friends for allowing the business to grow.
Emma Rodgers, owner of Black Images in Dallas and a director of the ABA, said an African American Booksellers school held in Chicago before Book Expo was well attended.
During the convention, the sale of Random House to the Bertelsmann German conglomerate was confirmed and many sellers saw that as bad news.
Avin Domnitz, executor director of the ABA, said: ``Consolidation of books and publishers has never worked to the advantage of the independent''.
Increasingly, the booksellers association is involved in litigation as independents fight back any way they can against changes they see as threatening their survival in the industry.
A suit by the ABA accusing Borders and Barnes &AMP; Noble of antitrust violations is still awaiting a formal response.
``We're still in the early stages (of litigation),'' he said.
Though they may be tired from fighting for economic survival, the booksellers showed their trademark idealism.
They rallied around Bill Kramer, whose Washington, D.C., bookstore refused to hand over the bookbuying records of former White House intern Monica Lewinsky to independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
Said ABA board member Oren Teicher: ``There's no more important issue than that information about books they have purchased is personal and confidential''.
Booksellers have long seen themselves as involved in a marketplace of ideas and, as such, different from the owners of hardware and drugstores.
The Kramer case gives them an opportunity to cling to that while all around them appears to be changing.
Anne Morris is the book editor for the Austin American-Statesman Story Filed By Cox Newspapers For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service
WASHINGTON _ The staff of the Federal Trade Commission has concluded that the planned merger between the nation's largest bookseller and its largest book wholesaler violates antitrust law and has recommended that the full commission step in to block Barnes &AMP; Noble's $600 million acquisition of Ingram Book Group, a person involved in the deal said on Monday night.
The decision, a significant victory for both publishers and independent booksellers, which have waged a powerful campaign against the proposed deal since it was announced last year, does not bode well for the planned acquisition.
Lawyers for Barnes &AMP; Noble and Ingram, a unit of Ingram Industries, will try to make their case soon to the full commission.
But the commissioners rarely overturn the recommendations of their staff.
And if the recommendations are upheld, the two companies will have to decide whether it is worth waging a protracted and uncertain legal fight.
Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &AMP; Noble, said on Monday night that the company had been working closely with the commission and was providing information that the agency had requested.
``These are confidential proceedings,'' Ms.
Keating said, ``and we're not going to comment on speculation''.
Barnes &AMP; Noble proposed the merger during a period of consolidation and turmoil in the publishing and book-selling industries.
Top executives from the company have hailed the deal as a rare opportunity to recognize great cost-savings through consolidation.
Barnes &AMP; Noble, in particular, has been in the middle of a buying binge as part of its response to growing competition on line, particularly from Amazon.com.
Amazon.com, which started by relying almost exclusively on wholesalers to fill its orders, remains dependent on the services of Ingram.
Ingram has been its leading supplier, filling more than 58 percent of its orders, according to Amazon.com.
The acquisition would give Barnes &AMP; Noble access to 11 distribution centers, which would help it cut costs and reduce delivery time for its growing base of on-line customers.
But from the moment the proposed deal was announced last November, it was denounced by groups representing writers and smaller booksellers.
One group likened it to the marriage of Godzilla and King Kong.
The independent booksellers, led by their trade group, the American Booksellers Association, have waged a fierce legal and letter-writing campaign, hoping to enlist not only the federal regulators, but state antitrust officials as well.
Officials in California said they were investigating the deal.
For the independent booksellers, the worst fears are that a new book conglomerate mixing Ingram and Barnes &AMP; Noble could ultimately affect issues like credit, speed of delivery and access to popular titles that are in short supply.
Although Ingram, which is based in Nashville, is a dominant force in book distribution, it does not disclose its market share.
Barnes &AMP; Noble has about 14 percent of the retail book market.
The American Booksellers Association, along with Amazon.com, the New York-based Authors Guild, and others had filed papers with the Federal Trade Commission urging it to intervene and block the deal.
But the legal case has hardly been open-and-shut.
While federal regulators have been more rigorously examining proposed mergers during the Clinton administration than in earlier years, they have taken on so-called horizontal ones, that is, those between companies in the same line of business, and have only rarely challenged ``vertical'' mergers involving businesses in different aspects of an industry, like Barnes &AMP; Noble and Ingram.
Oren Teicher, the chief operating officer of the American Booksellers Association in Tarrytown, N.Y., said he had not heard of the FTC staff's position on the merger but added that the association would be ``extremely gratified'' to see it blocked.
For the nation's bookstores, Teicher said, the merger would be ``terribly anticompetitive''.
Many of the smaller bookstores rely on Ingram as the sole source for books, though the larger stores typically place orders directly through publishers as well as through Ingram and the second-largest wholesaler, Baker &AMP; Taylor.
Independent booksellers had organized one of the most elaborate opposition campaigns in the recent history of the book industry, with so many petitions, E-mail messages and telephone appeals to the FTC that the agency had set aside a special line just to record calls about the Ingram deal.
The FTC has been performing what is known as a second request review, a fairly uncommon procedure that allows the agency to extend its examination of the competitive impact of a proposed deal.
Other recent deals in the book industry faced intense reviews from federal regulators but were still eventually approved.
The British media group Pearson PLC faced this extra round of inspection for its purchase of Simon &AMP; Schuster's education unit, which was ultimately approved.
Bertelsmann A.G.'s successful acquisitions of Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell also received additional attention.
NEW YORK _ Facing intensifying competition, the nation's trade association for independent booksellers is creating its own national online store, Book Sense, to stave off fierce competition from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
The online venture, which is scheduled to open for business this summer, is the most ambitious element in a series of countermeasures to promote independent bookstores by the American Booksellers Association, the dominant trade group for a beleaguered fraternity that has seen its share of the popular consumer book market shrink to about 17 percent today from 32 percent in 1991.
Those pressures have continued to intensify with competition from superstore chains and online bookstores, prompting some store owners to abandon the business with bitter complaints that they are under siege.
The electronic bookstore and a planned national marketing campaign are the first collective efforts of an ordinarily disparate group of independents.
The goals is to compete against some of the forces that have reduced ABA membership to about 3,300 from 5,200 in 1992.
``We're not trying to knock off the Goliaths _ I don't want to look naive,'' said Hut Landon, a bookstore owner in Mill Valley, Calif.
, and the executive director of the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association, which developed the pilot concept last year.
``All we're trying to do is retain our market share.
We recognize that we've got to do this in this day and age.
We can't just be quaint little booksellers in our community asking how the kids are''.
The association already has organized a series of 12 customer focus groups along with the development of the electronic bookstore.
In its initial stages, the store will feature all the standard functions of popular online sites, including a search engine, a stock of 1.5 million titles, credit card fulfillment, gift wrapping, distribution services and a best-seller list.
But it will also allow individual stores to tailor Web pages to reflect their individuality with store reviews and features.
``What we're really trying to do is find the different ways that we can do what our competitors are doing,'' said Michael F.
Hoynes, the association's newly hired marketing officer.
He said initial interest in the program was enthusiastic because booksellers have been asking for a collective approach.
The booksellers' association, based in Tarrytown, N.Y., will begin its first national marketing campaign in May for the Book Sense brand, which in some ways is inspired by the example of the independent hardware stores that promote themselves under the True Value label.
The association plans to spend about $2 million to develop the electronic bookstore and about $2 million more on the marketing campaign _ money that comes in part from its half-share of $25 million that the association won from Penguin Group USA in a dispute over favorable discounts that were given to large retail bookstore chains.
In Northern California, where there is a strong and active group of independent booksellers, the regional association has also spent about $100,000 to promote a common identity under the name Book Sense.
The brand and a slogan, ``Independent Bookstores for Independent Minds,'' are appearing in newspaper advertisements and on decals, posters, and plastic shopping bags in the Bay Area, where more than 200 bookstores have signed up to participate in the pilot program.
But the collective approach envisioned by the national association is broader in scope, conceivably allowing customers to order books online with the freedom to pick up or return a book at any participating Book Sense store.
The association is already in discussions with a national wholesaler, Baker &AMP; Taylor, to provide distribution services, a critical element for an online service that caters to customers with swift delivery.
It is also considering expanding the electronic title base to include out-of-print books.
At this point, the pricing system still is being determined, although individual bookstore owners will have great flexibility to offer discounts on their templates, said Len Vlahos, the association's spokesman.
Within the next few months, the association will start signing up members to participate in the electronic project, which would cost bookstore owners monthly development fees expected to range from $175 to $450.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Several technology analysts said that the move was a vital step to protect the booksellers eroding turf, and noted that the independents may be able to capitalize on strengths in ways that Amazon.com and Barnes &AMP; Noble cannot.
David Brodwin, an associate partner with Andersen Consulting who follows electronic commerce, said the Book Sense venture would draw on the loyalty of customers who prefer local bookstores over corporations.
``Independents will feature locally relevant information _ travel, restaurant guides, local history _ with a degree of sophistication and connoisseurship that the nationwide players may have trouble matching,'' Brodwin said.
He cautioned, though, that associations often move slowly.
That could present problems for success in electronic commerce, which requires decisiveness and speed.
Kate Delhagen, the director of online retail strategies for Forrester Research Inc.
, a technology research company, said that independent booksellers had no choice but to act because customers' shopping habits were changing.
Forrester projects that almost $1.2 billion in book purchases will be made online this year, she said.
Spending will rise in 2003 to almost $3 billion, or about 18 percent of the book market, she added.
``The book lover in me is thrilled to hear about this for the independents,'' Ms.
Delhagen said.
``Banding together and forming a network is the only way.
This is a huge opportunity for them to survive, because long term, they're getting eviscerated.
There is an option now rather than shuttering their stores.
This development presents them with an opportunity to say, `I'm sticking around, and we're not letting Amazon and Barnes &AMP; Noble run us out of town.'''
Less than a year and a half after buying the nation's premier publishing house, the Bertelsmann media conglomerate is poised to form a partnership with an American icon of popular literature, Time Inc.'s Book-of-the-Month Club.
Bertelsmann _ which is based in Gutersloh, Germany, and purchased Random House last year _ is negotiating to create a joint venture that could bring together the two largest book clubs in the United States, the Book-of-the-Month Club and Bertelsmann's Literary Guild, according to publishing executives who asked to remain anonymous.
Both clubs have been pondering how to compete against online booksellers in a book market radically changed from the days when judges made Book-of-the-Month Club selections over sherry that had the power to spread literary culture to readers isolated far from bookstores.
Bertelsmann's Doubleday Direct, of which the Literary Guild is a part, has been negotiating with Time Inc.
for more than six weeks in an effort to strike a deal this month.
But both sides have not reached an agreement yet on the financial terms or determined which company would operate the club, according to publishing executives close to the negotiations.
The companies have made tentative plans to create a six-member board presiding over the joint venture that will be evenly divided between executives of Bertelsmann and Time Warner, Time Inc.'s corporate parent.
Executives at Bertelsmann and Time Inc.
refused to discuss the negotiations.
``We are declining politely, but firmly, to comment,'' said Peter Costiglio, a spokesman for Time Inc.
Liz Young, a U.S. spokeswoman for Bertelsmann, also would not comment.
However, one publishing executive familiar with the negotiations said that a joint venture would enable the two book clubs to cut costs by sharing ``back end functions'' such as distribution and warehousing.
The problem is that book club sales growth has been hurt by ``a couple of factors, most prominently online book sales,'' he said.
``In the case of the Book-of-the-Month-Club, they've really been struggling over the last couple of years, so this is an opportunity to put some operational systems together''.
Such fierce competition obviously did not exist when the Book-of-the-Month Club's founder, Harry Scherman, invented the book club in the United States in 1926 with a gimmick that relied on a literary stamp of approval from experts like Heywood Broun and Christopher Morley, who selected the best new books for a reading public hungry for literature.
The general book club strategy has been to entice a reader with promotional offers like a four-book purchase for $2 if the customer agrees to buy a specified number of other titles at regular prices.
For readers living far from a bookstore, the system offered a convenient alternative.
But with the rise of online bookselling and instant purchases at the click of a computer mouse, book clubs in the late 1990s were forced to offer something more than discounts.
``They have tremendous costs in finding new members,'' said Albert N.
Greco, an associate business professor at Fordham University who tracks book publishing.
``If these two clubs could cut down on their promotion and mailing costs they could save a lot of money''.
During the 1990s consolidation narrowed the chief players in the book club business to three companies, Bertelsmann's Doubleday Direct, Time Inc.'s Book-of-the-Month Club and Rodale Press' &UR; &LR; six holdings, including the health-oriented Prevention Book Club.
To counter online competition, the book clubs refined their marketing techniques and promoted their ability to filter choice books on specialty topics for harried readers who did not have the time to do it themselves.
The Book-of-the-Month Club sells general hardcover titles, but it also includes eight other clubs that offer books in niche markets like the One Spirit Christian Book Club or the History Book Club.
Together all of the clubs have a combined membership of 4.5 million members, according to the company.
Last year the Book-of-the-Month Club's revenues were estimated at about $280 million, roughly comparable to the revenues of Doubleday Direct.
Doubleday says it has a membership list of 4.8 million with book clubs that include the Literary Guild, as well as a collection of other smaller clubs like the fast-growing Christian club, Crossings, and a children's book club.
The most recent statistics from the Association of American Publishers indicate that the books clubs have been holding their own, but executives complain they have not been growing as fast as online booksellers.
Mail order companies like Readers Digest that have suffered from a free fall in sales, which have plunged as much as 20 percent from a year earlier.
For the year through October, net sales for book clubs had reached $950 million, an increase of 4.5 percent over the comparable period a year earlier.
Last year, with $1.2 billion in book club sales, that category accounted for 5.4 percent of the total $22 billion book market that includes consumer books, textbooks, and professional titles.
Bertelsmann also has a substantial stake in the online business, with a 40 percent interest in Barnesandnoble.com.
Under the tentative plans, Bertelsmann and Time Inc.
will allow the two literary clubs to remain in their present locations with separate identities _ the Book-of-the-Month Club in Manhattan and the Literary Guild in Garden City, N.Y. &QL;
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``I'm a writer now,'' Bill Murray announced to a crowd of publishers and booksellers, ``and in order to give you a feeling for the book that I've written I have come completely unprepared''.
Murray, co-author of the golf book and memoir ``A Cinderella Story,'' was speaking Saturday at BookExpo America, the industry's annual convention.
``I became a writer,'' he continued, ``back in 1999.
I had approximately, uh, the rest of the month to finish it.
And those of you who know the month of February know what I'm talking about''.
He joked about his inability to meet deadlines, apologized for exceeding his allotted speaking time and offered encouragement to all the independent booksellers in his own special way.
``I've never gone to the Internet and sat down and read anything,'' he said.
``But I've never gone to the Internet and shoplifted, either.''
LOS ANGELES _ The reviews are in for last year's books and the reading is not pleasant.
A new industry study indicates that the popular market for literature declined, with the number of purchases dropping for the first time in seven years despite the growing presence of electronic bookstores and the easy availability of titles.
The widely publicized arrival of online booksellers has failed so far to expand the market for popular fiction and nonfiction even as demand has fallen for mass-market paperback books and as affluent, educated readers buy fewer titles, according to the Book Industry Study Group, a trade group that tracks the reading habits of 16,000 households.
That conclusion may defy the conventional wisdom of some of the top publishers who gathered in Southern California Sunday at the Los Angeles Convention Center for Book Expo America, the annual and sometimes uneasy business reunion of independent booksellers and their suppliers.
A day before the release of the survey on Friday, Peter Olson, the chief executive of Random House, the unit of Bertelsmann AG that is the nation's largest publisher, appeared on a panel, ``Bookselling in the Next Millennium''.
During the discussion, he insisted that book sales on line amounted to incremental growth rather than a shift of purchases from other traditional outlets.
But the new consumer-research study indicates that sales over all declined almost 3 percent, to 1.04 billion books purchased _ literary spoils that were divided among a shifting group of booksellers.
For the first time that electronic commerce was measured as a category, online stores captured 2 percent of the book market while independent booksellers continued to lose share, which declined less than one percentage point, to 16.6 percent.
The large bookstore chains raised their part of the market slightly to 25.3 percent, reflecting their own slowing expansion of brick-and-bookshelf stores.
The rest of the bookselling market includes everything from mail order companies to warehouse chains to food and drug stores.
With the widespread availability of books and the plethora of titles on the market, booksellers struggled to understand why they were not reaching more readers.
The downturn in sales comes as the economy continues to thrive and the number of small independent publishers has grown in the last 10 years to more than 53,400 companies.
Many of those small publishers and large houses from New York stocked the vast convention center here with books, hoping to appeal to independent booksellers.
By necessity, those booksellers are banding together to create a common electronic bookstore of their own, Book Sense, which has now signed up more than 860 members.
Avin Domnitz, the chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, said the study reflected other research the trade group had conducted to prepare for the August start of the Book Sense site on the World Wide Web.
``Young people, in particular,'' Domnitz said, are ``so busy and so mobile that the acquisition of these things are just not on their priority list''.
That group is reading, he noted _ not necessarily traditional books but perhaps information on line.
Much of the softness in the market is attributable to the falling popularity of paperbacks; those books once ushered in a revolution in popular reading because of their modest cost and easy portability.
The weakness of paperback sales took their toll on used bookstores, book clubs, mail-order companies, even drugstores _ all of which experienced declines in their shares of the market.
Mass-market paperback sales sagged more than 21 percent at drugstores and 17 percent at used bookstores _ reflecting a shift in American reading habits by customers who may prefer the larger type of discounted hardcovers or more expensive trade paperbacks.
Cost may also have driven away potential customers: the average price of paid for a paperback book outpaced the rate of inflation over the last five years, rising to $4.56 from $4.12 in 1994.
To deal with the age factor, the Association of American Publishers has created an publicity campaign featuring celebrity bookworms and a slogan, ``Get Caught Reading,'' to try to reach the young, but there's heavy work ahead.
In particular, readers younger than 25 bought fewer books last year, with purchases down by 20 percent.
Older customers between 55 and 64 remained loyal, the study showed, buying 15 percent more books.
Readers with annual incomes of more than $75,000 are usually heavy book-buyers, but last year they also cut back.
In general, readers bought fewer fiction titles and pared even more on nonfiction, like biographies and history, which declined in sales by 12 percent.
The customers younger than 40 who did shift to online book-shopping displayed rather different reading tastes than those of the general market.
Popular fiction topped E-commerce sales at 33 percent, followed by 14 percent for technical and science books, 12 percent for cookbooks and crafts titles and 11 percent for psychological and recovery books.
In the general market, popular fiction has a much more commanding presence _ 51 percent _ followed by religious titles at 10 percent and cookbooks at 9 percent. The study notes that religious-book buyers did not seem to respond to electronic bookstores, but did buy enough titles in other outlets to expand the segment's share of the market by more than 1 percent.
Over all, customers bought fewer books in every category except in categories for travel and religion.
Domnitz, whose organization helped finance the study, still believes there is a potential for expanding the market.
``The problem is that about half of the population is not going to purchase books in the course of a year,'' he said.
``And so we have to concentrate on those who do.''
``You've Got Mail'' is an enticing first kiss of a film, with stars Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks as irresistible as free puppies outside a store and New York City looking like a flower-bedecked nirvana, which is why audiences are falling hard for this season's most popular romantic comedy.
But there is one group of people who watch ``You've Got Mail'' and see something other than Hollywood romance.
Never mind the ``Somewhere Over the Rainbow'' romantics of Nora Ephron's film.
Independent booksellers focus more on the movie's subplot and feel as though they are watching their own funeral.
Because ``You've Got Mail'' is the first popular entertainment to focus on the plight of embattled independent booksellers as they try to survive the tidal wave of chain superstores (Barnes &AMP; Noble, Borders) along with such online competitors as Seattle-based Amazon.com.
It is a tense battle that has involved not only a war of words, but also lawsuits as independent booksellers have taken their case to court, alleging that chain superstores have engaged in unfair trade practices and extracted favoritism from publishers.
The chains still march on.
In six years, independent booksellers have gone from selling one-third of the books in this country to half that percentage and many beloved independents have closed, including the recent demise of the Printers Inc.
bookstore in Palo Alto, Calif.
So while other viewers feel a tug at their heartstrings as the Ryan and Hanks characters perform their wise-cracking mating ritual, booksellers brush away tears as the adorable little children's bookstore run by Ryan's character (Kathleen Kelly) is imperiled by a chain superstore run by Hanks' character (Joe Fox).
The fictional Fox &AMP; Sons Books (carbon copy of a Barnes &AMP; Noble) muscles its way into the same Manhattan neighborhood, offering it trademark mix of what Fox laughing describes as ``cheap books and legal addictive stimulants''.
And in about six months, a sign goes up on the front door of The Shop Around the Corner, which was started by Kelly's mother and had been in the family ever since.
``After 42 years,'' the sign announces, ``we are closing.
We have loved being a part of your lives''.
``The movie made me feel very sad about what is happening in our business,'' admits Carol Santaro, co-owner of the Fremont Place bookstore in Seattle.
``We were both thankful the film brings out these issues, especially for those who might not be aware''.
```You've Got Mail' does portray many of the problems for independent bookstores in this country,'' says Paul Hanson, manager of Eagle Harbor Book Co.
on Bainbridge Island, Wash.
``Meg Ryan's bookstore did close in the movie and that's the plight of a lot of bookstores these days''.
The bookselling duel in the film _ which representatives at Barnes &AMP; Noble's headquarters in New York City declined to discuss _ is perhaps nowhere better mirrored in the Seattle area than in the bustling environs of University Village shopping center.
There, a two-level Barnes &AMP; Noble superstore, already having supplanted the long-established Kay's Bookmark, draws a steady crowd of customers, who stroll through its wide aisles and sprawl in its overstuffed chairs as the upbeat elevator music of ``Guantanamera'' plays over loudspeakers.
The upstairs children's section at Barnes &AMP; Noble is a showcase of big bucks being spent to attract little customers (and their parents), with huge cardboard cutouts of favorite characters from children's books, as well as tiny tables and stools and some kid Adirondack chairs.
From the picture windows in the department can be seen University Village shops and parking lots and not far beyond them, a bright blue shape.
It turns out to be the awning on the front of a small bookstore for children _ All for Kids Books and Music.
Inside, owner Chauni Haslet presides over a thriving independent of 4,000 square feet that sprawls through several rooms of varying shapes and sizes.
It is a homespun, handwritten notes, crazy quilt kind of place.
Haslet's attitude mirrors that of Ryan's character in the film.
While Kelly derides her chain-store competition as a ``theme park, multilevel mocha-cino land,'' Haslet simply refers to hers by its initials, which she jokes stand for ``Big &AMP; Nasty''.
```You've Got Mail' is remarkably true, although it is unfortunate that Tom Hanks makes the big guys look really lovable,'' Haslet says.
``That's not the sense I have of the big guys''.
The 54-year-old bookstore owner is not just spouting off.
She has already felt the muscle of the chains, closing a second location in suburban Issaquah when a Barnes &AMP; Noble was opening there (one of several factors in the closing).
She decided to concentrate all her energies on the University District store, moving aggressively to continue its success.
She expanded All for Kids into an adjoining storefront and hosted a series of daily events for four months prior to the opening at Barnes &AMP; Noble.
These measures were intended to draw traffic, convey properousness and foster customer loyalty.
All for Kids, already chock-full of products related to kid books (from plush characters to music to art), even added a section of adult books (all read and recommended by staffers) as a kind of living memorial to the defunct Kay's Bookmark.
All for Kids may indeed be the only children's bookstore in the country to stock a novel by Thomas Pynchon.
``We knew that if we had stayed small, not as visible, with not as much window space, we would not be in existence,'' says Haslet, who has 16 years' experience in the book business.
``Any time an independent sees a chain coming and does not make adjustments, they're in trouble''.
That is exactly what happened to The Shop Around the Corner in ``You've Got Mail''.
Kelly counts on her customers' loyalty, but sales continue to plummet each day that Fox Books is open.
Even a blitz of favorable media coverage about the little store's plight _ a battle depicted as ``Joan of Arc against Attila the Hun'' _ cannot stem the bleeding of red ink.
After the frantic going-out-of-business sale, Kelly returns to the shop one last time and surveys its empty shelves.
She admits, ``I feel as if a part of me has died.
I feel the way I did when my mother died all over again and no one can make it right''.
Independent booksellers hope that sympathy for The Shop Around the Corner will be transferred to their own stores.
The American Booksellers Association in Tarrytown, N.Y., distributed free movie tickets to booksellers in major cities and sent special ``You've Got Mail'' posters to its members, posters that included the additional lines: ``Independent Bookstores for Independent Minds'' and ``Visit the shop around YOUR corner''.
As Len Vlahos, spokesman for the 3,300-member association, stresses, ``The movie has done what we anticipated _ it raises issues about independent bookstores that many people in the public may never have considered.
So this helps, whether we happen to agree with how things are depicted in this Hollywood film.
It raises consciousness and gets people talking, so we felt that our members needed to be connected to `You've Got Mail'''.
The connection is already paying some dividends at small independents in the Seattle area.
Booksellers may complain that The Shop Around the Corner is too cute to be real, and that Kelly starts a new career much too easily after her store closes.
But those complaints have been muted by real customers who have come into their real stores, bought books and expressed support because of having seen the film.
It is only a trickle of customers, thus far, but independent booksellers are grateful for any encouragement they can get these days.
PARIS (AP) -- Investigators removed two engines from the Concorde crash site Wednesday in hopes the wreckage of the Air France supersonic jet will help determine the cause of the disaster that killed 113 people.
Some 100 technicians transported the wreckage to a site at Dugny near Le Bourget airport, north of Paris, where it will be examined.
''Every detail and every placement of the pieces is possibly crucial,'' said Xavier Mulot, head of Concorde 95, an investigatory team set up to establish the legal responsibility for the crash.
Forty-four members of the French national police and three judicial experts are participating in the inquiry.
They have taken statements from 295 witnesses of the crash, Mulot said.
As part of the inquiry into the July 25 crash, investigators also summoned technical experts from a U.S. tire manufacturer.
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.
, the world's largest maker of aircraft tires and the only tire supplier for the Air France Concorde fleet, sent two specialists to France on Monday.
''We were asked to supply technical assistance to the investigation,'' company spokesman Chris Aked said Tuesday from Goodyear headquarters in Akron, Ohio.
''We sent two aircraft tire engineers...
and they are now working with the investigation team''.
Aked said he had no information about the cause of the crash or whether a tire malfunction was involved.
There is evidence that one or two of the Concorde's tires exploded and one of the plane's engines shut down, followed by the partial shutdown of another engine.
France's Accident and Inquiry Office has said flames spewing from the side of the aircraft before it crashed most likely came from a major fuel leak.
On Tuesday, French authorities decided to keep its fleet of Concordes grounded while investigators try to recreate the events that caused the crash near Paris.
Air France grounded its remaining five Concordes immediately after the crash.
The world's other seven Concordes, owned by British Airways, resumed most flights after a day's pause .
LONDON _ British aviation authorities on Wednesday formally ruled the Concorde supersonic airliner unfit to fly unless its manufacturers took steps to prevent the problems that led to last month's fatal Air France Concorde crash near Paris.
The French said on Wednesday that they were contemplating a similar step.
The British authorities said the accident's ``primary cause'' was a tire that burst and expelled debris that ruptured a fuel tank.
The withdrawal of the Concorde's airworthiness certificate by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority was the first such action against a commercial airliner in more than 20 years.
Air France grounded its five remaining Concordes immediately after the July 25 crash of Concorde Flight AF 4590, which plunged to the ground about 90 seconds after take-off, killing 113 people in the first fatal accident involving the supersonic airplane.
British Airways, the only other Concorde operator, grounded its entire fleet of seven Concordes on Tuesday after learning that the airworthiness certificate would be revoked Wednesday.
Without an airworthiness certificate, aircraft are not permitted to fly.
British Airways said Wednesday that it had suspended Concorde flights through September, but gave no clear indication whether it believed the aircraft _ which crosses the Atlantic in about three and one-half hours at up to twice the speed of sound _ would ever return to commercial service.
The Concorde has been plying scheduled trans-Atlantic and charter routes for almost 25 years and had come to be seen as an icon of prestigious travel for executives and celebrities ready to pay up to $10,000 for a round-trip ticket.
After the July 25 crash, French investigators said they believed that a metal strip on the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris had caused a tire to burst.
The blow-out caused chunks of rubber to rupture fuel tanks located in the wings close to Concorde's four jet engines.
Concorde's spindly, stork-like landing gear is positioned directly below the wings and engines.
But, while Air France suspended its Concorde flights immediately after the July 25 crash, British Airways ordered only a one-day suspension before putting its own Concordes back into service.
British aviation experts said the British Concordes had been modified to protect the wings from tire blow-outs in the mid-1990s, while Air France Concordes had not been modified.
However, Malcolm Field, the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, an official regulatory body, said, ``It is clear to all of us on the CAA that a tire burst alone should never cause the loss of a public transport aircraft''.
He said the authority had asked Concorde's manufacturers, BAe Systems, Airbus UK and Aerospatiale of France, to devise a plan to insure that accidents could not be caused by a tire blow-out.
Under aviation regulations, airplanes whose fuel tanks are vulnerable to catastrophic damage from burst-tire debris may not be certified as airworthy.
Field rejected the idea that the demand for modifications effectively meant the Concorde would never fly again.
``We would wish Concorde to fly again,'' he said.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Jean-Claude Gayssot, the French transport minister, also said the measures did not necessarily imply the end of supersonic travel.
``Anyone who says it's the end for supersonic flights has got it wrong,'' he told the French newspaper Liberation.
``Traveling fast is going to be increasingly in demand''.
A British investigator, Ken Smart, of Britain's Air Accident Investigation Branch, said the precise links between the sequence of events that doomed Flight AF 4590 last month had not yet been established in detail.
But, he said, the burst tire sent debris flying to puncture one or more fuel tanks, allowing fuel to spill out and catch fire within seconds.
The airplane, thundering down the runway at around 195 mph for take-off, lost thrust in one engine, then in two.
``The crew had no means to make them aware of the nature of the fire nor to take action against it,'' he said at a news conference.
He said the safety issues relating to the tires would take ``some time to resolve''.
Burst tires have been a worry for Concorde pilots since the plane entered service, according to British aviation experts.
Since then, there have been seven known blow-outs in which debris struck fuel tanks without rupturing them, the experts said.
Modifications to the British Airways Concordes in 1993 involved changes to a water deflector on the undercarriage to ``reduce the energy'' from a tire-burst, according to Derek Blackhall, the head of the certification section of Britain's Civil Aviation Authority.
PARIS _ A metal strip that investigators believe may have led to the fiery crash of an Air France Concorde last July apparently came from a Continental Airlines DC10 that had taken off from the same runway only minutes before the Concorde, the French agency investigating the disaster said on Monday.
The agency said that an identical metal band that is believed to have gashed a tire on the supersonic jet, causing huge chunks of rubber to pierce the plane's fuel tanks, was reported missing by Continental.
``The characteristics of the missing piece seem identical to those of the metal piece which was found on the runway after the accident on July 25, 2000,'' a statement issued by the French agency said.
In a statement from its headquarters, Continental said the piece could well have come from a Continental plane that was on its way to Newark, N.J., from Charles de Gaulle airport outside of Paris.
The investigative agency's latest statement came on a day when Air France officials said they believed it was unlikely that the remaining sleek-needle nosed supersonic jets belonging to Air France and British Air would fly again before April, at the earliest.
The president of Air France, Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, said at a press conference that a team of 20 experts was working with the government and the plane's manufacturers to try to come up with modifications that would insure the safety of the plane.
The modifications would then have to be tested, and only then would Air France and British Air _ the only two airlines that fly Concordes _ discuss whether to return the aircraft to service.
The French agency described the piece of metal that may have triggered the crash that killed 113 people as ``a part of a hood on the plane's reverse thrusters''.
In a statement, Continental said the 17-inch by one-inch piece of metal found on the runway was ``similar'' in shape to a piece found missing from its DC10.
The piece, it said, was ``missing from the space between the fan reverser and the core door on the right wing engine''.
The absence of such a piece, the statement said, ``does not affect the safe operation of an aircraft''.
Just last week, French investigators disclosed that one of three daily runway inspections aimed at removing debris such as the metal strip had been skipped on the day of the crash because of a fire drill.
The runway thus had not been thoroughly inspected for about 12 hours before the supersonic jet took off, officials said.
But the news that the piece had fallen off the Continental flight pointed out that the runway inspections would not have prevented the disaster.
LONDON (AP) -- British Airways insists that demand for seats on its Concorde has not dropped off after the Air France crash a week ago, despite a series of embarrassing problems since then with the British fleet of supersonic jets.
British Airways resumed its Concorde flights after a single day's pause after the Air France flight crashed outside Paris on July 25, killing 113 people.
On Tuesday, British Airways -- the only airline flying the supersonic jets at the moment since the French fleet is grounded for now -- said Concorde traffic was comparable in recent days to the same time period in 1999.
Some days this year are worse, but the airline pointed to one recent post-crash Concorde flight from New York that arrived with 82 passengers, compared to 32 on the same date a year ago.
The plane's performance since the crash, however, hasn't helped calm fears about its safety.
Tuesday's flight to New York, with 33 of the 100 seats filled, was more than two hours late departing.
The first plane assigned to the flight was pulled after mechanics decided more work was needed on a recently replaced engine, and another Concorde was rolled out.
On Saturday, emergency services were out on the runway to attend to the landing of a Concorde at Heathrow after a report of a loud bang in an engine.
The following day, the first flight to New York was delayed by a refueling problem.
The day's second flight got only as far as Gander, Newfoundland, where it made an emergency landing after fumes that smelled like fuel got into the cabin.
British Airways operates a single round-trip flight daily between New York and London, which the airline said that is normal in August.
The French disaster was the first in 25 years of commercial operations for Concorde.
But because the Concorde makes far fewer flights than most aircraft, that one crash gave it one of the worst safety records for passenger aircraft.
Since there have only been 80,000 Concorde flights in a quarter century, the aircraft now has a rate of 12.5 fatal incidents per million flights, according to according to www.AirSafe.com, a Web site that tracks safety data.
The Boeing 727, with 46 fatal incidents since 1965, has a much better safety rate -- 0.64 per million -- because the aircraft has made nearly 72 million flights.
The DC-9, which ranks second with 42 crashes, has a fatality rate of 0.72 per million flights.
British Airways has one of the better safety records, at 0.32 fatal incidents per million flights, compared to 1.19 per million for Air France, according to AirSafe data.
American Airlines has a rate of 0.53 per million, Delta 0.30 per million and United 0.50 per million.

PARIS (AP) -- French investigators met Thursday to try to determine what new safety measures are required before Air France can resume its Concorde flights, grounded since one of its supersonic jets crashed in flames outside Paris.
The panel of experts, including French aviation authorities and Air France representatives, was working to establish the chain of events that led to the disaster and make a recommendation to the Transportation Ministry.
The technical investigation into the crash is going quickly, Gilles Ricono, the top aide to Transportation Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, said after the meeting.
But he said experts still had to clarify a number of key issues before a ban on Air France Concorde flights is lifted.
The meeting came a day after French authorities established a special investigation unit to establish legal responsibility and potential liability for the July 25 crash in which 113 people were killed.
The unit includes 44 members of the French national police and three judicial experts.
Air France Flight 4590 smashed shortly after takeoff into a hotel in the town of Gonesse north of Paris.
It was the first crash ever of the sleek jet, once the pride of French aviation.
British Airways resumed its Concorde flights a day after the crash.
Air France Concorde flights were immediately suspended.
Le Figaro newspaper on Wednesday quoted Gayssot, the transport minister, as raising the possibility that the ban on Air France Concorde flights could remain in place until the Accident and Inquiry Office releases a preliminary report on the crash at the end of August.
So far, the Accident and Inquiry Office, which is part of the Transportation Ministry, has said that flames spewing from the side of the aircraft before it crashed most likely came from a major fuel leak.
It has also said one or two of the jet's tires exploded, one of the engines shut down, and another failed twice -- once during takeoff and again, fatally, about one minute later.
On Thursday, a spokesman for the Accident and Inquiry Office declined to comment on a report in USA Today that quoted unidentified sources as saying investigators were trying to determine whether a piece of Flight 4590's landing gear broke off before takeoff, leading to a fuel leak.
On Wednesday, some 100 technicians carefully removed two engines from the site of the crash to a special location at Dugny, near Le Bourget airport north of Paris.
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.
, which is the only tire supplier for the Air France Concorde fleet, has sent two specialists to France to aid in the inquiry.
LONDON _ In the aftermath of Tuesday's crash of an Air France Concorde near Paris, some of the pilots who have flown them pondered a paradox Wednesday.
The supersonic airliner, according to one, is tough and robust, with ``tremendous reserve capacity'' to power its way out of trouble.
But, according to another, if the plane lost a side-by-side pair of its four engines at low speed just after takeoff, it would be ``impossible to control''.
Investigators in France reported Wednesday, that the pilot of Concorde Flight AF4590 reported the failure of one engine that had been repaired earlier in the day.
But that, a former pilot said, would not fully explain the flaming contrail of flame that witnesses saw just after the airplane lifted off from Charles de Gaulle airport.
``That great long plume of flame implies some sort of catastrophic failure, when the engine breaks up and blows apart,'' said John Hutchinson, a former Concorde pilot.
And failure on that scale, aviation experts said, could well have damaged the plane's control systems, or even another nearby engine housed in the Concorde's wings close to the fuel tanks.
``Failure of both engines at low speed just after takeoff is impossible to control,'' said another former pilot, Germain Chambort, in a television interview in London.
Investigators have yet to establish the extent of the engine failure that caused the flame.
But pilots from the elite corps of Concorde aviators, flying airplanes whose value is calculated far more in corporate prestige than dollars-and-cents return on investment, insisted that the Concorde's design _ with its engines much closer together than on most sub-sonic planes _ would not have contributed to the disaster.
``I have complete confidence in that part of the design,'' said Mike Bannister, the chief Concorde pilot for British Airways.
Brian Trubshaw, the former Concorde test pilot who flew the plane on its maiden flight over Britain in 1969, told reporters at the Farnborough Air Show that ``she is in her essence a safe plane''.
He was at the show to promote his autobiography, called ``Concorde: The Inside Story''.
And Hutchinson, the former pilot, said he regarded the Concorde as ``a very safe airplane that has got at least 10 years and maybe 15 years of life'' left in it.
Few of the former pilots and aviation experts who spoke to reporters Wednesday ventured an opinion on how the Concorde might have behaved in its final moments.
But Malcolm English, editor of Air International, said the drill would have been to avoid a stall _ when an airplane loses the airspeed it needs to fly _ and seek a safe landing.
If, however, an intense fire burned through the controls, even the most rudimentary anti-stall maneuvers would be impossible.
``If that's what happened, then it looks like they lost flight control,'' he said.
Under those circumstances, an airplane would pitch and stall.
One pilot reportedly suggested that if the experience of a Concorde simulator was anything to go by, a simple engine failure would be easier to control on a Concorde than on some subsonic planes.
Compared with those, ``keeping Concorde on centerline is a piece of cake,'' Capt.
John Wiley, a USAirways pilot, was quoted as telling a Farnborough Air Show news bulletin published by Aviation Week.
With a double engine failure programmed into the simulator, he said, the plane veered to one side while rolling to the other.
But regaining control was ``not even a bad dream, much less a nightmare''.
``But how difficult is Concorde to fly''?
Wiley ruminated.
``One simulator session may not be the best measure for this answer, but let's just say it takes a lot of commitment to fly Concorde.''
Britain's decision on Tuesday to ground the Concorde following the first fatal crash of the supersonic transport plane probably marks the end of the line for what was almost certainly the loftiest niche in commercial aviation history.
If so, it will be a long time before elite travelers will again be able to hop across the Atlantic in a mere three hours.
Concorde was never a significant factor in aviation except for those willing to pay up to $11,000 for a round-trip ticket between New York and London or Paris.
Only 20 of the planes were ever built, and just 13 of those were still in service, seven with British Air and six with Air France, which grounded its planes immediately after the accident.
Each Concorde has 100 seats, compared with more than 400 on the largest conventional jetliners, and the planes averaged only 800 revenue hours in the air a year, about a third of a conventional plane's time at work.
Concorde's conversion to museum status will be as much a matter of economics as safety.
Preliminary investigation of the crash, which cost 113 lives, indicates that a tire was punctured by a piece of scrap metal on the Charles de Gaulle Airport runway.
Chunks of the tire ruptured a fuel tank next to two engines, which ignited escaping fuel.
Reconfiguring the plane to prevent such ruptures, by thickening the outer skin, would probably be more expensive than even such enormous fares could justify.
Flying at more than 1,300 miles an hour, Concorde was largely restricted to over-the-ocean routes to avoid inflicting its sonic boom on earthlings.
But at subsonic speeds, especially during takeoffs, the roar of its jet engines and after-burners made conventional jets sound like purrs.
Noise-sensitive airports like Logan banned the craft except for occasional emergency visits.
Speed has always been the driving force in commercial travel.
Concorde's retirement may be unique in transportation annals for lowering maximum speeds.
Supersonic speed has remained a formidable barrier for most airlines, and no successor to Concorde is within sight.
So millions of air travelers will have to be content with moving around the world at a pokey 600 miles an hour.
Poor turtles.
LONDON (AP) -- Passengers describe taking off on the Concorde as ''a kick in the back'' and complain about the stingy legroom.
But riding the supersonic jet -- a haunt of celebrities, royalty, politicians and business tycoons -- also has been called an exercise in nonstop pampering.
That's why people pay $10,000 round-trip for the abbreviated experience.
The sleek, needle-nosed aircraft cross the Atlantic at an altitude of 60,000 feet and at 1,350 mph, completing the journey from London to New York in about 3 hours, 50 minutes -- half the time of regular jets.
''The wonderful thing about Concorde is that you can get there before you can imagine getting anywhere,'' said Seymour Druion, a London-based businessman who flies it frequently.
''You can leave London at 10 and be in New York at 9''.
The quick flight time leaves little room to settle in and watch a movie -- which is fortunate, because Concorde's stringent weight restrictions leave no room for video equipment.
There are no headphones, either, and the planes -- whose average age is more than 23 years -- are so old they do not have telephones, to the consternation of some business travelers.
But there are compensations, including an unending stream of gourmet food and drink, served on crystal, china and linen.
Food critic Egon Ronay described the service on the British Airways Concorde as ''oozing luxury and refinement'' -- and, apparently, alcohol.
One passenger was told that hand luggage was restricted onboard because extra space was needed for the wine cellar.
Contrary to popular imagination, however, the supersonic journeys are almost as cramped as regular flights -- partly the result of weight restrictions that would not apply in a bigger aircraft.
''It's not the normal first-class service.
It's pretty cramped inside, but it's viewed as a time saver.
It's not viewed as luxurious an option as a first-class seat on a 747,'' said Mike Stoddart, a transport analyst for Charterhouse Securities, a London-based brokerage firm.
Indeed, Philippe Gossard, a Paris-based aviation analyst for the investment bank Credit Lyonnais Securities, said many business travelers prefer to fly from Europe to the United States on Concorde to save time, then return to Europe in the evening in first class on a 747 so they can stretch out on an in-flight bed.
Recognizing the supersonic jet might be losing ground, British Airways -- which operates seven Concordes -- announced earlier this year that it would spend millions of dollars to make the plane's interiors brighter, the toilets bigger and the corresponding airport lounges more luxurious.
For pilots, flying a Concorde, which first took wing in 1969, can be the pinnacle of their careers.
''It's a beautiful airplane to fly, it's a responsive, thoroughbred of an aircraft,'' John Hutchinson, who flew it for British Airways for 15 years, told the British Broadcasting Corp.
on Tuesday.
But some passengers find their first experience of supersonic travel unsettling, describing takeoff as seemingly vertical and the resulting G-forces more than a little daunting.
''You are just thrust back into your seats,'' said Colin Frith, 50, who received a two-hour Concorde flight around Britain as a birthday present.
Another passenger said landing felt like someone had slammed on the brakes in midair.
Until Tuesday's crash of an Air France Concorde outside Paris, at least, passengers could feel they were paying for peace of mind.
Although the Concorde fleet is aging, it previously had one of the aviation industry's best safety records.
Its only major scare came in 1979 when a bad landing blew out a plane's tires.
After the crash, Air France agreed to temporarily ground its five remaining Concordes, and British Airways grounded its two remaining flights for Tuesday night.
GONESSE, France (AP) -- Forensic experts in white hooded suits combed a charred, rain-slicked field Thursday for anything -- wedding rings, teeth, scraps of clothing -- that might help identify the victims of the doomed Concorde flight.
As relatives paid tribute in Paris to the 113 people killed when their burning Air France Concorde jet plunged to earth Tuesday, experts converged on the crash site in this town of factories and pastures to begin the painstaking task of putting names to bodies.
By nightfall Thursday, all the bodies had been transported to a morgue in eastern Paris for autopsies, said Fabien Tillon, a spokesman at the regional police headquarters.
But some 40 experts continued their grueling work at the site in Gonesse, a gritty industrial suburb north of Paris, which was cordoned off and heavily guarded by police.
''The bodies are terribly mutilated, and some are so badly burned that it's impossible to recognize them,'' Tillon said.
For every plane crash in France, the Catastrophe Victim Identification Unit follows these steps, according to the police force that oversees the unit: First, specialists rush to the scene of the crash, dividing the crash site into quadrants and assigning each team a patch.
Team members turn over clumps of earth, charred cinders and pieces of metal from the plane during the search for the victims' bodies and possessions.
They number each body or body fragment, mark the spot with a traffic cone or a pole, and snap pictures.
Units begin calling the families, requesting details that might help identify the remains: hair color, broken bones, jewelry, tattoos.
Dental records are crucial, as the bodies are often unrecognizable.
The bodies are transported to the morgue for autopsies.
German Transport Minister Reinhard Klimmt, who went to Paris after the crash to follow the investigation and comfort relatives of the German victims, said he doubted the remains would be returned to Germany quickly.
''It's very difficult because no identification was possible,'' he told the Saarbruecker Zeitung paper.
''It will take even longer with some victims.''
PARIS (AP) -- Moments after a Concorde jet slammed into her hotel, a 21-year-old British woman jumped from a window, escaping the inferno that engulfed the building.
A busload of 44 teen-agers from southeastern England had been scheduled to check into the Hotelissimo an hour before the deadly crash, but was mercifully stuck in traffic.
And a group of Polish tourists returned from a sightseeing trip to find the hotel in ruins, their belongings destroyed -- and their lives spared.
They were among those who escaped death in the crash Tuesday that claimed the lives of all 109 people on board the supersonic jet and four on the ground.
Alice Brooking tossed her suitcases on her hotel bed Tuesday afternoon and dialed the phone to call her sister in London.
She had just arrived for a summer job in Paris.
''All of a sudden I heard a noise.
It sounded like a normal takeoff.
It just got louder and louder until the whole building started trembling,'' Brooking recalled a day after the Concorde, smoke and flames streaming from its engines, slammed into the backside of her 40-room hotel, about two miles from Charles de Gaulle airport.
On the other end of the phone, it sounded as if ''there had been an earthquake in Paris,'' Brooking's 24-year-old sister, Natalie, recalled at a news conference Wednesday at the British Embassy in Paris.
Flames shot through Brooking's room when she opened her door, turning it into a smoke-filled oven.
''I leapt across the room, leapt across the bed and out the window,'' said Brooking, of Hildenborough, England, who suffered only a burned left hand.
She doesn't recall how far she fell, if she landed on gravel or grass, or if the hotel crumbled or exploded.
''All you could see was flames.
It was just flames everywhere,'' said Brooking, a student of linguistics at Cambridge University.
Twenty-four hours after her brush with death, Brooking said she had not yet slept and did not consider herself ''someone that had survived a miracle''.
''I was very, very lucky,'' she said.
Brooking, a tour leader, was awaiting the arrival of the Suffolk Youth Wind Band.
Their tour bus, filled with 12- to 19-year-old band members, was late arriving at the Hotelissimo, stalled in traffic after the trip from Ipswich, England.
''We could see smoke for some time and there were rescue vehicles on the road,'' said conductor Philip Shaw.
''When we arrived at the hotel it was explained just what had happened''.
The youths, who spent Wednesday at a Paris hotel recovering from shock, planned to go ahead with their five-day music program in the concert halls of the French capital.
The group of 45 Polish tourists returned from sightseeing to find their hotel ablaze.
''We were totally unaware of what had happened,'' Maciej Kuznik, the group's guide, told Poland's private Radio Zet.
''All of a sudden we see the road blocked, and we hear our hotel is completely burned down''.
''We are still in shock and very tired,'' he said.
All their belongings and some passports were destroyed.
Air France paid for their stay Tuesday night in a Paris hotel and offered compensation for the loss of some possessions.
One survivor wept quietly at the Polish Embassy in Paris on Wednesday, saying she had lost ''everything...
even my most beautiful outfit''.
The crash killed two young Poles, Ewa Lipinska and Paulina Sypko, both students at a hotel school in Poland.
''I still had illusions that it was a different hotel,'' Danuta Lipinska, Ewa's mother, told a Polish television station after flying to the crash site.
''Only dust remained.
What will I take home?''
PARIS _ Air France said Wednesday that it has filed a lawsuit against Continental Airlines because it believes a metal strip from a Continental DC-10 led to the crash of its Concorde jet in July.
French investigators have said they believe that a thin strip of metal fell off the Continental plane, which had taken off on the same runway as the Concorde, and set off the events that caused the Air France jet to burst into flames and crash within minutes after its takeoff.
All 109 people aboard were killed as well as five on the ground.
Air France issued a one-paragraph statement on its lawsuit, saying it had been filed in the Pontoise commercial court, which covers the town of Gonesse, where the plane had dropped onto a small wooden hotel.
The statement said that under the civil aviation legal code, an airline is responsible for damage caused by any pieces that fall off its aircraft.
Three weeks ago, Continental acknowledged that a strip of metal found on the runway among debris from the plane was similar in shape to a piece missing from its DC-10, which had been heading for New Jersey just minutes before the doomed Concorde took off.
French investigators believe the strip shredded one of the Concorde's tires, sending huge chunks of rubber through the jet's fuel tanks.
Continental issued a brief statement on Wednesday, saying that there was not proof that it was linked to the crash.
``At this stage in the investigation there is no conclusive evidence that Continental is involved in the Concorde crash,'' the statement said.
``Continental will continue to cooperate fully with all the French authorities investigating the accident''.
The legal case was lodged by Air France and the airline insurance consortium Reunion Aerienne.
Industry experts said it was rare for airlines to sue each other, but somewhat logical in this particular case.
``These are very unusual circumstances,'' said Shephard Melzer, who recently stepped down as the chairman of the Aeronautic Committee of the Association of the Bar of New York City.
``Usually it's a manufacturer who gets sued for a defective part.
But here that is not the issue''.
Melzer said it was really the insurance companies that called the shots in such lawsuits.
``Which insurance company is going to pay''? he asked.
``That's what this is about.
And from Air France's point of view, you can see the advantages.
They are saying there was nothing wrong with their plane.
It was really a freak accident''.
Even before it took off, the Air France Concorde was in trouble.
Flames could be seen engulfing its left wing.
But the plane was going too fast for the pilots to abort the takeoff.
Instead, they tried to land at a smaller airport just a few minutes away.
The plane lost altitude, however, and crashed into the hotel.
French and British aviation authorities last month withdrew Concorde's airworthiness certificate, saying a ruptured tire should not bring a plane down.
Air France and British Airways, the only two airlines to operate the supersonic jets, have been studying whether corrective actions can be taken to insure that such an accident could not occur again.
Before the crash, the planes had one of the best safety records.
COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- Joined by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, relatives of the 113 people killed in the Concorde crash gathered Friday in Cologne's 750-year-old cathedral and were asked: Has mankind reached too far?
The peal of church bells rang out as relatives of the victims trailed Schroeder into the vast gothic cathedral, Germany's largest.
Schroeder met with the relatives privately before the service.
Some 1,500 mourners attended the hourlong ecumenical service led by the Cologne bishop and the head of the German Lutheran Church.
One theme ran throughout the service -- encapsulated in a question by the Cathedral's priest, Bernard Henrichs: ''What are the limits of what is possible''?
The question has haunted the relatives of those who died since the supersonic jet crashed shortly after takeoff outside Paris last month, killing all 109 aboard and four on the ground.
The airline industry also has had to confront the reality of investigators' findings that the crash was caused by a burst tire.
Air France, which owned the crashed Concorde chartered by a German tour group setting off on a luxury cruise through the Caribbean, has not returned the jets to service since the crash.
British Airways also grounded its Concordes this week.
Both countries, however, have said they are committed to getting the plane back in the air.
But no determination of cause or official certification that the jets are safe can comfort the loved ones, religious leaders said.
''Whatever the experts' investigation and journalistic research may reveal...
does not answer the question, 'Why'''? said the head of the Lutheran church in Germany, the Rev.
Manfred Kock.
''Why this plane exactly, and why these people exactly?
All of the technical explanations will not undo what has been done''.
Standing beneath the cathedral's ornate stained glass windows, Cologne's bishop drew a sharp distinction between technological advances that honor God and those meant to glorify mankind.
Bishop Friedhelm Hofmann cited an advertising sign at the Basel airport that reads: ''We are building heaven on Earth''.
''When we truly try to replace the reality of heaven by building an earthly paradise, death will always tear us abruptly from our illusions,'' he said.
By contrast, Hofmann said the mourners could find comfort in the cathedral's graceful spires: ''In building this church, our forefathers turned our gaze toward heaven through this manifestation of earthly beauty, harmony and legitimacy''.
This crash -- and other modern tragedies, like the crash of a high-speed train in northern Germany two years ago that killed 101 people and a bomb explosion at a Duesseldorf train station three weeks ago that injured 10 immigrants -- create feelings of hopelessness, the bishop said.
''We feel caught off-guard, abandoned and overtaxed,'' he said.
Among the mourners were travelers who opted not to take the pricier Concorde across the Atlantic.
Kennith Dixon, a Briton who retired in Cologne, said he didn't know any of the people who died but found comfort in the ceremony.
''I came here just to pay my respects to them, even though I didn't know them, and as a symbol of thanks that I was not on the plane,'' he said.
Not everyone who attended the service, which included hymns sung by the Cologne Boys Choir, was receptive to the religious leaders' questions.
''I was a bit angry about what they said.
They tried to build up a heavy doom-and-gloom atmosphere.
This is not the way to help the survivors,'' said Eberhard Francesco-Lorenz, an opera singer from Cologne.
''The question, 'Why does it happen'? makes no sense.
The better question is, 'What does this mean for our daily lives?'''
PONTOISE, France (AP) -- Forensic experts on Monday finished identifying the remains of all 113 victims of the Concorde crash, nearly two weeks after the supersonic jet plunged to the ground in a town outside Paris, a French public prosecutor said.
Prosecutor Xavier Salvat also said he ordered experts to evaluate the jet's tires, motors, tanks and other important features as part of the ongoing judicial inquiry into the July 25 crash.
Salvat, the prosecutor in Pontoise, north of Paris, who is in charge of the judicial inquiry, said investigators still had not pinpointed the chain of events that led the delta-winged jetliner, streaming with flames, to plunge into a small hotel in Gonesse north of Paris shortly after takeoff.
Four people on the ground and all 109 people in the plane were killed.
The French government has grounded the five remaining Air France Concordes while the inquiry continues.
On Monday, France's civil aviation ground mechanics called for the government to rethink its move to freeze Concorde flights, while the mayor of the town where the plane crashed underlined his support for the decision.
The national union of civil aviation ground mechanics, known by its French initials SNMSAC, released a statement demanding a ''rapid lifting'' of the grounding order, saying the Concorde itself should not be called into question.
Meanwhile, Gonesse Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy sent a letter to Air France President Jean-Cyril Spinetta underlining his support for the supersonic jet's grounding and threatening to push on with stronger demands.
British Airways has continued to fly its fleet of Concordes.
There has been speculation in the French press that a 16-inch strip of metal found on the runway -- and not belonging to the Concorde -- could have been at the origin of the crash.
On Friday, the Accident and Inquiry Office reported the discovery of the metal strip without further comment.
In their statement, the civil aviation ground mechanics questioned why officials revealed this news nearly two weeks after the accident.
It may seem heartless to think about beauty in the wake of human tragedy.
But the aftershock from news of the Concorde disaster was linked to the emotions beauty can stir up.
One hundred fourteen people died as a result of last week's crash.
Compared with a single life, the plane itself is nothing, just metal, rubber and oil.
These were nonetheless combined into one of the most important cultural artifacts of the 20th century.
In the 31 years since the first Concorde was rolled out, only a select few have flown on it.
But this swan of a craft has winged through the imaginations of millions more.
It's not just the French or the British who look up admiringly when the Concorde flies overhead.
Anyone with an eye looks up.
To see: A masterpiece of contrapuntal aesthetics.
The contrast between thin, elongated fuselage and wide, swept-back wings.
Between the curve of the wings and the rectangular engines beneath them.
The proportions of windows in relation to fuselage.
The triangular configuration formed by the needle-point nose and the wing tips (or, when on the ground, the birdlike landing gear).
The ugly duckling-into-swan metamorphosis when the drooped nose swings back into place.
The Concorde's elegance arises from these formal relationships.
The plane's beauty is existential.
Profit-taking doesn't keep it aloft.
A round-trip ticket costs in the neighborhood of $10,000.
Even when full, however, the Concorde has lost money.
National pride is one reason it has stayed in service.
The pain of writing off what it cost to develop the plane may be another.
But an ineffable factor is also at work: a reverential feeling akin to the impulse to admire an oak, contemplate a painting or gaze up at a Gothic spire.
The Concorde is French (or half French) in the sense that the Chartres cathedral is French, but the plane's appeal is global to the extent that French civilization is available to others.
In 1955 Roland Barthes wrote that cars were the precise modern equivalent of the great Gothic cathedrals: ``I mean the supreme creation of an era, conceived with passion by unknown artists, and consumed in image if not in usage by a whole population which appropriates them as purely magical objects''.
In the mid-50s new cars could even satisfy the pangs of aspiration.
But by the 1960s the U.S. space program had raised the stakes.
Aspiration now came in the form of altitude and the skyward thrust of jet propulsion.
The Concorde was Europe's answer to our Apollo mission.
Let the Americans catapult their tin cans, play golf and plant metal flags on the moon.
We Europeans will turn space into a secular idea of heaven: Champagne, caviar and freshly laundered linen napkins on the headrests.
No doubt many brave young souls do dream of becoming astronauts when they grow up.
But a trip to Paris on the Concorde does not involve settling for less.
A rich person I know says that the one thing she truly enjoys about having money is that it makes traveling easier.
Mass travel, in other words, is what gravity used to be in the early days of flight: an oppressive condition from which only the privileged manage to escape.
Yet the Concorde has long been trailed by a whiff of morbidity.
Until last week the plane's safety record had been impeccable.
But its status as a cultural icon was always fragile.
When the United States canceled its program to develop supersonic transport for civilians, the British-French endeavor was left without competition and the benefits that accrue from it.
It is not always so great to be the only game in town.
Without competition there was no incentive to update the aircraft and none of the improvements that succeeding generations of supersonic craft might have developed.
As a result Concorde pilots must use their brains to operate controls that on newer subsonic jets are run by computer.
Who knows whether more advanced controls would have alerted the pilots last Monday to the flames shooting out of the engines?
Or whether advanced technology could have reduced noise, increased head room, extended the range of flights or eventually brought down fares?
The craft's obsolescence was thus virtually guaranteed before the first flight took off.
In this the Concorde resembles the Queen Elizabeth 2, which began trans-Atlantic service in the summer of 1969.
Like the Concorde the new Cunard liner was launched as a fusion of luxury and modernity.
Unlike the stodgy Art Deco interiors of the Queen Mary and earlier Queen Elizabeth, the QE2 was fitted with dramatic jet-black carpets and molded plastic fixtures.
But who cared?
Design did not suffice to conquer time.
No luxury could compete with speed.
In the 1970s ads promoting a package deal started to appear in glossy magazines.
Sail first-class to Europe on the QE2, fly home on the Concorde.
The package, presented as a cutting-edge experience, was actually an invitation to indulge yourself in not one but two obsolete forms of travel.
Five days worth of shuffleboard and midnight buffets.
Three and a half hours on a plane whose days became numbered when carriers cast their lot with the 747.
To gain a few hours over regular jets, you had to travel on a plane that was swiftly becoming a museum piece of aeronautics.
For some the Concorde disaster evoked the memory of the destruction of an earlier legendary trans-Atlantic vessel.
On Feb.
9, 1942, while being refitted for wartime use, the French liner Normandie caught fire at its Hudson River berth.
Attempts to put out the flames filled the ship with so much water that it capsized.
The Normandie lay on its side for the remainder of the war and never sailed again.
As smoke from the fire drifted over Manhattan, it was understood that this was not an ordinary military mishap.
For many the Normandie was the most beautiful object created in the 20th century.
It epitomized the style and sophistication for which the French were celebrated.
Some compared it to the Parthenon.
And its destruction was an occasion to look for meanings deeper than the tragedy's immediate cause.
The welder's torch was an instrument in a ritual enactment of the ancient idea that beauty itself may be condemned to play a tragic, sacrificial role in human affairs.
Our relationship to beauty is not entirely positive.
The power to be moved by it can flow in more than one direction.
For Socrates, erotic attraction was to be directed toward a higher, moral craving.
From there it is but a step toward thinking that physical beauty is a bad thing.
The next step is to regard beauty as an opportunity to relieve intense rage.
Destroy the idol!
Crush Salome!
Three days after the Concorde crash I found myself in the middle of an exchange between Peter Eisenman, the architect, and his wife, Cynthia Davidson, editor of ANY magazine.
Eisenman said, ``Hey, the Stealth bomber is beautiful, too''.
To which Davidson objected: ``No!
The Concorde is beautiful.
The Stealth bomber is terrifying''.
My position is that beauty is terrifying.
Like Homer's Helen or Michelangelo's David, beauty throws everything into an uproar.
There is pleasure as well as horror to be found in the desecration of beautiful things.
After the French Revolution, the Sainte-Chapelle was used for storing flour.
The Ottomans stockpiled gunpowder in the Parthenon.
The Normandie, appropriated by the United States from France's Vichy government, was being converted into a troop ship when it burned.
Something there is that doesn't like art.
There's a risk in dwelling too much on the Concorde's obsolescence.
The risk is that we blind ourselves even further to the outmoded ways of thinking coursing through culture today.
The Concorde's beauty emerged from the context of the 1960s, a period interior decorators now call retro.
We've given ourselves the luxury of periodizing progress.
At Disney World, the Futureland attractions have been redesigned as Jetson-style, nostalgic attractions.
This luxury is turning out to be expensive, and not just because an original Eames chair can cost thousands.
The fundamentals of the '60s context have not disappeared.
As Davidson reminded me, the demand for speed is greater, not less, in today's world.
As Eisenman suggested, the military faces few obstacles in meeting that demand.
Technically there's nothing to prevent development of a supersonic passenger craft capable of altitudes from which the sonic boom would not reach Earth.
The Concorde crash, in other words, ought to shock people out of retro ways of thinking in all spheres of culture.
It could easily be used as an opportunity to affirm them.
NEW YORK _ The flight may not be as comfortable as business class on a 747 and it does not offer a choice of a dozen movies _ or any movies, for that matter _ but crossing the Atlantic in just over three hours on the supersonic Concorde, versus seven to nine hours on standard jets, is well worth the cost and relative discomfort, Concorde passengers said Wednesday.
In the aftermath of Tuesday's crash of a chartered Air France Concorde outside Paris, killing all 109 people on the airplane and four people on the ground, most members of the elite club that is the Concorde's clientele had few qualms about flying the jet again.
``When I heard about the crash, obviously I was horrified,'' said John Demsey, president of Mac Cosmetics, who flies on the Concorde often and was planning to ride it from New York to Paris Wednesday on his way to the island of Capri.
His trip was delayed after Air France suspended all its Concorde flights until the airline is convinced the planes are safe.
But Demsey said that he was ready to take his flight even after he heard about the crash.
``Up to this point the plane has had a safety record as good or better than any other plane,'' he said.
``I would definitely fly it again''.
British Airways, the only other airline that flies the Concorde, resumed its New York to London service Wednesday after having canceled some flights Tuesday.
Passengers who are normally consigned to economy class might smirk to hear the Concorde, which costs more than $10,000 for a full-fare roundtrip ticket, described as a business tool.
But that is how many of its denizens refer to it.
Air France says two-thirds of its Concorde passengers are traveling on business, while the rest are celebrities, the superrich or vacationers like members of the German tour group who died in Tuesday's crash.
For business executives, the advantage of the Concorde, which cruises twice as high as conventional jets and, at 1,350 mph, twice as fast, is not just the time saved in the air.
It is also the time saved on the ground.
British Airways and Air France have designed their Concorde services so passengers can avoid the increasingly common hassles of modern jet travel.
Concorde passengers can arrive a half hour before the flight departs and are whisked through check-in and immigration.
Their luggage is delivered to them within minutes of arrival.
Celebrities like the Concorde's exclusivity because it separates them from the common folk on commercial flights.
Executives like it because they can socialize with celebrities.
They can also network, though that is not always a good thing.
The Concorde's 100-seat cabin is so small it is hard to work without your neighbors peeking over your shoulder.
Wall Street executives have been known to pick up the whiff of a deal after bumping into a competitor with a client.
The Concorde's speed allows executives to put in a full day of work in London, hop on the 7 p.m.
Concorde and arrive back in New York the same day at 6 p.m.
With the number of cross-border mergers on the rise in industries like entertainment, finance, telecommunications and energy, many executives are finding that they are having to travel back and forth to Europe on a regular basis.
``I certainly don't take it for the luxury,'' said Emmanuel A.
Kampouris, former chairman of American Standard Companies, who had just arrived on the 7 p.m.
British Airways Concorde from London Wednesday.
``It's not comfortable.
Sometimes it is really cold, or sometimes it is really hot but it is unbelievably convenient.
You arrive before you leave''.
The only reason he flew the Concorde Wednesday was because he had a meeting in London Wednesday and another in New York Thursday.
His wife, Camille, who accompanied him, was pleased because they now had time to go out for dinner in New York.
The Concorde also allows travelers to Europe to arrive early enough to connect to other destinations the same day.
Indeed, the Concorde is the only daytime flight that arrives on the Continent in the afternoon.
The alternative for many travelers is to take an overnight flight and try to sleep on the plane.
``I don't sleep well on planes,'' Demsey said.
``To me it buys back two days''.
Besides, one of the Concorde's dirty secrets is that few of its regulars pay the top fare of more than $10,000 roundtrip.
Most fly so often that they or their companies have cut deals with the airlines for discounts of as much as 30 percent, or the price of a business-class ticket, which on Air France is $7,050.
Passengers also use frequent flyer miles to upgrade to the Concorde.
``It is not as if it is either the Concorde or they are going to swim,'' Richard Nigosian, president of Bond Street Travel in Manhattan, said of the customers he books on the Concorde.
If they did not fly supersonic, they would fly first class, which is only a few thousand dollars cheaper.
Most of his customers believe that the added cost is well worth it since it means they can do more business.
``For people who earn millions of dollars a year, it really does pay for itself,'' he said.
LONDON (AP) -- For its makers, Concorde proved to be the swiftest turkey in the skies.
Hoping to sell hundreds, the British and French manufacturers persuaded airlines to take options on a total of 74.
Only 16 were built.
Protests about noise, national rivalries and an oil crisis all played a part in killing the market for supersonic airplanes.
''It's a technical miracle, but an economic disaster,'' said Ronald Davies, curator of the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., and author of the book ''Supersonic Nonsense''.
''It was always bound to be uneconomical to fly,'' Davies said.
''It was costly, it wasn't big enough, and really the nail in the coffin was when the world authorities decided it wouldn't be allowed to fly over land because of the sonic boom''.
Long an emblem of luxury and technological prowess, the supersonic jet favored by the rich and famous may slip quietly into history after the July 25 crash of an Air France Concorde outside Paris.
With official doubts mounting about the safety of Concorde's tires, British Airways indefinitely grounded its fleet Tuesday.
The sleek, needle-nosed aircraft could cross the Atlantic at an altitude of 60,000 feet and at 1,350 mph, completing the trip from London to New York in less than four hours -- half the time of regular jets.
Although there always seemed to be people willing to pay the round-trip ticket price of $10,000, Concorde had its detractors from the start.
The first ominous signs might have been oil price shocks and uncertainty about whether the noisy plane would be allowed to land in New York, said Brian Trubshaw, the test pilot who flew the first British Concorde flight in 1969.
The idea of a supersonic passenger plane gained momentum in the 1950s, after Chuck Yeager's 1947 blast through the sound barrier.
Manufacturers in Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United States scrambled to develop a design.
In 1962, the British Aircraft Corp.
and Sud Aviation of France agreed to cooperate, along with engine builders from both countries.
In 1963, Pan Am, British Overseas Airways Corp.
and Air France all signed options on the Concorde.
Despite the mounting excitement, Beverly Shenstone, technical director of what would later become British Airways, called Concorde ''the largest, most expensive and most dubious project ever undertaken in the development of civil aircraft''.
Nevertheless, British Airways ended up with half the world's Concorde fleet, and became its ardent defender.
In 1968, the Concorde's first prototype rolled out at Toulouse, France.
It lifted off 13 months later, three months after the Soviet version of the supersonic plane made its first flight.
Options for 74 Concordes were sold by 1967; eight each for British Overseas Airways Corp.
, Air France and Pan Am; six each for American Airlines, TWA, Eastern Airlines and United Air Lines; four each for Air Canada and Qantas; three each for Japan Air Lines, Lufthansa, Continental and Braniff; and two each for Air India, Middle East Airlines and Sabena.
But when final orders were placed in 1972, British Airways took five planes and Air France took four.
That was it.
Britain and France built 16 planes, and British Airways and Air France took the unsold planes in 1979.
But British Airways had no place to fly the Concorde except to Bahrain when it began service in 1976.
Protests against the noisy engines and sonic booms led the U.S. government to ban Concorde landings in 1975, and they were banned in 1976 by the Port Authority of New York, which operates John F.
Kennedy airport.
The market opened up after the U.S.
Supreme Court refused to hear the Port Authority's appeal.
Through the years, the airlines tried various plans to make use of its fleet, including a joint venture with Singapore Airlines and a London-Washington-Dallas tie-up with Braniff that lasted only a year.
Air France had a Paris-Washington-Mexico City service from 1978 to 1991.
At one point, there was talk of converting a Concorde to fly for Federal Express, Trubshaw says in ''Concorde: The Inside Story,'' a book whose official publication date fell on the day after the crash.
Britain and France both stopped underwriting Concorde's costs in 1984, and the two airlines took responsibility.
British Airways and Air France both insist the aircraft was profitable, but refused to give details.
Davies called the claim ''absolute nonsense''.
''Having been given the airplane, and operating it, they are able to cover the cost of the crew and the fuel and possibly the cost of the maintenance on an individual flight,'' he said.
''But the fuel bill must be pretty high -- for every seat that that the Concorde carries across the Atlantic, it had to carry a ton of fuel''.
The planes actually required eight times as much jet fuel per passenger as a 747, said Mike Stoddart of Charterhouse Securities, a London-based brokerage firm.
Moreover, British Airways and Air France usually staffed each 100-seat Concorde with nine crew members -- almost twice as many per passenger as the 19 crew members on a 400-seat 747.
PARIS _ ``Concorde 4590, you have flames, you have flames behind you,'' the control tower warned the crew of the plane, which had just lifted off at about 200 mph from Charles de Gaulle airport.
Seconds later, the Concorde's navigator said Engine 2 had malfunctioned and the pilot ordered, ``Engine fire procedure''.
Then the co-pilot warned: ``Watch out, the indicator, the indicator, the indicator''! meaning the speed was dropping.
``It's really burning,'' the air controller told the crew, ``and I'm not sure it's coming from the engine''.
The first realization that Air France's Flight 4590 was in trouble was in those exchanges, released Thursday night on the Web site of the French Air Accident Investigation Bureau and elaborated on Friday.
Investigators still defended their July 28 assumption that an exploding tire had ruptured wing fuel tanks, starting a major fire.
It was also revealed Friday that an inspection of the runway was skipped that day because of a fire drill.
But questions began to be raised as to whether the pilot had unwittingly made a crucial mistake: Told by his navigator that Engine No.
2 was malfunctioning and by the tower that flames were shooting out, he apparently assumed Engine No.
2 was on fire and ordered it cut off.
Meanwhile, perhaps not knowing it, he was losing power in Engine No.
1, next to it.
That may have left the plane with too little thrust to fly.
Investigators later found no marks of fire in either engine; only the wing and fuselage were scorched.
Friday's preliminary report carefully does not criticize any decision made that day.
``The crew,'' it notes, ``had no way of knowing the nature of the fire nor of fighting against it''.
But Le Monde, the Paris daily, asked: ``What would have happened if he had kept Engine No.
2 working?
It's impossible to say whether the crash could have been avoided''.
And the author of the article, Michel Alberganti, said a careful analysis of the transcript and report led him to the conclusion that ``it was the wrong decision'' but understandable given what the pilot was told.
It is hard to tell from the transcript exactly what the crew knew.
They did not remark aloud on Engine No.
1. One of the plane's black boxes indicated later that its power decreased, increased, then decreased again, for unknown reasons.
After the pilot ordered power cut to No.
2, he was distracted by the landing gear's failure to retract.
Meanwhile, the co-pilot kept drawing attention to the airspeed indicator.
While those decisions were being made on July 25 in the 77 seconds between 4:43:13 pp.m., when the controller spotted the fire, and 4:44:30, when the last sound was recorded, amateur photographers on the highways below were capturing the flight's death throes: a Concorde filled with German tourists hoping to be on a supersonic rendezvous with a New York cruise ship was seen fatally crippled, spewing flames and smoke as it roared low over the suburbs and farms north of Paris.
The pilots were allowed a half-minute of hope that they could make Le Bourget, a small airport used by private planes.
But then the plane banked sharply left and crashed into a small hotel in a neighborhood known as ``The Goosefoot of Gonesse''.
All 109 on board were killed, as were four on the ground.
The final report will not be issued until the plane is rebuilt in a naval air-base hangar, which could take a year, but investigators still believe that just as the Concorde had reached 195 mph _ too fast to abort takeoff _ a stray piece of bent metal stabbed deep into one of its tires.
The tire, hot from friction, exploded, sending chunks of rubber as heavy as 8 pounds flying upward with such force that they punctured the huge triangular left wing.
The plane lifted off, but as the jet fuel ignited, the left-side engines malfunctioned.
The pilot reacted, but the plane lost speed.
The transcript picked up controllers scrambling to call the airport's fire brigade, clearing Runway 26 and cooly telling the crew: ``4590, you have fierce flames behind you.
At your convenience, you have priority to return to the runway''.
But it could not.
With fire alarms gonging in the cockpit and an automatic warning system whooping, the pilot, Christian Marty, was heard to say: ``Too late.
No time, no''.
The last recorded words were from the co-pilot, Jean Marcot: ``Negative.
We're trying Le Bouget. . . No''.
For about nine seconds, there were noises described as ``unclear, sounds like exertion,'' and then the recording ended.
It was the first fatal crash in the 26 years that Concordes have been flying commercially.
Investigators warned that any of France's five remaining Concordes, now grounded, could suffer the same burst-tire accident.
``We have no certitude that, if another Concorde were to make the same flight today, the same thing would not happen,'' Paul-Louis Arslanian, director of the air investigation bureau, said Friday.
There have been six previous cases of damage to Concorde gas tanks.
In a 1979 incident at Washington's Dulles Airport, rubber debris and wheel shrapnel tore completely through a wing, but the plane landed safely.
British aviation officials said last month that their Concordes were modified in 1993 with landing gear deflectors to protect the wings in a tire blowout.
French ones, they said, were not.
A picture of the 17-inch strip of metal found on the runway that investigators believe slashed the tire was posted on the agency's Web site; it is long and thin, bent in a 7-shape and has pairs of holes, some of which contained ``cherry'' rivets, the report said.
The type of plane it came from has not been identified.
A picture of a piece of the blown tire was also released; it has a clear 12-inch slice in it.
On the day of the crash, the usual three daily inspections of the runway for debris did not take place, Arslanian said Friday, because a fire drill interfered.
The last complete inspection took place at 4:30 a.m., he said, and there was a cursory sweep of parts of the airport at noon.
The underlying causes are, of course, of great interest to the families of the 100 victims, whose lawyers are now trying to form a class action; one said he hoped to win $270 million, arguing that the typical award in American plane crashes is $2.7 million per victim.
On Wednesday, investigators said they had recovered roughly 5,000 pieces of jewelry and other valuables like watches, lighters and eyeglasses from the wreckage.
``Just imagine what people going on a cruise on an ocean liner would take with them,'' a spokesman for the Air Transport Police was quoted as saying.
The police said the valuables would be photographed and the photos given to victims' embassies so relatives could claim them.
The plane's 100 passengers included 96 Germans, two Danes, an Austrian and an American.
The nine crew members were French.
Two of those killed on the ground were Poles.
The agency's report can be found at www.bea-fr.org in French and at www.bea-fr.org/anglaise/index.htm in English translation .
PARIS _ Standing on the steps of Sacre-Coeur, the imposing basilica that sits on the hill of Montmartre, overlooking Paris, the old woman held rosary beads in veiny hands.
She said that her name was Madame Morauw, and that she had just prayed for the 113 people, nearly all of them Germans, who were killed Tuesday as a Concorde jet crashed just after takeoff, just outside Paris.
Asked if any of her family had suffered under the Germans during the war, she nodded her head and said, ``Oui, trop''.
Too much.
The woman seemed to know where the line of questioning was going.
She raised a finger to abruptly silence her questioner.
``That was a long time ago,'' Madame Morauw said.
``The French and Germans are together now''.
The crash, the first fatal accident involving the supersonic Concorde, redemonstrated that there is no such thing as an infallible airliner.
the reaction to the tragedy has also shown a remarkable transformation in the relationship between France and Germany since World War II.
Sixty years ago the Nazis bombed Paris and occupied France.
By the time Paris was liberated in August 1944, the Nazis had earned the hatred of the French people.
Nazi soldiers took special delight in drinking and carousing around the Eiffel Tower, taunting the French by turning a national symbol of French pride into a celebration of domination.
Wednesday, Joseph Meinel, a German tourist, stood in line, waiting for a chance to ride to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
``Everywhere I have gone the last two days, French people have said they were sorry about what happened to the Concorde, that they were sorry for the Germans who were killed,'' said Meinel, who lives near Berlin and who said he has come to France regularly over the years.
``I have never been treated with anything but respect,'' he said.
Hours before the crash, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, had given a speech in Frankfurt, lauding the friendship between France and Germany, saying the two countries were the undisputed leaders of the European Union and of the drive for greater European integration.
Schroeder spoke of what he called ``the French-German motor'' that drives European integration, an unfortunate choice of words given the engine failure that seems to have sent the Air France Concorde crashing in a fireball near Charles de Gaulle Airport.
It was de Gaulle who led the French resistance to the Third Reich, and last month, the German government invited the Gaullist president of France, Jacques Chirac, to be the first foreigner to speak at the newly reopened Reichstag in Berlin.
In that speech, Chirac celebrated the close relationship between the two nations, saying it was their destiny to lead a united Europe.
The French backed the American revolution and gave the United States the Statue of Liberty as a gift, while the Americans twice sent their armies to help liberate France from the Germans in the last two world wars.
Conversations with many French reveal that they see Germans as more natural and important allies.
Americans are routinely decried in France as being too powerful, too arrogant and too disdainful of the French and other European allies.
The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, has called the United States a ``hyperpower''.
(In France, huge supermarkets with hardware sections are called ``hypermarkets'').
Vedrine and his German counterpart, Joschka Fischer, have repeatedly tried to persuade Britain, their historical shared enemy, of joining them as leaders of the European Union _ an invitation the British have continually declined, viewing the Germans and French with equal suspicion.
In his speech before the crash, Schroeder, whose father was a German solider who died in battle three days before Schroeder was born in 1944, said that ``German-French relations have not been this good for a long time''.
Hours later, after learning that almost all of the passengers who died on the French plane were German, a somber Schroeder said, ``Germany and France are united in their horror over the accident''.
France's prime minister, Lionel Jospin, was visibly shaken after touring the scene of devastation.
He said he was mourning ``the victims, the flight crew, and our German friends''.
Maria Nelson, an Irishwoman married to a Frenchman, agreed that relations between the two former bitter enemies have improved dramatically in the 14 years that she has lived in France.
But she says the French bitterness, especially in the older generation, is just below the surface.
``You hear remarks about Nazis,'' she said.
``You don't have to dig too deep, especially with older people who lived through the war''.
Yet that bitterness was hard to find Wednesday as the sun shone and the French came to terms with the loss of both a symbol of French ingenuity and of more than 100 people, many of whose parents and grandparents would have been part of an army that occupied France just 60 years ago.
Madame Morauw said it best, just before she gingerly descended the stairs at Sacre-Coeur Wednesday.
``Germans bleed,'' the old woman said, ``just like us.''
PARIS _ French investigators looking into the crash last month of an Air France Concorde said Thursday it was probable that a 16-inch piece of metal found on the runway caused a tire to blow out, sending debris from the tire through fuel tanks and triggering a fire that brought down the plane.
It was the first time the investigators had offered a probable explanation of why the jet caught fire on takeoff and crashed into a hotel north of Paris on July 25, killing 113 people.
The Bureau of Accident Investigations, which is looking into the causes of the crash, said in a statement that the metal strip appeared to match the shape of a gash found in one of the plane's left-side tires, and that it was `'probable that this piece caused the cut''.
Since the disaster 16 days ago, investigators have focused on the possibility that a tire blew out and that its debris damaged the plane, starting the fire.
In their statement Thursday, the investigators said that the bursting of the tire while the plane was moving down the runway at about 195 mph threw up large pieces of the tire, some of them weighing as much as 9 pounds.
The investigators steered clear of a final explanation, but they said that as a result of the debris from the tire, ``one of several fuel tanks on the left wing was very rapidly damaged, with as a consequence a very important fuel leak and fire''.
Exactly how this happened had not yet been determined, they said.
In earlier statements, the investigators had said that tire marks found on the runway after the crash showed that the aircraft had veered to the left before taking off.
They also said that in addition to traces of tire marks, pieces of a water deflector fixed above the left-side tires and debris from a fuel tank had been found on the runway.
Thursday the investigators further reported that parts of the plane's No.
5 fuel tank were found.
The Concorde is outfitted with seven fuel tanks in each wing.
The tires on the Concorde are supplied by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.
, which manufactures them at a factory in Virginia.
Last week, Goodyear officials confirmed that the company's specialists had been sent to France to assist the investigators.
The investigators have thus far been unable to determine whether the metal strip was part of the Concorde.
Xavier Mulot, a captain in the French air transport police who is conducting a parallel legal investigation of the crash, said at a news conference that he could not say if the metal strip belonged to the Concorde.
Last week, investigators from the Bureau of Accident Investigations said they believed the piece was not a part of the plane.
Work was suspended last week because of health concerns, after asbestos particles were found in the debris.
But Thursday investigators resumed work, collecting and sorting out debris from the crash.
Investigators have been gathering remains from the Concorde's four engines and seeking to reassemble key parts of the plane to determine the cause of the crash.
Attention has focused on the placement of the engines.
A report in the British publication New Scientist, the contents of which were released Thursday, stated that a study commissioned in 1998 by British Airways, which also flies the Concorde, revealed 55 ``significant risks'' inherent in the design of the plane's jet engines.
Among the risks, the report cited the danger of uncontrolled fire and multiple engine failure.
GONESSE, France (AP) -- One month after an Air France Concorde crashed outside Paris, victims' relatives gathered Saturday to remember their loved ones near the site where the supersonic jet went down.
Family members were flown in from Germany by Air France, which suspended all Concorde flights immediately after the July 25 crash outside Gonesse, a small town nine miles northeast of Paris.
Most of the crash victims were Germans flying to New York to join a luxury cruise through the Caribbean.
Journalists were not allowed to approach the site Saturday.
Family members were seen crying and holding red carnations after a brief visit to the site.
A technical investigation is being carried out by the Accident and Inquiry Office, a part of the French Transportation Ministry.
The office is expected to release a preliminary report on the crash on August 31.
British Airways, the only other airliner to operate the Concorde, suspended its flights on August 15.
PARIS (AP) -- His supersonic jet aflame and two engines failing, Christian Marty, captain of the doomed Concorde flight, tried to gain speed for an emergency landing less than two minutes after takeoff.
''Concorde zero...
4590, You have flames.
You have flames behind you,'' the control tower warned.
Seconds later came Marty's chilling word: ''Too late''.
A preliminary report on the crash posted on the Internet Thursday by French investigators provides a graphic account of the final moments of Air France flight 4590 -- a chillingly professional cockpit exchange that indicates the control tower gave the first alert of trouble but that the crew was powerless to change their aircraft's course.
The July 25 crash, the first in the Concorde's 24 years of commercial service, killed all 109 people aboard, mainly German tourists, and four on the ground.
The 75-page report by France's Accident and Inquiry Office, the BEA, underscores that the crew was unaware, then unable, to correct a trajectory toward disaster.
The flaming plane slammed into a small hotel, decimating it, and was partially embedded in the ground.
Both France and Britain -- the only countries with supersonic fleets -- last month withdrew the Concorde's airworthiness certification while the investigation proceeds.
The BEA, which draws no conclusions in its report, planned a news conference Friday.
Its final report is not expected for at least a year.
A judicial investigation also is in progress.
The report gives a second-by-second description of events.
It was 4:43 p.m.
The sleek supersonic had just lifted its needle nose toward the heavens after roaring down the runway at breathtaking speed.
Seven seconds after the message from the control tower at Charles de Gaulle airport, the chief navigator confirmed, ''Breakdown eng... breakdown engine two''.
''Cut engine two,'' he said, four seconds later.
The aircraft tried to gain speed for an emergency landing.
But Marty could be heard saying: ''Too late''.
The control tower was trying to coax the Concorde back to runway 26, where it had taken off.
''Negative. We're trying for Le Bourget,'' a small nearby airport, the copilot responded.
It was 4:44 p.m. and 22 seconds.
There were some sounds similar to exertion.
Nine seconds later all was silent.
''The crew had neither the means to be aware of the nature of the fire nor to fight it,'' the report said.
The report stresses that it was the destruction of a forward tire on the left landing gear -- gashed by a 16-inch stray piece of metal on the runway -- that likely triggered a chain of events dooming the flight.
Yet there was no indication from the transcript of cockpit conversation that the crew was aware of a problem.
''It's burning badly, and I'm not sure it's coming from the engine,'' said someone in the control tower.
''Gong'' sounds were periodically recorded inside the plane.
Investigators believe that heavy chunks of rubber from the burst Goodyear tire damaged the fuel tanks located in the Concorde's delta-shaped wings.
Less than two minutes had elapsed from the time the tire was gashed to the time the plane crashed, the report said.
The flames appeared less than a minute after takeoff.
The highly technical report contains simple, telling photographs, like that of a nearly 9-pound tire part with a nearly 13-inch gash, the bent metal strip that destroyed the tire and the crash site.
After the tire was gashed, a fire appeared under the left wing, the report said, followed by problems on engines No.
1 and 2.
''The plane can neither gain altitude nor accelerate.
The crew notes that the landing gears cannot be lifted''.
Then the motor stops.
''The Concorde has crashed near Le Bourget ...
,'' the control tower said at 4:45 and 10 seconds.
A minute later, the control tower sent out a general message: ''For all planes listening, I'll get back to you in a minute.
We're going to pull ourselves together and restart takeoffs''.

GONESSE, France _ The doomed Air France Concorde apparently lost power in two of its four engines as it was taking off, and the flight crew was unable to retract the aircraft's landing gear, government investigators said Thursday.
The swan-like supersonic aircraft also left pieces of tire on the runway and had dropped debris along the 4-mile trajectory of its brief flight, the French Bureau of Accident Investigation, or BEA, also said in a statement.
Readings recovered from one of the so-called ``black boxes'' recovered from the aircraft indicated that the left No.
1 engine malfunctioned as the Concorde rotated for take-off.
This engine was next to the No.
2 engine, which was repaired before take-off and burst into flame as the aircraft took flight.
``The aircraft was in flight for less than one minute when the parameters of engine No.
1 decreased again, the plane lurched strongly to the left and crashed,'' the BEA said.
``In the sound recording, we noted that the crew announced a problem in engine No.
2 and a little later they said the undercarriage would not come up.
``The flight data recorder shows that on take-off engine No.
2 lost power to the point that it stopped, and that engine No.
1 temporarily lost power,'' according to the statement.
Tower controllers told the pilots that flames were streaming from the rear of the plane during take-off, but the Concorde was traveling too fast to halt the flight, the BEA said.
A French aviation engineer who serves as an official adviser to French courts said initial findings suggested that a tire might have exploded on take-off sending pieces into an engine, setting off a chain reaction.
``We can have ingestion of foreign objects in the engines, and then you have problems in the engine,'' Raymond Auffray told the BBC.
Meanwhile, Air France's remaining five Concorde's stayed grounded as the investigation progressed Thursday.
British Airways, the only other airline to fly the high-speed transport planes, resumed its Concorde flights between New York and London Wednesday.
The BEA _ the French equivalent of the U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board _ is studying about 600 pieces of technical information including mechanical readings and the aircraft's altitude, speed and position contained in the black boxes recovered from the aircraft, which crashed Tuesday.
Government experts have extracted all the information from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, the BEA said Thursday, adding that it planned to finish a preliminary report at the end of August.
The agency said it was unclear how soon the data would yield more clues about what caused the crash that killed 113 people when the Concorde crashed into a small hotel near Paris.
Experts also intend to study the amateur video aired Wednesday on television news reports to determine if, for example, the color and size of the flames can determine the temperature and source of the fire, investigators said.
The Concorde was carrying 100 passengers _ 96 Germans, two Danes, an American and an Austrian _ and nine French crew members.
Two Polish women were among the four people killed on the ground.
Six members of one German family died in the crash, including a 10-year-old boy and a seven-year-old girl, the newspaper France Soir reported Thursday.
Before the BEA report was released, Auffray, the aviation expert, told La Croix newspaper that evidence and observations suggested that an engine turbine blade might have failed.
He told the newspaper that investigators should focus on turbine blades inside both Rolls-Royce engines under the left wing.
Auffray said the pilots' loss of control indicates that a ruptured blade may have caused the engine to break up inside.
Local government officials said Thursday that the bodies of all 113 victims had been recovered from the wreckage and transferred to a medical institute in Paris for examination.
Most were burned beyond recognition in the inferno, and can only be identified by dental records or DNA tests.
After remains were removed, about 40 forensic experts in white-hooded suits continued working in the drizzle to comb the charred crash site for anything _ wedding rings, teeth, scraps of clothing _ that might help identify the victims.
``The bodies are terribly mutilated, and some are so badly burned that it's impossible to recognize them,'' Fabien Tillon, a spokesman at the regional police headquarters, told the Associated Press.
Mourners, including high-level officials from the French and German governments, streamed into the beautiful Madeleine Church in central Paris to pay their respects to the victims.
It is the same church where Parisians gathered to pray after the death of Princess Diana here in 1998.
The church, which holds about 1,000 people, was filled with uniformed Air France pilots, cabin crew and other staff and the families of many of those who died.
German relatives of the victims, some holding one another for support, arrived in buses provided by the Paris Airports Authority.
Many wore dark glasses in the bright summer sunshine.
Outside the church, a priest in purple and white robes greeted mourners.
Passers-by laid bunches of flowers in tribute.
President Jacques Chirac, who did not attend the service, sent a large bouquet of pale pink roses and other flowers.
A priest began the service with these words: ``We are gathered here united in our pain and if possible, united in our hope''.
At Charles de Gaulle airport, where the Concorde took off Tuesday on its journey to New York, travelers and Air France employees observed a moment of silence.
A similar ceremony took place at Orly Airport, Paris' other major airport which is served by Air France.
Air France said Thursday it would pay $20,000 each to surviving families to help defray immediate expenses such as funeral costs.
Residents of Genosse, a working-class town of 20,000, plan to hold a silent march to the crash site Friday.
Merchants said they would close shop to honor the dead.
Also Thursday, the Val d'Oise region prosecutor officially opened an investigation into the accident to determine whether charges could be brought for ``involuntary homicide and involuntary injury''.
And French newspapers reported that investigators had seized maintenance documents relating to the repair work on the engine's thrust reverser.
Such an investigation is not unusual in France following such a large accident.

WASHINGTON _ A plume of fire about to consume a marvel of aviation, a moment of horror frozen forever in a stunning image: To Prof.
W. David Lewis, who studies the history of technology, the burning Concorde looked like a zeppelin for the new century.
``It's haunting,'' said Lewis, a historian at Auburn University.
``That long fiery path in the sky, it reminds me, not in detail but in overall symbolic concept, of the Hindenburg''.
But it is not just that both had a fiery end, the Air France jet as it took off near Paris on Tuesday and the giant German zeppelin as it was being moored in Lakehurst, N.J., on May 6, 1937.
Both supersonic jet and zeppelin, Lewis pointed out, were symbols of national pride.
Each offered luxury service for a wealthy few, and both operated at times of rapid technological change that made their futures uncertain.
And both, it seems, are instructive about the difficulties of predicting technological progress.
It remains to be seen whether the accident last week, which killed 114 people including five on the ground, will kill the supersonic transports the way the Hindenburg ended the promise of the dirigible, when it crashed killing 35 people on board and one on the ground.
But progress _ including, perhaps, progress in safety _ has bypassed both.
In its day, the Concorde was the ne plus ultra of technology, the edge of the envelope in speed and altitude.
Thirty years later, the envelope has stretched a great deal, but in other directions, notably toward safety, comfort and reliability.
And though the Concorde still flies twice as fast and twice as high, the question is whether it has been left behind.
Predicting technological change is hard, and the airlines and plane builders are not good at it.
When the Concorde was new, Boeing was turning out 747s, the world's largest plane, as a stopgap until supersonics could become the mainstay of commercial aviation, and Pan Am was talking about carrying passengers to the moon.
The moon is still there but now is unvisited even by astronauts.
Pan Am is gone.
The 747 has only grown to carry more people more miles, and the Concordes are dwindling like the last of an endangered species: 20 were built; 12 remain.
There are more of every high-profile thing that flies, except maybe for the space shuttles and the Goodyear blimps.
Technology has advanced in ways almost unimaginable in 1976, when the Concordes entered commercial service to the United States.
And while expectations may have scaled back in some areas, like trips to the moon, they have grown in other ways, almost without our noticing, especially in the ubiquity and safety of air travel.
In 1969, the year the Concorde first broke the sound barrier, the total number of people carried on planes in the United States was less than the country's population.
This year, the number of passengers is more than double the population.
New planes carry entertainment screens in every seat-back.
The Concorde's design does not allow even an in-flight movie.
Makers of new planes boast that they will fly almost continuously, day after day.
The typical Concorde, in contrast, flies 3 hours a day or less.
The Concorde is one of the few examples in history of a technology whose successor was slower.
It bears a passing resemblance to the U.S. nuclear power industry, which used a technology that looked advanced and attractive in the 1960s and '70s, only to seem, 20 years later, esoteric and not worth the bother and expense.
It is as if the airlines have decided the tortoise is sexier than the hare.
Flying is now safer than driving, taking the train or walking, and almost safer than staying home.
One reason is that airplanes are now mass produced, and their failures protect each other.
There are, for example, about 2,600 Boeing 737s in service, and every now and then, somebody finds something worrisome in one of them, like a power conduit inside a fuel tank that has short-circuited and is giving off sparks.
But the result is a swift order to inspect the other thousands for the same problem and fix it.
In contrast, if the cause of the Concorde crash turns out to be a generic flaw, the population protected will be the remaining 12 airplanes.
But in the grand sweep of technological progress, that may not be a fair way to consider safety, or even a sensible one.
``If you do take that approach, we'll never have any advances,'' said John R.
Deakin, a veteran Boeing 747 pilot and safety expert.
``Somebody has to be out there on the bleeding edge.''
LONDON (AP) -- The grounding of the Concorde left a hole at the top end of the travel market, reducing the rich and famous to the same subsonic pace as the rest of humanity.
''Of course, for people who used it, it's a disaster in two areas: It got you there quickly, and it got you there more interestingly,'' British film director Michael Winner said Wednesday.
''And you met a better class of people in the lounge''.
The decision by British and French authorities to suspend certification of the supersonic plane leaves executives, celebrities and the merely wealthy with no alternative for cutting the time of a trans-Atlantic flight.
Air France grounded its remaining five Concordes immediately after the July 25 crash near Paris that killed 113 people.
British Airways, which has seven Concordes, persisted until crash investigators discovered that the failure of a tire was the primary cause of the disaster -- and could threaten other flights.
Opera singer Placido Domingo said he has taken the Concorde many times and ''always appreciated the fact that it got me to my destination in a miraculously short time and safely''.
''I'm appreciating it doubly now that they have taken the precaution of grounding the planes until they know all the pertinent facts about this terrible tragedy,'' said Domingo, who is in Austria at the Salzburg festival.
''It is a tragedy and a shattering blow for this country if it is the end of Concorde,'' noted food critic Egon Ronay told The Times of London.
''It is such a prestigious brand and something Britain was known for''.
Travel agents already are hearing from customers.
''I have only one couple -- a very big philanthropist -- they are very upset that they have to go on subsonic flight,'' said Rina Anoussi, owner of The Travel Business in New York City.
Grounding Concorde ''will affect a lot of people because of the extraordinary savings of time.
I have a lot of people who love the London Concorde for the time, for the prestige,'' Anoussi said.
And people love the Concorde for the chance to sit near a celebrity -- whether it be Michael Jackson, Madonna, Paul McCartney, Margaret Thatcher or Mike Tyson.
Celebrities, however, are a small slice of the Concorde market.
''It's mainly businessmen, average age around 40 -- sort of bankers, that sort of thing,'' said Steve Miller of Air News, a news agency based at Heathrow airport.
''And you get a very small percentage of people who have saved up their money for a once-in-a-lifetime treat.
You get cruise passengers as well''.
British Airways promised Wednesday to seek urgent meetings with the plane's makers and regulators to get the supersonic jets back in the air.
Britain's Civil Aviation Authority stripped the airline's Concordes of permission to fly after investigators said a burst tire probably caused the deadly crash.
The Air France Concordes were already grounded; French aviation officials also suspended their flight certification Wednesday.
British aviation authority chairman Sir Malcolm Field said the Concorde's certificate of airworthiness would remain suspended until ''appropriate measures'' had been taken to ensure the safety of the aircraft's tires.
Despite the crash and the actions of French and British officials, Concorde retained its allure for many flyers.
''I'd get on it in a minute,'' said American film director John Waters, who confessed he never flew the Concorde.
''What will be will be,'' Water said from Baltimore.
''I'm scared of cars, not planes.''

ULAN BATOR, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) Chairman Qiao Shi said today that China attaches great importance to developing friendly and good-neighborly relations with Mongolia.
China sees Mongolia as an important neighbor, Qiao noted, saying that it will always respect Mongolia's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as its people's own choice for their social system and road of development.
The Sino-Mongolian cooperation in various fields has expanded since the normalization of the two countries' relations in 1989, Qiao said while meeting Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj, chairman of Mongolia's State Great Hural, the country's top legislature.
China is willing to push forward, together with Mongolia, long-term and stable friendly and good-neighborly relations and cooperation on the basis of the five principles of the peaceful co-existence and the China-Mongolia Treaty of Friendly Relations and Cooperation, he said.
The top Chinese legislator pointed out that China is especially willing to further its economic and trade ties with Mongolia.
On his part, Gonchigdorj thanked the Chinese government and people for their support and assistance during Mongolia's transition from a planning economy to a market-oriented one.
One important part of Mongolia's foreign policy, he said, is to strength friendly relations and cooperation with China, which is not only in the interests of the two countries, but also favorable for peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific region.
Mongolia is willing to establish friendly relations and cooperation with China geared towards the 21st century, he added.
Mongolia is the last stop of Qiao's European and Asian tour, which has already taken him to France, Norway and Italy.
It is also the first visit to Mongolia by a Chinese NPC chairman.
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said today that China will as always hold to the policy of good-neighborly friendship with Mongolia and abide by the principles guiding Sino-Mongolian relations.
Tang said this during talks today with visiting Minister of External Relations of Mongolia Nyam-Osorin Tuyaa.
China attaches importance to its relations with Mongolia, and will maintain friendly ties no matter how the international situation changes, Tang added.
Tuyaa said that one principal guideline of the Mongolian government is to develop relations of friendship and cooperation with China, and Mongolia will work together with China to assure healthy Mongolia-China good-neighborly relations of long-term stability and mutual trust.
Tang also told Tuyaa about the decision of the Chinese government to provide one million yuan (about 120,482 US dollars) worth of aid to the snow-stricken regions of Mongolia.
On the Taiwan issue, Tuyaa said that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory and Mongolia will as always persist in the "one China" policy.
Tuyaa arrived here today for an official visit to China at Tang 's invitation.
KUWAIT CITY, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Natsagin Bagabandi would start an official visit to Kuwait Saturday mainly aimed at promoting economic and trade relations, Mongolian non-resident ambassador to Kuwait was quoted as declaring Friday.
Sairaan Kader, who is based in Cairo, Egypt, and also in charge of Kuwait affairs, said Bagabandi will hold talks with Kuwait Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah which will cover ways to promote bilateral relations, especially in the economic fields, the Middle East Peace process and issues of mutual interest, according to Kuwait News Agency.
Bagagandi will accompanied by a high-powered delegation including his foreign minister, development and housing minister, lawmakers and 30 businessmen.
The visit to Kuwait will be the first for Bagagandi since he was elected the President of the Asian country.
Kuwait Amir paid a visit to Mongolia in October, 1995.
During Bagabandi Kuwait tour, the two countries are expected to sign an economic cooperation agreement to build a 180-kilometer road in Mongolia valued at 59.4 million U.S. dollars to be funded by Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development.
Other projects under consideration are a hydroelectric station project and an oil refinery project in the central Asian country, Kader said.
Kader also appealed on Kuwaiti businessmen to invest in Mongolia which is rich in natural resources.
ULAN BATOR, April 30 (Xinhua) -- France and Britain have both pledged to continue their support for Mongolia's foreign policy and its political and economic reforms, Mongolian President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat said here Monday.
The two countries also promised to continue humanitarian aid to Mongolia and expressed appreciation of and backing for its self-declared nuclear-free status, Ochirbat said in an interview with the newspaper People's Right.
Mongolia's reforms, aimed at transforming its centrally-planned economy into a market-oriented one, have won support from France and Britain since they were launched in 1990, said Ochirbat, shortly after his return from his first visit to the two countries.
France promised to grant Mongolia 10 million francs (about 2 million U.S. dollars) in aid to establish a geographical remote control research center, and decided to reopen its embassy in Ulan Bator as quickly as possible, Ochirbat said.
The two European countries also agreed to strengthen their relations with Mongolia and increase economic and trade contacts, he added.
ULAN BATOR, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Some international organizations and foreign countries vowed here Tuesday to provide 320 million U.S. dollars in loans and aid to Mongolia to help it overcome economic difficulties and to assist in the transition to a market economy.
Under the promise reached in a two-day international conference on economic aid to Mongolia by some participant states and international organizations, Mongolia will receive 320 million dollars in the next 18 months.
The money will be used to stabilize its macro economy, carry out reforms on economic structuring and the monetary system, upgrade infrastructure, support the development of private ownership and solve social problems such as unemployment and poverty.
Some 20 countries, including China, the United States, Japan, and eight international organizations, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, attended the meeting, the 7th of its kind.
This meeting was co-sponsored by the World Bank and the Mongolian government.
Mongolia has secured 2 billion dollars in loans and aids from the international communities in the period from 1991 to 1998.
According to reports here, about 45 percent of Mongolia's annual investment and budget depends on foreign loans and economic aid.
ULAN BATOR, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States will continue supporting the economic and political reforms in Mongolia, a U.S. senior official said here.
U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Susan Shirk, who was on a visit to Mongolia between November 12-14, made the remarks while meeting with Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy and Prime Minister Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan.
She said that the United States was satisfied with the development of relations and cooperation with Mongolia during the past ten years after the two countries set up diplomatic ties.
The U.S. is also willing to cooperate with Mongolia in the field of environmental protection, Susan added.
She also revealed that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would probably visit the Asian country.
Enkhsaikhan was grateful to the U.S. support for his country's reforms and considered Susan's visit as a good beginning for the U.S. delegation afterward.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the U.S. government attached great importance to the strategic status of Mongolia, which led to rapid development of the relations between the two countries.
So far, Mongolia has received more than 70 million U.S. dollars of economic and technological aid from the United States, and the two sides had signed an agreement on military exchange and cooperation.
ULAN BATOR, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian Prime Minister Janlaviin Narantsatsralt said here Saturday that his country will expand and further develop relations of "comprehensive partnership " with Japan oriented toward the 21st century.
Narantsatsralt made the remarks while meeting with his Japanese counterpart Keizo Obuchi, who arrived here on Saturday noon for a two-day visit.
Mongolia needs foreign support and aid, especially those from donor nations, to help it deepen the comprehensive socio-economic reforms, Narantsatsralt said.
He also expressed his gratitude to Japan for its promise to increase loans and assistance to Mongolia.
During the talks, Obuchi said that Japan, which is the largest donor nation for Mongolia, will support the inland country's democratic and economic reform, the expansion of bilateral trade, the increase of investment in Mongolia and the development of small- and medium-size enterprises.
The two leaders also exchanged views on the situation in the Korean Peninsula and in the Northeast Asian region.
Obuchi also held talks with Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy and parliament chairman Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj.
The relations between Japan and Mongolia have developed rapidly since the early 1990s.
Japan has organized six international meetings with the World Bank to help Mongolia get 1.7 billion U.S. dollars, about one third of which was from Japan.
At the seventh international meeting for assistance to Mongolia held in June, Japan promised to provide 115 million dollars worth of loans in aid to Mongolia within the coming 18 months.
Obuchi flew in after a visit to China.
ULAN BATOR, April 4 (Xinhua) - Canadian Senate speaker Gildas Molgat has announced that his country will give financial aid to Mongolia and set up an honorary consulate here to promote economic and trade relations between the two countries.

About 10 Canadian companies are engaged in gold and uranium exploration and mining in Mongolia.
ULAN BATOR, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The first French cabinet minister visiting Mongolia has brought in a grant of 20 million French franc (about 3.5 million U.S. dollars).
Corinne Lepage, France's minister of environment, told a press conference today that the assistance is earmarked for hydro-power and environmental protection projects in Mongolia.
To facilitate the official aid program, Lepage said at the end of her two-day stay, she had signed a protocol with Shukhar Altangerel, Mongolia's minister of external relations.
An agreement was signed with her Mongolian counterpart Tsohio Adyasuren on cooperation in environmental protection, she said.
During her visit, Lepage met with Mongolian President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat and Prime Minister Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan, and attended the opening ceremony of a French cultural center at the Mongolian Foreign Languages Institute.
Enkhsaikhan reportedly told Lepage that while Mongolia has rich natural resources and France owns advanced technologies, the two could work together to complement each other's advantages.
He also expressed hope to further the bilateral cooperation in culture and tourism.
Although the two countries has had diplomatic ties since 1965, it was during President Ochirbat's tour of France last April that they agreed on the reopening of French embassy here and their relations took an upturn.
MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Economic problems between Russia and Mongolia will be resolved, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Maksimovich Primakov said on Tuesday.
He acknowledged that Mongolia's debts to Russia and Russia's raising of value-added-tax which has prevented Mongolian products from entering the Russian market, have caused some problems in bilateral relations.
But he assured visiting Mongolian Minister of External Relations Tserenpiliyn Gombosuren that these difficulties could be overcome.
Primakov said that in spite of these problems, Russia's relations with Mongolia are developing positively and that there are no major conflicts between the two countries.
The Russian foreign minister also welcomed the development of good relations between China and Mongolia and said he supported the maintenance of active dialogue between countries in the region.
Jasray said that his current visit is aimed at strengthening bilateral relations and cooperation, adding that such relations in various fields have scored great progress in the past few years.
Describing Li's visit to Mongolia in 1994 as important for the smooth development of bilateral relations, Jasray said that the treaty on bilateral friendship and cooperation is functioning as the political and legal basis for bilateral relations.
Jasray told Lit that Mongolia attaches importance to its friendly relations with China, which is in the interests of the two peoples, and conducive to regional peace and stability.
The Mongolian side appreciated China's policy on good-neighborly ties and China's support for Mongolia as a nuclear-free zone, added Jasray.
He also noted that Mongolia is glad to see the marked development of bilateral economic and trade relations in the past few years, and the smooth development of bilateral economic cooperation, especially China's investment in Mongolia.
China's economic aid to Mongolia has also played an important role in the economic development of Mongolia, according to Jasray.
He reiterated that Mongolia always sticks to a "one China" policy, and recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government representing China.
Noting that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, Jasray said that Mongolia opposes Taiwan's entry into the United Nations.
He added that Mongolia will not have any official contact with Taiwan, except some non-governmental trade exchanges.
Li expressed his appreciation for Mongolia's position on the Taiwan question.
In addition, the two prime ministers briefed each other on the situations in their respective countries.
After the talks, the two sides signed three documents including an agreement on economic and technological cooperation between the two governments.

ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia has decided to apply to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the government press office said today.
The decision was made at a recent government meeting and the application process was entrusted with the ministries of external relations as well as trade and industry.

ULAN BATOR, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia will give priority to developing its relations with China and Russia, President Nachagyn Bagabandy said today in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
"We believe that developing relations with China and Russia has been and will always be the primary principle of Mongolia's foreign policies," he said.
The president praised China for its fast economic development, and said China's role and reputation on the world stage have increased day by day.
He said China has become an important force in maintaining stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the whole world, and Mongolia will "further develop its cooperative relationship with China, which is beneficial to both sides".
Bagabandy, who was sworn in as Mongolia's new president Sunday, said that in recent years Mongolia has expanded its cooperation with China, and the two countries have enhanced mutual understanding and trust between them.
He added that the legal basis for developing the relationship between the two nations has been further consolidated.
The official visit to Mongolia in April by Qiao Shi, chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, is an important step toward a closer relationship and cooperation between the two countries, he said.
Mongolia is willing to promote the good-neighborly ties of cooperation with China in the spirits of equality and mutual benefits and in accordance with international norms and a friendship agreement signed in 1994, said the president.
"Mongolia pursues an open foreign policy of non-alignment," he said.
In developing foreign relations, he said, it is highly important for Mongolia to create a sound outside environment, overcome difficulties arising from the transformation of economic structures, and to promote national economy and social development.
On domestic issues, Bagabandy said he will give priority to curbing inflation and stabilizing currency exchange rates.
"Only when the prices and currency exchange rates are kept stable, can the country ensure that more investments will flow in, people's income will rise and people will enhance their confidence in the future".
Bagabandy vowed to give particular attention to fighting unemployment and poverty, which have become the most serious problems of the country.
Government statistics show that by June, 64,200 Mongolians had lost their jobs, but the actual number of unemployment had reached 200,000.
In order to reduce poverty and unemployment, Mongolia has to take macro-control measures to stabilize economic situation, increase investment, revitalize national industry, agriculture and animal husbandry, and fully support private productive activities, commerce and trade, he noted.
ULAN BATOR, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian Ministry of External Relations should be active in promoting economic diplomacy, its new minister R.
Amarjargal said in the People's Right newspaper published on Friday.
In his first speech published after he took office late last month, Amarjargal said it is the call of the times to add economic diplomacy to the work of the ministry, for the economic relations between Mongolia and other countries bear a special significance for Mongolia's further development.
On the fundamental principle of Mongolia's foreign policy, the 37-year-old minister said his country should be active in political and economic activities in the northeast Asia and the whole Asian-Pacific region.
He also stressed the need to maintain a consistent Mongolian foreign policy by keeping its relationship with China and Russia at an appropriate level.
ULAN BATOR, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States will expand bilateral relations and multilateral cooperation with Mongolia, visiting U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said here Saturday.
In a joint statement released after meeting Mongolian Prime Minister Tsakhiya Elbegdorj, Albright pledged U.S. support for Mongolia's ongoing economic and political reforms and continued U.S. aid to Mongolia.
The United States backs Mongolia's efforts to join international organizations which are influential in the world, and recognizes its status as a nuclear-free state, she said.
The U.S. secretary of state said she was pleased to see Mongolia improving and expanding relations with neighboring Russia and China, as well as other nations in the region.
On his part, Elbegdorj thanked the United States for its support and said Albright's visit will advance the Mongolian-U.S.
ties. The United States and Mongolia established diplomatic relations in January 1987.
Both sides agreed to expand relations in political, economic, scientific and cultural sectors, and explored the possibility of cooperation in environment protection.
They expressed satisfaction over their cooperation in the defense area, such as programs for non-combative trainings and disaster relief efforts.
Albright, who is here for a nine-hour stay starting Saturday morning, also met Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy and Tadnaasumberel Gonchigdorj, chairman of the Great Hural, or parliament.
She is the highest ranking U.S. official to visit Mongolia since former U.S.
Secretary of State James Baker's visits in August 1990 and July 1991.
The United States supports the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to extend preferential loans to Mongolia.
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China has always understood the importance of developing a long-term, stable, and good-neighborly friendship with Mongolia, and any changes in Mongolia's political system and government will not affect China's consistent and friendly policies toward the country.
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen made the comment here this afternoon during his talks with Mongolian Minister of External Relations Shukher Altangerel, who is on his first visit abroad since he took office.
Qian welcomed Altangerel, saying that China and Mongolia are friendly neighbors, and that since the normalization of bilateral ties, the contacts and cooperation in various fields and between different departments of the two sides have kept expanding and moving forward.
Qian appreciates Mongolia's stand on maintaining friendly ties with its two great neighbors, China and Russia, and said that through joint efforts, China and Mongolia will always be "good neighbors and friends".
Altangerel said China and Mongolia have a long history of contacts, and that the development of bilateral ties is in the interests of the two peoples.
He went on to say that there are no unresolved problems between Mongolia and China, and bilateral relations will be further developed as long as the two sides trust each other and enhance consultations.
Both sides agreed that China and Mongolia are economically complementary and have the potential and conditions for further expanding economic and trade cooperation.
They also agreed to continue to explore ways for increasing bilateral economic and trade cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
Qian briefed Altangerel on the decision made by the China Red Cross Society to provide 20,000 US dollars in relief aid to its Mongolian counterpart, to help Mongolia's snowstorm victims.
Altangerel thanked Qian for this.
After the talks, Qian and Altangerel signed an agreement between the two governments on the placement of the Mongolian honorary consulate in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China.
Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and Mongolian Ambassador to China Dagva Tsakhilgaan were present during the talks.
This evening, Qian hosted a dinner in honor of Altangerel and his party.
Altangerel arrived here earlier today on an official visit to China as Qian's guest.
ULAN BATOR, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide free technical aid worth 400,000 U.S. dollars to Mongolia to help improve the living conditions of the country's poor.
An ADB representative, after signing the agreement here with Mongolian officials, told reporters poverty is one of the issues obstructing economic restructuring in Mongolia and the bank hopes the assistance will help solve the problem.
Montsame News Agency today said the assistance will go to the Mongolian Women's Foundation for Helping the Poor.
Earlier this month, the United Nations Development Program granted 800,000 U.S. dollars to the foundation.
A poverty alleviation program set up by the Mongolian government in 1995 will cost the country 83.6 million U.S. dollars.
But half the cost is expected to come from international organizations and foreign nations.
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met with visiting Mongolian Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray here this afternoon, and they exchanged views on furthering bilateral relations in a friendly conversation.
Extending his welcome to Jasray, Jiang mentioned the "very good talks" yesterday between Chinese Premier Li Peng and Jasray, and said he believed that Jasray's current visit to China will make new contributions to furthering bilateral good-neighborly friendship.

Noting that Mongolia is an important neighbor of China, Jiang said that to safeguard and develop Sino-Mongolian good-neighborly friendship and reciprocal co-operation, a set policy of the Chinese Government and the common aspiration of the two peoples, is in the fundamental interests of the two countries.
He went on to say that no matter what changes take place in the international arena, China will always abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence and the treaty on Sino-Mongolian friendship and co-operation, and make unremitting efforts to achieve a long-term, steady and healthy development of bilateral ties.
Last year Mongolia made new progress in safeguarding social stability, and developing its economy and foreign relations, which China was glad to notice, according to Jiang.
He pointed out that, as a neighbor of Mongolia, China sincerely hopes for social stability, economic prosperity and people's happiness in Mongolia.

The Mongolian minister came to China yesterday for a week-long visit at the invitation of China's Foreign Ministry.
ULAN BATOR, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia is satisfied with its relations and cooperation with Japan, President Nachagyn Bagabandy told a Japanese parliamentary delegation today.
Developing Mongolian-Japanese relations is of primary importance, as Japan has supported Mongolia's reform and provided it with economic and technical assistance, Bagabandy said.
In addition, Japan has for years hosted international conferences of Mongolia's donators, and all these have contributed to stablizing the country's economy, he said.
Mongolia has received 1.484 billion U.S. dollars in aid and loan since 1991, with one third of it coming from Japan.
Prime Minister Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan and Chairman of the Great Hural (parliament) Radnasumberlyn Gonchigdorzh also met separately with the Japanese delegation during its four-day visit.
The delegation, headed by House of Representative Deputy Speaker Kozo Watanabe, arrived in Mongolia on Monday.
ULAN BATOR, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian Prime Minister Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan left here today for a five-day working visit to Japan.
During his visit, Enkhsaikhan will hold talks with his Japanese counterpart Ryutaro Hashimoto on establishing a relationship of overall partnership between the two counties to face the 21st century.
They will also sign an agreement on Japan's free economic aid to Mongolia to help stabilize its economy and promote its food production.
Mongolia and Japan established diplomatic relations in 1972.
Ever since, to develop positive relations with Japan has been one of the top priorities in Mongolia's foreign policy, with economic cooperation having a major role.
The largest donor country of Mongolia, Japan accounts for one third of its foreign aid.
In the past years, trade volume between them was on the increase, hitting 112 milliion U.S. dollars in 1996.
ULAN BATOR, April 30 (Xinhua) -- France and Britain have both pledged to continue their support for Mongolia's foreign policy and its political and economic reforms, Mongolian President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat said here Monday.
The two countries also promised to continue humanitarian aid to Mongolia and expressed appreciation of and backing for its self-declared nuclear-free status, Ochirbat said in an interview with the newspaper People's Right.
Mongolia's reforms, aimed at transforming its centrally-planned economy into a market-oriented one, have won support from France and Britain since they were launched in 1990, said Ochirbat, shortly after his return from his first visit to the two countries.
France promised to grant Mongolia 10 million francs (about 2 million U.S. dollars) in aid to establish a geographical remote control research center, and decided to reopen its embassy in Ulan Bator as quickly as possible, Ochirbat said.
The two European countries also agreed to strengthen their relations with Mongolia and increase economic and trade contacts, he added.
ULAN BATOR, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia and Demark will further develop economic and trade cooperation, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Petersen said here today.

The Danish foreign minister told Mongolian Prime Minister Mensaihani Enhsaihan that his country would urge the European Union and some other world organizations to give more aid to Mongolia.
Demark, which established diplomatic relations with Mongolia in August 1968, began to play an active role in helping this Asian country in 1991.
It has decided to provide a grant of 27 million U.S. dollars to Mongolia between 1991-1997.
In addition, Demark has also offered some 2.8 million dollars of aid to Mongolia through the United Nations Education, Science and Cultural Organization for the implementation of the Education Program for Women in Gobi Desert.

Support and economic assistance from Germany is very important to Mongolia, Bagabandy told reporters after the meeting.
Herzog said that Germany, which supports Mongolia in developing market economy, will promote relations with this Asian country.
On Monday, the two countries signed six documents, including an agreement on 1998-1999 financial cooperation under which Germany will provide 25 million marks in aid.

WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Chicago is the United States' 1998 murder capital, despite experiencing a 10-year low in murders, according to preliminary data from cities nationwide.
Chicago had 698 homicides in 1998, surpassing New York City's homicide totals for the first time ever.
New York has seen a dramatic drop in its homicides.
There were 629 there last year, compared with a 1990 high of 2,262.
When looked at per capita, Chicago's 1998 homicide rate is more than double that of New York.
"One murder is too many, but we are always pleased when the numbers go down," Chicago police spokesman Pat Camden said.
He credited the city's community policing program for much of the decline.
But once the final numbers are in, Chicago is expected to again have the highest violent crime rate of the eight largest U.S. cities, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.
Although the city's violent crime rate has dropped consistently in the last decade (it dropped 20 percent overall between 1990 and 1997), it still lags behind the other largest cities.
In that same period, New York City cut its violent crime rate 47 percent.
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S.
President Bill Clinton ordered his government Saturday to develop a plan for closer federal-state cooperation to increase prosecution of criminals who use firearms and to take other steps aimed at reducing gun violence.
In his weekly radio address, Clinton claimed the country's crime rate has dropped by more than 20 percent since 1993, and the rate of murders by firearms has fallen by 33 percent.
But he said that far too many people still are killed by guns.
In 1997, 14,000 people were killed by guns.
"Guns have magnified the malevolence of crime," Clinton said, adding that disarming criminals should be the top priority.
Clinton put Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin and Attorney General Janet Reno in charge of developing a strategy against gun violence.
He singled out Project Exile, headed by the U.S. attorney in Richmond in cooperation with state, local and other federal officials.
Clinton said hundreds of firearms have been seized and hundreds of criminals who used firearms convicted.
The key to the project, he said, is using existing federal laws as the backbone of the enforcement effort.
Clinton repeated what his budget for the next fiscal year is proposing to help cut firearm-related crime, including 5 million U.S. dollars for dozens of new federal prosecutors and 23.8 million dollars for more than 120 new agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
Arrests by the New Jersey State Police were down 42 percent in September from the same period last year, and the head of the state troopers' union said Wednesday that he attributed the decline to low morale and troopers' fear of being accused of racial profiling.
The statistics, which are published monthly, show a continuing trend of fewer arrests since February, when Col.
Carl A.
Williams, superintendent of the State Police, was forced to resign by Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman.
Williams had said in a newspaper interview at the time that certain racial and ethnic groups dominate segments of the illegal drug trade.
In the month after the resignation, the number of arrests also fell 42 percent; they had been up slightly the month before.
Troopers made 1,042 arrests last month, 754 fewer than the 1,796 made in September 1998, according to figures released Tuesday.
The number of traffic summonses issued was also down, by about 10 percent, to 32,567 last month from 36,074 a year ago.
Trooper Edward Lennon, president of the State Troopers Fraternal Organization, said the decline _ the largest since March _ reflected troopers' poor morale and fears of being accused of singling out minority drivers.
It was on Sept.
7, Lennon said, that Troopers John Hogan, 29, and James Kenna, 28, were indicted on charges of attempted murder and assault in the April 1998 shooting of three unarmed men, two of them black and one Hispanic, on the New Jersey Turnpike.
The incident led to widespread public criticism as well as state and federal investigations of the force.
``I think troopers are less likely to take the step further that is required to initiate a patrol-related arrest,'' Lennon said.
``When they stop a car for speeding, they're issued a summons for speeding, and the driver's on his way''.
There are indicators, like a driver's nervousness, that might ordinarily prompt troopers to search a car, he said, but ``it could be that they are ignoring those indicators''.
John Hagerty, a spokesman for the State Police, would not comment on Lennon's assertions.
Hagerty said the decline could be linked to the reassignment of 40 troopers to flood relief duty last month or to a continuing decline in the overall crime rate.
``Let's not forget that in 1998 we recorded a 9 percent drop in crime, and the FBI is telling us we're looking at a similar decline in 1999,'' he said.
``With declining crime rates, you're going to have fewer arrests''.
Hagerty said troopers were also busier aiding drivers last month, with 15,127 reports of assistance, compared with 14,277 in September 1998.
The number of warnings issued fell slightly, to 15,418 from 15,684.
The State Police began publishing the monthly figures in April at the recommendation of Peter G.
Verniero, then the state attorney general, to increase accountability and public confidence in the force.
Hagerty said he could not say whether either goal had been achieved.
``State Police get letters, pro and con, on a daily basis,'' he said.
``Are we seeing a difference in the tone and nature of the letters?
Not necessarily.''
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Violent crimes fell 10 percent in 1996 in the United States, says an annual U.S.
Justice Department survey of victims released Saturday.
The overall victimization rates from all crimes were at their lowest level since the survey of victims began 23 years ago, the survey said, The 1996 violent crime rate against victims was down 16 percent from 1993.
Property crime was down 8 percent last year, and was 17 percent lower than 1993.
Other crimes against persons, including rape, attempted rape, other sexual assaults and aggravated assaults, also were down dramatically during the 1993-96 period.
Likewise, household burglary, motor vehicle theft, personal theft such as purse snatching fell 19 percent, 29 percent, 35 percent respectively.
There were an estimated 2.7 million "completed'' violent crimes in 1996, for a rate of 12.4 per 1,000 U.S. residents 12 years or older.
In contrast, there were 3 million in 1995, a rate of 13.8.
Property crimes and attempts dropped from 29.5 million, or 291 per 1000 households, to 27.4 million, or 266 per 1000 households.
The Bureau of Justice Statistics says the victims' survey is in general agreement with the FBI figures released last September.
WASHINGTON _ Six years after stepping down as New York City's police commissioner, Raymond W.
Kelly finds himself playing cop again _ this time as commissioner of the U.S.
Customs Service, with a mission that includes tracking down terrorists who might try to cross the borders in time for this week's millennium celebrations.
``It feels like I never really left the beat,'' said Kelly, who ran the New York City Police Department when terrorists bombed the World Trade Center in 1993, the last deadly attack by foreign terrorists on American soil.
In the last few weeks, the Customs Service seems to have proved that the potential millennium threat is real.
On Dec.
14, customs inspectors arrested an Algerian man, Ahmed Ressam, as he crossed from Canada into Washington state.
Prosecutors said his car was packed with a nitroglycerine-like chemical and other bomb-making components; he had a reservation at a motel in Seattle near the Space Needle.
Seattle officials later canceled the public celebration there because of security concerns.
And five days after Ressam's arrest, customs agents in Vermont detained two people who have since been tied by prosecutors to Algerian militant groups.
Kelly speaks somberly of what the arrests might suggest.
``We've got to be concerned,'' he said, his stocky, compact frame and thick New York accent bringing Jimmy Cagney to mind.
``I think you've got to be realistic.
You can't sugarcoat''.
Kelly knows what terrorists bent on slaughter can do.
He recalled rushing to the World Trade Center on Feb.
26, 1993, when a bomb unleashed a fireball, killing six people and leaving a seven-story crater where a parking garage had been.
``The thing I remember most vividly,'' he said, ``was looking down and seeing this hole, this huge hole''.
But every so often, the solemnity in Kelly's voice gives way to his obvious excitement at how the Customs Service, among the least glamorous of law enforcement agencies, has found itself on the front lines of the war against terrorism.
``Yes, absolutely, I feel energized, invigorated,'' he said.
He is convinced that the professionalism of his agents in Washington state prevented a terrorist attack.
``There's no question about it.
They're heroes''.
The arrest prompted President Clinton to announce a heightened state of alert for federal law enforcement agencies.
In the last two weeks, Kelly has added 500 inspectors to border stations.
``Will there be more searches?
Yes,'' he said.
``Will there be more interviews with people?
Yes. Are there going to be some delays?
Yes''. This whirlwind of excitement is a reminder of why he told Clinton last year that he wanted to run the Customs Service.
It was technically a demotion from his last job, as the Treasury Department's undersecretary for enforcement, a post in which he supervised not only the Customs Service but also the Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
``It was a step down, but it was an inside-the-beltway step down,'' he said.
``Undersecretary was a policy job, and that's fine, and I enjoyed it.
But this is more fun.
This is a law enforcement organization.
I feel more comfortable here.
I'm much more comfortable here''.
There were worries earlier this year that Kelly might have to cut short his tenure.
In June, he had a heart bypass operation.
``This was a shock to me,'' said Kelly, a 58-year-old Marine Corps veteran who always prided himself on staying in shape.
He was back at work within days of the surgery and has resumed his daily visits to the gym in his condominium complex, spending 40 minutes on a treadmill before hitting the weights.
As New York's police commissioner, Kelly had a resume drawn up by central casting.
The youngest of five children, he was raised in a building at Columbus Avenue and 91st Street in Manhattan _ ``It's now a McDonald's,'' he says with a sigh _ before moving to Queens as a teen-ager.
His father, a milkman, later worked for the Internal Revenue Service.
His one sister worked in the fashion industry before retiring.
Like his three brothers, Kelly joined the Marines.
He returned to civilian life after fighting in Vietnam.
While working in the stockroom in the baby clothes department at Macy's, Kelly saw a recruiting ad for the police.
He registered at the Police Academy, graduating first in a class of 1,800.
His tenure as police commissioner was brief _ only 18 months _ but Kelly was praised for his performance, both for the overall decline in the crime rate and for his sensitivity to racial concerns.
Jimmy Breslin, the newspaper columnist, described him as ``a city treasure''.
Kelly said he had long wondered what else he might have accomplished had Mayor Rudolph Giuliani not decided, shortly after his election in November 1993, to find a new commissioner.
``Giuliani had the absolute right to pick his own police commissioner,'' he said.
``But crime was down every day on my watch''.
He still sees plenty of New York, where his wife, who sells medical equipment, lives in their apartment in Battery Park City in Lower Manhattan.
``We have a commuting deal, and she'll come down to Washington virtually every weekend if I don't go up,'' he said.
He is always glad to go up.
``I'm a New Yorker,'' he said.
``That's my home.''
FORT WORTH, Texas _ By the end of September, the warnings will be up on billboards all over this Texas city: ``Gun Crime Means Hard Time''.
In Richmond, Va, the signs carry this message: ``An Illegal Gun Gets You Five Years in Federal Prison''.
In Rochester, N.Y., you might read a similar warning on the side of a city bus: ``You (plus) illegal gun (equals) federal prison''.
Behind the tough messages is a new approach to curbing gun violence that is being adopted by cities around the country, where officials are eager to duplicate the apparent success of Richmond's 2-year-old ``Project Exile''.
Criminals who ignore the advertised warnings and tote guns face tough, specialized federal prosecution instead of getting lost in the overwhelmed state courts.
In each city, they're selling a promise that if you're caught carrying a weapon in the commission of a crime, the local authorities will turn you over to the feds, who will use existing law to seek out the longest sentence applicable for your offense.
A convicted felon caught with a gun or anyone caught carrying a gun while trafficking in drugs will usually draw at least five years in a federal penitentiary.
In the federal system, repeat offenders get more time, federal prisoners serve about 80 percent of their sentences and there is no parole.
``There's been a sea change in the criminal community,'' says James B.Comey, criminal division chief in Richmond's U.S. attorney's office.
``The bad guys say exactly the same thing: `Hey man, nobody's carrying any more.
That thing will get you five years'''.
Richmond had the second-highest murder rate in the country in 1997, the year they mounted Project Exile.
They ended the year with 140 homicides, but by the end of 1998 that number had dropped to 94.
The city has recorded only 47 homicides through the first eight months of this year, as compared to 67 for the same time period last year.
``I tell you what it's done,'' Comey said.
``Richmond was a demoralized city, not just in the folks who live here but in the police department.
``Exile gets more credit than it deserves some times, but it's fired up the cops and fired up the citizens,'' Comey said.
``We are doing something.
We are becoming a zero-tolerance city for guns''.
Because the program doesn't require new gun laws, and is not gun control in the traditional sense, even the National Rifle Association is supporting Project Exile.
That makes it a rare animal _ a gun program that President Clinton, Sarah Brady and the NRA can agree on.
``I wish (the Clinton administration) backed this more than the lip service they've given it,'' said NRA spokesman Bill Powers.
``Call it whatever you want, but whatever effort goes after armed violent felons on the streets of American cities is something the NRA backs heartily''.
Civic leaders are desperate to reduce gun violence in their communities.
Even though the murder rate has fallen dramatically in most major cities in recent years, traveling to Richmond to study Project Exile is becoming a civic leader's pilgrimage to Mecca.
``There really isn't any rocket science to doing a lot of gun cases,'' says Comey.
``The genius to Exile is the advertising, because what that has done is sell fear to the potential defendants in ways we never imagined.
``It really almost creates a myth in Richmond,'' Comey said.
``The advertising people said, `Look, we manipulate culture'.
They said, `Give us a chance to sell fear'''.
Word of mouth has been important, too, Comey said.
``Bug Smith was a legendary shooter in Richmond.
We popped him with a single gun and he got 16 1/2 years in the fed.
When the word got out that Bug Smith got 16 1/2 years on a gun, the reaction was just phenomenal''.
Comey quickly agrees there are other factors at play in Richmond that may have affected the murder rate.
For instance, Virginia abolished parole in 1994, which means the first wave of criminals put away since then are probably not yet back on the streets.
And the drug trade in his city has shifted away from crack cocaine to heroin, which produces less volatile behavior, Comey said.
But all the decreases in homicides in Richmond have been in the category of murders by firearm.
And there's been a nearly identical drop in armed robberies.
``Those two clues tell me something has happened in the firearm world of bad guys in Richmond,'' Comey said.
But the approach has its critics.
Three U.S.
District judges have lambasted Project Exile for crossing the line ``into a sovereign state's area of authority and responsibility''.
Federal prosecution also costs considerably more than state prosecution of similar cases.
And in Richmond, criminal attorney David Baugh charges that Project Exile violates the civil rights of Richmond's black residents by sending them in front of federal juries drawn from a larger, predominantly white pool.
Federal officials point out, however, that most Project Exile offenders will never see a jury, opting to plea bargain.
The 10th Amendment to the constitution was written to make sure the federal government did not intrude upon those responsibilities held by the states, Baugh said, ``And now we have every case, and it's momma being handled by the feds.
The federal courts are overcrowded anyway _ judges who are supposed to be handling the most delicate cases are now doing the equivalent of traffic cases''.
Fort Worth's ``Operation Safe City'' will work much like Richmond's program, as a cooperative approach among the local police department, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the U.S. attorney's office.
On a recent afternoon, ATF agent Mike Russell delivered his pitch for the program to more than 100 of Fort Worth's Neighborhood Police Officers.
He made it clear that the gun cases will be prosecuted strictly off the arrest reports filed by the local police.
``The success of this program is directly proportional to getting these guys prosecuted in the federal system,'' Russell said.
``It's a gimme, folks.
The U.S. attorney doesn't want cases where we have to come back and interview people.
These cases will be made strictly off the reports you file''.
Their best chance for making a gun case stick is at the point of executing the search warrant, he said, advising them to write down as much detail as possible about where the gun was found and any comments the suspect makes about the gun.
``They may not tell you about the dope,'' Russell said.
But the gun?
``You're not the gun police, we are,'' Russell said.
``You talk to them then and they'll probably tell you anything you want to know''.
Several Fort Worth officers immediately began asking questions about using the program to get people off the streets who are problems in their neighborhoods.
When Russell got back to his office, he had a handful of telephone messages from officers who had specific cases they wanted to pass on for federal prosecution.
Russell has been operating something of a one-man ``Safe City U.S.A''. program for the past 18 months, wading through Fort Worth Police Department offense reports and pursuing those gun cases he thought he could make stick.
Russell picked up one gun case from an offense report on a man arrested for multiple traffic warrants.
A patrol officer spotted a motorcycle parked between two houses in a residential neighborhood late at night, and saw a shortened, pistol-grip shotgun strapped to the bike.
The officer ran the motorcycle's license tag number, and discovered the outstanding traffic warrants.
The officer arrested Nicholas Alexander Martin when he returned to the bike a few minutes later, dressed in black, a bandolier of shotgun shells strapped to his chest.
He was also carrying a flashlight, four feet of telephone cord, a four-inch lock-blade knife and white surgical gloves.
There was a ski mask in his pocket.
``We picked up the (gun) case, and he turned out to be a multiconvicted felon in possession of a firearm,'' Russell said.
Martin got 17 1/2 years in the federal penitentiary.
David Montague, a spokesman in the Tarrant County District Attorney's office, said Martin probably would have been allowed to plead guilty to 10 years or less had the case stayed in the state system.
And with good time and parole, he would serve even less.
``The reality is that in the state courts, we have so many murders, armed robberies, child abusers and sex offenders that it's unlikely he would have the maximum,'' Montague said.
When the Safe City program formally kicks off at the end of the month, Russell will be aided by six other ATF agents in researching gun cases for prosecution.
``When this thing gets rolling, we're talking about volume,'' he said.
Volume has been a problem in Richmond, where federal prosecutors saw their felony caseload jump from about 139 in 1996 to 404 in 1998 as a result of Project Exile.
The Justice Department is requesting an additional $5 million from Congress to fund about 45 to 50 prosecutors to help with the increased gun enforcement through a variety of programs.
The NRA is lobbying Congress for $50 million to implement Project Exile or something like it in every major city.
In Fort Worth, the public relations campaign designed to make criminals leave their guns at home is being financed by local businessmen Perry and Lee Bass.
Fort Worth is not reeling under its homicide rate.
In 1991, considered the city's worst year for violent crime, there were 195 homicides.
But by 1998 there were only 64, and Fort Worth's violent crime rate dropped more in the past two years than Richmond's under Project Exile.
``What better time than when life is good''? said Fort Worth assistant U.S.
Attorney Terry Moore.
``I came to the U.S. attorney's office from the district attorney's office.
I was the gang queen.
I didn't try anything but murders and capital murders.
It was all guns.
``I'm excited about bearing down on criminals with guns because I don't want to go back to those days,'' Moore said.
``If I can take a gun away from one criminal and one person doesn't get shot or killed, man, I feel great!
How do you measure that''?
&QL; XXXX END OF STORY &QL;
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The crime rate in the United States declined in 1998 for the seventh straight year, with the murder and robbery rates being the lowest in three decades, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported Sunday.
The overall violent crime rate -- 566 murders, rapes, robberies and assaults per 100,000 residents -- dropped to its lowest level since 1985, according to the report.
The national total of seven serious violent and property crimes reported to police around the country was about 12 million in 1998, down 5.4 percent from the previous year and 12 percent from 1989, the FBI said.
A total of 16,914 murders were reported last year -- one murder every 31 minutes, but it still was the lowest murder rate -- six slayings for every 100,000 people -- since 1967.
Attorney General Janet Reno attributed the decline of crime rate to "more police officers on the street, greater partnerships between law enforcement agencies, continued efforts to keep guns away from criminals, and a balanced approach that includes prevention, intervention, punishment and supervision".
"This is good news for America's families, and it shows we can indeed turn the tide on crime," President Bill Clinton said in a statement.
But he cautioned that "even as crime falls, we must not let down our guard.
That is why we must redouble our efforts to build on what works".
The report also said firearms were used in 64.9 percent of murders.
Handguns were the type of firearms most often reported used in the killings.
NEW YORK _ It was a slow news day in the depths of summer.
Thirteen Ohio factory workers had won a $296 million lottery.
The Hamptons were gearing up for a visit by the Clintons.
WCBS-TV, Channel 2 in New York City, chose a different story to lead its 6 p.m. newscast on July 30: Seven women had been harassed over the previous two months on a jogging path in Westchester County.
Once, a man fondled himself as a woman passed by.
Several other times, someone tried without success to grab one of the women, the station reported.
Since no one had been hurt or arrested (police were not even sure if they had one or several suspects), the incidents might seem an odd choice as the top news in the nation's largest city.
In the early 1990s, when the New York crime rate was much higher, the report would have been unlikely to make the broadcast, much less lead it.
The selection reflects some of the significant changes on New York's television news broadcasts and in its newspapers as the city's crime rate has dropped for the last half-dozen years.
The crime stories reported by the local news organizations these days are noticeably different, having a greater emphasis on sexual attacks and child abuse.
There are more reports on crimes in the suburbs and the outer reaches of the region, as well as stepped-up coverage of the inner workings of the Police Department itself, including police misconduct.
But it is in the sheer numbers of reports about crime _ particularly in New York City's three major daily newspapers _ where change is most pronounced.
In the first two weeks of May 1994, for example, there were 120 articles on crimes in the city in The New York Daily News, The New York Post and The New York Times.
In the first two weeks of May this year, there were only a third as many articles about crime in the three newspapers: 44 altogether, including several on crimes in the suburbs.
On many days in May, there was no crime news at all in The Daily News or The Post, where once it was a staple.
On local television news, which has been criticized for years for its daily diet of murder and mayhem, there appears to be a reduction as well, though much more modest.
It is impossible to quantify, because news directors at New York's major network-owned stations refused to make available videotapes or written records of old broadcasts.
There is no rigorous independent survey that analyzed the contents of local news four or more years ago.
But many current and former television news executives say that for many years at least 30 percent to 40 percent of the reports on local newscasts were about crime.
The New York Times analyzed 20 news broadcasts on the three network-owned stations with the largest audiences _WCBS-TV, WNBC-TV and WABC-TV _ over four weeks this summer, and crime was the subject of 27 percent of the reports.
On some evenings, reports about crime represented a majority of the reports on local news shows, and many minutes of air time at the start of the broadcasts were devoted to them.
But on other nights, crime news was relatively brief and came late in the shows.
These changes are largely a consequence of the remarkable decline of violent crime in New York, where the number of killings has diminished from 2,245 in 1990 to 767 last year.
At the current rate, there would be fewer than 600 this year, the lowest total in three decades.
Alterations in news coverage also reflect deliberate decisions, especially by people who manage local television news operations, to adjust somewhat the tone and content of their daily reports.
``There is a positive feeling overall, and I think reporters and editors come into the workplace feeling that, because we all live in the same community,'' said WCBS-TV news director Bill Carey.
``We look for stories that are relevant to the life that we live''.
Many reporters and editors say the changes are also the result of police department policies that make it more difficult to get information on crime and access to police officials.
Six or seven years ago, when there were nearly six killings a day in New York City, on average, the basic question for crime reporters was which of the grisly homicides to cover.
There was seldom time to report on other kinds of crime or on the Police Department as an institution.
Crime news often crowded out other subjects on television.
``Today, there is less and less crime that is worthy of any coverage,'' said Bart Feder, news director at Channel 7, WABC-TV.
``This is an opportunity to fill the shows in a more interesting and diverse way.
I think there is more commitment at all the stations to enterprise reporting, to investigative reporting, to honest-to-goodness journalism''.
Feder's counterparts at other New York City stations offer the same assessment, and on some nights there is evidence to buttress their view.
But careful viewing of the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. news shows also offered considerable evidence to the contrary.
Some nights, local stations compensate for the murder gap by covering crimes committed in other places and by reporting on local crimes that, not long ago, would have passed unnoticed.
A few weeks ago, for example, Channel 7 sent a reporter to Westchester for a long piece on the expanded use of unmarked police cars on highways to counter road rage.
Local stations also reported in recent weeks on the arrest of a man in Freehold, N.J., accused of stabbing his wife, a sexual assault on an employee of a Bronx motel and a double homicide in Bayonne, N.J.
But there were also recent examples of more ambitious journalism on local stations, reports on serious subjects that might have had difficulty getting on the air when television news was overwhelmed by body bags.
On Aug.
28, Channel 4 broadcast a long report on how the stock market's slide might affect New York City's budget.
The previous week, a Channel 4 reporter assessed the accuracy of campaign advertisements by Democratic candidates for governor and the U.S.
Senate. nn Many journalism professors and critics contend there is still too much crime on local television.
``There's no question that it is still the predominant item,'' said David Klatell, head of the broadcast program at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism.
``Television news has always been a much more emotive and emotional medium than a logical one, and so the fear of crime persists even if the reality doesn't.
It's much easier to cover crime than to cover the school system or race relations''.
Klatell worked with a group of academic researchers who began to study the content of local television news two years ago.
They analyzed broadcasts in eight cities on four nights during the 1996-1997 television season.
The survey showed that 27.2 percent of the air time on New York City newscasts was devoted to crime, well above the eight-city average of 20.2 percent.
A similar analysis of the television season that ended last spring is not finished.
Some former broadcast executives credit NY1 News, the all-news cable station, with influencing coverage on the larger network-owned stations.
Since it started in 1992, NY1 has tried to balance crime news with beat reporting on everything from government and schools to the subway and neighborhoods.
Steve Paulus, the senior vice president for news at NY1, said that his station was devoting less time to crime these days.
``Where a police reporter would have covered the crime of the day,'' he said, ``the police reporter is now more likely to be covering police department issues''.
Paradoxically, the reduced crime rate may sometimes cause journalists to react more strongly to major crimes.
The decline in crime means that ``those that do occur take on a prominence, seem more newsworthy than they did in the past,'' said Daily News managing editor Arthur Browne.
``There is an added shock value now when they happen''.
Many reporters who regularly cover the police say that another factor in the decline of crime news is that the police share information less readily and are generally less cooperative.
Some police reporters said that they could usually get enough information to report breaking crime news, but that it was often difficult if not impossible to learn enough for analytic or other enterprise articles.
``This administration has made a concerted drive to keep bad news out of the papers and off the screen,'' said Gabe Pressman, the veteran television reporter who is president of the New York Press Club.
Whether it is by design or by chance, the decrease of crime news in the city's papers is startling.
On May 4, for example, there was a single crime article in The Daily News, buried deep on page 24: a 13-year-old Long Island boy had been shot in the shoulder by a stray bullet, possibly from a nearby shooting range.
The Times, in its local pages, had one reference to crime: a few sentences on a sexual abuse case in Syracuse.
The following day, there were no reports on crime in The News, The Times or The Post.
&QL; On May 6, there was one article in The Post, on page 7, about the arrest of a substitute teacher in Queens accused of hitting students with a chair.
The News put the same story on page 8, next to an article about an investigation into whether police officers had covered up for an off-duty detective involved in a car crash.
The Times carried an article on the substitute teacher on page B1.
That week, and the following one, the front pages of New York's tabloids _ where crime once was king _ were taken up with the Knicks' playoff chances, new cancer drugs and the final episode of ``Seinfeld''.
``There are really two possible explanations for this,'' said Mitchell Stephens, acting chairman of the journalism department at New York University.
``One is that the reality has changed and news reflects reality.
I tend to doubt that.
The other is that competitive organizational pressures in the news business are responsible for the waxing and waning of crime coverage''.
Stephens, who has a new book on video and television called ``The Rise of the Image the Fall of the Word,'' said the arrival of New York Newsday in the 1980s led to a brutal circulation war in the city.
In time-honored American fashion, he said, newspapers sought circulation by concentrating on crime.
The death of New York Newsday eased the circulation wars, he said, reducing pressure on editors to pursue crime.
Stephens also offered a second theory for the diminished attention to crime by the New York news organizations.
``Maybe people are feeling less paranoid,'' he said, ``and it is harder to push those buttons''.

WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- At a time when the opening of the 1996 summer Olympic Games is drawing, the host city, Atlant, was rated as the most violent city in the United States by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) statistics.
The FBI figures revealed Sunday show that while crime nationwide fell 2 percent in 1995, crime in Atlanta rose 4 percent in the year.
The figures make Atlanta's crime rate the highest among U.S. cities of 250,000 or more people.
It topped the rankings in both violent and non-violent crime.
However, officials from the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) said, "This is not representative of a lack of preparation for the Olympic Games".
"If people who come here will follow instructions, I think they'll be in the most secure place on Earth," said A.D.
Frazier, chief operating officer of the ACOG.
ACOG has mounted a massive security operation to protect the Games, with more than 25,000 federal, state and local law enforcement officers and military personnel.
They will be assisted by thousands of agents from the FBI, CIA and other secret services.
In preparation for the worst, security forces held a series of anti-terrorism exercises in the city last month, and law enforcement officers uncovered a underground bomb factory in central Georgia and arrested two men.
Reports said that ACOG security officials have travelled to foreign countries to get advice on anti-terrorist tactics.
If the state of Georgia electrocutes Alexander Williams on Thursday, as planned, five men who committed murder when they were 17 will have been put to death this year in the United States.
That is more than in any year since 1954, when six teen-agers were executed in Florida and Georgia.
Williams, now 32, is one of 80 condemned youthful offenders _ those who were under 18 at the time of their crimes _ and while they make up only a small percentage of the overall death-row population, more are awaiting execution than at any time since the ban on capital punishment was lifted in 1976.
The practice of condemning teen-agers reflects the complexity of attitudes about capital punishment in the United States.
While 23 of the 38 states that have the death penalty permit the execution of youthful offenders, only a handful have actually carried out such executions since the death penalty was reinstated.
Half of all condemned youthful offenders are in Texas and Alabama.
In South Carolina, where four juvenile offenders are on death row, Wayne Bailey, a district attorney, expressed a view popular among supporters of the death penalty for those who committed capital crimes when they were younger than 18.
``If you do an adult crime,'' Bailey said, ``the jury ought to have the option to come back with the death penalty''.
But even many prosecutors who support the death penalty, as well as national organizations that are neutral on the issue, are expressing concern about sentencing to death those who were, according to most laws, still children when they committed their crimes.
The United States is one of only seven countries in the world that permit such executions, according to the State Department.
Language prohibiting the practice is included in several international human rights treaties, including the U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child, which only the United States and Somalia have not yet ratified.
``It offends my conscience to execute someone who was under 18 at the time of the crime,'' said District Attorney Joshua Marquis, of Astoria, Ore.
, a member of the board of the National Association of District Attorneys, who otherwise supports the death penalty.
The U.S.
Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty for 16- and 17-year-olds by one vote in 1989.
The previous year the court ruled that executing those under 16 was cruel and unusual punishment, but legal experts are split on whether that constitutes a ban on such executions.
No one younger than 16 at the time of the crime has been executed, and only one person who was 16 at the time of the crime has been executed.
Of the 23 states that permit the execution of juvenile offenders, only seven have carried out such executions since 1976: Texas, Virginia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Missouri, Georgia and Oklahoma.
Experts say that it is little surprise that most are Southern states, since the South has the highest incarceration rate and the highest execution rate in general.
This year, Virginia and Texas each executed two men who committed their crimes when they were under 18.
Federal law prohibits the execution of juvenile offenders charged with federal crimes, and when New York reinstated the death penalty in 1995, it specifically excluded juvenile offenders.
Kansas took the same step when it reinstated the death penalty in 1994.
Montana outlawed the death penalty for its juvenile offenders last year.
Maryland raised the age for capital punishment to 18 in the late 1980s, and the state of Washington did so in 1993.
The American Bar Association and the Children's Defense Fund oppose death sentences for juvenile offenders.
In South Carolina, several former prosecutors formed a group to protect juvenile offenders last year when they learned their state has four on death row.
``Considering all the ways the government failed our children _ from crack babies to horrible public schools to miserable health care, we can at least ask the government not to willfully kill them,'' said Zoe Sanders Nettles, a former prosecutor who helped found the group, South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Execution of Children.
In many ways Alexander Williams is the typical condemned youthful offender: Southern, black, poor, male and his victim was white and female.
The six teen-agers who were executed in 1954 were all black and their crimes involved either the murder of white men or the rape of white girls.
They were all between the ages of 17 and 19 when they were electrocuted.
Williams' lawyers have asked the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles to commute Williams' sentence to life imprisonment and are planning a last-minute appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
nn (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) The American Bar Association and the Children's Defense Fund have condemned the sentencing to death of juvenile offenders and have written letters to the pardons board on Williams's behalf.
Rosalynn Carter, the former first lady, has also written, asking that Williams' sentence be commuted to life imprisonment.
Carter wrote: ``As a society we traditionally have given special consideration to children who commit crimes because we recognize that they lack the maturity or the mental capacity to function as adults''.
Williams' cause has also been taken up by the European Union, a measure of the repugnance other Western countries have for the execution of juvenile offenders.
A representative of the union met with the Georgia pardons board Monday to present an ``urgent humanitarian appeal'' for the sentence to be commuted to life imprisonment, a European Union official said.
While it is impossible to document with certainty the extent of the death penalty for juvenile offenders internationally, the U.S.
State Department, the U.N.
High Commission on Human Rights and Amnesty International, a human rights advocacy group, report that the only countries other than the United States to have carried out such executions in the last 10 years are Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Congo.
The United States has executed 14 juvenile offenders in that time, more than the other countries combined, according to Amnesty International.
China, which executes more people than any other country in the world, formally banned the execution of juvenile offenders in 1997.
Other countries that allow the death penalty but prohibit it for juvenile offenders include Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Libya.
Besides the prohibition in the U.N. treaty, the execution of juvenile offenders is also banned under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights.
The U.S.
Senate voted to ratify that in 1992, but specifically reserved the right to execute juvenile offenders.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) The United States is continuing a practice that dates to 1647, when 16-year-old Thomas Graunger was reportedly hanged in Plymouth Colony for bestiality involving a cow and a horse, said Victor Streib, a leading expert on juveniles and the death penalty, and the dean of the law school at Ohio Northern University.
Streib and other experts on adolescence and criminal justice say that juvenile inmates facing execution may be viewed as an extreme expression of Americans' fears of violence, and the attitudes among politicians and law enforcement officials who want to be seen as tough on crime.
The experts say that executing juvenile offenders in more recent years reflects the trend toward treating juvenile offenders as adults, with their crimes judged as more significant than their youth as a mitigating factor.
Execution of juvenile offenders increased with the escalation of juvenile violent crime in the mid-1990s and has continued even as that crime rate has been declining in the last few years.
Some experts contend there is growing scientific evidence that the brain is still developing through adolescence, and that with proper intervention, violent juvenile offenders can be rehabilitated.
``The empirical and moral question here is, at what age can we be so sure of a person's inability to change in the context of an attempt by society to change that person that we would sentence that person to death''? said Laurence Steinberg, a psychology professor at Temple University and the director of the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Adolescent Development and Juvenile Justice.
``I don't think that 16 or 17 seems like a very reasonable answer to that''.
Law enforcement officials and politicians who favor the treatment of teen-age offenders as adults say the traditional juvenile justice system was not set up to handle the numbers of teen-agers who now have access to guns, and who commit the types of crimes that are punished with the death penalty.
Alexander Williams was 17 in 1986 when he abducted 16-year-old Aleta Bunch from a shopping mall in Augusta, Ga.
, then raped and fatally shot her.
Aleta's mother, Carolyn Bunch, said of her daughter's killer in a recent interview, ``I don't care how old he was.
He was old enough to know better.
I could pull the switch on him and never have any remorse.
He shot her three times in the forehead.
He shot her eye out.
He shot her in the heart''.
Daniel Craig, the district attorney in Augusta, said in an interview that he opposes clemency for Williams because the jury had ``determined that the appropriate response of a civilized society is the death penalty''.
Under Georgia law, at 17 Williams was automatically charged as an adult, but it was the prosecutor's decision to seek the death penalty.
Williams is described in prison records as mentally ill: records indicate he is bipolar and has schizoaffective disorder, which reportedly leads him to worship the actress Sigourney Weaver as god and to dress as the Lone Ranger.
As a juvenile, he was charged with several offenses, including reckless conduct for holding a knife to a 13-year-old classmate's throat.
Williams' sister, Alexsandriya Clemons, and half-brother, Rodney Blair, have both sworn affidavits describing the abuse their mother meted out to all of them as children.
In an interview in Jackson, Ga.
, last month, where they were visiting their brother on death row, they said their mother had beaten them frequently with electrical cords, frying pans, belts, barbells and a vacuum cleaner.
Their brother Alexander, they said, bore the brunt of the worst abuse.
``One time she was hitting his toes with a screwdriver and a hammer,'' Clemons said.
They said their mother, Pat Blair, held down three jobs while supporting five children.
She declined to be interviewed for this article.
At the trial, Alexander Williams' lawyer, O.L.
Collins, who has since died, did not present any of the details of his client's childhood.
Last week, four jurors, and a fifth this week, swore affidavits stating that had they known about Williams' childhood abuse, and his mental illness, they would not have voted to sentence him to death.
It is for that reason they, too, are asking Georgia's pardons board to grant Williams clemency.

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn Streib and other experts who have studied the youthful offenders on death row say that they often grew up in fractured families marked by drugs, alcohol, violence and mental illness.
As children the offenders had to figure out ``how not to get beaten to a pulp or sexually abused by one of the so-called adults who'd been placed in charge of them,'' said Craig Haney, a professor of psychology at the University of California at Santa Cruz, who has compiled the social histories of many juvenile offenders on death row for defense lawyers.
That kind of early abuse can lead to aggression and violence, Haney and other experts contend.
Haney and other experts also say that the stereotypical image of teen-age killers as superpredators who cannot be redeemed is not borne out by scientific evidence.
``Even people who are cynical about the rehabilitation of adults recognize that juveniles are different,'' Haney said.
``It's the notion that human nature is unfolding.
It's not until later in someone's life that you're willing to throw up your hands and say there is nothing more we can do now''.
But many law enforcement officials view these offenders differently.
``Gary Hart is not a kid,'' the prosecutor said during the trial of Gary Davis Hart II, who was 16 when he fatally shot a restaurant manager in Mobile, Ala.
, in 1989.
``Gary Hart is a predator''.
Gary Hart, who is on Alabama's death row, testified at trial that an older man had given him and a friend instructions on how to rob the restaurant.
The shooting, he said, had been an accident.
Once he had cocked the gun, he did not know how to uncock it, he said.
He said he had taken the gun from the trunk of his mother's car.
Christopher Simmons, who is on death row in Missouri, was 4 when his stepfather began taking him to bars and pouring him drinks, defense psychologists say.
His stepfather would tie young Christopher to a tree when he went fishing.
At 17, in the course of a burglary in 1983, Christopher and a 15-year-old friend bound and gagged a 46-year-old woman and pushed her into a river and she drowned.
The 15-year-old was given life without parole.
``Seventeen years old,'' the prosecutor said of Christopher at his trial.
``Doesn't that scare you?
Mitigating? Quite the contrary, I submit''.
The prosecutor suggested that Christopher's family would be better off if he were executed.
``Show some mercy to his family,'' he said.
``Give him death''.
Kevin Hughes had a mother who was a schizophrenic and an alcoholic, according to court records.
Left alone by their mother for weeks at a time, Kevin and his five siblings begged on the streets of Philadelphia for money and food, according to affidavits filed by several relatives.
The mother had a series of violent boyfriends, who beat and raped Kevin while his mother laughed, according to the affidavits.
``Kevin got really bad beatings and whippings because he could not understand things and was mentally slow,'' his oldest brother said in his affidavit.
Kevin Hughes, now 38, was 16 when he raped and strangled a 9-year-old girl, Rochelle Graham.
He has been on death row in Pennsylvania for 17 years.
If the state of Georgia electrocutes Alexander Williams on Thursday, as planned, five men who committed murder when they were 17 will have been put to death this year in the United States.
That is more than in any year since 1954, when six teen-agers were executed in Florida and Georgia.
Williams, now 32, is one of 80 condemned juvenile offenders _ those who were under 18 at the time of their crimes _ and while they make up only a small percentage of the overall death-row population, more are awaiting execution than at any time since the ban on capital punishment was lifted in 1976.
The practice of condemning teen-agers reflects the complexity of attitudes about capital punishment in the United States.
While 23 of the 38 states that have the death penalty permit the execution of youthful offenders, only a handful have actually carried out such executions since the death penalty was reinstated.
Half of all condemned youthful offenders are in Texas and Alabama.
In South Carolina, where four juvenile offenders are on death row, Wayne Bailey, a district attorney, expressed a view popular among supporters of the death penalty for those who committed capital crimes when they were younger than 18.
``If you do an adult crime,'' Bailey said, ``the jury ought to have the option to come back with the death penalty''.
But even many prosecutors who support the death penalty, as well as national organizations that are neutral on the issue, are expressing concern about sentencing to death those who were, according to most laws, still children when they committed their crimes.
The United States is one of only seven countries in the world that permit such executions, according to the State Department.
Language prohibiting the practice is included in several international human rights treaties, including the U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child, which only the United States and Somalia have not yet ratified.
The U.S.
Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty for 16- and 17-year-olds by one vote in a 1989 ruling.
The previous year the court ruled that executing those under 16 was cruel and unusual punishment, but legal experts are split on whether that constitutes a ban on such executions.
No one younger than 16 at the time of the crime has been executed, and only one person who was 16 at the time of the crime has been executed.
Of the 23 states that permit the execution of juvenile offenders, only seven have carried out such executions since 1976: Texas, Virginia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Missouri, Georgia and Oklahoma.
Federal law prohibits the execution of juvenile offenders charged with federal crimes, and when New York reinstated the death penalty in 1995, it specifically excluded juvenile offenders.
Kansas took the same step when it reinstated the death penalty in 1994.
Montana outlawed the death penalty for its juvenile offenders last year.
Maryland raised the age for capital punishment to 18 in the late 1980s, and the state of Washington did so in 1993.
In many ways Alexander Williams is the typical condemned juvenile offender: Southern, black, poor, male and his victim was white and female.
The six teen-agers who were executed in 1954 were all black and their crimes involved either the murder of white men or the rape of white girls.
They were all between the ages of 17 and 19 when they were electrocuted.
While it is impossible to document with certainty the extent of the death penalty for juvenile offenders internationally, the U.S.
State Department, the U.N.
High Commission on Human Rights and Amnesty International, a human rights advocacy group, report that the only countries other than the United States to have carried out such executions in the last 10 years are Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Congo.
The United States has executed 14 juvenile offenders in that time, more than the other countries combined, according to Amnesty International.
Other countries that allow the death penalty but prohibit it for juvenile offenders include Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Libya.
Besides the prohibition in the U.N. convention, the execution of juvenile offenders is also banned under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights.
The U.S.
Senate voted to ratify that in 1992, but specifically reserved the right to execute juvenile offenders.
The United States is continuing a practice that dates to 1647, said Victor Streib, a leading expert on juveniles and the death penalty, and the dean of the law school at Ohio Northern University.
Streib and other experts on adolescence and criminal justice say that juvenile inmates facing execution may be viewed as an extreme expression of Americans' fears of violence, and the attitudes among politicians and law enforcement officials who want to be seen as tough on crime.
The experts say that executing juvenile offenders in more recent years reflects the trend toward treating juvenile offenders as adults, with their crimes judged as more significant than their youth as a mitigating factor.
Execution of juvenile offenders increased with the escalation of juvenile violent crime in the mid-1990s and has continued even as that crime rate has been declining in the last few years.
Some experts contend there is growing scientific evidence that the brain is still developing through adolescence, and that with proper intervention, violent juvenile offenders can be rehabilitated.
Streib and other experts who have studied the youthful offenders on death row say that they often grew up in fractured families marked by drugs, alcohol, violence and mental illness.
But many law enforcement officials view these offenders differently.

LOS ANGELES, February 2 (Xinhua) -- California and the rest of the United States have reported continuing drop in crime rates, but it seems difficult for police as well as criminologists to explain why.
California state law enforcement authorities point to community policing and tougher sentences as the primary factors for the drop of crime.
But even law enforcement-oriented sources note that increase in police staffing levels and hard-line enforcement and prosecution policies fail to totally account for falling crime rates.
Perhaps there is not a single soundbite that has the answer.
Nationwide, the recent improvement in the economy, age-demographics, gang-war cycles, the waning interest in drugs like crack, and community policing are often used by experts to explain the decline.
Violent crime nationwide declined by five percent in the first six months of 1997, according to FBI statistics, and property crimes dropped by four percent.
Victimization survey by the U.S.
Department of Justice shows violent crime down nationwide by 10 percent and property crime down by eight percent.
Some types of criminal activity had dropped by as much as 44 percent in the past four years.
Many academics and law enforcement sources note that crime always seems to drop when employment rates are high.
A study of declining homicide rate in seven cities by the National Institute of Justice also found a potential connection between employment and crime.
But this hypothesis does not apply to some cities, where economic conditions have improved since 1992 but some crimes climbed steeply.
The country's aging population is also a common explanation for falling crime rates.
According to this hypothesis, the number of people between the ages of 18 and 40, an age group in which most potential offenders are to be found, has declined by more than seven percent since 1990.
Another possible cause for the crime rate cut is the decline in the nation's crack cocaine problem, which is associated with large increase in violence crime among young people in the 1980s.
Law enforcement advocates tend to credit the recent apparent decline in crime to a nationwide tougher sentencing laws and more aggressive policing strategies.
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, noting that crime had decreased steadily since 1994, one said that tougher sentences and hiring more local police officers are "one of the most important reason".
California's "three strikes," which dealing with repeated offenders with heavy prison terms, is often cited as an example for tougher sentencing laws.
Under the "three strikes, you'er out" law which was enacted in 1994, a person, who has two previous violent or serious felony convictions, must by sentenced to a term of 25 years to life in person for each new felony conviction, whether or not violent or serious, which must by served consecutively.
Critics of the law say that it has had a minimal impact on crime rates, but has tied up public resources on prison expansion and construction that could have been used on other governmental programs.
The National Institute of Justice, in a study of the national "three strike" movement, also says that it is still too early to tell whether California's tougher sentencing law is having any substantial impact on crime rates, although it has had a major effect on the state's prison capacity and criminal court caseloads.
"Three strikes" is not the only thing special in California.
Politicians and police through Southern California are pushing architects and developers to tailor their projects with subtle crime-fighting features such as better lighting, strategically placed thorny bougainvillea bushes and even pouring rose-colored concrete for walkways.
The system is known in government circles as "crime prevention through environmental design".
The idea is that troublemakers don't want to be seen and buildings should be designed so the owners can see them.
Now Los Angeles is in the forefront of promoting the system on a metropolitan scale.
WASHINGTON _ The rate of violent crime in the United States continued a downward trend in 1999, with the 10 percent drop last year representing one of the largest decreases in decades, the Justice Department said Sunday.
The latest figures, released by the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, show a continuation of declines in every major type of personal and property crime between 1993 and 1999.
During this period, the rate of violent crimes in general declined 32.7 percent, while robbery with injury dropped 38.5 percent, aggravated assault decreased 41.2 percent and rape fell 40 percent.
Results of the annual National Crime Victimization Survey, begun in 1972, show that property crime rates continue a 25-year downward trend.
Crime rates involving property, including burglary and motor vehicle theft, dropped 9 percent from 1998 to 1999, decreasing from 217 per 1,000 U.S. households to 198 per 1,000 households.
Americans were more secure in their homes from 1998 to 1999, with the number of completed burglaries dropping from 38.5 per 1,000 households to 34.1 per 1,000, an 11.4 percent fall.
``After a period of slow decline that was interrupted by an increase from 1980 to 1981, the burglary rate fell each year through the rest of the period,'' the Justice Department report said.
``The 1999 household burglary rate was about a third that of the adjusted rate of 1973''.
Law enforcement officials attribute the continued drop in crime rates to a healthy economy, crime prevention programs, tougher sentences and more police officers on the street.
As with earlier reports of similar declines, President Clinton called the figures ``further proof that the Clinton-Gore administration's anticrime strategy of more police on our streets and fewer guns in the wrong hands has helped to create the safest America in a generation''.
Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the Republican presidential candidate George W.
Bush's headquarters, told The Associated Press: ``It's typical for the Clinton-Gore administration to take credit for good things in America.
But much of the credit for the decline in crime has to go to governors and local officials who have passed tougher laws, longer prison sentences and lowered parole rates''.
The crime rate report is based upon information on nonlethal violent and property crimes gathered during the annual National Crime Victimization Survey.
In 1999, 42,895 households and 77,750 people age 12 or older were interviewed for the survey.
Although homicides were not included in the survey, the report said preliminary data gathered separately by the FBI indicated that the murder rate declined about 8 percent last year.
Males account for about three-quarters of murder victims.
About one in eight of these victims is under 18 years of age, and firearms are used in seven of 10 homicides, it said.
The report said 44 percent of last year's violent crimes against people were reported to police, compared with 34 percent of property crimes.
Robbery was the violent crime most often reported, with 61 percent of incidents disclosed, while rape and other sexual assaults were the least often brought to the attention of law enforcement.
Only 28 percent of these cases were reported.
Males were more likely to be victims of violent crime, including robbery and assault, than females in 1999.
``Males experienced violent crime at rates 28 percent greater, and were robbed at rates more than two times that of females,'' said the report.
``Females were victims of rape and sexual assault at 7.5 times greater than the rate of males''.
During 1999, it said, three females per 1,000 were raped or sexually assaulted, compared with 0.4 per 1,000 for males.
NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A week after Mayor Marc Morial received a national award for overhauling the city police department and a coinciding drop in crime, two teen-agers were murdered after leaving a weekend party in an upscale neighborhood.
Four more people have been killed since then, the latest victims in a disturbing trend: There have been 110 murders in New Orleans this year, compared with 80 by the same time a year ago.
The bad news isn't limited to New Orleans.
Selected checks of major cities, including Baltimore, Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia, found that murders are up over last year.
The increases follow a substantial drop in murder rates across the country during most of the last decade.
In May, the FBI said murder and other serious crimes reported to the police dropped for an eighth consecutive year in 1999, by far the longest-running crime decline on record.
Murder was down 2 percent in cities over 500,000 and 8 percent overall.
Several leading criminal justice experts agreed that the public should no longer expect to see the same significant drops in the rate of violent crimes that occurred in the 1990s.
But they were unsure whether this year's murder upswing is temporary or whether America's violent crime rate has reached its low point and will now increase.
''I call it the criminal justice limbo stick; at some point you can't go any lower,'' said James Alan Fox, a criminal justice professor at Northeastern University in Boston.
''Certain types of murder are way down...
but the issue of thrill and revenge motivation is still here and remains as American as apple pie and we have not seen an abatement of this type of violence''.
Steve Levitt, a University of Chicago economics professor who specializes in criminal justice issues, actually expects a long-term drop in violent crime.
He said unabated prison growth has removed violent offenders from society and is serving as a deterrent.
Not all the news so far this year is bad.
The murder rate for the first half of the year has dropped in some large cities, Denver and Phoenix among them, by as much as 28 percent.
But other experts aren't as optimistic as Levitt.
''Demography is working against us,'' said Fox, noting the number of people between 14 and 20 -- considered crime-prone ages -- is growing.
''If we don't pay attention, we could see youth violence so bad we'll look back on the 1990s and say, 'Those were the good old days'''.
When Morial took office in 1994, New Orleans had the nation's worst murder rate.
That has fallen more than 50 percent since then, with 162 murders last year.
At the U.S.
Conference of Mayors in Seattle on June 10, Morial received the City Livability Award for turning things around.
But now New Orleans is on pace for 230 murders this year, the total in 1998.
Police Superintendent Richard Pennington has blamed most of the killing on drug gangs.
The real question may be why the city's 1999 rate was so low, according to Al Blumstein, a criminal justice professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
He said last year's tally was an anomaly.
Unlike Fox, Blumstein sees less of a threat posed by the growing population of young people.
The crime rate for that age group has been falling at about 5 percent, he said, and he expects violent crime rates to level off.
''We've solved the easy stuff, now it's going to be a lot harder to go beyond that,'' he said.
None of the experts found evidence that the increase in some city murder rates is due to an economic slowdown.
Morgan Reynolds, a Texas A&AMP;M economics professor and director of criminal justice at the National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas, instead suggested that recent public embarrassments for police in Los Angeles and New York has left officers more gun shy about the way they treat suspects.
''We may be seeing something here in terms of temporary drop in police efficiency because of either morale, corruption or scandal,'' he said.

Later this month, the U.S. government will release new figures showing how many Americans are behind bars, and the numbers will reveal that the bull market for prisons is still charging ahead.
Nearly 1 of every 150 people in the United States is in prison or jail, the Justice Department will announce, a figure that no other democracy comes close to matching.
Soon, the total number of people locked up in federal and state prisons and local jails will likely reach the 2 million mark, almost double the number a decade ago, as the ranks of prisoners grow enough each year _ to fill Yankee Stadium and then some.
For an American born this year, the chance of living some part of life in a correction facility is 1 in 20; for black Americans, it is 1 in 4.
Most experts failed to predict that the inmate population would triple from 1980, and now nobody seems to know how to stop the buildup.
By all logic, prisons should be experiencing a few vacancies, and the cost of arresting, prosecuting and putting away an army of criminals should be at ebb.
After all, the economy could hardly be better, and crime has fallen steeply six years in a row.
But a prison peace dividend is nowhere in sight.
Instead, the guessing game now is: At what point does the world's largest penal system hit a plateau _ 2.5 million inmates, 3 million?
Surely, if crime continues to fall, the number of new prisoners must also fall.
Not quite.
No matter how much crime plummets, the United States will still have to add the equivalent of a new 1,000-bed jail or prison every week _ for perhaps another decade, federal officials say.
Some even believe the prison boom could be permanent, at least for another generation.
A big reason is that so many of the new inmates are drug offenders.
In the federal system, nearly 60 percent of all people behind bars are doing time for drug violations; in state prisons and local jails, the figure is 22 percent.
These numbers are triple the rate of 15 years ago.
Americans do not use more drugs, on average, than people in other nations; but the United States, virtually alone among Western democracies, has chosen a path of incarceration for drug offenders.
More than 400,000 people are behind bars for drug crimes _ and nearly a third of them are locked up for simply possessing an illicit drug.
``America's internal gulag,'' is what Gen.
Barry McCaffrey, the nation's drug czar, calls the expanding mass of drug inmates.
Many of those have committed any number of crimes.
But a growing number of them have broken no laws other than the ones on drug use.
In the 1980s, Congress and the states passed drug laws that required judges to put people in prison _ even first-time offenders, or those caught with small amounts of an illicit substance.
Mandatory minimum sentences, as they are called, leave no room for a judge to consider special circumstances, or options such as treatment instead of jail.
The idea was that more arrests would lead to more convictions, which would put more people in jail, and the crime rate would fall.
That did happen.
Another dividend was supposed to be a drop in drug use, but that has not happened.
Arrests of people who use drugs just hit an all-time high, the FBI reported.
At the same time, drug use has gone up among the young, and for drugs like heroin or methamphetamines.
Over all, drug use has not budged for 10 years.
For virtually all other crimes, of course, the figures are stunning _ with huge drops in murder, robbery and assault.
Whether this is because the United States will soon have 2 million people locked up is subject to much debate.
But many of the authorities who argue that the prison boom has taken the worst criminals out of circulation _ and has thus been the biggest factor in reducing crime _ are at a loss to explain the drug-use figures.
``I am in favor of the federal government ceasing and desisting the war on drugs,'' said Dr.
Morgan Reynolds, director of the Criminal Justice Center at the Dallas branch of the National Center for Policy Analysis, a free-market think tank.
He described himself as being on the conservative side of the debate over prisons and crime; he says the crime drop can be directly attributed to the prison boom.
But he is less sure that the federal government's war on drugs has an effect on crime rates and drug use.
For liberals and libertarians who have long claimed incarceration has failed to do anything but run up the bill in the drug war, conservative cover is welcome.
Last week, Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass.
, introduced a bill to restore discretion for judges in sentencing low-level, nonviolent drug offenders.
``We may be getting to the point of diminishing returns _ the more you expand the prison system, the more small fry you put in there,'' said Marc Mauer, assistant director of the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit group that has been critical of the prison buildup.
Even some of the architects of punitive drug policies now argue that stuffing the prisons with ever more drug offenders is not a wise investment.
Edwin Meese, who was attorney general under President Ronald Reagan, when most of the drug laws were rewritten, has started to look favorably on treatment for low-level offenders rather than jail.
``I think mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders ought to be reviewed,'' said Meese in an interview.
``We have to see who has been incarcerated and what has come from it''.
Beyond the laws that send drug offenders to prison with reflexive certainty, there are now institutional incentives to keep locking up more people _ a trend that some people call the prison industrial complex.
nn The stock price of the Corrections Corporation of America, the nation's largest private jailer, has increased tenfold since 1994.
The company's stock is now privately held.
But Corrections Corp.
has created a popular real-estate investment fund to get a return on all those new prisons being built at the rate of one a week.
Unions representing prison guards are the fastest-growing public employee associations in many states.
In California last year, the union was given a raise of 12 percent, which brought the salary for a seasoned prison guard up to $51,000.
It is the rare rural community that rejects a new prison in its backyard, with the prospect of permanent, high-paying, benefit-rich government jobs.
The prisons in California, as in virtually every other state, are near capacity, even though the state has built 21 new institutions in the last 15 years.
Soon, it will cost nearly $4 billion a year to run the state's prison system.
Should the Legislature propose some change in the law that might bring down the growth in prisons, they are likely to hear howls of outrage from the union that has most benefited from the growth in prisons.
``Once you have a society committed to building new prisons and keeping them, it's very difficult to close them down,'' said Mauer.
``Particularly in rural areas that come to depend on them.
It's like trying to close a military base''.
The states also have an incentive to keep people in jail a long time.
A federal law passed in 1994 provides matching funds to states to keep violent criminals in prison longer by denying parole.
This act and other so-called truth-in-sentencing laws are reasons why the ranks of prisoners will not soon drop, even as crime levels off.
``We've got crime going in one direction, and social policy going in the other,'' said Dr.
Allen Beck, the Justice Department's lead statistician on criminal justice trends.
The one thing that may finally slow prison growth, said Beck, are budget concerns.
It costs taxpayers $20,000 a year to house and feed every new inmate _ and that does not include the cost of building new prisons and jails.
The states are spending nearly $30 billion to keep people in jail _ about double the rate of 10 years ago.
Some states are starting to balk.
California legislative leaders say they will build no new prisons in coming years, but they have not said what they will do with excess prisoners.
In Washington state, a bill that would abolish mandatory minimum prison terms for drug offenders has gained support from judges, prosecutors and tough-on-crime Republicans.
Washington was a pioneer state in enacting laws requiring long lockups, with no chance of early release or leeway for judges to consider other options.
But prisons now are the state's fastest-growing part of the budget _ even as crime has nearly bottomed out.
But it will be difficult to change the pattern, with new prisons rising in depressed rural areas.
Cleaning up after a crusade, some lawmakers said, has proven much harder than they anticipated.
RICHMOND, Va.
_ Here on the streets of Virginia's capital, Melvin Douglas Smith was known for his luck as much as his troublemaking.
For all the charges brought against him in state courts over a decade, from larceny and resisting arrest to illegal firearms and murder, none stuck.
He never served a day in prison.
Then Smith's luck ran out.
When a patrol officer pulled him over for a traffic violation in 1997, the officer looked in the car and found 12 grams of crack cocaine, a 12-gauge shotgun and a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol.
The combination of guns and drugs was his undoing: Under a new program aimed at gun offenders called Project Exile, prosecutors were able to charge Smith in the tougher federal system.
He is now serving 16 and a half years in a federal prison.
As cities across the country sue the gun industry or buy back handguns as last resorts to get them off the streets, Project Exile is being credited for helping reverse a decade of rising crime rates in Richmond by moving gun offenses into the federal system, where bond is less available, sentences are longer and convicts are sent out of state to serve their terms.
Project Exile has not only helped to reduce crime in Richmond, but it has also brought together officials from other cities and the National Rifle Association in an expanding experiment to see whether violent crime can be reduced by aggressively enforcing laws already on the books, rather than fighting over new laws.
While the Justice Department, long an adversary of the rifle association over gun control, has held back from recommending Project Exile as a cure-all, and a panel of federal judges in Richmond has criticized it as a federal intrusion into state matters, Philadelphia and Rochester, N.Y., have adopted versions of the program, and more than a dozen other cities are considering it.
While homicide rates have dropped across the country for a variety of reasons, the authorities in Richmond contend that Project Exile helped cut their rate of homicides by firearms by 36 percent last year, to 78 homicides from 122 in 1997, one of the steepest declines in any city.
The program has also helped the authorities solve older cases.
Once Smith was sentenced, for example, witnesses no longer afraid of him came forward with enough information to charge him with six murders, including two that could bring the death penalty.
``In Richmond, there has been an intense need for people to become believers in their own community,'' Mayor Timothy M.
Kaine said.
``High crime has been our psychological downer.
But Project Exile is driving the crime rate down, and that is starting to make Richmonders believers again''.
Patterned after federal efforts to fight illegal drug activities, the program evolved from a determination to prosecute gun charges in federal courts, where the stakes are higher for defendants than in state courts, even though federal courts generally regard gun violations as low-level crimes.
Many gun offenses become federal as well as state crimes when they are coupled with other offenses like drug possession or when the person arrested is a convicted felon, an illegal alien, a mental patient, a drug addict, a fugitive, the subject of a criminal indictment or a person convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence.
As a key element of Project Exile, a coalition of business and civic leaders has cooperated with the police by saturating the area with radio and television messages, billboards and posters, warning that anyone caught with an illegal weapon faces a jail term of five years.
Project Exile is so well known on the street, said David E.
Boone, a criminal defense lawyer here, that ``the first thing I hear now when I talk to a client is, `Can you keep this from going Exile'?
A lot of them can't add two and two, but they know a gun plus drugs equals five''.
Some do, anyway.
S. David Schiller, an assistant U.S. attorney here who conceived the program, said the first two years of Project Exile have led to the recovery of 475 illegal guns, indictments against 404 people on gun charges, a conviction rate of 86 percent through trials and plea bargains, and an average prison term of more than four and a half years.
And Richmond police officers say the program is convincing some would-be criminals to leave their weapons at home.
``We're now finding more guns in houses than on the street,'' said Michael J.
Shamus, an acting lieutenant on the police department's Rapid Mobilization Team.
``The streets are safer''.
Still, not everyone is convinced that Project Exile is the appropriate means to attack the gun problem.
In a recent court ruling, all three judges of the federal District Court here criticized the program as ``a substantial federal incursion into a sovereign state's area of authority and responsibility''.
And the Justice Department has remained reluctant to promote it as a national solution to gun violence.
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said recently that department officials ``take issue with the notion that there is a cookie-cutter approach to reducing gun violence'' and added, ``Exile worked in Richmond and can work in other places, but you have to look at the local situation, the situation in every city, to decide exactly what will work''.
Holder also said the department had sent additional federal marshals, agents and prosecutors ``to make Exile a successful program''.
(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn Schiller conceded that more federal agents had been sent to Richmond.
But he insisted that the only federal participants dedicated to Project Exile outside of the U.S.
Attorney's office are two agents on loan from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and one from the FBI.
Others say the involvement of the NRA, which has opposed federal gun control laws, has tempered the Justice Department's interest.
The rifle association has contributed $125,000 to Richmond's efforts and has lobbied Congress to get $2.3 million for programs in Philadelphia and Camden, N.J.
Schiller's boss, Helen F.
Fahey, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said, ``I can't answer that as a fact, but I suspect it is true''.
Wayne R.
LaPierre Jr.
, the association's executive director, minced no words.
``They consider these nuisance cases, and the last thing federal judges want are armed felony cases in their courts,'' he said.
``That's shameful.
Killing people is wrong, and regardless of the NRA, it needs to be changed''.
In Philadelphia, Mayor Edward G.
Rendell led the effort to establish a Project Exile after a challenge last summer by the NRA to ``give us one major American city'' to prove that aggressive law enforcement can make a bigger difference than more laws that restrict gun ownership.
Just two days after the city's version of Project Exile, called Operation Cease-Fire, was announced, 15 indictments were returned.
In Rochester, where a program similar to Richmond's was begun in late September to supplement other new crime-fighting initiatives, no homicides were reported in November and just two in December.
``I can't say that everything is attributable to our Project Exile _ it's a little early for that,'' said Denise E.
O'Donnell, the U.S.
Attorney for the Western District of New York.
``But we're very enthusiastic about the program.
We are seeing our crime rates come down''.
Police officers on Richmond's streets seem thankful for the help, no matter who provides it.
When Jerry A.
Oliver was hired as chief of police in 1994, Richmond had had a decade of increasing numbers of homicides, peaking that year at 160.
``We desperately needed a home run, something to celebrate,'' he said.
``As police chief, I see Project Exile as one of those programs that is working.''
VICTORVILLE, Calif.
_ Every 20 seconds, someone in the United States is arrested for a drug violation.
Every week, on average, a new jail or prison is built to lock up more people in the world's largest penal system.
It was not always so.
Ten years ago, half as many people were arrested for drug crimes, and the nation's incarceration rate was closer to those of other democracies.
But in the 1980s crack cocaine scared the country, and the criminal justice system has never been the same.
Crack poisoned many communities.
Dealers turned neighborhoods into drug markets.
As heavily armed gangs fought over turf, murder rates shot up.
Authorities warned that crack was instantly addictive and spreading rapidly, and predicted that a generation of crack babies would bear the drug's imprint.
It looked like a nightmare with no end.
But for all the havoc wreaked by crack, the worst fears were not realized.
Crack appealed mainly to hard-core drug users.
The number of crack users began falling not long after surveys began counting them.
A decade later, the violence of the crack trade has burned out, and murder rates have plunged.
Yet crack left its mark, in ways that few people anticipated.
Crack prompted the nation to rewrite its drug laws, lock up a record number of people and shift money from schools to prisons.
It transformed police work, hospitals, parental rights, courts.
Crack also changed the racial makeup of U.S. prisons.
More whites than blacks use crack, according to surveys, but as the war on drugs focused on poor city neighborhoods, blacks went to prison at a far higher rate.
In California, five black men are behind bars for each one in a state university.
But the harsh laws responding to crack have not reduced overall drug use.
And now the ceaseless march of new drug offenders and the mounting costs of prisons are moving some of the people charged with enforcing the punitive laws to question the assumptions behind them.
``We have a failed social policy and it has to be re-evaluated,'' said Barry McCaffrey, the four-star general who heads the National Drug Control Policy Office.
``Otherwise, we're going to bankrupt ourselves.
Because we can't incarcerate our way out of this problem''.
More than a quarter-million Americans in prison for drug offenses could be better dealt with in treatment programs, he said, saving up to $5 billion a year.
Since 1985 the nation's jail and prison population has grown 130 percent, and it will soon pass 2 million, even as crime rates continue a six-year decline.
No country has more people behind bars, and only one, Russia, has a higher incarceration rate, according to the Sentencing Project, which tracks prison rates.
Behind the increase is a national get-tough mood that has produced longer sentences for all criminals and the end of parole in many states.
Polls show that most Americans favor lengthy terms for violent criminals.
But perhaps the biggest single factor is the systematic jailing of drug offenders.
In the first 10 years after Congress toughened drug laws in response to crack, the number of people imprisoned for drugs grew more than 400 percent, nearly twice the growth rate for violent criminals.
More people are behind bars for drug offenses in the United States _ about 400,000 _ than are in prison for all crimes in England, France, Germany and Japan combined.
Crack's legacy can be seen in nearly every corner of the land, even in the Mojave Desert, where the newest federal prison is rising at the dusty edge of Victorville.
In an age of government downsizing, the federal corrections budget has grown more than tenfold in a decade, to nearly $4 billion, yet prisons are so stuffed with drug offenders that this one will be at capacity almost from the day it opens.
Some experts argue what might seem obvious: that high incarceration rates deserve the credit for falling crime rates.
``Putting people in prison has been the single most important thing we've done to reduce crime,'' Dr.
James Q.
Wilson, the political scientist whose ideas have influenced police departments for a generation, has written.
In New York, the police and prosecutors say locking up thousands of drug offenders was a major factor in the city's turning the corner on crime.
``What plays havoc with a neighborhood are the low-level dealers,'' said Bridget Brennan, the Special Narcotics Prosecutor for New York.
``When they take over a street or a stoop, everyone else is terrified.
When you put those people in jail, it gives the community a sense that order has been restored''.
What the prison boom has not done, however, is reduce illicit drug use, national surveys show.
Far fewer Americans use illegal drugs now than in the peak years of the 1970s.
But almost all of the drop occurred before crack cocaine or the laws passed in response to it.
The most recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, for 1997, estimated that about 14 million people had used an illegal drug in the last month, a number barely changed since 1988.
Of those, 600,000 had smoked crack within a month, unchanged since 1988.
But during that time, imprisonment rates soared.
``What's happened across the board is that police started going after small-time street dealers and users,'' said Dr.
Steven Belenko, a criminologist at the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.
Crack never became a mainstream drug, but the fear of it changed perception and laws for virtually all illicit drugs, according to Belenko and others who have studied the war on drugs.
``Crack probably had more impact on the entire criminal justice system than it had on the communities and the drug users,'' said Dr.
Franklin Zimring, director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California School of Law.
``This secondary impact, on police and prisons, may end up being more negative than anything associated with the drug''.
Among governors, teachers, criminologists and police chiefs, there is vigorous debate over how the drug laws enacted at the height of the crack panic have transformed the nation.
But in Congress, which enacted the laws without a single hearing, there is nothing.
For crack has left one other major legacy: The policy discussion in Washington on prisons and drugs has been frozen for more than a decade.
(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn The Evidence As Crime Rate Falls, More Prisons Are Built The little towns tucked into the folds of the Appalachian Mountains in Schuylkill County, Pa.
, are a world removed from the city streets where crack cocaine was a media obsession in the mid-1980s.
But the legacy of crack is all around.
A first-year teacher there can expect to make $18,500 a year, the state-mandated minimum.
A prison-guard trainee is paid $22,300.
The job of watching over the drug offenders and others who are filling three new state prisons in the region is coveted.
Pennsylvania might not seem the kind of place where prisons and jails would be booming.
The state has an aging population.
Crime has never been a particularly big problem; among the states, Pennsylvania has ranked near the bottom.
But every year for the last 14 years, Pennsylvania has added at least one prison, and the corrections budget has soared to more than $1 billion a year, a fivefold increase over a decade.
In 1988, not long before President George Bush spoke to the nation about the war on drugs while holding up a bag of crack, Pennsylvania radically changed its drug laws, establishing mandatory minimum sentences for people caught with illicit drugs.
No time off for first-time offenders.
No community service.
No treatment for addicts.
Pennsylvania was following the lead of Congress, which had set the nation on a course of strict incarceration for drug users with laws enacted in 1986 and 1988.
Ten years later, its inmate population had grown 225 percent, to 35,600.
Pennsylvania spends an average of $20,000 a year for each one, about the national average.
Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican, has no plans to change the incarceration policy.
``Every public expenditure comes with a choice,'' said his spokesman, Tim Reeves.
``We defend the choices we've made''.
The crime rate might not be so low if the state had not locked up so many drug offenders, Reeves said.
``What would the rate be if those guys were not in jail''? he said.
``Think about the cost to the community, the wasted lives and violent crime''.
But in building a penal system in which three of every 10 new prisoners are serving time for drugs, according to the Pennsylvania Sentencing Commission, which tracks prison rates for the state, Pennsylvania, like most states, has not reduced illegal drug use.
``I don't think anybody believes it has turned out to be an effective policy,'' said David Sweet, a Harrisburg lawyer who headed a special commission that examined the state's prison growth.
``It appeared to us that we were using a very expensive way to provide secure housing for people who probably don't belong in prison''.
Dr. Julia Glover Hall, a criminologist at Drexel University and president of the Pennsylvania Prison Society, which Benjamin Franklin established to monitor prisons and jails, said: ``It's a stupid game we're playing.
We're locking up all these nonviolent offenders, pouring money down a rat hole''.
She added: ``I've been a crime victim.
I'm not soft on criminals.
But we have to look at the bottom line of what we're doing.
There was this powerful scare in the crack years, and all across the country we passed these Draconian laws.
Now we're starting to see how much it has cost the rest of us''.
Pennsylvania is typical of what has happened across the country.
California is spending nearly $4 billion a year to operate the nation's largest prison system.
As the state added 21 prisons since 1984 _ and only one university campus _ violent criminals fell to 42 percent of the prison population in 1997, from 57 percent, while drug inmates grew to 27 percent, from 8 percent.
Political leaders have debated whether the building boom was at the expense of their budget's other big discretionary item, higher education.
Many politicians said the state would try to fully finance both.
But the numbers tell another story.
Spending on prisons has grown 60 percent over a decade, and pay for prison guards has more than doubled.
For higher education, there was virtually no growth, and salaries in the state university system stagnated, falling behind other states.
A prison guard now makes about $51,000 a year, while a first-year professor in California's once-vaunted university system is paid $41,000.
As the prison budget swelled, California raised tuition to make up the university financing gap.
Over the last 10 years, as the state's population grew by 5 million people, state university enrollment fell by 20,000.
The shift in priorities, documented in a number of studies, has become a major issue since a new governor, Gray Davis, and a new Legislature took office.
``Most of our buildings are literally falling apart and we've lost 1,500 full-time faculty members,'' said Jeri Bledsoe, general manager of the California Faculty Association.
``You bet there's been a price to pay for our prison boom''.
The Convicted $40 Worth of Cocaine Brings a Life Sentence The biggest legacy of crack is out of sight, behind the concrete and steel of prisons.
Addicts, couriers, girlfriends of dealers, people tempted by the lure of a quick buck, mostly poor blacks _ these are the dominant profiles of the people jailed since prisons started filling with drug criminals.
Inside the maximum-security unit at the state prison for women in Topeka, Kan.
, Gloria Van Winkle is in the sixth year of a life term for possessing $40 worth of cocaine.
A mother of two and a drug addict, she had two convictions for cocaine possession when a convicted thief told undercover agents she was smoking crack and they set up a sting.
Kansas has all but forgotten about Ms.
Van Winkle.
Asked about her case, the state Sentencing Commission said no one was doing life for drug possession.
``Only murderers get life sentences in Kansas,'' said its executive director, Barbara Tombs.
On further review, Ms.
Tombs found that, yes, for a brief period in the early '90s, a person convicted of three drug offenses could get life.
That law was changed.
Ms. Van Winkle's sentence was not.
``I can't laugh anymore, I can't cry _ it's just a slow rage that makes me numb,'' Ms.
Van Winkle said.
Her sentence offers an eventual chance of parole, but for now, she lives for visits from her children, ages 10 and 6, and wonders what they will grow up to be like with her behind bars.
nn Her concern is shared by many others: Three-fourths of the 54,000 women jailed for drug crimes have children.
The police and prosecutors said Ms.
Van Winkle should have been aware of the possibility of a life sentence.
They said she was chosen because they thought she might lead them to dealers, but no follow-up arrests were made.
Ms. Van Winkle's case is rare but not unique.
Because of three-strikes laws and other changes made in the last decade, people in several other states are serving life sentences for drug possession.
More typical among women convicted of drug offenses are 5- and 10-year mandatory terms.
Tonya Drake, a mother of four, had no criminal record or history of drug use when she was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for mailing a package that contained crack cocaine.
She says a friend paid her $44 to mail the package, which she did not know contained drugs.
Ms. Drake admits what she did was wrong.
``But the time does not fit the crime,'' she said in a prison interview.
``You lock me up for 10 years.
While I'm here, my father dies, my children grow up, it cost thousands of dollars to keep me behind bars''.
The children are having considerable trouble growing up with their mother in prison, said Ms.
Drake's sister, Williet Mitchell.
``Tonya was taken away from the kids at a time when everybody needed her,'' Ms.
Mitchell said.
``Now the kids are screwed up.
They're angry and bitter that she was forced to leave them''.
When the children see their mother in the prison visiting room, Ms.
Drake tries to explain what brought her there.
``I tell my kids I did something wrong, that it was a mistake,'' she said.
``But it was my first and only mistake''.
In Kentucky, Louie Cordell, a 55-year-old father of nine with no prior convictions, is finishing a mandatory five-year federal sentence for growing 141 marijuana plants.
Cordell was sent to prison under the 1986 law that set mandatory five- and 10-year sentences for the possession or sale of small amounts of crack.
For marijuana, the law set a mandatory sentence of five years for possession of 100 plants, whether they were seedlings or 6 feet tall.
That provision has since been changed to go by weight.
The law punished Cordell, but it hit his family just as hard.
He worked seasonally at a sawmill in a poor county in southeastern Kentucky and was growing the marijuana to help make ends meet, said his wife, Shirley.
Since Cordell went to prison, a son gave up plans to attend college on a scholarship, in order to help support the family, and the Cordells have been on and off welfare.
``There's no way to describe what's happened to us except to say that it's been bad in all ways,'' Mrs.
Cordell said.
``Louie was here providing for us and then they took him away.
I expected him to get some time for what he did, but not five years''.
Marijuana was never mentioned in the floor speeches in Congress when the drug laws were rewritten in 1986, but the new penalties for crack were accompanied by harsher sentences for most drugs.
Ten years later, more people were sentenced under the federal system for marijuana than for any other drug.
Supporters of harsh penalties argue that locking up the Louie Cordells of the world has a deterrent effect and say convictions reduce other crimes associated with drug use.
Marijuana arrests set a record in 1997 _ 695,200, nearly 90 percent of which were for simple possession.
And marijuana remains, by far, the most popular illegal drug: 18 million Americans used marijuana at least once in 1997, according to the National Household Survey.
And some 71 million, 33 percent of those over age 12, have used marijuana at some time.
Asked about deterrence, the federal prosecutor in Cordell's case, David Marye, said marijuana cultivation does not seem to have diminished in rural Kentucky.
``I've been prosecuting cases, state and federal, for 21 years, and we have so many people who keep doing what Louie Cordell was doing that it makes you wonder if we'll ever stop them,'' he said.
The Cities Racial Implications of the Crack Laws One of every 20 Americans born this year will serve time in prison, according to a Justice Department study.
For blacks, the projection is one in four.
By 1996, 8.3 percent of black men age 25 to 29 were inmates, compared with 0.8 percent of white men that age.
The odds of going to prison used to be more even.
But the criminal justice system's special treatment of crack cocaine dramatically threw off the balance, according to reports by the Sentencing Commission and the Justice Department.
For people convicted of a crack offense, the world of justice is unlike any other.
Crack is simply cocaine processed so that it can be smoked.
But federal law equates 5 grams of crack with 500 grams of powder cocaine, a 1-to-100 ratio that no other country recognizes.
Possessing 5 grams of crack is a felony with an automatic five-year prison term, while 5 grams of the same drug in powder form is a misdemeanor likely to carry no jail time.
One consequence of the disparity is that kingpins at the top of a drug network who sell pounds of powder cocaine for processing often serve less time than street-level dealers who sell grams of crack.
``One of the great victims of the drug war is that our sense of penal proportion has been thrown out,'' said Zimring, of the University of California School of Law.
``Now we have a fairness problem''.
In addition, a law aimed at one type of drug use has been applied most often against one type of user _ urban blacks.
A higher percentage of blacks use crack cocaine than whites or Hispanic people.
But in absolute numbers, twice as many whites as blacks use crack, and three times as many whites as blacks use powder cocaine, the national household survey shows.
As the war on drugs set up special penalties on crack, however, law enforcement focused on the highly visible, often violent crack trade in city neighborhoods, rather than the larger traffic in cocaine going on behind closed doors across the country.
The result: Nearly 90 percent of the people locked up for crack under federal drug laws are black, McCaffrey said.
In state prisons, blacks make up nearly 60 percent of the people serving time on drug offenses, according to Justice Department figures, though they are only 12 percent of the general population and 15 percent of regular drug users.
``I don't think we got into this fix because of racism,'' McCaffrey said.
``The impact of crack on the African-American community was devastating.
And that's where enforcement has been concentrated''.
The racial disparity would disappear if the law treated the powder and crack forms of cocaine equally, said Dr.
Douglas McDonald, a senior scientist at Abt Associates, a social policy research group in Cambridge, Mass.
, who testified before Congress.
If enforcement were evenly applied, more whites than blacks would go to prison, he said.
nn So for many blacks the legacy of crack is not just the violence and high prison rates that have hit so many communities, but a heightened sense that the law does not treat them fairly.
``You have so many people who feel hopeless, who feel that it is extremely unfair that so many low-level offenders are going to jail for such a long time,'' said Mattie Compton, a black community leader in Fort Worth, Texas, who is deputy chief assistant U.S. attorney for the civil division.
``We know we're going to lose people in poor neighborhoods, but when you see people who are prospects for future leaders going away to jail for so long, you wonder if we really are a community under siege,'' Ms.
Compton said.
Asked about the legacy of crack in the Roxbury district of Boston, where he works with drug addicts at a community health center, Seward Hunter said: ``If you're African-American, you expect to be targeted by the police and you expect to be stopped and searched''.
Many in Congress say there is no racial intent behind the disparity between crack and powder.
Crack is punished more severely because of the harm it does and because of the violent crimes associated with it.
``No one should forget that crack traffickers deal in death, and that they do so to the most vulnerable among us, the residents of our inner cities,'' said Rep.
Bill McCollum, R-Fla.
, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Crime.
The Change Crack Makes News; Congress Responds How Congress came to write a law that allows a person caught with 400 grams of powder cocaine, worth some $40,000, to do less than a year in jail, while a person holding the same amount of cocaine in crack form will spend 10 years in prison, is a mystery to people who have tried to research the statutory intent.
One lawyer who was instrumental in rewriting the drug laws in 1986 and 1988 says it came about through whim and attempts by politicians to one-up each other as crack seized headlines just before elections.
``There was a level of hysteria that led to a total breakdown of the legislative process,'' said the lawyer, Eric Sterling, who as a lead lawyer on the House Judiciary Committee wrote the laws that established long mandatory terms for several drugs.
Since leaving the Judiciary Committee in 1989, Sterling has worked to overturn the laws as president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation in Washington.
In the summer of 1986, crack was just starting to be labeled as an epidemic when a college basketball star, Len Bias, died of a drug overdose, reportedly crack cocaine.
Speaker Tip O'Neill, whose hometown team, the Boston Celtics, had drafted Bias, ordered an overhaul of federal drug laws.
The death of Bias was invoked in Congress 11 times.
The law, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, passed the House with only 16 dissenting votes.
Despite complaints by some senators that no one had studied the bill, it sailed through the Senate and President Ronald Reagan signed it before Election Day.
A year later, court testimony revealed that Bias had died of an overdose of powder cocaine, not crack.
But by then crack had its special status in state and federal law.
Crack was singled out for good reason, according to Edwin Meese, the attorney general in the mid-1980s and now the Ronald Reagan Distinguished Fellow of Public Policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization in Washington.
``Crack cocaine was the scourge of the inner city,'' he said.
``The reason laws were changed was to protect the inner city''.
In 1988, Congress passed another overhaul of drug laws just before the election, singling out crack as the only drug to carry a mandatory five-year prison term for possession.
That year, a Gallup poll found that 62 percent of Americans surveyed agreed that to curb drug use they ``would be willing to give up some freedoms''.
Crack was on the cover of news magazines, dominated television and newspaper coverage, and was labeled ``America's drug of choice,'' by NBC.
The New York Times reported that crack was spreading to the suburbs.
William Bennett, the drug czar for 18 months under President Bush, said it might soon invade every home in America.
Crack was compared to the bubonic plague and called ``the most addictive drug known to man'' in Newsweek.
Today, few of the revisionist experts on drug laws dispute crack's link to violence and gangs.
``It was a nightmare,'' McCaffrey said.
``It was World War III''.
But crack was never America's drug of choice _ it did not come close.
At the height of concern in the late 1980s, the National Household Survey on Drugs estimated that less than one-half of 1 percent of the population over age 12 used crack once a month, while 10 percent used marijuana.
And three out of four high school seniors who tried crack did not continue to use it, according to a national survey of students by the University of Michigan.
Both surveys have flaws, underestimating inner-city users and high school dropouts.
But even after the findings for high use in certain urban areas are adjusted, crack was never the epidemic it was held up to be.
The media attention was so hyperbolic that the Drug Enforcement Administration was compelled to correct the record.
``Crack is currently the subject of considerable media attention,'' the agency said in 1986.
``The result has been a distortion of the public perception of the extent of crack use as compared to the use of other drugs''.
Although crack was labeled the world's most addictive drug, 10 years of national surveys have shown that most people who try crack do not continue to use it.
Because of its intense but short-lived effect, crack does tend to make its users ``psychologically dependent,'' reported a Justice Department study.
But numerous studies have shown that crack, like the powder form of cocaine, may be less physically addictive than alcohol or tobacco.
The Pyramid Lower-Level Dealers Feel the Sting of Laws Political leaders said harsh sentencing laws were intended to deter use of the most dangerous drugs, with crack at the top of the list.
Failing that, they said, the laws would at least go after drug kingpins.
But statistics show a different pattern among people sentenced to prison for drugs since 1986.
Of the people jailed by the federal government for crack offenses, only 5 percent were considered high-level dealers, according to a study by the Sentencing Commission.
``The current policy focuses law-enforcement efforts on the lowest level of the distribution line, the street-level dealer,'' the commission's vice chairman, Michael Gelacak, wrote.
``Unless we ignore all evidence to the contrary, the current policy has little or no impact upon the drug abuse problem.
The jails are full''.
nn Supporters of the crack laws say the numbers are explained by the pyramid structure of drug operations; by nature they have few people at the top, lots of people at the bottom.
But those at the top are often dealing powder cocaine, with its vastly different penalties.
And they are in a position to become informers, the only real hope of beating a mandatory prison term.
Had Tonya Drake, the woman serving 10 years for mailing a package, been able to supply what the law labels ``substantial assistance'' _ information on a high-level dealer _ she might have reduced her sentence.
The 1980s drug laws leave discretion in the hands of prosecutors to encourage people to ``snitch''.
Ms. Drake identified the man who gave her the package, but he was never found.
The prosecutor decided her assistance was not substantial.
The fixed sentences have infuriated judges, who say they feel their role has been reduced to that of rubber stamps for prosecutors, while their courts are clogged with low- to medium-level drug offenders.
``When you're dealing with first-time offenders, you should have some discretion,'' said Lawrence Irving, a former federal judge from San Diego.
``I had cases where I was forced to give more jail time for low-level offenders than for the kingpins.
It made no sense''.
In a 1994 case in Chicago, Marvin Aspen, a U.S.
District Court judge, labeled his sentencings ``a farce'' as he sent the lowest and ``least culpable'' member of a big crack operation to prison for longer than a supplier at the top.
Monica Boguille, the 20-year-old mother of a baby girl, was sentenced to 10 years for occasionally counting money for her boyfriend, a crack dealer.
L.C. Godfrey, one of the ring's wholesale suppliers of cocaine, who was deemed helpful to prosecutors, received nine years.
Justice Stephen Breyer of the U.S.
Supreme Court said recently that federal judges should regain some of the discretion they once had.
Five years ago, Chief Justice William Rehnquist made similar points in condemning the mandatory minimum sentences established by Congress.
Dozens of federal judges, most of them former prosecutors, have taken a strong stand against mandatory minimum drug sentences.
For these judges, the most significant legacy of crack is a legal system that has left them as little more than spectators in their own courtrooms.
The Aftermath The Penalties Outlive Fear of an Epidemic McCaffrey says he came to the drug debate with an open mind but has become convinced that current policies, with the primary emphasis on imprisonment, are failing.
``The current system is bad drug policy and bad law enforcement,'' he said.
On cost alone, arresting, prosecuting and locking up all drug criminals at the price of about $35 billion a year is not effective, he said.
He now favors long sentences for dealers and treatment for low-level users.
A recent study by Rand Corp.
concluded that mandatory jail terms are the least cost-effective way of reducing cocaine consumption.
For violent crimes, long sentences keep criminals off the street, it reported, but for drug crimes, ``a jailed supplier is often replaced by another supplier''.
Drug treatment also has a low success rate; among regular users of cocaine who undergo treatment, only one in eight stops.
But even that would achieve a greater reduction in cocaine use _ at a fraction of the cost _ than prison, the Rand study stated.
``We misread a lot what was going on in the 1980s, in that we thought crack use was going to grow and take over society,'' said Dr.
Jonathan Caulkins, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, who conducted the study.
``The real tragedy is that now that it's clear that crack was not the epidemic it was supposed to be, we still have these laws''.
But few authorities on crime expect the laws to change, no matter how full the prisons become.
``For politicians, the drug debate is driven by the three R's _ retribution, revenge, retaliation _ and that leads to the fourth R, re-election,'' said Dr.
James Alan Fox, dean of the college of criminal justice at Northeastern University.
This month, the Clinton administration announced a plan to cut drug use in half by 2007.
After years of reduced federal financing for drug rehabilitation, it would increase money for treating addicts.
The war metaphor has been dropped by the White House, and by some in Congress as well.
But the emphasis on long mandatory prison terms and locking up small-time dealers remains the main strategy for Congress.
``I believe it is crucial, given our continuing struggle in the war on drugs, that we send an unwavering and unambiguous message to all Americans, and our children in particular, that the sale of illegal drugs is dangerous, wrong and will not be tolerated,'' said Sen.
Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.
, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Abraham has introduced a bill that would establish much longer sentences for people convicted of powder cocaine offenses, making them closer to crack.
``All that bill would do is lock up a bigger batch of small fry,'' said Julie Stewart, a former member of the conservative Cato Institute, who founded Families Against Mandatory Minimums after her brother was sent to prison on a marijuana conviction.
The group has 37,000 members.
But with polls showing that most Americans favor long prison terms for drug trafficking, attempts to persuade Congress to reconsider the laws have gone nowhere.
Sentiment has remained the same for nearly a decade, dating to a time when some politicians predicted that the United States could be drug-free by the year 2000.
Nobody makes such a prediction these days.
LOS ANGELES _ The California state prison system, which led the huge national prison-building boom for years, has recorded the first decline in its inmate population in more than two decades, according to state officials.
The drop, although tiny, has already caused some officials to say that it is time for California to temporarily halt a prison buildup that inspired spending in other states across the country, and had a big effect on the state budget.
At one point, in the mid-1990s, California began spending more on prisons than for its giant university system.
Since 1980, California has spent $5.6 billion on prison construction and, with increasingly tough laws for repeat offenders, has had little trouble filling the new cells.
``But now there are several prisons we aren't building,'' said C.A.
Terhune, the director of the Department of Corrections, on Wednesday.
``Frankly, it's a lot of money that the governor and the Legislature can use for other social problems.
We're still going to need prisons, but at a much lower rate''.
The state's prison population of 161,401 in late June was 360 fewer inmates than in June 1999.
``In one sense, 360 is a drop in the bucket,'' said Franklin Zimring, an expert on prisons and a professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley.
``The big news is that the bucket didn't get any bigger this year.
It's not the decline, it's the absence of an advance''.
``This is very good news, which we haven't seen nationally,'' Zimring added.
``Now, the question is to what extent is California serving as a leading indicator for the rest of the country''?
Among the largest states, at least, California seems to be the only one actually experiencing a decline in the prison population, according to officials around the country.
Nationally, the prison population continues to grow, although the rate has slowed over the last five years.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) In Texas, which has the nation's second-largest prison population, the number of inmates increased by 2.9 percent, to 150,359, from June 1999 to last month, officials there said.
This rate of increase was greater than it was the year before, but significantly less than the 5 percent increase in the state's prison population from June 1996 to June 1997.
Florida, which has the third-largest prison population, had a 3.8 percent increase from June 1999 to last month, state officials there said.
The state's total prison population is 71,233.
It increased by just 0.6 percent from June 1996 to June 1997.
Between June 1999 and last month, New York state experienced a 0.5 percent increase in its inmate population, bringing its total to 71,021.
The rate of growth was down significantly from the 1.7 percent increase in 1997.
From 1997 to 1998, there was a 0.3 percent decrease in the state's prison population, then it rose the next year with a 2 percent increase.
Referring to New York, James B.
Flateau, spokesman for the New York State Department of Correctional Services, said, ``The violent population is still increasing, but the nonviolent population is not.
And any growth is attributable to violent offenders''.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) Terhune said the growth of the prison population in California has been steadily slowing over the last three years.
Between 1980 and 1989, the prison population grew by 14.5 percent a year.
In the 1990s, the growth slowed to an average of 6.3 percent a year.
Terhune said it was still unclear whether the decline represents a long-term trend or simply a short-term dip.
``But I'm happy about it,'' he said.
``Growth was up to nearly 12,0000 a year.
Considering what growth was, this is significant''.
He speculated that several factors played a role in the decline, including a decrease in new inmates sentenced by courts, fewer parole violators returned with new terms and a slowdown in the rate of parole violators returned to custody.
Officials in California also said they were increasingly turning to alternatives to prison, such as drug rehabilitation programs and additional parole.
Zimring said the declines should have occurred years ago to match the decline in the crime rate, which has been falling in California since the early 1990s.
``The prison admission numbers have finally caught up with the trends in crime,'' he said.
``This is a state that has become almost addicted to massive increases in punishment, and now it appears it has taken a vacation from that attitude''.
Several large cities in other states have also reported decreases in crime in recent years.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) California is still going ahead with plans to build a $335 million, 5,000 bed high-security prison in the town of Delano.
But it will be the last for several years, Terhune said, adding, ``We can go five years without having to go to the Legislature for additional construction''.
Rose Braz, a defense lawyer in Oakland and the program director for Critical Resistance, a group that monitors prisons and criminal justice issues, said the state's new numbers were evidence that the Delano prison was not necessary.
``It gives us hope,'' Braz said.
``The race to incarcerate may finally be slowing down.
Maybe people are really starting to question the reliance on incarceration as the answer to everything''.
But other states, such as Virginia, have experienced declines one year only to see increases the next.
``California, as in so many things, is the leader in the nation, both in things good and bad,'' said Alfred Blumstein, a professor of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
``The drop in California is so small that it might just be noise, but it could also be an indication that finally we're seeing the first dove after the flood.''
LOS ANGELES -- Keeping kids off the streets of the northeast San Fernando Valley through a nighttime curfew has helped drive down burglary and robbery rates there to the lowest citywide, police say.
The Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill Division hands out twice as many curfew citations as other divisions, and it was the only one with a decline in violent crime during the first three months of this year.
``It's a lot of juveniles who burglarize cars and instigate a lot of violent crimes on the streets,'' said Foothill Division Capt.
Ken Garner.
``The curfews have really worked''.
The division's property crime rate fell by 25 percent, dramatically below other Valley divisions.
The Valley's top police officer, Deputy Chief Mike Bostic, said tough enforcement of the curfew wouldn't necessarily work as well elsewhere in the suburban San Fernando Valley northwest of downtown.
``The ordinance doesn't work as much in places like North Hollywood where the crime patterns show it's more adults causing problems,'' Bostic said.
``I tell the division commanders to use whatever tools they can to reduce crime.
The curfew isn't a cure-all issue''.
However, the numbers seem to tell a different story: Property crimes -- which police say are largely caused by juveniles -- are down only 4.5 percent in the North Hollywood Division and are up 1.3 percent in the Devonshire Division.
North Hollywood Division Capt.
Rick Wahler said his officers enforced the curfew aggressively, and the juvenile-crime problem stopped, so now there is no need to continue regular patrols.
``It didn't make sense to have officers patrol areas where the problem had diminished,'' Wahler said.
``They continue to enforce the curfew on regular patrols, but we don't do any more special enforcements''.
Violent crime in North Hollywood increased 6.5 percent, caused by a surge in domestic violence, Wahler said.
``That's an area that has nothing to do with the curfew,'' he added.
In the Van Nuys Division, officers have focused on stemming school truancy rather than enforcing nighttime curfews, said Detective Craig Rhudy.
At night, he said, officers are too busy with emergency calls to deal with curfew violators.
The property crime rate in Rhudy's division declined 8.4 percent, while violent crimes rose 13.2 percent.
``I think our crime rate would decline even further if we spent more time on the curfew,'' Wahler said.
``We might be starting an enforcement program soon''.
Criminologists insist that curfews work.
Nationwide studies show that when police enforce the curfew, crime drops, said Daniel Glaser, a University of Southern California professor who specializes in juvenile crime and crime prevention.
``There's more kids getting in trouble these days and, if police are there to send them home, there's no trouble,'' Glaser said.
Yet the Los Angeles ACLU questions whether curfew enforcement decreases crime, said Liz Schroeder, associate director of the Los Angeles chapter.
``It's easy to attribute crime drops to things like the curfew, but it's really jobs and the economy that play a big role,'' she said.
Sixteen-year-old Jaime Orosco, who likes to hang out in Hubert H.
Humphrey Memorial Park, laments the fact that his park-loitering freedom slips away as the sun sets over Lake View Terrace.
``You can't go out at night without getting hassled anymore,'' said Orosco.
``I have some friends that got tickets.
They're out like crazy.
The cops just pick on us''.
Most curfews for minors have been upheld in state and federal courts, despite protests from parents, kids and civil rights groups that say the rules are discriminatory and don't include enough exceptions.
In the first U.S.
Supreme Court action of its kind involving curfews, justices allowed police in Charlottesville, Va.
, to continue enforcing their ordinance despite claims the law deprived minors and their parents of their freedoms.
Schroeder also says there appear to be biases against minorities in areas where the curfew is enforced heavily.
``Generally we feel that curfew ordinances are enforced disproportionately in minority areas, like in the Foothill Division, instead of white areas,'' Schroeder said.
``The ordinances should be done in a way that they don't interfere with the rights of kids and they aren't used as an excuse to harass''.
That argument makes sense to Orosco's 19-year-old friend David Misa, even though he's of legal age.
``Sometimes we like to cruise around and just kick it, you know, on Friday and Saturday,'' Misa said.
``But the cops come and bug us, and it gets broken up.
Some people won't even come out because they don't want to get hassled.
``I think the cops are being racist,'' he said.
Heavy enforcement has nothing to do with race, Garner said.
It's about auto thefts, burglaries and gang violence attributed to the region's Pacoima gangsters -- most of the crimes committed by juveniles.
``The curfew has been a great tool, especially at places like Humphrey Park where we were having serious gang problems,'' said Foothill gang Detective Bob Brophy.
``Since we vigorously started enforcing the curfew, the gang problem has dropped''.
Apart from the drop in property crimes, violent crimes fell by 3 percent while the rest of the Valley's divisions have increased.
Foothill Division has issued more than 3,600 citations since mid-1996 -- almost double the amount written by other Valley divisions during the same time.
While the curfew ordinance has been on the books for many years, it didn't begin having an impact until 1996 when heavy enforcement began, said LAPD Juvenile Division Detective David Berglund.
The state changed the penal code in 1996, allowing officers to enforce the ordinance by handing out citations instead of taking kids in and getting wrapped up in delinquency court.
Every juvenile issued a citation must appear in traffic court, and penalties range from community service to between $250 and $675 in fines.

ALBANY, N.Y.
_ Borrowing from a crime-fighting tool used in New York City, Gov.
George Pataki has announced a pilot program designed to help counties share crime data, map trends and nab more criminals.
The program is modeled after New York City's successful Comstat system, which turns dry crime statistics into maps of criminal hot spots.
Within a year, the state hopes to institute a similar data-sharing system among 10 counties, with the hope that this will help the police agencies map county-to-county trends, share resources and confront crime more effectively.
Officials hope to expand the program statewide by 1999.
``Criminals don't abide by jurisdictional borders,'' Pataki, Republican, said in announcing the program Monday.
The pilot program includes the counties that comprise the State Police Troop G area, including Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga and Schenectady counties.
New York City's crime rate has plummeted during the time it has been using the Comstat tracking system, fueling a statistical drop in crime statewide.
Murders dropped by 44 percent statewide between 1995 and 1997 and rapes have declined 15 percent, according to projections made by the Department of Criminal Justice Services.
But not all counties have seen such a dramatic drop.
In Rensselaer County, for example, violent crime increased 33 percent between 1992 and 1996.
Between 1996 and 1997, it jumped another 6 percent, according to the most recent statewide statistics.
The police and prosecutors in some upstate areas have said they fear that as New York City's crime rate drops, criminals move northward, where drugs fetch higher prices.
In 1996, for example, 1,226 of the suspects arrested in Albany said they were born in New York City, up from 644 in 1991, city records show.
A kilo of heroin that sells for as little as $75,000 in New York City can trade for as much as $180,000 in the Albany area.
``There's no doubt that we do get some crime from New York City,'' said Albany Police Chief Kevin Tuffey, adding that the problem of dealing with the criminal commute north was the subject of a law enforcement seminar held two weeks ago in New York City.
``That's what this will help us to track''.
The Pataki administration's pilot program is called the Crime Analysis Partnerships to Upgrade Regional Enforcement, or CAPTURE.
The CAPTURE system, which will cost an estimated $500,000 to start, will enable the police in one area to tap into a program that will tell them if the police in another jurisdiction have encountered a similar crime pattern.
``They (criminals) are moving in the direction of least resistance,'' said Deputy Chief Jack Nielsen of the Albany Police Department.
``This will help tell us where to shore up''.
The details are still being worked out.
But the program may require the state to equip the smaller policing agencies with a computer or a fax machine enabling them to provide data to the state on a weekly or biweekly basis.

DETROIT (AP) -- The city's murder rate, already among the highest in the nation, jumped 16.7 percent in the first half of 1999 -- baffling city leaders who have watched a decline in the number of other serious crimes.
The city recorded 57,736 serious crimes from January through June, a 15.8 percent drop over the same period a year ago.
The largest drop came in larcenies, which were down 25.5 percent, while assaults, auto thefts, burglaries, rapes and robberies also declined.
But murders increased to 224.
Mayor Dennis Archer and Police Chief Benny Napoleon said they were concerned because there was no clear cause and no obvious solution.
The murder rate in the city of 1 million dropped last year.
``I wish we had sufficient police officers that we could put an officer on every corner of the streets where we live,'' Archer said Wednesday.
``The reality is that the homicides that are taking place are taking place behind closed doors''.
Detroit's murder rate still ranks among the highest in the country.
In 1998 Detroit had 429 murders, or 44.2 per 100,000 people, ranking it sixth among U.S. cities with more than 100,000 residents.
In recent years, murder has been the leading cause of death among children and young adults.
Crime has been a sore spot for Detroit leaders for many years.
Safety was often cited as a cause of flight to the suburbs; poverty and drugs were blamed for driving crime rates up.
Making people feel safe was one of Archer's prime goals when he took office in 1994, and since then Detroit's crime rate has gone down, mirroring a national trend.
AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas prison system grew faster than any other in the country over the past decade, and one out of every 20 adults in the state is under the watch of the criminal justice system, according to national study released Monday.
``The sheer numbers of people in prison and jail in Texas are signs of system fixated on punishment and devoid of compassion,'' said Vincent Schiraldi, the director of the Justice Policy Institute of Washington, D.C., and a co-author of the report, ``Texas Tough: An Analysis of Incarceration and Crime Trends in the Lone Star State''.
According to the institute's study, Texas also has the nation's largest populations of probationers and parolees.
The report confirms statistics that have long been known to state criminal justice policy analysts, and several proponents of tough sanctions for lawbreakers said the numbers represent the sentiments of most Texans.
``We didn't have this prison building boom by happenstance,'' said Dianne Clements, president of the crime-victims advocacy group, Justice for All.
``It happened because the citizens and taxpayers who live here every day determined that they would no longer abide a revolving-door prison system.
We realize there is a cost, and we are ready to foot the bill''.
That cost was high and will probably get higher.
In the early 1990s, Texas voters authorized spending $1.7 billion in bonds to triple the size of the state's prison system, which now exceeds 150,000 beds.
When lawmakers return to Austin in January, they will be asked to send a $500 million bond package to the voters for the construction of three maximum-security units.
In all, 163,190 state inmates are in custody in Texas, compared with 163,107 in California, according to the institute, which supports alternatives to prison.
Tony Fabelo, who heads the Texas Criminal Justice Policy Council, which assesses prison needs for state lawmakers, said the institute's figures include inmates housed in low-risk substance-abuse treatment facilities and those in county jails awaiting transfer to state facilities.
Other significant findings: _ The Texas prison population's average annual increase of 11.8 percent during the 1990s was not only the highest growth in the nation, but was almost twice the average annual growth of the other states.
_ If Texas were a country, it would have the highest incarceration rate in the world, easily surpassing that of the United States and Russia, the next two finishers, and would be seven times that of the next biggest prison system in China.
_ Blacks in Texas are incarcerated at seven times the rate of whites, and nearly one in three young African-American men in Texas is under some form of criminal justice control.
The institute is a think tank of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice, and the study was paid for with a grant from the Center on Crime, Communities and Culture.
The groups provide programs for families of inmates and look for other solutions to criminal behavior beyond prisons, such as substance abuse treatment.
The institute determined that Texas added 98,000 inmates to its prison system in the '90s, which is almost 25,000 more inmates than the population of New York's entire system.
Yet, since 1995, New York's decline in crime was four times greater than that of Texas, the study found.
New York and Texas have almost the same population.
According to the study, the crime rate declined much more slowly in Texas than it did in other large states.
From 1993 to 1998, crime in the Lone Star State fell 5.1 percent, half the national average, and the least of any of the nation's five largest states.
``If locking more people up really reduced crime, Texas should have the lowest crime rate in the country,'' said Jason Ziedenberg, another co-author of the study.
``The cost of having one in three young black men under criminal justice control is a steep price to pay for the states' lackluster crime declines''.
But a spokesman for Gov.
George W.
Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, defended the state's criminal justice policies as tough but fair.
``Clearly Texas was right to develop strong laws for dealing with criminal activities and strong laws covering juvenile crime to let them know that there are consequences for their behavior,'' said Bush press aide Mike Jones.
``What the authors of that study might not understand is that Texas also has been very aggressive in using rehabilitation efforts and faith-based organizations to change people's hearts.
The bottom line to all these efforts is that, under Gov.
Bush, Texas has the lowest violent crime rate in 26 years and the lowest murder rate since the 1950s''.
But state Sen.
Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, said Texas should be receptive to critical assessments of its institutions and open to suggestions of policy changes.
``I think it is helpful that groups such as this force us to take a look at impact of our policies,'' Ellis said.
``I firmly believe in punishing those who break the law, but these are some pretty graphic statistics.
``We have to realize that our `lock them up and throw away the key' mentality is costing us a lot of money.
Maybe there is too much emphasis on dealing with criminal justice issues on the back end of life rather than on the front end''.

CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago is the nation's 1998 murder capital, despite experiencing a 10-year low in murders, according to preliminary data from cities nationwide.
Chicago had 698 homicides in 1998, surpassing New York City's homicide totals for the first time ever.
New York has seen a dramatic drop in its homicides.
There were 629 there last year, compared with a 1990 high of 2,262.
When looked at per capita, Chicago's 1998 homicide rate is more than double that of New York.
The bad news comes at a time when Chicago is witnessing a drop in murders.
There were 759 murders there in 1997.
The last year murders numbered less than 700 was 1988, when there were 663.
``One murder is too many, but we are always pleased when the numbers go down,'' Chicago police spokesman Pat Camden said.
He credited the city's community policing program for much of the decline.
But once the final numbers are in, Chicago is expected to again have the highest violent crime rate of the eight largest U.S. cities, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.
Although the city's violent crime rate has dropped consistently in last decade (it dropped 20 percent overall between 1990 and 1997), it still lags behind the other largest cities.
In that same period, New York City cut its violent crime rate 47 percent.
``It is upsetting and very disturbing that we have now passed New York City in the number of murders...,'' said Arthur Lurigio, chairman of the criminal justice department at Loyola University.
``I am at a loss as to why Chicago's reductions are not commensurate to other large cities''.
Poverty levels in Chicago could account for some of the statistics, said James Alan Fox, dean of the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University in Boston.
Meanwhile, Chicago police officials hope their efforts will eventually pay off.
``We are making a long-term investment in our communities, making them places where neighbors feel safe and criminals feel unwelcome,'' Chicago Police Supt.
Terry Hillard said.
``This process may take a little longer, but the long-term rewards are great -- steadily declining crime rates and increased quality of life.''
WASHINGTON _ The nation's overall crime rate in 1997 fell for the sixth consecutive year, with the rate of violent crimes such as murders and robberies showing the sharpest drop, the FBI reported Sunday.
The nation's big cities experienced the steepest decline in their crime rate, with a 5 percent drop, while suburban counties saw a decrease of 4 percent, and rural areas were down 1 percent.
Criminal experts and law enforcement officials attributed the drop to several factors, including the aging of baby boomers, increased incarceration of criminals, declining use of crack, additional police officers and better policing methods.
Overall, the rate of violent crimes fell 4 percent from 1996, helping to push down the overall U.S. crime rate by 3 percent, its lowest level in over a decade, the FBI reported.
Murders fell by more than 7 percent to 18,209.
In the past four years, the murder rate has plummeted by more than 25 percent.
Robberies fell 8 percent, while aggravated assaults and forcible rapes decreased 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively.
``It's definitely continues the trend of good news about crime,'' said James Alan Fox, dean of Northeastern University's College of Criminal Justice.
But Fox cautioned: ``People should remember that these numbers aren't the full story.
In the coming years, these declines could turn quickly''.
Fox and other crime experts said two dominant trends are influencing the nation's crime rate.
First, the aging of the baby boom generation, which makes up 25 percent of the population, has pushed down the number of crimes because adults tend to be less violent than juveniles.
At the same time, the number of crimes committed by teen-agers has risen sharply since the mid-1980s.
The number of murders committed by teen-agers increased 145 percent between 1985 and 1995.
And although the number of violent crimes committed by juveniles has fallen slightly in the past two years, the number of teen-agers will grow quickly over the next decade.
Currently, there are 40 million children under the age of 10 nationwide.
Fox said future crime rates will be determined by how society deals with the rising tide of teen-agers over the next decade.
``Right now, crime rates peak in the couple of hours between the end of school and when most parents get home for dinner,'' he said.
``That tells you that our children are not getting enough supervision from their parents''.
At a press conference Thursday, Attorney General Janet Reno warned Americans not to ``relax their vigilance about crime, about enforcement, about prevention''.
She said the large number of people growing through their teens and early 20s over the next decade presents law enforcement officials with a challenge, but that these kids do not have to become criminals.
``We've got to make sure, as we have more young people, that we have more programs for them, more opportunities to give them a strong and positive future,'' Reno said.
All regions of the country saw crime rates fall in 1997, with the Northeast experiencing the largest drop, 5 percent, the FBI report said.
The crime rate in the West and South declined nearly 3 percent, while the Midwest saw a drop of 2 percent.
The FBI report also said the rate of property crimes, burglaries and larceny fell 3 percent, while the rate of motor vehicle thefts dropped 4 percent.
&QL; (STORY COULD END HERE.

&QL; The report noted that 65 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty during 1997, nine more than in 1996.
Of the slain officers, 34 worked for city police departments, 20 for county police and sheriff's offices, 9 for state agencies and 2 for federal agencies.
In 1997, the South was by far the most dangerous region for law enforcement officers.
Thirty-two officers were killed in that part of the country last year, twice as many as next highest region, the West, where 15 officers were slain.
Eleven officers were killed in the Midwest and seven in the Northeast.
LOWER GRANITE DAM, Wash.
_ The big hydroelectric dam sits deep in a valley framed by softly rounded, grass-covered mountains that look from a distance as if they have been sanded down and then covered with beige and blond velvet.
Great expanses of sun-dappled blue water, more reservoir or lake than river, stretch above and below the concrete-and-earth barrier.
That is part of the problem.
The once fast-flowing Snake River is now so slow, and Lower Granite Dam so much of an impediment, that salmon _ totem fish of the Pacific Northwest and the focus of a landmark political, economic and environmental struggle _ cannot migrate up and down the Snake without the help of an elaborate man-made Rube Goldberg-like system.
So it was on a recent day as a state fisheries biologist, Fred Mensik, plucked a silvery, six-inch fish from water speeding through a trough.
``Chinook,'' Mensik said, identifying it as a member of the heftiest of the salmon species.
If it lives long enough, the juvenile smolt, as it is called, could grow to 3 or 4 feet and 40 pounds or more.
Mensik measured the fish, entered the information into a laptop computer and returned the fish to the trough, where it joined other smolts and migrating young steelhead (sea-run rainbow trout) on their way to a tank truck parked outside.
The truck would transport the juvenile fish nearly 250 miles downriver, past seven other dams in the Columbia River system, of which the Snake is a part.
There the fish were released to resume a trip to the Pacific Ocean.
While Mensik and his co-workers were shepherding the fish downstream, adult salmon and steelhead _ big, powerful veterans of years at sea _ were climbing a fish ladder a few feet away, heading upstream to spawn and die.
But there are so few going back upstream that all these fish, along with all other salmon and steelhead that spawn in the Snake River, are listed as imperiled under the Endangered Species Act.
Will the elaborate, two-decade-old system for moving fish around the dams prove inadequate to save the salmon?
The question is at the heart of a tense debate over whether to continue to rely on the transportation system or junk it and remove the earthen portions of Lower Granite and three other hydroelectric dams on the lower Snake.
Breaching the dams would help restore the natural flow along a 140-mile stretch of the river, and many scientists say it would be the single most effective remedy for the salmon's plight.
The concrete portions of the dams, their humming turbines silenced, would become relics; abandoned monuments to a time when the only consideration was to conquer and harness nature, and to the dawn of an era in which coexisting with nature has been made a priority.
A decision on the dams, driven by a federal lawsuit brought by environmentalists, was expected by early next year.
If the Clinton administration proposes breaching the dams, the issue would then go to Congress, which must appropriate the money.
Few if any conservation problems match this one for scale and complexity, or for its many connections with the modern economy.
``The salmon involves our whole way of doing things,'' said Dr.
Peter M.
Kareiva, an ecologist who is directing a scientific assessment of the problem for the National Marine Fisheries Service.
``There is no simple, easily defined enemy''.
Many scientists and environmentalists say the question of whether to breach the dams is a no-brainer.
They argue that the population of the Snake River salmon began to decline after the dams were built in the 1960s and 1970s, and that while the system for trucking and barging fish downstream and helping adults back up may have helped, it is inadequate.
``Prior to completion of the lower Snake River dams, Snake River stocks did as well or better than their downriver counterparts,'' said Ed Bowles, a scientist who is the salmon and steelhead recovery manager for the state of Idaho, which contains the Snake's watershed upstream of the four dams.
``Since completion of the dams, we have every year done much worse''.
But other scientists, particularly those of the marine fisheries service, say the situation is more complicated.
The service's studies, which are being reviewed by an independent panel, suggest that while breaching the dams may be necessary to save some salmon stocks, it will not be enough.
The wild salmon population has also been hurt by the destruction and degradation of spawning areas, overfishing and the introduction of hatchery-bred salmon and trout, according to the analysis.
(Only about 20 percent of Snake River salmon today are the progeny of wild fish).
Unless these problems are solved, the analysis suggested, the wild salmon and trout will probably continue to decline, even if the dams are breached.
Breaching ``is not going to be a silver bullet,'' said Dr.
Michelle McClure, a biologist with the fisheries service who is helping to conduct the federal analysis.
Moreover, said the fisheries service, which will draft the scientific opinion on which the decision about the dams will be based, the latest evidence suggests that trucking and barging young fish is more effective than was previously thought.
Whether that is true should become clear in 5 or 10 years, scientists with the fisheries service said.
One option, they said, would be to wait.
But other experts, including Bowles, said the answer was as apparent now as it would ever be.
The fisheries service said any delay would increase the likelihood that some stocks of Snake River salmon would become extinct.
Pacific salmon are different from Atlantic salmon in that there are several species, and that different populations spawn at different times.
Moreover, they spawn only once and then die (Atlantic salmon, and steelhead, can return to the ocean and spawn again, several times).
Conservation efforts have focused not so much on entire species of Pacific salmon as on specific stocks, a group of fish that spawn in the same locality, like a specific creek. nn
SEATTLE _ Buoyed by ad hoc accords that have boosted salmon spawning in both Puget Sound and British Columbia rivers, Washington Gov.
Gary Locke and Canada's fisheries minister, David Anderson, say this is the year to resolve the U.S.-Canada fisheries dispute up and down the Pacific Coast.
``If we cannot deal with problems on this coast, what hope is there for dealing with the crisis of overfishing worldwide''?
Anderson asked Thursday in a Seattle speech to the World Affairs Council.
He echoed the optimism of Vice President Al Gore, who said in a February interview that the United States will make a major push this year to reach a long-term fisheries agreement with Canada.
And Locke, encouraged by results of interim accords, said: ``It is time to come to a long-term U.S.-Canada agreement that focuses on recovery of salmon in all of our rivers''.
Anderson and Locke celebrated a trio of two-way deals that have made an immediate, positive impact on several of the Northwest's most imperiled salmon runs.
Washington agreed last June to restrict the recreational catch of coho salmon bound for the Thompson River in British Columbia, and later to hold off the start of fishing for sockeye salmon bound for the Stuart River.
In turn, the Canadians cut back ocean fishing off Vancouver Island for Puget Sound-bound chinook and coho salmon.
The result has been much higher numbers of adult spawning salmon _ particularly imperiled spring chinook salmon in the region.
``We successfully concentrated on finding a solution rather than apportioning the blame,'' Locke said.
Locke and leaders of local governments in the region face a big challenge in the recent listing of Puget Sound-area salmon under the Endangered Species Act.
The listing is likely to require multiple measures to improve spawning habitat.
But, Anderson maintained, money done to nurture salmon in streams will be wasted drain unless conservation measures are taken at sea.
``The other half of the equation is to get adult salmon back from the Pacific Ocean to their spawning beds,'' said Anderson, a longtime conservationist who represents Victoria in Canada's House of Commons.
Over the past five years, the fishing dispute has repeatedly disrupted U.S.-Canadian relations.
In 1994, Canada's fisheries ministry slapped a $1,100 ``licensing fee'' on Alaska-bound U.S. fishing boats using waters of British Columbia's Inside Passage.
Two years ago, British Columbia Premier Glen Clark tried to have U.S. submarines barred from a torpedo testing range on Vancouver Island.
In the summer of 1997 a blockade by B.C. fishing boats prevented the Alaska Ferry ``Malaspina'' from leaving the dock in Prince Rupert.
However, the past year has seen a major change of policy and attitude in Canada.
Instead of hammering at historic inequities in the salmon catch _ U.S.-fishermen catch millions of salmon bound for Canadian rivers _ Anderson has put heavy emphasis on conservation.
He moved last year to curtail fishing of coho salmon.
Instead of the two-five million coho salmon caught annually by B.C. commercial fishermen in the mid-1990s, only 100,000 coho were caught by all fisheries _ commercial, sport and native _ in 1998.
``Confrontation makes everyone poorer,'' Anderson said Thursday.
``Our constituencies are tired of arguments over who would kill the last fish''.
Anderson's policy has met with opposition from the British Columbia government and the United Fishermen and Allied Workers Union.
But his strategy has proven as popular a cause in British Columbia as the restoration of salmon is south of the border.
``Salmon are a totem of this part of the world,'' he said.
``Salmon are also the canary in the mine as far as the condition of our environment.
If salmon are okay in our streams...
the environment must be all right''.
Locke agreed, calling salmon ``the very definition of the Pacific Northwest''.
Anderson said technical discussions between Canadian fisheries experts and their Alaska counterparts ``are going surprisingly well ...
I believe we can get to an agreement this year.''
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heard of crash test dummies?
Now there's a crash test salmon.
Engineers on Wednesday unveiled Flubber, a six-inch rubbery replica of a young salmon packed with wires and sensors.
The fake fish will spurt through the churning, 10-foot-long blades of the McNary hydropower dam on the Washington-Oregon border next month to measure how salmon are jostled, scraped and even killed on their treacherous journey downstream.
``The idea is to document with data what fish experience,'' said George Hecker, president of Alden Research Laboratory Inc.
in Holden, Mass.
The synthetic salmon was developed at the Department of Energy's Richland, Wash.
, lab as part of a five-year, $8 million government effort to make hydropower dams more fish friendly.
Government scientists and some corporate partners, including Alden and Voith Hydro Power Generation of York, Pa.
, want to use the Flubber data and studies of real salmon to make better turbines.
So far, the faux fish seems up to the job.
It has been tested with a sledgehammer, a lighted candle and intense water pressure, said Bennie Rinehart, an engineer with Lockheed Martin Idaho Technologies Co.
, which helped finance the project.
``Everything is working real good,'' he said.
Industry experts say 90 percent of the fish that pass through a dam turbine survives.
But with many salmon forced to go through and around eight large dams on the Snake and Columbia Rivers, the overall survival rate can be as low as 60 percent.
By changing the turbines' shape, the survival rate at a dam could rise to 98 percent, said Diane Lear, a Voith Hydro administrator.
In the Pacific Northwest, 16 salmon species are considered threatened or endangered, and Congress has authorized more than $100 million a year on attempts to bring them back.
Environmentalists consider most of these attempts expensive failures and are pushing for the partial removal of four Snake River dams.
But even a harsh critic of government salmon efforts, Justin Hayes of American Rivers, said it may have something useful in Flubber.
OTTAWA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today called on the United States to "return in good faith to negotiations" aimed at solving the Pacific salmon dispute.
Canada suspended talks on May 21 when the U.S. negotiator was unable to advance a position on one of the key southern issues, Fraser River sockeye.
"I am contacting U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright today to urge that the United States send its chief negotiator back to the table with a mandate to reach agreement on the dispute," said Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
He emphasized that "barring an immediate return to negotiations, we will consider further options.
Any further steps we take must be aimed at resuming negotiations--not detracting from them".
"On May 21, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans stepped up enforcement of measures requiring foreign vessels to contact Canadian authorities as they pass through Canadian waters," said Fisheries and Oceans Minister Fred Mifflin.
The Canadian Minister added that his country will assess the impact of these measures in the near future to determine their effectiveness.
Under the Department of Fisheries and Oceans regulations, vessels that violated the regulations can be inspected, required to go to a Canadian port or face arrest, depending on circumstances.
U.S. vessels going to and from the Alaskan Fishery are subject to these regulations.
The talks to end the four-year deadlock in the Pacific Salmon Treaty involve reducing the high levels of U.S. interception of salmon heading through Alaskan waters in Canadian waters to breed, and a balanced reduction in Canadian and American interception each other's salmon stocks farther south off Vancouver Island, in the Fraser River and Straits of Juan de Fuca.
Canadian officials say Canada has honored its treaty obligations to take a limited share of West Coast commercial salmon stocks.
But the U.S.
Alaskan catch, the officials say, has been continuously excessive and has reached a 500-million U.S. dollars imbalance in favor of the United States since 1985.
WASHINGTON (AP -- Rising ocean temperatures, perhaps caused by global climate change, are threatening to push salmon out of their Pacific Ocean habitat, two marine biologist said today, citing as early evidence the decline in Alaska salmon.
``Whether the changes are related to global warming is not statistically clear, but it's what appears to be happening,'' said Jim Barry, a marine biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California.
The scientists said at a news conference that warmer ocean waters in the Pacific has caused a much higher mortality rate among salmon.
It also has produced a dramatic shift in plankton species that has interfered in food supplies for marine life and seabirds, they said.
``We don't fully realize what's happening...
but these are the sort of events we expect from global warming,'' said David Welch, head of the salmon research project for the Canadian National Department of Fisheries.
Welch, who is based in British Columbia, said he is convinced that ocean warming reflects broader climate change and raises the possibility of ``large-scale potential changes in the marine ecosystem''.
While scientists agree the oceans have become warmer, the reasons remain in dispute.
Some scientists argue it reflects broader climate change as a result of heat trapping pollution, but others say it simply reflects cyclical temperature changes, including the El Nino phenomenon.
Whatever the reason, higher ocean temperatures already have had dramatic impact on Pacific salmon fisheries, the two biologists said at a news conference sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund and the Marine Conservation Biology Institute.
Welch cited as clear evidence of concern the dramatic decline in Alaska's Pacific salmon population in 1997 and again last year.
Salmon returning to swim up the Fraser River in British Columbia have been fewer in number and much smaller than in years past, he said.
And the in-river mortality rate among salmon returning to spawn soared to 76 percent in 1997, he said.
Welch attributed the smaller fish and high death rate to the warmer ocean waters that, he said, sapped the salmon of their energy and strength.
``We're starting to see a very troubling perspective on this,'' he said.
The biologists said the high sea temperatures in 1997 and 1998 produced a rate bloom of phytoplankton in the northern Pacific waters typical of waters closer to the equator, causing changes in the food chain.
The reduced size of returning salmon and the decrease in overall numbers ``suggests large-scale starvation,'' they said.
Welch said that if the warming continues as part of a broader global climate change, the salmon as a species may be forced northward into the Bering Sea, abandoning their traditional Pacific habitat.
While that may still be 40 or 50 years in the future, ``the early stages are already here,'' he argued.
As for those who argue that the sea temperature rise may only be cyclical, Welch said that the last El Nino was the strongest ever recorded and the frequency of El Nino events has increased, suggesting a broader climate change.
``What we're seeing now is unprecedented,'' agreed Barry .
WASHINGTON _ On the west coast of Canada's Hudson Bay, fewer and fewer polar bears are being born each year.
In the Maldive Islands, coral are bleaching and then dying.
And in the North Pacific, sockeye salmon seem to be losing weight.
These are a few of the signs that scientists say point to an increasingly inescapable conclusion: global warming is threatening marine life worldwide.
In a report scheduled for release Tuesday, the Redmond, Wash-based Marine Conservation Biology Institute and the World Wildlife Fund declare that ``global climate change is an additional stress on already stressed species, and may be the straw that breaks the camel's back for many types of marine life''.
The scientists did not do new research, but pulled together a variety of academic studies conducted in recent years in an effort to show a broad picture of the effects of global warming.
``The news is not good,'' said Elliott Norse, the biologist who heads the Marine Conservation Biology Institute.
``The thing that screams out here is that from the inter-tidal zone to the open ocean, from the Antarctic to the Arctic, we are seeing worrisome things everywhere that seem to be most closely correlated with climate change''.
Norse offered a variety of recent examples of the impacts of global warming, from the encroachment of subalpine firs into the alpine meadows on Mount Rainier, to the marlin caught off Longview, Wash.
, to the appearance of Pacific dolphins off the Aleutian islands.
Even the recent spate of emaciated gray whales beaching themselves along the West Coast may be attributable to global warming, he said.
In virtually every example, Norse said, species such as fish or bears or whales appear to be suffering from a lack of food that is connected to a warming of the ocean.
Polar bears, for example, seem to be suffering from a decline in the amount of sea ice, which is a source of algae that form the lowest rung on the bears' food chain.
' The report says the Alaskan salmon population declined drastically in 1997 and 1998, and that salmon that survive are unusually small, suggesting that they were starved.
The report says that sockeye are particularly susceptible to temperature variations.
``Researchers predict that anticipated increases in water temperature caused by a double of carbon dioxide will eliminate most, if not all, suitable habitat for Pacific sockeye salmon, and possibly for other salmon species as well,'' the report says.
The report was greeted skeptically by critics of global warming science.
``This doesn't surprise me, because they blame everything on global warming from tornadoes to droughts to heat waves,'' said John Carlisle, director of the environmental policy task force for The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank.
``But there is no firm evidence that man-made global warming is even occurring.
The fact is that the Earth's temperature is naturally fluctuating''.
Frank Maisano, a spokesman for an alliance of businesses called the Global Climate Coalition, said environmentalists are too quick to use unproven theories and circumstantial evidence to bolster claims of damage from global warning.
But Norse said the evidence that global warming is harming marine life is overwhelming.
``Whether the warming we have been seeing is caused by people is unclear, but that is by far the most logical explanation for the fact that the weather is the warmest it's been for thousands of years,'' Norse said.
``The evidence is so strong, it's almost like the evidence for gravity.
The people who deny it are denying it for reasons that are not scientific or substantive, but because it goes against their beliefs or economic interests''.
Global warming is the change in the climate thought to occur because human activities add to a buildup of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.
Those gases trap heat, and although there is ongoing dispute about how that in turn affects the climate, there is no doubt that global temperatures are rising.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, over the past century mean global temperatures have increased 0.6 to 1.2 degrees, the global sea level has risen 4 to 10 inches, and the snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere and floating ice in the Arctic Ocean have decreased.
The 10 warmest years of this century have occurred within the past 15 years.
What to do about global warming is controversial, both in Congress and in the international policy arena.
World diplomats meeting in Bonn have been bogged down in a dispute between the United States and Europe over how to address global warming.
And the Clinton administration has yet to ask Congress to approve the Kyoto Protocol it signed in 1997, saying that it is waiting for more developing countries to sign onto the pact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The report also comes at a time when residents of the Northwest and the country are already spending millions of dollars and facing potential restrictions in development in order to address other factors thought to be harming Pacific salmon, such as overfishing, dams and hatcheries.
OTTAWA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States announced here Thursday that they have reached an agreement on the elements of a ten-year accord to conserve and manage Pacific salmon.
The agreement represents a victory for all those on both sides of the border interested in salmon conservation and the long-term viability of their salmon industries, said Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Alberight in a joint statement issued here Thursday.
The comprehensive agreement, reached through vigorous diplomacy among the responsible parties, is designed to ensure the sustentation of the five Pacific salmon species through a combination of scientific co-operation, in addition to providing new funds to improve fisheries management and aid recovery of weakened salmon stocks.
The agreement is also necessary to limit on salmon catches, said the joint statement.
Under the accord, the U.S. will provide 142 million U.S. dollars to a conservation fund to help rebuild stocks and habitat on both sides of the border.
It is a good deal because conservation means more fish for the future, said Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson.
The U.S. catch of Fraser River salmon will be limited under 16.
5 percent, down from an historical average of about 20 percent, while U.S. fishermen took 25 percent last year.
The Pacific Salmon treaty was first negotiated in 1985 to divide the salmon catch between U.S. and Canadian fishermen based on how many fish were spawned in each country.
However, sections that dictated how to do that expired in 1992.
Since then, there have been a series of failed and sometimes hostile negotiations for a new agreement.
WENATCHEE, Wash.
_ Operators of three Columbia River dams have agreed with the Clinton administration on a 50-year preservation plan that may provide a model for how the Pacific Northwest goes about saving its endangered salmon.
The major requirement is that the dams be operated with no net loss of salmon.
It is the product of four years of negotiations involving dam-owning utilities, the National Marine Fisheries Service, Indian tribes and a key conservation group.
The plan mandates that 91 percent of the young salmon migrating downstream survive through each dam and reservoir.
The Chelan and Douglas County Public Utility Districts, the operators of the dams, will make up for any salmon mortality by production at hatcheries, and by an ambitious program of enhancing salmon habitat in river systems draining the east slope of the Cascades.
``The key is that the plan sets standards, and the federal government leaves it to the utilities to figure out how to achieve these goals.
They know what can work best at each dam,'' said Terry Garcia, assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and the atmosphere.
The habitat plan covers Rock Island, Rocky Reach and Wells dams.
The dams are owned by the two Central Washington utilities, but supply electricity to Puget Sound Energy.
``There isn't a single federally owned dam in the Columbia River system that is meeting these performance standards.
This is going to be a model,'' said Lorraine Bodi of American Rivers, a conservation group that worked on the plan.
With freedom to tailor fish protection to their dams, Chelan and Douglas PUD managers have tried out ideas large and small _ as can be seen at Rocky Reach Dam north of Wenatchee.
The reservoir above the dam has pipes and diverters for a $12.9 million, prototype fish collector.
If it works, a $50 million permanent collector will be installed to attract young salmon and send them around the dam.
Inside the dam's powerhouse, turbines are being redesigned to eliminate an indentation that was pinching and cutting into young salmon.
Below the dam, nearly invisible stainless steel wires are strung across the river.
The cables keep away the fish-eating seagulls that usually flock to the turbulent waters below dams on the Columbia River.
Government employees also use starter pistols and bottle rockets to drive away predator birds.
``Of the salmon that go through our turbines, 5 percent are killed.
The other 95 come out stunned and disoriented.
What we are trying to do is remove predators while fish get their bearings,'' said Dick Nason, executive director of corporate services at the Chelan County PUD.
The Chelan PUD discovered that thousands of young salmon were passing alive through Rocky Reach, but disappearing in a 300-yard stretch between the dam and two trees along the west bank.
They were providing a feast for squawfish.
``The first thing we did was go out and hire eight college and high school kids at $7.50 an hour,'' said Nason.
``They fished for eight weeks and pulled 10,000 squawfish out of the river''.
The utility has since financed Rotary Club fish derbies, and prevailed on the Agriculture Department to include squawfish in a predator-control program.
Keeping the predators away is vital, as can be seen elsewhere on the Columbia River.
Birds and predator fish below Bonneville Dam have devoured more than 20 percent of the young salmon emerging from the outfall of the dam's second powerhouse.
South of Wenatchee, at Rock Island Dam, most young salmon go safely down the dam's spillways.
Built in 1933, Rock Island was the first major dam on the main Columbia River, and is only half as high as its upstream neighbor Rocky Reach.
While the conservation plan governs dams in Central Washington, it has wide-ranging implications around the Northwest.
They include: _Assured power: A big chunk of the electricity from the projects is transmitted across the mountains.
A long-term agreement and what Garcia calls ``a no-surprises policy'' will guarantee continued power generation at the dams.
_All species: The plan governs all species of salmon and steelhead, from the relatively healthy sockeye salmon runs of Lake Osoyoos and Lake Wenatchee to the endangered spring chinook salmon.
``The no-net-loss policy applies to spring, summer and fall chinook, sockeye salmon, steelhead and coho salmon if the tribes successfully re-introduce this species,'' said Bill Dobbins, manager of the Douglas County PUD.
_A possible model: Faced with federal listing of salmon under the Endangered Species Act, Western Washington counties may combine their salmon-recovery efforts into a giant urban Habitat Conservation Plan.
``If the players can get together, write their own plan, and set in place a degree of certainty _ while assuring survival of the salmon, everybody can emerge as a winner,'' said Sen.
Patty Murray, D-Wash.
The agreement on the Columbia River ``represents the future of the Endangered Species Act; this is how to achieve recovery with flexibility,'' Garcia said.
Each dam on the Columbia River has its own design and hydrology.
Some are more easily modified than others.
Wells, the newest of the utilities' dams, has a unique structure in which the power plant is located in the middle of the dam.
The spillways are on top of the turbines.
By accident of design, it has become most fish-friendly dam on the Columbia.
The utility has installed a vertical slot in the middle of the dam.
It takes most salmon through the dam, underneath the spillway, and deposits them downstream.
A few salmon do go through the turbines.
``Overall we figure we have a mortality rate of just 1.2 percent of the salmon that pass through our project,'' said Robert Clubb, the Douglas PUD's chief of environmental and regulatory services.
The enthusiasm and ingenuity of the two utilities has impressed Bodi of American Rivers.
As a senior federal fisheries attorney, she crossed swords with the Chelan PUD in the mid-1980s over the relicensing of Rock Island Dam.
But after losing a legal battle that reached the U.S.
Supreme Court, the utility began to consult its critics.
``They made a decision early on to work with tribes and conservation agencies,'' Bodi said.
The habitat plan is to be signed June 27.
Supporters hope for the broadest possible support, with Indian tribes and American Rivers signing along with federal agencies and the two public utility districts.
But prospects for that are clouded.
The Yakama, Colville and Umatilla Indians helped negotiate the agreement.
But they are locked in a dispute with the National Marine Fisheries Service over harvesting standards and hatchery enhancement of endangered fish stocks.
``The assumption is that this will be worked out before the signing,'' Bodi said.
``I'm not so sure.
If the tribes feel they can't sign the plan, I won't sign it''.
The Grant County PUD, which owns Wanapum and Priest Rapids dams on the mid-Columbia River, has backed away from the habitat plan.
``Chelan and Douglas are signing a plan that our engineering people have advised us is virtually impossible for us to meet,'' said Don Godard, manager of the Grant PUD.
Instead of a sweeping agreement, Godard said, the utility will do ``a step-by-step process'' with federal fisheries managers and Indian tribes.
``The difference is that Chelan and Douglas have agreed to a process, which leaves them free to decide how to meet standards,'' he added.
``In our case, we will be working with the tribes and agencies to reach agreement on specific actions.''
WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal salmon proposal unveiled last month was supposed to be good news for loggers, developers and other industries in four states.
The plan offers exemptions from new federal salmon regulations, as long as the industries abide by certain state and local rules in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California.
But some business leaders see big problems instead of a great deal.
The same proposal that carves out exemptions also says people who kill, harm or harass 14 threatened salmon populations or their habitat could face one year in jail and a $50,000 fine.
Business owners who have grown used to the idea of land restrictions because of salmon problems say the prospect of stiff penalties -- even for indirectly hurting the fish -- is going too far.
"Northwesterners are now at the mercy of federal officials, accountable to no one, and many northwesterners will dare not offend them," James Buchal, a Portland, Ore.
, attorney who represents businesses on salmon issues, wrote in a critique of the plan.
The proposal announced Dec.
14 will indeed result in more endangered species prosecutions, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service.
But the prosecutions will be limited and targeted at the most egregious violators who destroy salmon habitat, dump toxic chemicals in rivers and apply pesticides so that they harm streams, agency officials said.
The Fisheries Service has neither the staff nor desire to aggressively track down all violators across the 159,000 square miles the plan covers, they said.
But the new proposal signals that the agency is serious about recovering the fish, said Garth Griffin, a fisheries service biologist in Portland.
"If something is listed, it's serious," Griffin said.
"It has the possibility of sometime going extinct".
Under the Endangered Species Act, people who harm any of the nation's 934 endangered species -- plants and animals in danger of becoming extinct -- could face jail time or fines.
Under most circumstances, people who do the damage are not exempt from possible penalties unless they get a federal permit allowing them to "take," or harm a species.
But the ESA does not extend the penalties to 263 threatened species, including many of the listed salmon stocks in the Pacific Northwest.
(Threatened species are defined as likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future).
In Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California, 20 of the 26 salmon populations listed under the ESA are threatened.
The other six are endangered.
The Fish and Wildlife Service, the federal agency primarily responsible for enforcing the ESA, wrote regulations that make penalties identical for threatened and endangered species.
But the Fisheries Service, which enforces the ESA for salmon, has no such regulations.
Instead the agency decides when crafting rules for individual listings whether harming a threatened species should carry ESA penalties.
The Fisheries Service's announcement on Dec.
14 was the first indication that the agency intends to require penalties under new rules for 14 threatened salmon stocks.
"That's clearly a concern," said Laura Cleland of the Independent Forest Products Association in Portland, saying some landowners worry about being targeted by the agency.
But Griffin said the Fisheries Service's decision should not have been a surprise.
The agency calls for penalties in most rules it promulgates for threatened species, he said.
If the newly proposed rules are adopted, harming 24 of the 26 salmon populations in the four states could result in a penalty.
The Fisheries Service has not yet drafted rules for the other two populations because they were listed in September.
Still, Fisheries Service prosecutions for ESA violations have been rare in the Pacific Northwest.
The agency brought just 19 cases against alleged endangered species violators in the region in the fiscal year that ended Sept.
30. That was down from 23 prosecutions in 1998.
Environmentalists say landowners probably don't have much to worry about in terms of Fisheries Service enforcement under the new rules.
While the rules call for penalties, the Fisheries Service has not specifically said which activities -- such as logging too close to a stream, or dumping fertilizer into a stream -- will most quickly draw prosecutions.
That has caused confusion, said Daniel Hall, director of the forest biodiversity program at American Lands Alliance in Portland.
The agency "is telling landowners to be scared, but they're not telling them what to be scared of," Hall said.
Meanwhile, the Fisheries Service plans 22 hearings on the proposed rules, which begin Jan.
10 in Portland and run through Feb.
3 in San Luis Obispo, Calif.
The rules could become final in June 2000.
SEATTLE _ Headlines report a $400 million effort to save salmon on the Columbia and Snake rivers.
Others announce that the United States and Canada agree on an urgent plan to rescue salmon runs in Washington, Oregon and British Columbia.
Still others tell readers there are other threats to Pacific Northwest salmon, such as Caspian terns feasting on young salmon in Washington rivers.
Now, the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute says consumers are confused about whether it is OK for them to eat salmon because they fear threatening and endangering the fish.
Alaska salmon is different, they say, and they have begun a $250,000 public relations campaign to carry their message to consumers.
An in-depth research project conducted for the institute indicates that consciencous Americans _ including many in the Pacific Northwest _ don't know Alaska salmon isn't threatened or endangered, said Barbara Belknap, the institute's executive director.
``How ironic it would be if Americans quit eating all-natural salmon, thinking it was endangered _ as has happened with tuna and swordfish _ when last year 150 million Alaska salmon were harvested and 100 million more made it upstream to spawn,'' she said.
``It's important to us that people understand we're sensitive to the fisheries problems in the Pacific Northwest and we don't want to come off as saying we got salmon and you don't.
We are aware and concerned''.
Researchers who conducted interviews in Seattle, New York, Atlanta and Chicago found that people, especially in Seattle, were aware of the threats to salmon runs.
But they were lumping Alaska salmon with problems in Oregon and Washington fisheries, she said.
``People in Seattle especially are very sophisticated salmon buyers and they would go into the supermarket and see the case filled with salmon but they were concerned,'' Belknap said.
``We wanted to conduct an education campaign before it began to affect sales.
We wanted to be pro-active''.
Among information distributed by the institute are these items: _No salmon stock of Alaska origin is threatened or endangered.
_Alaska has only three dams in the entire state and more than 15,000 salmon streams.
_Alaska's seafood industry, much of it operated by owners of small boats, is the state's largest private employer.
Scott Marshall, a fisheries biologist and regional supervisor at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said Alaska has had ``nearly 15 years of record commercial salmon catches and last year it declined a bit back down to a normal level''.
Alaska has programs assuring salmon management and escapement and balancing the catch against the escapement, he said.
Alaska's salmon rivers are pristine and free of dams, he said.
Fresh and ocean waters offer excellent habitat for salmon, and Alaska, with a statewide population of about 600,000, is thousands of miles away from large sources of pollution.
Curt Smitch, Washington Gov.
Gary Locke's special assistant for natural resources, said it is accurate that the public is confused about salmon, the differences between distinct runs and differences in habitat.
``I think that they (Alaska fisheries management experts) try to do a good job and manage their escapement goals and most of their watershed doesn't have the damage we do from hydro dams and habitat, although they are moving in that direction in some of their more urban areas,'' Smitch said.
``In one sense, their (Alaska's) stocks are in pretty good shape.
But during the last round of negotiations on the U.S. and Canada treaty, it was stated that in Southeast Alaska, the chinook that they are fishing aren't their fish.
They came from Washington and Oregon''.
The Pacific Management Council is managing the harvest of fish to better match escapement from sources in Alaska, British Columbia, Washington and Oregon, Smitch said.
Scientists have reached a tentative consensus that dam-breaching offers by far the best chance of restoring strong Snake River salmon runs.
But like so much in the Columbia Basin salmon debate, this conclusion is neither simple nor certain.
Science, in short, offers policy-makers gamblers' odds, not answers _ and the 20-year debate over Columbia Basin fish runs grinds on.
The broadest analysis to date comes from about two dozen Northwest scientists, Indian tribes, federal agencies and other groups.
The scientists' effort, called the Program for Analysis and Testing of Hypotheses (PATH), analyzed options for improving salmon and steelhead survival in the lower Snake River.
The team used sophisticated mathematical models and was reviewed by four leading scientists from outside the region.
Under every modeled scenario, the virtual fish fared better without dams than with them, even with extra efforts to barge or divert salmon past the dams.
With dams bypassed, the simulations showed spring and summer chinook salmon runs recovering to healthy numbers in about a half-century some 80 percent of the time, compared with half the time with the dams in place.
The healthy margin remained large even if dams were made more fish-friendly by boosting water flows or barging young fish.
Environmental groups greeted the simulation results prepared by the panel of independent scientists as decisive.
``It is fairly clear that under virtually all assumptions, dam removal is the only option that meets both the survival and recovery goals,'' said Tim Stearns of Save Our Wild Salmon.
But Wednesday, in a broad review of the science, the National Marine Fisheries Service cautioned that the apparent advantage of breaching could evaporate.
Under a small minority of the computer simulations, dam-breaching appeared to afford ``negligible advantages,'' said the review's director, Peter Kareiva.
Moreover, he said, tentative new findings hint the dam-breaching advantage may be overstated.
The PATH report assumed that salmon that are barged through the lower Snake River dams are considerably less likely to survive a round-trip to the Pacific Ocean than non-barged fish.
Initial returns from a new line of research tend to show that barged fish actually may return almost as well as those that migrate freely.
If that tentative finding proves right, the mathematical advantage of dam-breaching over other salmon improvements would drop from 30 percent to a more modest 11 percent, the Fisheries Service said.
If barging doesn't weaken fish at all, the edge drops to a negligible 2 percent.
Those caveats aside, the Marine Fisheries Service confirmed that ``breaching meets recovery and survival goals over the widest range and highest proportion of assumptions'' for the spring-summer chinook, the best-known and most numerous salmon the Snake River.
And it appears even more advantageous for fall chinook, though less is known about that run.
Scientists said more study might answer questions about barging.
But delay has risk, too.
If dam operations remained unchanged for 24 years, scientists calculated that the chance of fish runs going practically extinct would rise about 8 percent.
The decline of Snake River salmon has been sharp since the lower Snake River dams went up in the 1960s and 1970s.
Spring and summer chinook, which numbered about 1.5 million a century ago, have fallen to less than 10,000 fish.
The main problem generally isn't with returning adult salmon, but with juveniles.
As they pass the dams on their migration to the sea, young salmon are bumped and scraped, injured by water pressure fluctuations, and exposed to lethal levels of nitrogen gas in the water below the dams.
In reservoirs, they are exposed to water that is too warm for them, and delays getting to sea may affect how they survive in salt water.
Dam defenders say these problems have been reduced and the practice of collecting young salmon in the upper Snake River and barging them below Bonneville Dam on the Washington-Oregon border is an effective antidote.
But decades of extensive barging of fish have failed to reverse the salmon decline.
Last month, 200 scientists signed a letter drafted by an Idaho environmental group urging President Clinton to lower the Snake River to natural-river level to save salmon and steelhead runs.
They included two current members and one former member of an influential group of scientists that advise the Northwest Power Planning Council.
The letter concluded: ``Enough time remains to restore them, but only if the failed practices of the past are abandoned and we move quickly to restore the normative river conditions under which these fish evolved''.
But dam supporters _ and some scientists _ loudly disagree.
Bruce Lovelin, director of the Columbia River Alliance, a consortium of dam-dependent businesses, claimed that the PATH study underemphasized evidence that dams and barging may not be as harmful to fish as in the past.
Lovelin dismissed many scientists as advocates for breaching.
And so do many audiences in Eastern Washington.
When federal biologist Tom Cooney explained the panel's findings in Pasco, Wash.
, in January, he was derided by his audience.
``You're using assumptions as facts, weighting the inputs the way you want so the dams need to be removed,'' one elderly man said.
&LR; &LR; SACRAMENTO _ Government officials, conservation groups and private landowners announced an ambitious plan to revive California's beleaguered salmon fisheries Monday, claiming it points to a new era of environmental restoration.
Under the pact, five Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
power-generating dams will be removed on Battle Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River east of Red Bluff that supports endangered salmon and steelhead trout.
Three other dams will be retrofitted with fish ladders, and the volume of downriver flows will be increased tenfold.
The project will open up 42 miles of new salmon spawning grounds.
Because it is a pristine watercourse fed year-round by cold, subterranean springs, Battle Creek is one of the finest salmon streams in California.
The deal is considered a centerpiece project for CalFed, a federal and state venture designed to guarantee stable water supplies for farms and cities while improving water quality and wildlife habitat in the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, their delta and San Francisco Bay.
The removal of the dams is expected to begin next year, and should be completed in 2001.
At a news conference Monday on the Delta King, a restored river boat docked on the Sacramento River, U.S.
Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt hailed the accord as a template for cooperative environmental efforts that can join government with the private sector.
``The salmon that is driving this happy event is leading us to a new era in our relationship with the environment,'' Babbitt said.
``The salmon has no fixed address.
(It) teaches us we must see the entire landscape''.
Referring to the salmon's uncanny ability to sense its arrival at its natal stream after several years in the ocean, Babbitt added: ``Its instincts are so finely honed it can taste one drop of vermouth in 500,000 barrels of gin.
That's a fish worth listening to''.
Babbitt's ebullience was echoed by representatives of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, which donated $3 million to implement the project.
``We're interested in projects that involve the private sector, projects that sustain a vision of a restored California,'' said Jeanne Sedgwick, director of conservation programs for the Los Altos-based foundation.
Jean Oscamou, a spokesman for PG&AMP;E, said the removal of the dams will cut electricity generation on Battle Creek by 25 percent.
``The creek currently supplies enough power to supply about 40,000 homes, so that's not insignificant,'' said Oscamou.
``But this plan allows us to both restore fish and maintain a reasonable level of power production.
``It would have been tough to resolve this if we had gotten into an adversarial relationship (with environmental groups and government agencies),'' he said.
``A joint partnership is much more productive''.
But some concerns about the project were also aired.
Battle Creek already supports the largest salmon hatchery in the state, a facility run by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service.
About 80,000 mature fall-run chinook salmon now return annually to the creek's narrow gorge, a number some scientists feel is too high for the good of other salmon runs.
Bill Kier, a Sausalito fisheries consultant who didn't attend Monday's event, said the sheer mass of fall-run salmon on Battle Creek could impede the migration of endangered winter-run and threaten spring-run chinook salmon, which spawn higher up the watershed.
Biologists from the University of California have also expressed concerns about the genetics of the Coleman hatchery fish, noting that some may be inbred and that undesirable cross-breeding has probably occurred between fish from different runs.
Babbitt said he has very real concerns about the Coleman hatchery and its impact on wild fish.
``This is the time for a comprehensive and fundamental look at the hatchery,'' he said.
``For a long time, fish hatcheries have been viewed as parts of mitigation packages, as equivalents to livestock feed yards.
That's not how we want to do it here.
We want to do this right, and the time to do it is now''.
Scott Hamelberg, who supervises north state fish projects for the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, said agency biologists are addressing Coleman's problems.
Last year, Fish and Wildlife moved winter-run chinook hatching operations from Coleman to a facility near Shasta Dam to prevent hybridization with fall-run fish, Hamelberg said.
Local landowners have also expressed apprehension about the Battle Creek project _ but at Monday's announcement, they appeared to give it a qualified endorsement.
``We started out scared,'' said Bob Lee, secretary of the Battle Creek Watershed Conservancy, an organization representing people living in the creek's watershed.
``We were worried that the agencies would come in here and smash the local economy,'' Lee said.
``Anyone who ranches or works in timber or agriculture has trouble with endangered species in their backyard.
But people have gradually calmed down''.
Still, said Lee, the supervising agencies ``have to make sure they address the surrounding lands, not just dams and water flows.
The riparian areas and watershed have to be protected as a whole, and the ranches are the biggest key.
``The ranchers have been taking care of this land for 100 years, and they've done a pretty good job of caring for the creek,'' he said.
``We have to make sure they have a future.''
PALO ALTO, Calif.
_ Look beyond the hype over the deal to save the Headwaters Forest and you'll see that taxpayers may not be getting their money's worth.
Soon the California Legislature will decide whether to appropriate $130 million for purchase of 7,500 acres of redwoods in Humboldt County.
With an additional $250 million in federal money, the purchase price of these majestic trees is $380 million.
In my view, the 7,500 acres of virgin and second-growth redwoods are not by themselves worth $380 million.
This huge expenditure is justified only if the public can be assured that the side agreement _ a giant string attached to the purchase, known as a ``habitat conservation plan'' _ won't imperil the future of endangered species on the rest of Pacific Lumber's 200,000 acres nearby.
As it stands now, the habitat conservation plan negotiated by Pacific Lumber and government officials would not only permit the logging of ancient redwoods.
It could also lead to extinction of the coho salmon population in California.
In March, the Legislature's Joint Committee on Headwaters Forest, which I co-chair with Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, uncovered the following: The proposed Headwaters habitat conservation plan may not preserve the other 12 groves of ancient redwoods owned by Pacific Lumber.
Contrary to the ``50-year protection'' allegedly locked in for these groves, Pacific Lumber is negotiating a separate side agreement with federal wildlife officials that would allow the company to seek changes to the habitat plan periodically for the purpose of logging one or more of these groves.
The coho salmon to be affected by the Headwaters habitat plan now amount to just 1 percent of their original numbers.
In 1973, there were 40,000 fishing jobs on the North Coast.
Now there are just 5,000.
Those jobs disappeared after logging and mining destroyed the coho salmon's habitat.
Under the proposed Headwaters habitat plan, Pacific Lumber would establish a 30-foot ``no-cut'' zone on the sides of streams to protect spawning habitat for coho salmon.
Yet two of the U.S.
Forest Service's top coho salmon experts _ geologist Leslie Reid and hydrologist Robert Ziemer _ have asserted that the ``no-cut'' buffer zones are inadequate.
The scientists noted ``significant discrepancy'' between the protections in the Headwaters habitat conservation plan and the two most widely accepted, scientifically based sources, which recommend ``no-cut'' zones of 170 to 300 feet.
To date, officials with the National Marine Fisheries Service, the agency responsible for survival of the coho salmon, have been unable to rationalize the inconsistency between the previously recommended national standards of 170- to 300-foot ``no-cut'' zones and the Headwaters plan, which requires only 30 feet.
To be sure, politics is the art of compromise.
Wildlife biology, however, is not.
If we compromise the habitat of the coho salmon for Pacific Lumber, we will be forced to do so for other private landowners up and down the coast.
Although the struggle for Headwaters Forest has already gone on for more than 15 years, we must remember that extinction is forever.
Stepping back to rethink the Headwaters agreement will be a prudent step.
We must ensure that the Headwaters deal does what it ought to do: Strengthen rather than weaken environmental protection.

SEATTLE _ Once-abundant salmon runs of Canada's west coast have suffered drastic declines in recent years due to habitat destruction, overfishing and changes in ocean conditions, the Vancouver-based Pacific Fisheries Resource Council found in its first report.
``Overall, our salmon catches over the last five years are among the lowest of the last 50 years.
We seem to have gone from many diverse fish stocks down to a few strong runs,'' said John Fraser, the council's chairman and former speaker of Canada's House of Commons.
The decline is most dramatic among chinook and coho salmon, species that are also imperiled in the Columbia River system and throughout the Pacific Northwest.
The return of coho salmon to British Columbia's central coast, Fraser said in an interview, has declined from more than 500,000 fish to fewer than 25,000.
The report released Tuesday said that coho salmon are in danger from the Skeena River, in northern British Columbia, south to Vancouver Island and the Strait of Georgia.
Last year, Canada curtailed both the commercial and sport fishery for coho salmon.
But even sockeye salmon, although still abundant in the Fraser River, are in peril elsewhere along the Canadian coast.
``The central coast area once supported the second largest sockeye fishery in British Columbia, after the Fraser.
The Rivers and Smith Inlet fisheries are now essentially closed,'' said the Council report.
The Council is a quasi-governmental body of experts appointed last September to advise Canada's fisheries minister David Anderson on how to conserve and restore endangered salmon runs.
Its report comes less than a week after the United States and Canada reached a long-term agreement for conserving and managing salmon runs from the Alaska border to the Oregon coast.
The Council said Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans doesn't have enough money to meet its current conservation mandate and has lacked resources even to keep track of salmon runs.
``For example, there is a shortfall in basic (counting) and assessment monitoring to the extent that only a few stocks, primarily large ones, have adequate data for their management and protection,'' the report said.
The report noted that fisheries officials cannot account for what happened to 3.5 million sockeye salmon that swam up the Fraser River last year but never reached their spawning grounds.
``The state of many salmon stocks is unknown,'' the panel reported.
``The Council has found that there are such glaring information gaps...
that no valid conclusions could be drawn about the state of many stocks.
Nonetheless, there is evidence that salmon biodiversity is being eroded''.
The 1998 salmon catch along Canada's west coast was about half the average catch of the last half-century, the Council reported.
``It appears that unfavorable marine conditions, past overfishing and habitat damage have been significant causes of the reduced catch,'' it found.
The Council pointedly delivered its report to both the Canadian government and British Columbia provincial government, which have bitterly feuded over fisheries policy.
Anderson on Wednesday defended his department, saying it spends $220 million (Canadian) in the Pacific region and has invested major work on restoring salmon habitat.
But many of the streams and logged-over areas needing restoration fall under the control of the British Columbia government, noted Sharon Chow of the Sierra Club of British Columbia, which endorsed the Council report.
``We still have a huge problem between the province and the federal government, and between Anderson and (British Columbia Premier) Glen Clark,'' she added.
``And that is not good for fish''.
Fraser noted, however, that the United States and Canada have managed to come together after an often-bitter five year dispute.
``We have created some stability and set out in the direction of much closer Canada-U.S.
cooperation to save fish,'' he said.
``Now it is time to get our own house in order''.
In a future report, the Council is expected to discuss breakdowns in Canada's fisheries enforcement, particularly overfishing in ocean waters and failure to catch poachers once salmon have begun their upstream migration .
PHILOMATH, Ore.
(AP) -- Ron Yechout was elk hunting in the Coast Range a couple years ago when he came upon technicians at the Fall Creek hatchery bashing coho salmon in the head with baseball bats and stripping their blood-red eggs into 5-gallon buckets.
Yechout got his video camera -- so incensed was he to learn that the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife was killing thousands of hatchery fish and millions of their eggs so that about 100 threatened wild Alsea River coho could spawn without competition from their domesticated cousins.
Just as the Zapruder film fueled doubts over the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, Yechout's home video is spawning resistance to government efforts to save salmon as he shows it to service clubs and chambers of commerce.
The video has found a receptive audience among people still smarting over logging cutbacks to protect the northern spotted owl.
It has also sparked a legislative effort to stop killing hatchery fish and a challenge of the Endangered Species Act.
''We can have a California condor raised in a laboratory and turn them loose and they are wild,'' said Yechout, the manager of a bank in this small farming and logging town.
''Yet we have a higher standard for fish.
There is something wrong with that''.
Hatcheries have been part of the Pacific salmon equation since 1872, when the U.S.
Fish Commission built the first one on the McCloud River in Northern California.
Since then more than 400 have been established from Alaska to California, turning out more than 325 million juvenile fish a year.
The biggest problem with hatcheries is they make people think they can have salmon without worrying about wiping out their spawning habitat with dams, clearcut logging and overgrazing, biologist Jim Lichatowich argues in his book, ''Salmon Without Rivers''.
From the very beginning, hatcheries ignored the lifecycle that had made wild salmon thrive for 10,000 years since the last Ice Age.
Eggs were routinely shipped as far away as New Zealand, with no regard for the local adaptations the fish had evolved for their home rivers.
Gene pools were truncated by spawning a whole generation from the first few fish to come in.
While hatcheries are good at producing fish for people to catch, they are not as good at producing fish to survive in the wild, said Reg Reisenbichler, a biologist for the U.S.
Geological Survey.
To thrive in a hatchery, fish feed aggressively on the top of the water, where their food pellets are scattered.
In the wild, that sort of behavior will get a smolt eaten by a kingfisher.
As a result, hatcheries genetically change the behavior of the fish, and are vulnerable to booms and busts, said Robin Waples, director of conservation biology at the National Marine Fisheries Service's Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle.
Hatcheries generally release smolts all at once, so a whole generation can be wiped out hitting the ocean when food is scarce or predators are plentiful.
Spawners come back in a bunch, too, making them vulnerable to the weather.
Wild fish are spread out as they migrate to the ocean and return to spawn, so if smolts run into a school of hungry mackerel or the eggs laid by spawners are washed away by flood, there are others behind them.
''The only sure way we know of maintaining salmon into the future is maintaining the natural diversity we know has carried the species through long periods in the past,'' Waples said.
Though still considered experimental by government agencies, tribal fisheries programs think combining higher survival rates of young fish in hatcheries with habitat restoration will bring back more fish for spiritual and economic use.
On the Hood River, which runs off towering Mount Hood into the Columbia, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs have joined with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.
They are raising the fish under more natural conditions, and allowing the fish to decide when to go into the river, rather than dumping them out of a truck.
''We feel we've got to imitate Mother Nature the best we can,'' said Mick Jennings, a former state fisheries biologist now working for the Warm Springs Tribes.
''These fish have adapted over thousands of years on their own.
The problems in this basin are man-caused activities''.
They haven't been doing it long enough to see any increase in returning adults, but they have doubled the proportion of young fish reaching the mouth of Hood River, Jennings said.
At Fall Creek hatchery in Oregon's Coast Range, the coho were bred since the 1950s for fishermen to catch in the ocean.
After ocean coho seasons were essentially eliminated in 1993 to protect dwindling wild stocks, the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission decided to shut down Fall Creek's coho program, said Doug DeHart, fisheries chief for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.
Smolt survival was seriously declining, from 5 percent in the 1970s to 0.5 percent in recent years, he said.
As a mix of stocks taken from up and down the coast and the lower Columbia River, they lacked the local adaptations evolved by wild fish.
DeHart's explanations didn't dissuade two state representatives incensed by Yechout's video from crafting a bill that would bar the state from killing off hatchery fish and create an expert panel to review the science.
''It just doesn't make sense to kill an endangered species when we're trying to keep them alive,'' said state Rep.
Jeff Kropf, R-Halsey, who with state Rep.
Betsy Close, R-Albany, plans to introduce the bill next year.
The Pacific Legal Foundation, a property rights organization, lost attempts to stop killing the Fall Creek hatchery coho, but has a lawsuit arguing that the Endangered Species Act protects hatchery coho as well as wild.
''Now because of the Ron Yechout video, we know why salmon are dying,'' said foundation attorney Russell Brooks.
''The government is killing them.
''That allows them to continue to list coho salmon as a threatened species, which in turn allows them to continue to regulate.
In that regulation they control land use and resources.
That's what it is, is a land grab''.
An adviser to the foundation, retired Oregon State University fisheries professor Jim Lannan finds the science favoring wild fish to be weak.
He notes that the two strongest wild runs of coho in Oregon are on rivers where salmon ranching operations went bust, leaving their domesticated stock to breed with wild fish.
''All I want to see is some intellectual honesty brought into the argument and see what the public wants,'' Lannan said.
''If they want culture-based fisheries so they can have the kind of robust offshore fisheries they had several years ago, that's fine.
Or if they want to treat salmon like a museum piece, that's fine, too''.

LOWER GRANITE DAM, Wash.
_ For roughly half of the millions of salmon born on the Snake River that set out each spring for the Pacific Ocean, the journey past four federal dams is an arduous and often lethal one.
They can be whacked to death by giant blades of the dam turbines, knocked out from collisions with concrete spillways, or succumb to a fatal condition not unlike the bends.
The other half of the salmon have a much simpler trip: They get to take the boat.
But this annual free ride, by which the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers loads the young fish on barges and totes them around the dams, is coming under scrutiny like never before.
And for scientists, lawmakers, farmers, fishermen, American Indians, barge shippers, environmentalists and a breathtaking array of other interested parties, the assessment is most likely the key to a momentous decision that will ultimately fall to Congress: whether to take down the Snake River dams altogether.
The job of protecting the baby salmon, so they can mature and breed, is a remarkable feat of engineering and an expensive _ critics say outlandish _ accommodation to man's demands for electricity.
Thousands of fish a day are diverted to a channel leading to a pipe that runs into a trailer downstream of this dam, the first of the four, which is near the Idaho border.
In the trailer, a busy assembly line of seasonal workers briefly anesthetizes the salmon and then injects a computer chip the size of a rice grain into their bellies so they can be tracked over the years.
They are barged for a 36-hour, 300-mile trip, bypassing the dams on the Snake and four more on the Columbia River.
More salmon are collected at two other dams on the Snake and one on the Columbia.
It is all part of the government's bid to keep both salmon and dams _ ``to find a way to have our cake and eat it, too,'' said Jim Anderson, a fisheries professor at the University of Washington.
But with the river's coho salmon already declared extinct, and every other species of Snake River salmon and steelhead now listed under the Endangered Species Act, the once-unthinkable idea of breaching the dams has emerged in several federal studies as the action with the best chance of restoring healthy salmon runs.
The Corps of Engineers is to recommend by the end of the year whether to propose such a step.
Breaching of the dams is bitterly opposed by many people as an assault on the area's agricultural economy, and the proposal has already emerged as a hot-button issue in the Northwest in this year's presidential race.
Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas vowed in the primary campaign here never to allow the dams to be breached, while Vice President Al Gore, part of an administration that is intensely debating the issue, has taken no public position.
Breaching the dams would mean removing the earthen portions, restoring a 140-mile section of the Snake to its wild, free-flowing condition and thus make salmon barging both impossible and unnecessary.
It would also mean that the 4 percent of the electricity the dams provide in the Northwest would have to be supplied by other sources.
The cost of the 20-year-old barging program for juvenile salmon, known as smolts, is just part of the more than $3 billion the government has spent over that period trying to save salmon on the Snake and Columbia Rivers.
The barging program is derided by critics as a ``techno-fix'' that harms fish, interfering with their natural migration rhythms, causing them to die early, and perhaps interfering with their fabled and mysterious ability to find their way back home to spawn in their native river after spending years and traveling thousands of miles in the Pacific Ocean, as far north as Alaska.
Supporters of barging defend it as a kind of magic solution that could allow the salmon and the dams to coexist.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) And the National Marine Fisheries Service, one of several federal agencies that must weigh in on the fate of the dams, recently said that a decision on breaching could be put off for 5 to 10 years if barging was continued and other aggressive conservation measures undertaken.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) So far, however, the results are hardly encouraging.
While a corps brochure boasts that the barging system is ``custom-made to make the trip as safe and comfortable as possible,'' and while 98.5 percent of smolts survive the trip, the salmon themselves remain in decline.
In most recent years, just 0.5 percent to 1 percent of all Snake River salmon have made it out to the ocean and all the way back, jumping through a ladder system that bypasses the dams, to their original spawning grounds.
That is much less than the roughly 4 percent that scientists say the salmon stocks would need to recover fully.
Researchers are unsure what percentages of barged and nonbarged fish are making it back, a question that the microchips implanted in recent years are supposed to help answer.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) (Some fish implanted with the chips are caught years later by fishermen, and ultimately served in restaurants; corps biologist said the chips are implanted in a part of the fish that is not consumed by humans).
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) But for many environmentalists, the numbers suggest that the barging efforts are not enough.
``In a way, this issue about the difference in survival of transported fish versus fish that migrate through the river is a red herring,'' said Rob Masonis, regional director of hydropower programs for American Rivers, a conservation group.
``The fundamental question is whether either of those classes of fish are making it back to the Snake River at levels that would lead to survival or recovery.
And the answer is clearly no''.
Still, there is no scientific consensus on how large a culprit the dams are in the salmon's decline.
Other factors include cyclical ocean conditions, commercial fishing and erosion of habitat all along the rivers where the salmon spawn, which is caused by construction and run-off from farms.
At this point, the dams on the Columbia are not candidates for breaching.
And early counts indicate that the Snake River may see some of the highest numbers in recent years of returning adult chinook salmon this year, a result that would not take them off the endangered listing, but might lead supporters of barging to argue for more time to see if the program can work.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Moreover, no scientist can guarantee that taking the dams down would revive the salmon runs the explorer William Clark found in the Snake River two centuries ago, when he wrote in his diary that the river was ``crouded with salmon''.
(At that time, biologists estimate, about 2 million adult salmon a year completed the epic journey back to their spawning grounds; in most recent years, that number has been measured in the thousands or only the hundreds for some types of salmon).
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) nn &QL; There is no question that, compared with those fish that have to navigate through the dams, a much higher percentage of salmon survive the barge trip, which drops them off just downstream of the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River, the last man-made impediment before the fish can reach the Pacific.
But as the tugboat Umatilla made its way down the Snake the other day, pushing a barge loaded, by the government's count, with 254,317 smolts, corps biologists said they were still gathering data on whether barging contributed to a much higher rate of what they termed ``delayed mortality'' among salmon transported that way.
``With one big caveat, if I were a fish, I'd rather be here than there,'' said Doug Arndt, chief of the regional fish management division for the corps, standing aboard the barge and pointing to the dam on the river.
``And that caveat is disease transmission,'' Arndt said.
``Is this program enhancing disease in these fish?
We just don't know enough about it''.
Jim Baker, the Northwest salmon campaign coordinator for the Sierra Club, said there were many ways in which barging could be harmful to fish, despite the fact that such high percentages survive the short trip itself.
``For one thing, these barges are running on a human schedule, rather than the fishes' schedule,'' Baker said.
``There's a great deal of evidence that these fish are released too soon below the Bonneville Dam, so that they enter a salt water estuary too early in their development''.
Anderson of the University of Washington says that there is not enough research to show if barged fish die in much greater numbers than others.
``There are a lot of hypotheses and no real ways to measure the mechanisms that might be producing this extramortality,'' Anderson said.
``So people are really making arguments on things for which we don't have enough information yet''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) The fish transportation program started on an experimental basis in 1968 with trucks, and has been in full operation with barges since 1981.
The breaching issue represents a political juggling act for Gore, the presumptive presidential nominee of the Democrats, and there are strong indications that the process leading to a corps recommendation will extend, not at all coincidentally, until just beyond the Nov.
7 election.
It is a clearer political call for Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who ran radio commercials in the primary declaring that the dams ``will stay right where they are'' if he is elected.
In February, he told a cheering crowd at Columbia Basin College in Pasco, Wash.: ``I grew up in West Texas.
It's a part of the world without much water.
I understand the importance of water''.
While the fisheries service is expected to recommend waiting for several years before a decision is made, the Environmental Protection Agency told the corps recently that the four dams harmed the river's water quality, endangered the salmon and might have to be breached to comply with the federal Clean Water Act.
Opinions remain impassioned on both sides.
The Columbia River Alliance, representing other commercial users of the river, said the breaching proposal was ``an economic dark cloud hanging over these communities that depend on dams''.
But at a hearing on dam breaching in Seattle this winter, one fisherman said he did not want delays or stop-gap measures or ``Army Corps of Engineers Rube Goldberg barges''.
The solution, he said, was to ``let the Snake River flow.''
The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 8: &QL; &QL; The decline of the once-great salmon populations off the Pacific coasts of Canada and the United States ranks high on the list of the 20th century's environmental disasters.
But 1999 may well turn out to be the year when the fish finally caught a break.
In March, acting under the Endangered Species Act, the federal government set in motion a regional plan to restore salmon runs throughout the Pacific Northwest.
Then last week, following years of fruitless negotiations, the United States and Canada announced a plan to set new limits on salmon catches and establish a conservation fund to further protect the fish.
At the core of the complex agreement are new protections for ``intercepted'' salmon stocks _ fish that spawn in one country but are caught as they migrate through another country's waters.
Under the old rules, fishermen in, say, Alaska or British Columbia were allowed to catch a fixed number of fish every year, regardless of the health of the fish population.
Under the new agreement, harvest levels would be adjusted up or down based on scientific measurements of fish stocks along thousands of miles of coastline.
The agreement also calls for a $140 million fund that would be used to buy up fishing licenses _ essentially paying some fishermen not to fish _ and to begin restoration efforts in rivers whose spawning areas have been damaged.
The importance of this agreement is that it finally addresses the demand side of the salmon equation.
The supply of fish can be increased if the rivers where they spawn are restored to good health.
But these efforts will mean little if the fish continue to be over-harvested at sea.
The agreement is also heartening in another sense.
As David Anderson, the Canadian fisheries minister, once observed, ``if two friendly neighbors can't agree on this issue, what does that forecast for diplomacy elsewhere''?
Anderson deserves much credit for this deal, along with Gov.
Tony Knowles of Alaska _ who agreed to subject Alaska's profitable annual harvest to the new rules _ and Trout Unlimited, a private organization that suggested key provisions.
Vice President Gore played a role, too, which cannot hurt his environmental credentials.
But he has more to do.
Money must still be secured from a Republican Congress for the United States' share of the $140 million restoration program, as well as for a separate $100 million fund _ a special favorite of Gore's _ to help the Pacific Northwest clean up rivers and streams.
Beyond that, the Administration will face a politically risky decision later this year about whether to dismantle four hydropower dams on the Snake River, which over the years have had a calamitous effect on salmon stocks.
That decision will tell a lot about how serious this Administration is about the salmon.
WASHINGTON _ One hundred years ago this year, a Smithsonian Institution biologist visited the Pacific Northwest and marveled at the plentifulness of the fish that has come to symbolize the region.
``The quantities of salmon which frequent these waters is beyond calculation,'' said Richard Rathbun, ``and seems to be so great as to challenge human ingenuity to affect it in any way''.
But over the last century, human ingenuity in the form of homebuilding, logging, farming, dam-building, fishing and other activities has managed to significantly affect those very same salmon runs of which Rathbun spoke.
Tuesday, in an attempt to reverse the course of history, the federal government plans to formally announce that nine salmon and steelhead groupings in Washington and Oregon are headed for extinction.
The dwindling salmon runs are throughout the Northwest, from Ozette Lake on the Olympic Peninsula to the Columbia, Snake and Willamette rivers.
By the end of the day Tuesday, virtually every watershed in Washington state will be subject to the strictures of the federal Endangered Species Act, which makes it a crime to harm endangered and threatened species.
And there is more to come.
In June, another federal agency plans to list coastal Puget Sound bull trout _ another type of salmon _ for protection.
But much of the focus will be on the wild Puget Sound chinook, prized by fishermen for their large size, but now numbering about one-third of their historic peak.
The chinook spend part of their life cycle in rivers and streams that extend throughout the same part of the Northwest most densely populated by human beings _ the central Puget Sound counties of King, Pierce and Snohomish, home to 3 million people.
The listing of four groups of chinook as threatened _ meaning they are at risk of becoming endangered _ will post a major test of just how far this country is willing to go in protecting endangered species.
There are currently 702 species of plants and 477 species of animals listed for protection under the 26-year-old Endangered Species Act.
But most of those species live in sparsely populated rural areas.
Never before has the government demanded protection of a species whose habitat so completely suffuses one of the nation's large metropolitan areas.
By declaring the species eligible for protection under the federal Endangered Species Act, the government will be calling for changes in a wide variety of practices by farmers, fishermen, builders, businesses and homeowners.
These groups are thought to be harming the salmon either directly, by catching them or blocking their passage, or indirectly, by polluting or altering the waters the fish call home.
``We've got problems with water quality and water quantity in many parts of the state, habitat destruction from agriculture and timber and development, hydropower and harvest and hatchery impacts,'' says Curt Smitch, salmon adviser to Gov.
Gary Locke.
Smitch says changes could be required in all of those areas.
Of the nine species to be listed for protection Tuesday, seven are in Washington state, and two are in Oregon.
The National Marine Fisheries Services has decided to postpone for six months decisions on whether to list for protection four other species in California and Oregon.
``The basic message of the listings is that salmon and the need to recover salmon has landed squarely in the urban areas of the Northwest, and not just the countryside,'' said Bill Bradbury, executive director of the Oregon-based group For the Sake of the Salmon, a coalition of governments, industry and environmental groups working to conserve salmon.
``That was already true, or becoming true, in Portland, but clearly with major listings in the Puget Sound, salmon have come to the city''.
The effect of the announcement will be gradual _ at first, only federal actions will be affected, and it will take some months before federal agenciesspell out the rules that place new restrictions on activities on state and private lands.
State and local governments hope to retain a large degree of control over salmon conservation measures, but ultimately, the federal government and any activist can ask the courts to force an end to behavior that harms the threatened species.
By the beginning of next year, the changes are likely to affect many of the residents and businesses of the central Puget Sound.
Homebuilding will be more difficult along the region's many waterways.
Disposal of agricultural and industrial waste will be more closely scrutinized.
The already sharply-restricted commercial and sport fisheries in Puget Sound may be even more restricted.
Small dams could be bypassed or removed.
Homeowners may be asked to pay higher fees for stormwater storage and treatment.
``Clearly, there is going to be some pain involved in this,'' said Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the National Marine Fisheries Service.
``We're not going to go back to the middle of the 19th Century, but we're not going to ignore the fact that critical, vital salmon habitat has been destroyed and is being destroyed, and...that's going to be a violation of law''.
Government officials are hoping they can protect the salmon without choking off the region's remarkable economic growth.
``I see this as a challenge to grow much more wisely, in a smarter fashion than ever before,'' said Gov.
Gary Locke.
The diet of Northwesterners, however, is not likely to be impacted.
Most salmon sold in area supermarkets is either caught wild in Alaska or is raised in pens in Canada, Chile and the United States.
The Pacific Northwest has grappled with the Endangered Species Act before.
The listing of the northern spotted owl for protection in 1990 caused tremendous bitterness in the region, pitting environmentalists against timber communities and ultimately helping to spur unsuccessful efforts to overturn the law.
Then in 1996, Oregon began a costly and failed battle to prevent the federal government from listing coastal coho for protection.
But Tuesday's listings, which will remain in place until the salmon runs recover, are dramatically different.
Conservatives in Congress have given up any effort to weaken the Endangered Species Act, and local officials aren't even considering mounting a challenge to the declaration that salmon are threatened.
Salmon _ because of their iconic status in the Northwest _ seem to enjoy greater public sympathy than the rarely seen owl.
And although the salmon listing is likely to affect more people than the spotted owl listing, the effect is likely to be more diffused, with few communities suffering the sharp economic damage experienced by logging towns a decade ago.
A poll taken last summer by Elway Research found that most residents are willing to spend money to save salmon, and most do not believe a listing of salmon under the Endangered Species Act will directly affect their lives.
Some argue that there is public sympathy for the salmon because their plight, in some ways, echoes the plight of human residents of the area.
``People in this region are tired of the direction we're going, as far as quality of life,'' said Ed Zuckerman, executive director of the Washington Environmental Alliance for Voter Education.
``The salmon are an indicator of environmental problems we're having in the Northwest...Whether it's sitting in traffic, the loss of open spaces, declining drinking water -- this is kind of a wake-up call''.
But ultimately, the Endangered Species Act aims to protect the endangered animals.
It is likely to be decades before anyone really knows whether the measures forced by Tuesday's listing which actually lead to restoration of the salmon runs.
``There's nothing new here _ we have been worried about the decline of salmon and trying to do something about it for over a century, but we keep trying the same kinds of things the same ways,'' said James Karr, a professor of fisheries and zoology at the University of Washington.
``This announcement is going to cause a lot of activity, but sadly, a substantial portion of that activity will be wheelspinning unrelated to restoring salmon, and as a society we should be up in arms about that because it's our resources that are being wasted''.
But others are more optimistic.
``A very large number of these runs are going to be brought back to vitality,'' said Denis Hayes, a leading environmental advocate and president of the Bullitt Foundation.
``I am enough of a realist not to believe they all will, but this is a region that from the governor to the clerk in the grocery store shares an objective to make this happen...We'll just pull up our boots and get to it.''
OTTAWA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. refusal to honor the Pacific Salmon Treaty is costing Canadian fishermen at least 60 million dollars (42 million U.S. dollars) a year, said Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson.
The U.S. overfishing undermined Canadian efforts to save the salmon from extinction, the minister was quoted by Thursday's Globe and Mail newspaper as saying.
"Americans are taking more of our fish than we are taking of theirs, and the trend is upward," Anderson said in a speech on the eve of a long-delayed resumption of talks on salmon quotas.
Ottawa and Washington announced Tuesday that the talks will begin at the end of this month, three months after two special envoys urged immediate return to negotiations.
The envoys also asked the Alaskan fishermen to reduce their interception of Canadian-bound fish in the North Pacific.
Under the 1985 treaty, neither country is supposed to take more fish from the ocean than the number that originates in their waters.
Yet, Alaskan interceptions of fish returning to Canadian rivers last year reached an unprecedented peak, even while Canada was cutting its own catch to save them from extinction, Anderson noted.
In the south, Canada has also cut its interception of fish swimming into U.S. waters off Washington state, and helped that state's conservation programs, he added.
OTTAWA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian province of British Columbia (B.C).
has launched its lawsuit against the United States for failing to curb overfishing by Alaska and other states in the Pacific Northwest.
The Canadian province plans to seek 325 million dollars (230 million US dollars) in damages for alleged U.S. overfishing, said reports today.
"This is not about an attempt to get money for American overfishing," B.C.
Premier Glen Clark was quoted as saying.
"This is about using the American court system to force the states to comply with the principles of salmon treaty, conserve the resource and force them to get back to the table and negotiate a treaty in both our interests".
The B.C. suit alleges that intensive Alaskan interception of Canadian-bound fish this summer violated the basic principles of conservation and share in the Pacific Salmon Treaty.
The U.S. federal government signed the treaty in 1985 and remains responsible for enforcing it in individual states.
Apart from the damages, the suit also seeks a court order certifying that the U.S. violated its international obligations, and directing Washington to compel compliance by individual states.
The B.C. latest move reinvigorates the Pacific fish war that has raged between Canada and the U.S. for months.
Yet, a memo leaked later Monday in Ottawa casts doubt on the province's chance of success.
The memo, prepared by Canada's federal government, concludes that a U.S. court would not likely side with Canadian interests in such a dispute.
Ottawa said it had considered its own lawsuit, but ruled out the option for various reasons including an interest in focusing on diplomacy.
The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, March 18: The federal government's decision on Tuesday to order new protections for nine threatened salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest is just the beginning of what could be the biggest and most expensive rescue effort in the 26-year history of the Endangered Species Act.
It is an effort worth making.
The decline of the once-great salmon runs of the Pacific Northwest ranks high among the ecological blunders committed in the name of economic growth.
The time has surely come to correct that mistake.
What makes the challenge uniquely interesting is its reach.
Salmon spawn throughout the Pacific Northwest, so any effort to save them will have to be regional in scope.
The effort will inevitably require higher taxes to clean hundreds of waterways and buy open space in crucial watersheds.
It will impose tough restrictions on new construction, farming and logging, and may even require the costly decommissioning of federal and private dams that impede salmon runs but have also long supplied the Pacific Northwest with cheap power.
The early response from local politicians and citizens has been extraordinarily positive.
One reason is that the salmon is not only economically important to the Pacific Northwest but is virtually a cultural icon.
Beyond that, many local residents are consumed by fears that development will someday destroy the natural beauty that surrounds them.
A save-the-salmon effort, with all the restrictions that implies, is thus seen as a timely antidote to shapeless sprawl.
As Seattle's mayor, Paul Schell, noted, ``as we work to save the salmon, it may turn out that the salmon save us''.
But this battle has a very long way to go.
It is one thing to preach salvation.
It is quite another to pay the price when the controls kick in _ when farmers have to stop using pesticides, when developers have to stop building in sensitive watersheds, when loggers have to stop cutting trees along salmon-bearing streams.
Today's euphoria could easily become tomorrow's backlash.
There are also many questions surrounding the federal commitment.
Washington moved to protect the salmon only because environmental advocacy groups threatened to sue if it did not _ an exact replay of the campaign to save the spotted owl.
By listing the salmon as threatened, the Clinton administration has now saddled itself with an even more onerous responsibility _ insuring that Washington and Oregon develop an effective plan to save the fish.
Vice President Al Gore has promised a special appropriation of $100 million to underwrite a ``cooperative restoration effort''.
But if the states falter, Washington would be obliged under the Endangered Species Act to step in with a variety of legal and regulatory weapons that, in effect, could halt development in its tracks.
An early test of this commitment will come in the next few months when the administration delivers its long-awaited proposal for restoring several species of salmon in the Snake River that were listed as endangered or threatened back in 1991 and 1992.
Some scientists believe that these species will never recover unless the federal government dismantles or at least modifies eight dams on the Snake and Columbia Rivers _ a strategy unalterably opposed by many big consumers of electricity and by Washington's powerful Republican senator, Slade Gorton.
The administration may find other ways to restore the fresh-water flows essential to the salmon's survival.
But what matters here is the end result _ recovery.
How the administration responds will tell much about its long-term dedication to the other species listed this week.
SEATTLE _ Sea walls, bulkheads and other man-made barriers have transformed more than half of the central Puget Sound coastline, starving beaches of sand and salmon of food and shelter.
State and federal officials are moving to protect these areas, but they are running into resistance from landowners and local agencies, turning shorelines into a new environmental battlefield.
There is nothing new about the problem.
Homeowners and industries have built walls against waterfront erosion for decades.
Few people noticed.
Until recently, few cared.
But a recent survey found that man has reshaped an extraordinary 52 percent of the central Puget Sound coastline.
The damage has gradually accumulated, scientists say.
In many places, sandy beaches have eroded away to cobble or hardpan, wiping out spawning areas for small fish and beds for grasses that nurture marine life.
Part of what makes the problem difficult to attack, biologists say, is that any single wall does little harm.
``It is the proverbial death by a thousand cuts,'' said Dan Pentilla, a biologist for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.
``If bulkheading isn't controlled or new material added, the beaches on Puget Sound are going to coarsen and disappear''.
To scientists, beaches aren't the stable features that appear to the casual beach-walker.
They are rivers of sand.
They ebb and flow at the prodding of waves, currents and tides.
Bulkheads and seawalls are retaining walls built a short distance from shore to slow natural erosion of banks into water by reducing wave action on the beach.
In doing so, bulkheads can dam the headwaters of these granular streams, with effects that can stretch for miles.
By reflecting wave energy, they also can accelerate how fast sand is washed away.
This week, protection of beaches was elevated by the long-heralded listing of Puget Sound chinook salmon as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.
The local chinook is one of several fish that suffer from shoreline armoring.
Federal officials are writing rules that will prohibit people from doing anything that significantly harms the fish or its habitat unless specifically exempted.
That means tighter restrictions loom over bulkhead-building.
In an effort to protect near-shore habitat, and maybe avoid draconian restrictions, a state commission on shoreline guidelines proposes to make bulkhead-building a last resort.
The panel, representing government agencies and business, environmental and recreational groups, aims to make homeowners prove that proposed bulkheads are needed to protect their homes from imminent danger, and that a ``softer'' solution, such as adding gravel to the beach or planting on a bluff, will not work.
But the proposal faces an uncertain future.
Society's interest in saving fish and beaches collides at the shoreline with homeowners' determination to safeguard even small pieces of waterfront land.
Bulkheads are buttressed by forces of economics and property rights almost as irresistible as Puget Sound's tides.
The real estate market rewards their construction by boosting the value of land that is protected.
And when conflicts with regulators have arisen, courts and the Legislature have generally backed landowners' wall-building.
It remains to be seen whether the Endangered Species Act, once termed the hydrogen bomb of environmental laws, will shift the balance toward conservation.
There is little doubt that coarsening beaches by reducing them to hardpan and gravel affects salmon.
When small fish like sand lance and surf smelt lose spawning areas, their decline deprives young salmon of food.
Sand loss also can eliminate footing for eelgrass, which provides both food and shelter for to salmon in what is, for some, a crucial stage of development.
Probably the most heavily affected salmon are so-called ``ocean-type'' chinook, which leave streams early to spend as long as two months in shallow Puget Sound waters, according to Charles Simenstad of the University of Washington School of Fisheries.
There, in a process he calls ``puberty times 10,'' they adjust to saltwater and pack on the size and strength they need to evade predators at sea.
Other types of salmon do not use the shallows as much, so why not write off the ocean-type chinook?
Biologists say the region's depleted chinook family cannot afford to lose an important branch.
Salmon rely on diverse life cycles to avoid extinction, somewhat as investors rely on diverse stock portfolios to reduce risk of financial collapse.
Chinook salmon are the masters of diversity, with some racing to sea, others lingering in streams and still more hanging around Puget Sound.
The payoff in the evolutionary lottery is clear: If conditions for one type of chinook collapse, others can carry on the species.
That calculation has focused official attention on Puget Sound beaches and near-shore shallows.
Most of the region's attention has focused on streams, so some officials are warning that degrading near-shore areas risk becoming ``the neglected link'' for salmon between rivers and the sea.
``If we focus solely on the streams and don't focus on the near-shore, we aren't going to be successful'' restoring Puget Sound chinook, says Chuck Clarke, regional administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
State officials hope to upgrade habitat protection by rewriting state shoreline guidelines, which prod counties to meet minimum standards for protection.
Biologists say the 20-year-old guidelines are badly outdated.
But some businesses and property owners are resisting change.
Three attempts to upgrade guidelines have run aground, and dissent continues.
The Association of Washington Business boycotted the current guidelines commission and calls its recommendation premature.
Thomas Terich, a professor of geography at Western Washington University in Bellingham, empathizes with the opponents.
``It's a difficult situation,'' he says.
``I can understand the plight of people who paid a lot for their property and want to preserve it, but in doing so they're creating a lot of problems for the preservation of beaches''.
In fact, no one expects to tear out bulkheads, so the guidelines will have little impact on the well-hardened shores of urban areas like Seattle and Tacoma.
Mostly, the commission hopes new rules will slow the spread of walls across still-developing shorelines, such as those of rural Pierce and Kitsap counties.
The front-line troops defending these shorelines are habitat biologists for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.
They issue permits for docks and bulkheads.
Still, their authority is limited.
The Legislature has directed them to expedite permits for bulkheads in front of single family homes.
While biologists may encourage less-damaging bulkhead designs, they say they generally lack authority to deny them.
City and county development agencies exercise the most control over bulkhead and retaining-wall construction.
Wall-builders must get permits from these agencies whether the project is above or below high water.
County attitudes about shoreline protection vary widely.
Whatcom and Thurston counties have cracked down on building bulkheads and retaining walls.
``We don't think they're necessary and they're somewhat destructive to the environment,'' said Roger Giebelhaus, an environmental planner in Thurston County's development office.
Some other counties and cities have shrugged off biologists' attempts to slow bulkhead-building.
Ordinances in many places ``are not strong enough to prevent damage to near-shore habitat,'' says state researcher Ginny Broadhurst.
Jim Brennan, a state habitat biologist, goes further.
In Kitsap County, he complained, ``we're allowing people to build anywhere they want with no analysis''.
Even in King County, generally one of the most progressive in enforcing environmental laws, shoreline administrators have butted heads with state biologists.
The county's Department of Development and Environmental Services routinely waives environmental review for homeowner proposals to build replacement bulkheads and docks, which can shade out eelgrass and harbor fish that prey on salmon.
In the past year, state biologists objected, noting that the replacements often went far beyond the original structure.
One 40-foot dock, for instance, was ``replaced'' by an 80-foot dock without environmental review.
Mark Carey, director of land use for the county department, said he was ``infuriated'' by the second-guessing from the state, which he rejected.
Even though King County ordered all agencies to re-examine procedures that could affect salmon, Carey's agency stuck by its practice.
State habitat biologist John Boettner says he once mentioned to county officials that chinook would soon be listed as threatened, but got brushed off.
``They said it wasn't listed yet,'' Boettner said.
But as the county felt the hot breath of this week's listing, it called for all county agencies, including Carey's, to impose tighter environmental reviews.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- A permanent conservation fund that President Clinton will propose Monday includes $100 million for initiatives to preserve salmon in four West Coast states, officials said.
If Clinton gets his way, the money to save salmon in Alaska, Washington, Oregon and California would be replenished automatically at $100 million each year for at least a decade.
The money would go to the states annually without approval from Congress -- if Congress agrees to enact Clinton's ``Lands Legacy'' program into law this year.
``The fact that we've come back and asked for the full $100 million, and this year proposed in addition that it be made permanent, shows how serious we are about making this a priority,'' said George Frampton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.
In all, Clinton is proposing $290 million for salmon conservation programs in the West and Pacific Northwest.
That includes $91 million for U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers projects in the Columbia-Snake river system; $60 million to implement the Pacific Salmon Treaty between the United States and Canada; and $39 million for the National Marine Fisheries Service's salmon recovery efforts.
The proposals represent increases of 30 percent or more over what Congress approved last year for salmon.
Salmon are a cultural icon on the Pacific Northwest and have been suffering for decades from dams, development, overfishing, runoff and other problems.
In Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California, 26 salmon populations are threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.
Clinton first proposed the $100 million to help rebuild coastal salmon stocks a year ago, but Congress approved just $58 million for the effort.
Frampton declined to discuss other details of the ``Lands Legacy'' proposal until the administration reveals its fiscal 2001 budget on Monday.
But he said the program will use off-shore oil drilling royalties and other revenues to create a permanent, dedicated fund for environmental preservation.
The House Resources Committee last November approved a bill that is similar to what the administration is proposing.
The measure would set aside more than 60 percent of off-shore oil drilling revenues for buying land and conserving coastline.
But that measure, which is pending on the House floor, did not single out salmon for funding.
SEATTLE _ Lending political momentum to an idea that would have been unthinkable in a different era of Pacific Northwest history, Gov.
John A.
Kitzhaber of Oregon announced Friday that he favored breaching four large federal dams on Washington state's Snake River in an effort to restore endangered salmon populations.
Kitzhaber, a Democrat, became the first major political figure to endorse the controversial dam-removal proposal, which is passionately favored by many environmental groups, American Indians and commercial fishermen, but opposed with equal fervor by farmers and many others in the interior Northwest who now rely on the tamed Snake River for barge shipping and electricity.
The debate will almost surely wind up in Congress, sometime after the Army Corps of Engineers, which operates the dams, issues its own opinion on the proposal next year.
Just how much influence Kitzhaber's stand will have remains to be seen, but it is nonetheless an intriguing reflection of changing times in man's relationship with the rivers of the Northwest, where some hydroelectric dams generate enormous amounts of power but have also proven lethal on a major scale to the region's fabled salmon runs.
``In the end, the answer will be a political one _ informed by good science _ but based on a set of values and on the degree of economic and ecological risks the region is willing to accept,'' Kitzhaber said in a speech to the American Fisheries Society in Eugene, Ore.
``It is time that we shoulder our responsibilities and develop a blueprint for action''.
Construction of Northwest dams was an undeniably epic engineering achievement, celebrated in Woody Guthrie's songs more than a half-century ago.
But for the last several decades, the Corps of Engineers has been laboring under federal requirements, to help dams and the salmon coexist on the Snake but has met little success.
Despite spending more than $3 billion on projects such as fish ladders, hatcheries and even a truck-and-barging system that a Corps brochure describes as ``custom-made to make the trip as safe and comfortable as possible'' for the fish, the salmon populations have declined.
The Snake's coho salmon has already been declared extinct, and every other species of salmon and steelhead in the Snake River is now listed under the Endangered Species Act.
In the early 1800s, when the explorer William Clark discovered a river ``crouded with salmon,'' about 2 million adult salmon a year completed the trip back to their spawning grounds, biologists estimate.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Ed Bowles, Idaho's manager of anadromous fish, those that hatch in fresh water and migrate to the sea, said today that 3,276 Snake River adult spring and summer chinook returned last year, down from 8,426 in 1998.
Fall chinook returns were estimated to be about 400, slightly up from 306 in 1998.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) Under the dam-breaching proposal now being considered by the Corps, earth around the dams would be removed, rendering the dams themselves inoperative and restoring 140 miles of the Snake River in eastern Washington to a wild, free-flowing condition.
Many scientists and biologists have endorsed dam breaching as the step that would have the greatest odds of saving the salmon from extinction.
The dams _ Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose and Lower Granite _ would be the biggest federal dams ever slated for removal.
But there is no guarantee that the plan would work, and it would take out of service dams that provide about 4 percent of the Pacific Northwest's electricity.
(Unlike other dams in the region, the Snake dams are not used for flood control).
The dams were also constructed to turn Lewiston, Idaho, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and nearly 500 miles from the Pacific Ocean, into the West's most inland seaport.
But virtually all barge traffic to and from Lewiston would stop if the dams were breached.
Lawmakers in eastern Washington have lined up against any breaching.
Republican lawmakers throughout the region have been generally united against the idea.
U.S. Sen.
Slade Gorton, R-Wash.
, who is running for re-election this year, said taking down the dams would be ``an unmitigated disaster and an economic nightmare'' for the region.
Many Democrats have been non-commital on the idea, but Kitzhaber, who said Friday that the region should feel shame for losing what were ``once the greatest salmon runs on the face of the earth,'' has now become the first major political figure from the region to endorse breaching.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) In his speech Friday, Kitzhaber said that the region is required to try to save the fish under the federal Endangered Species Act, and he warned that if dam-breaching were not attempted, other alternatives might be even more expensive and disruptive.
``All I am saying to you today is that we have to stop deluding ourselves into believing that our choices will be easier and cheaper if we just leave the dams alone,'' he said.
``Our choices won't be easier.
They'll be just as tough''.
Kitzhaber, who was elected in 1994 and re-elected in 1998, also criticized, by implication, a range of state and federal officials who have called for more study of the issue.
``Some will say that we have not done enough science,'' said Kitzhaber.
``I say that we can always play that card as an excuse for inaction and as a justification for avoiding tough choices.
But exactly what additional scientific experiment is necessary to demonstrate that it is easier for salmon to migrate in a free-flowing river than to negotiate a several hundred foot high concrete barrier''?
Environmentalists praised Kitzhaber.
``The governor is providing what the Snake River salmon need most right now, and that is political leadership,'' said Rob Masonis, regional director of dam programs for American Rivers, a group that favors dam removal on many of the nation's rivers.
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Canada signed an agreement on Wednesday aimed at protecting and building up dwindling Pacific salmon supplies.
The Pacific Salmon Treaty, agreed to after five years of tough negotiations and years of disputes between U.S. and Canadian fishermen, revises a 1985 agreement to rebuild wild salmon runs and ensure that both sides get a fair share of the catch.
The Treaty was signed by U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Thomas R.
Pickering and Canadian Ambassador Raymond Chtien at the U.S.
State Department's Treaty Room.
The treaty establishes two regional funds managed by both countries to improve fisheries management and enhance cross-border scientific cooperation.
It calls for the U.S. to spend 140 million U.S. dollars to restore salmon habitat and other measures to rebuild stocks.
The deal divides up salmon among the two countries' fishermen only after ensuring that enough remain to reproduce healthy and growing runs, especially of wild chinook, sockeye and coho salmon.
Some salmon runs are being listed as endangered or threatened under the U.S.
Endangered Species Act.
The agreement has the effect of reducing Canada's catch of chinook salmon bound for streams in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, while giving Canada more of the Fraser River sockeye salmon that have been harvested by Washington and Oregon fishermen.
HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- In a case that death penalty opponents portrayed as a test of Gov.
George W.
Bush's ``compassionate conservatism,'' an appeals court blocked a mentally ill killer's execution Tuesday just four hours before he was to die.
The Republican presidential candidate had said he was unlikely to postpone the execution of Larry Robison, who killed five people, including an 11-year-old boy and a lover who was beheaded, stabbed 49 times and sexually mutilated.
Robison, 42, said recently he was ``like a little kid at Christmas'' looking forward to his lethal injection.
His lawyers, relatives and capital-punishment opponents contended he was mentally ill and deserved treatment rather than death.
In a 5-4 ruling, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court, blocked Robison's execution and sent the question of whether he is mentally competent back to the trial court.
State and federal courts had rejected other appeals challenging Robison's competency.
The decision effectively put the execution off for weeks, if not months.
Prosecutors said Robison will be examined by psychiatrists selected by his attorneys and state lawyers and the findings will be presented to a trial judge in Fort Worth, who then will rule on the prisoner's competence.
Heather Browne, a spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general, said it was unclear whether the state could or would appeal the decision.
The Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that mentally ill people could be executed as long as they understood the punishment and why they were getting it.
In a concurring opinion to Tuesday's order, Judge Tom Price wrote that because Robison ``has long suffered from schizophrenia, he does not understand the nature of the punishment to be imposed upon him''.
The decision at least temporarily kept Bush from having to address calls from capital punishment opponents who demanded the governor, who has defined himself as a ``compassionate conservative,'' give Robison a 30-day reprieve.
``We believe that the citizens of your state and now all American voters are entitled to know just how real and deep your sense of `compassion' reaches,'' death penalty opponent William B.
Moffitt, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, wrote in a letter.
Bush, who was criticized for mocking executed killer Karla Faye Tucker in a recent interview published in Talk magazine, has never issued a reprieve in nearly five years as governor -- a span that has seen 98 executions in Texas.
Last week, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 17-0 against recommending that Robison's sentence be commuted to life.
That meant that Bush could do no more than grant Robison a 30-day reprieve to allow him more time to appeal.
Bush, however, indicated he was unlikely to delay Robison's execution.
He had no immediate comment after the court ruling Tuesday.
Bill Clinton found himself in a similar situation just weeks before the 1992 New Hampshire primary, when as governor of Arkansas he allowed a brain-damaged cop killer to be executed.
At the time, some political observers said Clinton's decision to deny the man clemency helped him distance himself from the Democrats' liberal, soft-on-crime image.
Robison, a former construction worker, was to be the fifth Texas inmate to receive lethal injection this month and the 21st this year.
Another execution is set for Wednesday evening.
``I feel like a little kid at Christmas waiting for Santa Claus to come,'' Robison said in a recent interview.
``I don't believe in death.
I'm just leaving this vehicle behind.
I'm moving on to new territory''.
Robison admitted he killed five people in neighboring cottages near Lake Worth in 1982.
One of the victims was Rickey Lee Bryant, 31, Robison's lover and roommate, who was shot twice in the head, decapitated, slashed eight times and stabbed.
Robison said he ate the man's testicles.
His case was considered by many critics an example of the problems with the state's treatment of the mentally ill.
Before the killings, Robison had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, but he was not considered violent and had been released from several public hospitals.
He pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, but a jury convicted him and sentenced him to death.
There have been questions all along about the depth and seriousness of George W.
Bush. They have been brought into sharp focus now by a surprising issue: the way the death penalty is administered in Texas.
In his comments on that subject Bush has defined himself, unforgettably, as shallow and callous.
In his five years as governor of Texas, the state has executed 131 prisoners _ far more than any other state.
Bush has lately granted a stay of execution for the first time, for a DNA test.
In answer to questions about that record, Bush has repeatedly said that he has no qualms.
``I'm confident,'' he said last February, ``that every person that has been put to death in Texas under my watch has been guilty of the crime charged, and has had full access to the courts''.
That defense of the record ignores many notorious examples of unfairness in Texas death penalty cases.
Lawyers have been under the influence of cocaine during the trial, or been drunk or asleep.
One court dismissed a complaint about a lawyer who slept through a trial with the comment that courts are not ``obligated to either constantly monitor trial counsel's wakefulness or endeavor to wake counsel should he fall asleep''.
This past week The Chicago Tribune published a compelling report on an investigation of all 131 death cases in Bush's time.
It made chilling reading.
In one-third of those cases, the report showed, the lawyer who represented the death penalty defendant at trial or on appeal had been or was later disbarred or otherwise sanctioned.
In 40 cases the lawyers presented no evidence at all or only one witness at the sentencing phase of the trial.
In 29 cases, the prosecution used testimony from a psychiatrist who _ based on a hypothetical question about the defendant's past _ predicted he would commit future violence.
Most of those psychiatrists testified without having examined the defendant: a practice condemned professionally as unethical.
Other witnesses included one who was temporarily released from a psychiatric ward to testify, a pathologist who had admitted faking autopsies and a judge who had been reprimanded for lying about his credentials.
Asked about the Tribune study, Bush said, ``We've adequately answered innocence or guilt'' in every case.
The defendants, he said, ``had full access to a fair trial''.
There are two ways of understanding that comment.
Either Bush was contemptuous of the facts or, on a matter of life and death, he did not care.
At the heart of the problem is the Texas way of providing lawyers for defendants too poor to hire their own, as most are in death cases.
There is no state system.
Judges assign lawyers _ often lawyers who have contributed to their election campaigns.
``The State of Texas is a national embarrassment in the area of indigent legal services,'' a committee of the State Bar of Texas says in a report just approved.
Again, Bush has shown no concern about this reality.
He vetoed a bill, passed by the legislature, that would have let Texas counties set up a limited public defender program for the poor.
Capital punishment, long favored by a majority of Americans, has become a national issue again because of concern about the fairness of its administration.
Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican, imposed a moratorium on executions in that state after 13 men on death row were shown to be innocent.
Pat Robertson and other conservatives have called for a national moratorium.
The most complete study ever done of the death penalty process, by Professor James Liebman and others at Columbia University, was published the other day.
It showed that two-thirds of death convictions or sentences were upset on appeal for such reasons as incompetent defense lawyers or prosecutors who bent the rules.
To all this George Bush is seemingly indifferent.
Or perhaps not entirely.
If he were not running for president, it is doubtful that he would just now have granted his first stay of execution.
Next week Gary Graham, convicted of murder on the testimony of a single witness who said she saw him at night from 30 to 40 feet away, is due to be executed.
Will Bush care?
AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov.
George W.
Bush followed his parole board's advice Friday and halted Tuesday's planned execution of Henry Lee Lucas, saying that too many doubts persist about the confessed killer's guilt in the case that sent him to Death Row.
``I take every death penalty case seriously and review each case carefully,'' Bush said in a written statement.
``The first question I ask in every case is whether there is any doubt about the individual's guilt or innocence.
``This is the first case since I have been the governor when the answer to that question is `Yes'.
'' Lucas, 61, once confessed to 600 killings.
He was scheduled to die in Huntsville for the Halloween 1979 rape and strangulation of a still-unidentified woman whose almost-nude body was found near Interstate 35 in Williamson County.
But, as in many of the slayings Lucas admitted to, evidence later emerged suggesting that the drifter was nowhere near when the crime was committed.
Bush's decision means that the oldest inmate on Huntsville's Death Row will soon be transferred to the prison system's diagnostic center, where he will undergo psychological evaluation and other tests before being permanently reassigned.
``I can only thank them for believing the truth and having the guts to stand up for what's right,'' Lucas said in a statement released by prison officials.
Bush's decision does not give Lucas hope for regaining his freedom.
He is serving six other life sentences, and 210 years in prison for nine other murders.
A murder charge pending in Florida could earn him the death penalty if he were to obtain parole or a pardon in Texas.
Bush, a staunch defender of the death penalty, has not intervened in the imminent execution of inmate since taking office 3 1/2 years ago.
In February, he declined to stop the execution of Karla Faye Tucker, who professed a conversion to Christianity and publicly expressed remorse for her part in using a pickax to hack to death a couple in Houston.
Numerous religious leaders, including Pope John Paul II, called for Tucker to be spared.
Bush said he allowed the execution to go forward because she was undeniably guilty.
Tucker, who never claimed innocence, became the first woman to be executed in Texas since the Civil War.
Bush raised concerns this month about whether Lucas should be executed after former Attorney General Jim Mattox cited a 1986 investigation by his office, which showed that the condemned man was probably in Florida when the 1979 Texas murder occurred.
Mattox, a Democrat who is again running for attorney general, and Bush, a Republican, said Lucas is guilty of other crimes and should never be released from prison.
But carrying out the execution for a case in which guilt is not absolutely certain would be abhorrent, both said.
``Governor Bush's decision will make our death penalty punishment stronger than ever,'' said Mattox, who added that police should reopen cases in which Lucas made confessions.
``But it was still politically risky, and I'd be glad to stand up and defend him against attack''.
Bush's first rebuke came from fellow Republican John Cornyn, who is running against Mattox in the attorney general's race.
``I have confidence both in the jury who heard this case and in the 23 (appellate) judges who reviewed the evidence,'' said Cornyn, a former Texas Supreme Court Justice.
``I believe their decision should be respected and their sentence carried out''.
A spokesman for Democrat Garry Mauro, Bush's opponent in November's election, said the governor may see some political fallout from his actions.
``The initial downside for Bush is whether or not the Christian Coalition decides to call him a fraud because he wouldn't get involved with the parole board with Karla Faye Tucker, but he's following Jim Mattox's lead on Henry Lee Lucas,'' said Joe Cutbirth, Mauro's spokesman.
Bush's decision in the Lucas case, made public 24 hours after the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles announced its recommendation, caps one of Texas' most bizarre crime sagas.
Lucas, a drifter who had served time in Michigan for killing his mother, was arrested in Montague County, Texas, in June 1983 for being an ex-con with a weapon.
While in jail, he confessed to killing an elderly woman who had disappeared from her home in Ringgold.
He also told the sheriff that he had killed a 15-year-old girl who had hitchhiked with him on trips across the South and West.
Other confessions followed, and soon Lucas' tally of death numbered in the hundreds.
Almost all were later proved to have been hoaxes, but Williamson County officials prosecuted him for the 1979 slaying and secured the death penalty.

HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- The Texas parole board refused to block the execution Thursday of Gary Graham in the most contentious death penalty case to confront Gov.
George W.
Bush since he announced his run for the White House.
But several last-minute court appeals delayed the execution.
Late appeals failed in the Supreme Court on a 5-4 vote and in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.
Graham's attorneys then tried to win a civil action challenging the constitutionality of the Texas clemency process; a federal judge ruled he did not have jurisdiction.
Appeals courts had already rejected Graham's arguments that he was convicted on shaky evidence from a single eyewitness and that his trial lawyer did a poor job.
Bush said he supported the parole board's decision and pointed out that Graham's case had been reviewed more than 20 times by state and federal courts.
''After considering all of the facts I am convinced justice is being done,'' Bush said after the appeals were denied.
''May God bless the victim, the family of the victim, and may God bless Mr.
Graham''. Graham, 36, was convicted of killing a man in a holdup outside a Houston supermarket one night in 1981.
He pleaded guilty to 10 robberies around the same time but said he was innocent of the murder.
''Because of human error and human frailty, we are about to put to death a man who is innocent,'' said Richard Burr, another of Graham's attorneys.
The Bush-appointed parole board, which has spared a prisoner only once during the Republican's tenure, could have granted a 120-day reprieve, a commutation to a lesser sentence, or a conditional pardon.
''I can say, unequivocally, that the board's decision not to recommend clemency was reached after a complete and unbiased review of the petition and evidence submitted,'' board chairman Gerald Garrett said, hours before the execution was to take place.
Immediately after the vote was announced, protesters outside the prison in Huntsville began chanting: ''Murderers, murderers''.
A woman who claimed to be Graham's daughter sobbed in the arms of a friend.
Hundreds of officers outnumbered protesters -- most of them supporters of Graham -- who gathered in stifling heat and humidity near the brick prison where 221 executions have been carried out since capital punishment resumed in Texas in 1982.
The total is by far the highest in the nation.
Graham had vowed to ''fight like hell'' on the trip to the death chamber.
In the hours leading up to the execution, he refused meals but met for about an hour with the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, whom he designated his spiritual adviser, his stepmother and Bianca Jagger of Amnesty International.
Jackson said he and Graham talked and prayed.
''He was amazingly upbeat,'' Jackson said.
''There were no tears shed.
He had a sense of inner peace.
He feels he was being used as a kind of change agent to expose the system.
With every passing hour...
there is mass education around the world about what is happening in Texas''.
Graham resisted when he was moved late Wednesday from death row to the death house in downtown Huntsville.
Several officers had to hold Graham down to apply the restraints, said Larry Fitzgerald, Department of Criminal Justice spokesman.
Bush had no authority to halt the execution without a majority vote from the 18-member parole board.
The governor does have the power to grant a one-time 30-day reprieve in death penalty cases, but Graham had already received one in 1993 from Bush's predecessor.
Bush had said he would treat the case no differently than any other he has considered.
During the governor's 5&AMP;frac12; years in office, 132 men and two women were executed before Graham.
Two years ago, Bush told the parole board to review the case of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas because of questions about Lucas's conviction.
His death sentence eventually was commuted to life.
This month, Bush granted a condemned man a 30-day reprieve so that he could pursue DNA tests.
The governor sent no similar messages about Graham's case.
The debate over Graham's case came amid growing questions about the death penalty.
Illinois Gov.
George Ryan has placed a moratorium on executions, and Bush and Vice President Al Gore have been forced to address the issue as they campaign for president.
Graham's case brought the loudest protests since pickax killer Karla Faye Tucker was executed in 1998, the first woman put to death in Texas since the Civil War era.
Six people were arrested outside the prison Thursday for breaking through police lines; other activists burned American flags.
Another 150 people protested outside the governor's mansion in Austin.
No physical evidence tied Graham to the killing of 53-year-old Bobby Lambert, and ballistics tests showed that the gun he had when he was arrested was not the murder weapon.
But the witness who identified him, Bernadine Skillern, has never wavered.
Skillern, who was waiting in her car outside the supermarket while her daughter ran inside, saw the holdup from about 30 feet away.
She identified Graham as the shooter and said the lighting in the parking lot was adequate.
Graham also argued that his lawyer during the trial, Ron Mock, should have introduced other witnesses who would say he was not the killer.
But those witnesses initially told police they couldn't identify the killer, and prosecutors said they were not actual eyewitnesses.
Bush acknowledged the protests but said he had to uphold the laws of Texas.
''I recognize there are good people who oppose the death penalty,'' he said.
''I've heard their message and I respect their heartfelt point of view''.

(UNDATED) _ It's too easy to get angry about the death penalty in America.
Last week, they took an old woman in Texas from her cell on a gurney to inject her with a lethal chemical that killed her instantly; and predictably enough, a lot of people _ especially in Europe _ were agitated.
It's too easy because it feeds on all of the usual cliches about the U.S.: frontier justice, Hollywood violence, guns'n'God.
And it doesn't do any good.
They don't take much notice of what the Europeans think about most things at the best of time, over here.
There is overwhelming support for the death penalty _ though it has declined, two-thirds of America supports capital punishment.
In the same way, it's too easy to get angry about Governor George W.
Bush deciding to take another life in a state that seems to so enjoy its executions.
After all, the man was obeying the laws of Texas, which were made before he entered government.
He was only doing what most people in his state expected, just as President Bill Clinton did when he was Governor of Arkansas.
Why, Governor Bush even took a day off the campaign trail to think about it.
Bush was certainly not stirred by any of the protests made to him about the execution of Betty Lou Beets, from abroad or at home.
And there isn't much doubt that Mrs.
Beets was guilty of the crime she was charged with, killing her husband; she wasn't the best exemplar for the anti-death penalty lobby in America.
Nonetheless, one can wonder what the point of taking her life was: whether in the end, the sum of human existence was served by killing an old woman.
It may be a matter of moral reflex rather than practical politics to denounce the way that America reaches for the needle or the switch, but sometimes, things that are easy are worth doing anyway.
The death penalty is wrong: we decided that in Britain decades ago.
It's as well to be clear about why it is so.
The taking of life itself is not always wrong, after all.
We accept that we may do it in certain circumstances, to defend ourselves, for instance.
And we expect others to do it on our behalf when it is necessary to safeguard our own lives or to achieve some greater good.
But the taking of a life, if it is to happen, is supposed to involve some careful consideration and some clear moral goal.
Anything else is lynching.
The Christian Conservatives, with whom Bush has been making such good friends over the last few weeks as he seeks election, want to post the Ten Commandments on the walls of government buildings.
The first of those is pretty clear: thou shalt not kill.
It is a commandment.
It really is set in stone, and you had better have some very good reasons if you decide to transcend it.
There is little or no evidence that capital punishment stops killing.
In America, the murder rate exploded in the two decades after execution was reintroduced in the 1970s; now it is declining again.
There is no statistical relationship.
Any consideration of the rationale of execution is bound to end in the conclusion that what is at stake here is simple retribution.
But then there is no consideration.
Indeed the legal process permits people to be executed with a casualness that is shocking.
Even if you accept the case for capital punishment, the process that leads to execution should be a stiff assault course.
But it has become more of a swift drive with the windows up through the legal slums.
Many on Death Row have lawyers who fall asleep in court, fail to call witnesses, or just spend the duration of the case drunk.
Innocent people are almost certainly being killed because of the death penalty.
Since it was reinstated, 84 people have been released from Death Row _ and those were the ones whose cases have drawn interest.
More than 600 people have died.
How many of them were innocent?
Now that they are dead, will we ever know?
This dreadful blindness to justice fosters a lethal cynicism.
Governor Bush, asked about the execution of the murderess Karla Faye Tucker in an interview with Talk magazine last year, casually discussed how she had pleaded for mercy in her final hours in words that have been frequently quoted since.
``Please,'' Bush whimpers, his lips pursed in mock desperation, ``don't kill me''.
I do not think that Bush is an especially cruel man, and I won't blame him for the explosion of state killing.
The point is that for governors across America, and for the nation as a whole, taking a life has become just too easy.
They do not even bother to think again before they do it: the governors just unscrew the pen and sign away as the pieces of paper come across their desks.
No one in high office questions it: that would be too hard.
One man, the governor of Illinois, has questioned it, however.
Illinois has even gone so far as to suspend capital punishment because more than half the most recent cases it had considered had ended with the conviction overturned.
There is a movement against execution in America, low-key but it is growing in intensity.
So that's the argument; it's over now.
Betty Lou Beets is dead.
But that isn't the end of the story, of course: in Texas alone there are Odell Barnes, Ponchai Wilkerson, Timothy Gribble and Dennis Bagwell, all ready to make that journey next month.
There are more than 3,000 on Death Row across the country.
And America can, and may, kill all of them: it's just that easy.

According to the article, ``Serious debate about how the death penalty is administered in America has begun to percolate for the first time in years _ a newly nuanced discussion that is spilling over into Campaign 2000 and will likely dog Bush's campaign from now until election day''.
Dog? Spill?
Percolate? These are the telltale verbs of a self-concealing journalist.
Once again, the media are driving a story to embarrass George W.
Bush _ and using the pretense of objectivity to cover it up.
Last year's media-driven controversy was whether Bush had used cocaine.
Reporters kept saying the cocaine question was ``dogging'' Bush, as though the question had a life of its own.
But questions don't dog politicians, reporters do.
That maxim bears repeating amid the current frenzy over Bush's use of capital punishment.
Debates don't dog politicians, much less percolate or spill onto them.
Journalists help decide when to brew those debates and where to pour them.
The press is well out of step with public opinion on the death penalty.
Reporters claim that ``America'' is ``rethinking'' the issue.
But while elite journalists overwhelmingly oppose the death penalty, polls show that two-thirds of Americans still support it.
And while the public's concerns are largely confined to whether some people on death row might be innocent, most journalists oppose capital punishment anyway, either in principle or because they believe its application is racially discriminatory.
They think it's outrageous that Texas, under Bush, has executed more than 130 convicted murderers.
They want to embarrass Bush and halt capital punishment by exposing flaws in the Texas system.
For months, out-of-state reporters have scoured Texas for evidence of dubious murder convictions.
Newspapers and newsmagazines have churned out article after article to keep the story going.
In the past month, The New York Times has published a dozen major stories on the death penalty and the Texas system.
The Chicago Tribune issued a press release promoting its front-page investigation (headline: ``Flawed Trials Lead to Death Chamber; Bush Confident in System Rife With Problems'').
The Los Angeles Times sent a reporter to New Orleans to cover a federal appeals court hearing on a screwy Texas case.
When appellate courts find errors committed by trial courts, the press cries scandal.
When appellate courts don't find errors committed by trial courts, the press cries scandal again.
Look at the June 12 Tribune.
While the article on Page 7 protests that two-thirds of the nation's death penalty cases ``were thrown out by higher courts or sent back for reconsideration,'' the article on the front page (''Justices Prove Reluctant to Nullify Cases'') protests that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals often fails to ``acknowledge holes in the prosecution's case''.
To obscure their zeal, journalists invoke the passive voice.
``New questions are being raised about capital punishment,'' says a CNN report.
``Texas Lawyer's Death Row Record a Concern,'' adds the New York Times.
Whose questions?
Whose concerns?
Not the reporter's.
Now that Bush is the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, the case of death row prisoner Ricky McGinn ``has begun to take on political significance,'' says The New York Times.
Not that any editor assigned the case such significance, mind you.
The case simply ``took it on''.
The Times of London agrees that McGinn ``brought the death penalty issue into the presidential campaign''.
How McGinn performed this delivery from his prison cell remains a mystery.
Every newspaper assault on Bush includes the obligatory ``scrutiny'' paragraph.
The lines hardly vary.
``Texas' death penalty system has come under increased scrutiny since Bush announced his presidential candidacy,'' says the Tribune.
``Texas's vigorous death penalty system is under close scrutiny because of Bush's presidential campaign,'' says The Washington Post.
``With Mr.
Bush as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, capital punishment in Texas is under heightened scrutiny,'' says The New York Times.
Who's heightening all this scrutiny?
The cases themselves are doing it.
The upcoming execution of inmate Gary Graham ``is the latest high-profile death penalty case to focus attention on Gov.
George W.
Bush and how the death penalty is administered in his state,'' says the Times.
The issue doesn't just hound Bush (He's ``been dogged by his remarks about Karla Faye Tucker, a Texas inmate executed early last year,'' according to The Philadelphia Inquirer).
It creeps up on him (he gave McGinn a reprieve ``against a backdrop of creeping unease over capital punishment,'' says Time) and occasionally attacks him ('' '81 Death Penalty Case Confronts Bush,'' says the Post).
It has even arrested him.
``The Death Penalty on Trial,'' announces Newsweek's June 12 cover story.
``The death penalty is in the dock,'' and ``capital punishment in Texas is in the cross hairs this political season''.
Whose cross hairs?
Whose courtroom?
Newsweek doesn't say.
Evidently, Bush brought all this on himself.
First he ran for president.
``Bush Candidacy Puts Focus on Executions,'' reported The New York Times.
Then he hinted at a reprieve for McGinn.
``Talk of Reprieve -- Brings Death Penalty Issue to Campaign Fore,'' responded The Los Angeles Times.
Then he went through with the reprieve, prompting CBS anchor Bob Schieffer to conclude that Bush had ``rekindled the debate on the death penalty'' and had ``put the focus on this whole idea of DNA testing and whether people on death row have been correctly defended''.
Bush, not the fourth estate, kept the fire going and the issue in focus.
Yes, the Texas criminal justice system is riddled with flaws.
Yes, there's an uncomfortably high probability that it has executed an innocent person.
But there's an even greater probability that it has failed to bring hundreds of real killers to justice.
The same is true of other states.
The difference is, journalists aren't writing those stories.
We're writing this one.
That's our decision.
And we ought to admit it.

HOUSTON _ George W.
Bush had not quite finished his second week as governor of Texas in 1995 when the first death penalty cases of his administration landed on his desk.
They would make for quite an initiation: Two executions were scheduled for Jan.
31, a rare event known on death row as a doubleheader.
Because he would be out of Texas that day, Bush reviewed the inmates' clemency appeals with his legal staff, approved the executions and instructed the lieutenant governor to proceed in his absence.
The two convicted murderers, Clifton Russell and Willie Williams, became the first inmates put to death under Bush, though hardly the last.
In his five years as governor, Bush has presided over the executions of 111 men and one woman, far more than any other governor in any other state since the U.S.
Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.
Texas leads the nation in putting inmates to death, and in 1997 the state executed four inmates in one week, eight in one month and 37 for the year _ all modern records.
For governors in most states, the grim job of approving an execution is a rare exercise.
For Bush, capital punishment has helped define him as a politician.
By any measure, his commitment to capital punishment is unquestioned.
But as he campaigns for president, his death penalty record offers insight into his distinct views of mercy and justice.
In his two most controversial cases, Bush allowed the execution of a repentant born-again Christian, despite appeals from religious leaders, including the pope, but stayed the execution of a confessed serial killer who appeared to have been wrongly convicted of the slaying for which he had been sentenced to die _ evidence, Bush's admirers say, of his willingness to make difficult choices based on principle.
In Texas, which led the nation in executions before Bush took office, public support for capital punishment is wide and deep.
By law, the governor cannot unilaterally commute a death sentence.
But Bush has appointed every member of the parole board that can make that decision.
He signed a law speeding the appeals process _ and, therefore, executions _ and resisted efforts to change Texas' much criticized clemency process.
The governor's critics describe the Texas system for capital crimes as the most unfair and merciless of the 38 states with a death penalty, saying it deprives the accused of adequate legal aid and appeals.
Other states, including Florida, where Bush's brother, Jeb Bush, is governor, see Texas as a model of efficiency.
George W.
Bush's own actions and statements have made clear a firm philosophy on death row justice: with almost no exceptions, the punishment must be meted out.
``All I can tell you,'' Bush said in 1998, ``is that for the four years I've been governor, I am confident we have not executed an innocent person, and I'm confident that the system has worked to make sure there is full access to the courts''.
This month, as Bush campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination in Iowa and New Hampshire, seven Texas inmates are scheduled to be put to death, including one who committed his crime as a 17-year-old.
Another, whose lawyers tried but failed to have declared incompetent for execution, will be put to death on the night of the full moon, at his request.
Whether the steady beat of executions will cause disquiet for Bush on the campaign trail is far from certain.
The potential for distasteful headlines became apparent in December when Texas officials chose to remove a hospitalized inmate from intensive care, where he had been taken after a suicide attempt, and fly him directly to the death chamber, rather than stay his execution.
``The death penalty is certainly popular in Texas, but as it's practiced, it seems extreme compared to the rest of the country,'' said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, a group often critical of the way capital punishment is administered.
But conventional political wisdom holds that a politician cannot be too supportive of the death penalty, when polls say that nearly three out of four Americans favor it.
In the 1992 Democratic primaries, Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, interrupted campaigning to approve the execution of a brain-damaged murderer.
This year, every presidential candidate supports capital punishment.
Eric Sterling, president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation in Washington, said politicians know that the public's sympathy for convicts is very limited.
The public, he said, also pays little attention to the problems faced by many poor defendants, most notably in getting adequate representation.
``I don't think voters care,'' said Sterling, whose group studies criminal justice issues.
``The public, I think, feels that accused defendants get the benefit of all kinds of `rights'''.
He predicted that the executions would not cost Bush votes or undermine his campaign theme of ``compassionate conservatism''.
``Compassionate means that the role of government is to help those who are innocent and deserving,'' he said in analyzing Bush's strategy.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) THE PROCESS: A SMOOTHER PATH TO DEATH CHAMBER &QL; In the 23 years since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment, states have executed 598 people, including 3 women, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Texas, which puts murderers to death by lethal injection, has accounted for 199.
Virginia is second with 73 and Florida third with 44.
The rate of executions in Texas has increased since Bush took office, for several reasons.
A handful of Supreme Court rulings began to curb appeals and break the backlog on death row.
In 1996, President Clinton signed a federal law further streamlining the appeals process; in 1995, Bush signed a similar state law, described by some lawmakers as the ``speed up the juice'' law.
This law did require the state, for the first time, to pay for lawyers appealing convictions of indigent people in capital cases.
Unlike in some states, Texas' governor is limited in granting clemency.
The 18-member Board of Pardons and Paroles approves or denies all clemency applications, and the governor can grant clemency only if the board recommends it.
Otherwise, he must either approve the execution or grant a 30-day stay.
But the governor does appoint the parole board and sets a tone.
nn ``Bush has maintained a relatively removed posture,'' said former Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox, a Democrat.
``The paroles board stands between him and the process, but there's no doubt if the governor tells the paroles board what he wants done, they do it''.
Bush's first general counsel, Al Gonzales, said his legal staff assessed each death penalty case to brief the governor.
Then, as now, Bush had two criteria for considering clemency: Is there any doubt about guilt?
Has the inmate had full access to the courts?
Some inmates did not seek clemency, and their briefings might take only 15 minutes.
Usually, Gonzales said, they took half an hour.
For 16 executions over the past five years, Bush has been out of state, and the highest-ranking state official presided, with the governor's approval.
``It's difficult to say those kinds of things were routine, but we had become quite efficient,'' recalled Gonzales, now a state Supreme Court justice.
``Many of them were pretty cut and dried''.
Bush campaigned as a law-and-order conservative, and he has called the death penalty a deterrent to crime.
His stance has brought him praise from the relatives of many victims.
Bush's first year in office ended with a record 19 executions, more than a third of the national total.
The number dropped to three in 1996 because of a lawsuit challenging the Texas system.
In 1997, after the challenge failed, the death chamber in Huntsville established the current yearly record of 37.
Executions became so common that the public and much of the news media ceased to pay much attention.
That changed in 1998 with Karla Faye Tucker and Henry Lee Lucas.
THE PRESSURE: Toughest Calls On Clemency In his recent autobiography, ``A Charge to Keep,'' Bush describes decisions about executions as ``by far the most profound'' that a governor can make.
He had approved 58 before Karla Faye Tucker, but it was Ms.
Tucker, he wrote, who ``put a face'' on the death penalty for him.
Convicted for her role in two slayings, Ms.
Tucker had undergone a death row conversion to Christianity, married the prison chaplain and become a model inmate.
Evangelical Christians seized on her story as proof of the transforming power of God, and religious leaders from the Rev.
Pat Robertson to Pope John Paul II called on Bush to grant clemency.
The calls for forgiveness, particularly from religious leaders, touched a familiar theme for Bush.
He had frequently cited his own religious reawakening in helping him swear off alcohol and right the course of his own life.
In a recent Republican debate, he named Jesus as the political philosopher who had most influenced his life.
Ms. Tucker did not argue that she was innocent or that she had been deprived of her legal rights.
She asked for mercy as reward for a life redeemed through faith.
Her advocates said that a life sentence would allow her to minister to others in prison and reinforce the message that even the worst prisoners can be rehabilitated.
In an appearance on CNN with Larry King that Bush watched, Ms.
Tucker asked the governor to spare her life.
He did not.
In a tense news conference before the scheduled execution, Bush cited his duty to carry it out.
``My responsibility is to ensure our laws are enforced fairly and evenly without preference or special treatment,'' he said.
He also hinted at more spiritual issues.
Saying he had prayed before reaching his decision, Bush suggested that he did not regard mercy or rehabilitation as cause for relief.
``I have concluded judgments about the heart and soul of an individual on death row are best left to a higher authority,'' he said.
The Tucker case resurfaced unexpectedly in the early stages of the presidential campaign.
In an interview in Talk Magazine, Bush was portrayed as mocking Ms.
Tucker's appearance with King, imitating her in a whimpering voice.
Aides to Bush said the reporter misread the governor's comments; the magazine stood by the article.
In his autobiography, published after the Talk article, Bush described feeling ``like a huge piece of concrete was crushing me'' as he waited with aides for Ms.
Tucker's execution.
He described it as ``the longest 20 minutes of my tenure as governor''.
The case of Henry Lee Lucas a few months later presented a different challenge.
A drifter, Lucas had been arrested in the 1980s and confessed to more than 600 killings across the country.
One was the 1979 slaying of a woman found near Austin, naked except for orange socks.
Based on Lucas' confession, which he tried to recant before trial, a jury convicted him and sentenced him to death.
With the execution set for summer 1998, Mattox, the former attorney general, who was running for the office again, wrote a newspaper opinion piece calling on Bush to spare Lucas.
A decade earlier, Mattox's investigators had determined that Lucas was guilty of only three slayings and that the rest of the confessions had been lies encouraged by law-enforcement officials.
Mattox said his investigators had established that Lucas was in Florida at the time of the ``orange socks'' murder.
Other newspaper articles raised more questions, even as prosecutors vehemently maintained Lucas' guilt.
At a June 15 news conference, Bush said that his office and the paroles board would have to give the case a very thorough review _ a comment some interpreted as a signal to the board.
Ten days later, the board voted to recommend clemency for the first time under Bush, and the governor commuted Lucas' sentence to life in prison.
``I take this action so that all Texans can continue to trust the integrity and fairness of our criminal justice system,'' Bush said.
Bush's (VR)admirers said his decisions on the Tucker and Lucas cases confirmed that he is an unconventional politician who will act on principle in the face of outside pressure.
Mattox, who supports the death penalty but is not a political ally of Bush, credits the governor for acting ``as a matter of conscience'' on the Lucas case.
``He could have allowed the execution, and if he did, he probably wouldn't have offended very many people,'' Mattox said.
He added, ``The last thing a governor wants to do, particularly one who has executed so many people, is to execute someone who is not guilty''.
nn THE DEBATE: INDIGENT DEFENDANTS FOCUS OF ATTENTION One thing that became clear from the Tucker and Lucas cases was how unclear Texas' clemency process was.
For years, death penalty opponents and capital defense lawyers had criticized the system without eliciting much sympathy or support.
In 1997, Amnesty International had declared that it violated international human rights standards.
But after the Tucker and Lucas cases, newspapers across the state editorialized for change.
As it turned out, one obstacle to change would be Bush.
The Dallas Morning News, the state's leading newspaper, noted that the clemency process was shrouded in secrecy.
The 18-member paroles board did not meet to discuss applications.
Instead, members reviewed cases separately and faxed in their votes from across the state.
The board operated without guidelines and offered no explanation of its decisions.
Early last year, Judge Sam Sparks of U.S.
District Court in Austin found that the Texas clemency system did meet the ``minimal procedural safeguards'' required by the U.S.
Supreme Court.
But in his opinion, the judge criticized the process, writing: ``It is abundantly clear the Texas clemency procedure is extremely poor and certainly minimal.
Legislatively, there is a dearth of meaningful procedure.
Administratively, the goal is more to protect the secrecy and autonomy of the system rather than carrying out an efficient legally sound system.
The board would not have to sacrifice its conservative ideology to carry out its duties in a more fair and accurate fashion''.
Before the 1999 legislative session, state Rep.
Elliott Naishstat, a Democrat from Austin, filed two bills that would require the Board of Pardons and Paroles to consider clemency appeals in public meetings and to consider issues such as rehabilitation.
But in an interview with The Austin American-Statesman, Bush said, ``It's going to have to take an awfully compelling argument for me to support the change''.
Public clemency meetings, he warned, might create ``a chance for people to rant and rail, a chance for people to emotionalize the process beyond the questions that need to be asked''.
Both of Naishstat's bills died in the legislative session.
``The governor's office did not want the clemency procedure in Texas changed,'' Naishstat said in a recent interview.
In the same session, Bush also spoke out against a bill offered by state Sen.
Rodney Ellis, a Democrat from Houston, that would have banned executions of mentally retarded inmates.
That bill ultimately died, as well.
A bill the Legislature did pass, unanimously, would have given county governments more authority to establish public defender systems, rather than local judges, and required that indigent defendants be appointed counsels within 20 days.
Unlike some states, Texas does not have a statewide public defender system; normally, elected judges in each county appoint lawyers, including campaign contributors, to represent poor defendants.
Last year, a Houston Chronicle investigation found that defendants with appointed lawyers in Harris County, which includes Houston, were twice as likely to go to jail as those who could afford to hire lawyers.
Harris has more inmates on death row than any other county.
In October, a federal district judge set aside a death sentence against Calvin Jerold Burdine because his lawyer slept throughout much of the trial, held in Harris County.
But Bush vetoed Ellis' bill.
The governor said it would not improve legal counsel for the poor and and that the 20-day limit could allow someone to be released improperly from jail.
WASHINGTON _ Convicted murderer Gary Graham, set to be executed today in Huntsville, is hitting Gov.
George W.
Bush's presidential campaign with its greatest challenge since Arizona Sen.
John McCain put up a dramatic primary fight.
``Every campaign is faced with a major issue, either planned or unplanned, and it appears that Bush is being faced with his first major issue with this death penalty controversy,'' said Scott Reed, former campaign manager of Sen.
Bob Dole's 1996 White House bid.
``How he handles this will be one of the three or four deciding factors on election day.
I put it up there with the vice-presidential selection, the convention and the debates, big events that affect the way the world looks at the candidate''.
Bush told CNN Wednesday that he would, ``uphold the laws of the land and if it costs me politically, it costs me politically''.
But with the world watching, the 18-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, all Bush appointees, have taken the unusual step of delaying a decision on Graham's fate until noon today.
Under Texas law, Bush can accept or veto board recommendations to pardon Graham or commute his sentence.
He cannot spare Graham's life against the board's wishes because former Gov.
Ann Richards already did that in Graham's case in 1993.
The board has recommended a death sentence be commuted to life in prison only once and Bush accepted that recommendation.
Graham's conviction, based on the testimony of a single eyewitness, has been grabbing media attention for the past several week.
It has been driven by newspaper reports questioning the fairness of Texas' justice system; reports of innocent men set free thanks to DNA testing; and a Columbia University study that found two-thirds of death sentences in the past 23 years have been overturned on appeal.
In addition, the Rev.
Pat Robertson and conservative columnist George Will have called for a reassessment of the death penalty.
The Rev.
Jesse Jackson and human rights activist Bianca Jagger joined protestors in Austin to support Graham as death penalty opponents heckled Bush on the stump.
Nationally, death penalty support, still strong, has softened since 1980.
Texans, however, continue to firmly back the ultimate punishment, despite concerns that the state has executed innocent people and expressions of strong support by Texans for making DNA testing available to inmates, according to a Scripps Howard Texas poll released today.
The survey of 1,000 Texans, conducted May 22-June 16, showed 73 percent in favor of the death penalty, consistent with national polls.
Seventy-two percent still favored it even when presented with true life imprisonment as an alternative.
But 57 percent also said they believe that Texas has executed innocent inmates.
Thirty-eight percent said that the state's image benefits from its frequent use of capital punishment.
Texas leads the nation in executions.
``What was a little surprising to me is the number of people who think Texas has executed innocent people,'' said poll director Ty Meighan.
``I think that's more a criticism of the criminal justice system.
Perhaps people think that some of these inmates are not getting a fair trial or they don't have the proper legal representation''.
Seventy-six percent of the respondents said Texas should declare a moratorium on death sentences for inmates whose cases might be affected by DNA testing.
Eighty-seven percent said the testing should be available to inmates at no charge.
Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said Bush weakens his credibility when he insists that all 134 inmates executed on his watch have been guilty.
He said Vice President Gore, a death penalty supporter, has nothing to gain by speaking out.
But in one of his few statements on the issue, Gore said Wednesday that a moratorium on executions is the right thing for states with numerous criminal justice errors.
He said he did not know the record in Texas, pointing instead to Illinois.
``This is really a situation, to use the metaphor, of Bush hanging himself,'' Mellman said.
``The reality is the public still supports the death penalty, but the level of support is shrinking and shrinking fairly dramatically...Given what's happened in science and what's been revealed in these studies of the death penalty, for anybody to say they're 100 percent sure that everyone put to death has been guilty is ignorant''.
Republican Illinois Gov.
George Ryan suspended executions after 13 death row inmates were exonerated and released.
Recently, Bush granted his first-ever 30-day reprieve so that the inmate, Ricky McGinn, could get further DNA testing.
Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas law professor, said what Bush does today and later matters less in political terms than how he does it.
``This has not to do with Bush's chances to win the presidency so much as it is another opportunity for him to show whether or not he can seem brave and serious enough when he talks about these matters,'' Buchanan said.
This is particularly true since this issue will not fade away for Bush: at least 16 Texas inmates are scheduled to be executed by the November election.
Last year, conservative writer Tucker Carlson quoted Bush mocking Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman executed since the Civil War, who was convicted of the ax-killing of two people.
Tucker, a white woman who never contested her guilt, asked to be spared because she found religion and redemption on death row.
Graham, a black man with a string of crimes behind him, does not pose the same sort of public relations problem.
Houston police accused him of 22 crimes.
He pleaded guilty to 10 armed robberies.
Victim David Spiers was left unable to walk for two years after Graham shot him during a robbery.
A female victim who was 57 in 1981 was robbed, abducted, and repeatedly raped by Graham.
Today, the ninth-grade dropout's fate hangs on his conviction in the murder of Bobby Lambert, shot in 1981 as he walked outside a Safeway, groceries in his arms.
As he weighs the facts, Bush needs to show the world his heart, Buchanan said.
``He's not comfortable talking about his serious, inner processes publicly so he sticks to a script,'' he said.
``In certain instances that won't reflect well on him''.
Gov. George W.
Bush's options in Gary Graham's execution: He cannot issue a 30-day reprieve.
Graham received the one reprieve he is allowed by law from Gov.
Ann Richards in 1993.
He cannot halt the execution unless the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles first recommends a reprieve, commutation to a life sentence, or a pardon.
He cannot overrule a board vote to proceed with the execution.
He can veto a board vote to grant a reprieve, commutation, or pardon _ and order the execution to proceed.

Story Filed By Cox Newspapers For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service
AUSTIN, Texas _ Knocked by death penalty protesters while on the presidential campaign trail, Texas Gov.
George W.
Bush isn't likely to lose votes because of his support of the death penalty, political analysts say.
``This is not a burning issue.
It's momentarily an issue because the media doesn't have anything else to talk about,'' said Mark Petracca, chairman of the political science department at the University of California at Irvine.
Speaking from a state where Bush is fighting hard against Democratic Vice President Al Gore, Petracca predicted the Gary Graham story would disappear from newspapers' front pages with ``the first airplane tragedy of the summer or boating tragedy or celebrity killed or celebrity divorced''.
``Bush has got the standard right line here, which is, `I'm following the law,''' he said.
Graham was executed in Hunstville, Texas, Thursday night amid a clamor of protests that he was innocent of the 1981 murder he was convicted of committing in Houston.
Political experts predicted little or no backlash for Bush as long as he appears to be handling the issue consistently and seriously.
``Politically, it's a wash,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Austin.
``I don't see it doing him any great harm or any particular good, although it could reinforce his image for decisively standing firm under pressure''.
Bush will face 14 more executions in the state before Election Day.
The death penalty won't be a factor with ``the overwhelming majority of Americans who are in favor of capital punishment,'' said Matthew Felling of the Washington-based Center for Media and Public Affairs, which does content analyses of news and entertainment media.
Gore also is a death-penalty supporter, Felling noted.
The worst damage done to Bush over the death penalty came after he was reported to have spoken in a mocking way about murderer and born-again Christian Karla Faye Tucker's plea to live, Felling and others said.
A Bush spokeswoman has said Bush's demeanor was misinterpreted and that he took the Tucker case seriously.
``I think he really understands now he cannot appear to be taking that issue lightly,'' said Allan Saxe, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Arlington.
``The issue of leadership and seriousness is very important''.
Questions have been raised nationally about the general quality of legal representation at trial for Texans given the death penalty.
A number of Texas officials, including Attorney General John Cornyn, have defended the state's process as fair.
Some of the state's Democratic U.S. representatives have urged Bush to place a moratorium on executions until a study can be done of capital punishment here.
The governor of Illinois has done so in his state.
But Bush's office said he doesn't have the authority to independently change death sentences or stop executions.
He only can grant a one-time, 30-day reprieve unless his appointed Board of Pardons and Paroles recommends otherwise.
Bush recently did this for the first time in a case involving DNA testing.
In the latest case to draw high-profile attention, that of Graham, who was defended by such well-known figures as the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, officials said Bush couldn't even grant a reprieve without board action.
That's because former Gov.
Ann Richards previously had granted Graham an independent reprieve.
``This does highlight the weakness of the gubernatorial office in Texas,'' said Dennis Goldford, chairman of the department of politics and international relations at Drake University in Des Moines.
``For all that Bush talks about leadership, the governor's office in Texas, relative to that in other states, is fairly weak,'' he said.
But Goldford said at worst the Texas death penalty issue at this point is only ``slightly negative'' for Bush.
``It puts him on the defensive a little bit,'' he said.
``Bush has been setting the agenda of the campaign so far, and Gore has been responding to Bush.
This doesn't knock Bush off stride.
It slows down his offense.''
During her tenure as Texas governor, Ann Richards once stood atop the state Capitol steps and tried to make an outlandish joke with a group of reporters.
A television reporter looked up at Richards.
``Are you serious governor''?
The comedienne-governor rolled her eyes and made a sweeping motion with her right hand, as if to drive the reporters away as annoying pests: ``You people can just suck the humor right out of a person''.
Gov. George W.
Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, got a taste of what Richards meant this week with the publication of interviews he granted to a conservative writer for Talk magazine.
The public has frequently seen an affable George W.
Bush or a serious George W.
Bush. What the Talk article captured, creating discomfort for Bush's presidential campaign, is the cocky George W.
Bush, the one-time fraternity president, former Air National Guard fighter pilot, oilman and sports team owner.
The article portrays Bush as uninterested in whatever his administration has done to reduce abortion, as someone who peppers his regular conversations with various forms of a four-letter sexual vulgarity, and as mocking executed killer Karla Faye Tucker, a pickax murderess who pleaded Bush's office for mercy on the grounds that she had found religion.
Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said writer Tucker Carlson captured some of Bush's personality in the piece but that Carlson had mischaracterized his interviews with Bush, especially the part about Karla Faye Tucker.
Hughes also said no one remembers Bush using foul language in his interviews.
Bush became visibly angry when asked about the Talk interview and tried to defer questions to Hughes.
``He misrepresented me.
I don't remember it happening that way.
I took the Karla Faye Tucker situation very seriously,'' Bush said, adding that Tucker's execution last year ``was a very somber moment and a very serious matter''.
But the damage was done.
Republican presidential rival Gary Bauer chided Bush over abortion and the Tucker comments.
And Bush received critical editorial comment from the Manchester Union Leader and conservative, nationally syndicated columnist George F.
Will, who said the article exposed what he saw as Bush's childishness.
``A critical mass of lightness in a candidate causes the public mind to snap closed, with the judgment, 'Not ready for prime time,''' Will wrote.
``He and it (the Republican Party) will care if on Nov.
7, 2000, people think of (Vice President Al) Gore or (Bill) Bradley as an unexciting but serious professor and of him as an amiable fraternity boy, but a boy''.
What the Talk reporter saw, and Will vicariously, was Bush's inner child.
Reporters who cover Bush regularly know there are three distinct Bush personalities.
First, there is the affable Bush.
This is the guy most people meet at campaign rallies.
He memorizes people's names and the names of their children.
He calls on reporters by name at news conferences.
Then, there is the serious Bush.
This is the somber man who said he had prayed over the issue of Karla Faye Tucker before refusing to grant her a stay of execution and wrestled with his religion's call to public service.
And then there is the cocky Bush, who as a young man can be seen in a widely circulated family photograph wearing an ``I'm-so-cool'' smirk on his face and a cigarette in his hand.
Richards captured this side of Bush's personality in their 1994 campaign when she complained that seeking the governorship was not a beauty contest: ``You can't wake up one morning, look in the mirror and say, `Hmm, Hmm, I think you're so cute I think you ought to run for governor'''.
These days, the self-possessed Bush allows his cocky side to manifest itself as smart-alecky remarks at news conferences.
This Bush is the one whose own daughters remind him that he is ``not as cool as he thinks he is,'' the one who thinks of the funny line before its effect.
Since Bush's days as a hard-drinking National Guard fighter pilot-turned oilman, Bush has quit drinking, quit smoking and married former public school librarian Laura Welch.
But that cocky Bush still shows up.
This is the same kind of cockiness that got his father bad publicity in 1984 when the self-assured elder Bush emerged from his vice presidential debate with Democrat Geraldine Ferraro and popped off that he had ``kicked a little ass''.
The cocky Gov.
Bush who makes flippant comments shows up on days when he is feeling especially good about himself, such as right before his inauguration to a second term in office.
The day Talk magazine interviewed Bush was the day he discovered he had set an all-time fund-raising record for a presidential primary candidate, $37 million.
Whether Bush's staff is correct in saying Carlson misrepresented the interview, Bush's attempts at humor have been known by those who cover him to be flippant.
Any personal torment Bush might have experienced from Tucker's execution was 16 months behind him while his top-of-the-world fund-raising was fresh and exciting.
When the cocky Bush is around, the only visible brake on his ego is Laura Bush, who more than once has been seen popping his balloon with a needle-like ``Hey''! or a playful tap to his shoulder.
Laura rarely travels with Bush on his presidential campaign swings.
He says he and his wife believe in historic preservation so they don't want to leave their twin teen-age daughters alone in the Texas Governor's Mansion.
&QL; &QL; XXXX END OF STORY &QL;
ON PRISONS: More Inmates For Longer Terms Under Bush, Texas has the largest criminal justice system in the country, with 545,000 people in prison or jail or on probation or parole, a point of pride to many Texans, said Fabelo, the governor's top criminal justice adviser.
Texas' prisons hold 724 inmates for every 100,000 residents, second only to Louisiana's 736.
By contrast, Minnesota, with the lowest incarceration rate, has 117 inmates per 100,000 people.
The buildup of the Texas prison system was underway when Gov.
Richards took office in 1991 and was far advanced when Bush took office in 1995.
In 1989, the state prison system had 41,000 beds.
When the buildup is completed next year, it will have 150,000 beds.
The Bush administration says the total cost will approach $3 billion, while some of the state's leading Democrats put the figure at $10 billion.
In any event, Bush has enthusiastically supported the continued growth of prisons, unlike California, where politicians have begun to question that state's prison-building program.
Republicans worry about increasing taxes to pay for the new prisons and Democrats argue that the program has taken money away from the state college and university system.
The money spent to build prisons is cutting into state spending for public education, one of Bush's priorities, said Eva DeLuna Castro, a budget analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research organization in Austin.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) ``There has been a definite trade-off,'' Ms.
Castro said.
State spending for public schools was 36.4 percent of the budget in 1999, compared with 41.3 percent in 1989, while spending for prisons was 7.8 percent, up from 5.2 percent, she said.
Bush's spokeswoman, Ms.
Hughes, said that to cope with the growing number of inmates who will eventually be released from prison, the governor is counting on programs like a voluntary Christian boot camp pioneered by Charles Colson, once the special counsel to President Richard M.
Nixon, and who served a federal prison term on Watergate-related charges.
The program includes Bible study as well as courses on personal responsibility, parenting and financial management.
``I'm absolutely convinced this program will work,'' Bush said after visiting a pilot project at a prison near Houston.
``The best recidivism program is a changed heart''.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) One of Bush's major planks in his race against Ms.
Richards was a promise to tighten the juvenile justice system in the face of skyrocketing teen-age crime, and as governor, Bush has transformed the juvenile justice code.
One result: a tripling of the number of young inmates in the Texas Youth Commission's juvenile prisons, to 6,000.
``If George W.
Bush can do for the United States what he has done for Texas, no one can lick his boots,'' said Dallas Juvenile Court Judge Hal Gaither, an adviser to Bush who describes himself as ``the most conservative man in Texas''.
The major change under Bush, Gaither said, was switching the main purpose of the juvenile system from protecting the best interests of the child, its historical role, to more of a prison system in which punishment is emphasized.
Among the changes was lowering the age at which juveniles can be sent to adult court for serious crimes to 14, increasing the maximum sentence for a juvenile to 40 years and requiring a one-year minimum sentence for anyone sentenced to the juvenile prisons.
The new code does provide flexibility, Gaither said.
Juveniles given long sentences can either be sent to an adult prison when they turn 16, or they can have their sentence reduced if their behavior has improved.
Many of these changes have been enacted in other states.
ON THE DEATH PENALTY: Leaving Appeals To Higher Power &QL; Bush has strongly supported the death penalty and he has presided over a record 98 executions as governor, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
Among those executed was Karla Faye Tucker, whose death-row conversion to Christianity led to calls for clemency from the Rev.
Pat Robertson and other religious leaders.
She was only the second woman to be executed in the United States since the Supreme Court allowed the resumption of capital punishment.
This appeal from the Christian Right gave Bush ``maneuverability'' to commute Ms.
Tucker's sentence without offending his conservative supporters, said Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, which opposes the death penalty.
But in one of his most publicized moments as governor, Bush chose not to intervene, saying: ``In every death penalty that comes to my desk, I ask this question: Innocent or guilty?
And I will tell you of all the death penalties we have had in our state, I am confident that those that have been put to death have been guilty''.
Addressing appeals for clemency based on Ms.
Tucker becoming born-again, Bush said, ``I have concluded judgments about the heart and soul of an individual on death row are best left to a higher authority''.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) In August the Tucker execution again became an issue for Bush, because of a profile in Talk magazine that quoted him as mocking Ms.
Tucker's pleading for her life.
His campaign officials have denied the profile's characterization of the governor, saying his comments were misread.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) Bush did halt one execution, that of Henry Lee Lucas, one of the nation's most notorious multiple murderers, who had already been given several life sentences for other killings.
Citing evidence that Lucas had been nowhere near the scene of the crime for which Texas was about to executive him, Bush commuted his sentence to life in prison.
Americans support the death penalty by a large majority, with 71 percent in favor and only 21 percent opposed, according to a Harris Poll released in July.
Given the frequency of executions, some Texas legislators introduced a bill this spring to bar the execution of the mentally retarded.
Five mentally retarded inmates have been executed in Texas since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
After the bill passed the state Senate, Bush announced his opposition, saying, ``I like the law the way it is right now,'' with juries having the right to make the decision.
The bill died in the House.
In another measure to deal with the number of executions and the growing number of inmates, the Texas Senate and House unanimously passed a bill this spring to create a state public defender system, guaranteeing that indigent defendants be assigned a lawyer within 20 days of arrest.
Currently defense lawyers are appointed by elected local judges, often from among their campaign contributors, leading to charges of cronyism, delays and incompetence.
Bush vetoed the bill.
``While well-intentioned,'' he said, the bill proposed ``drastic changes'' that would have lowered the quality of representation and posed a danger to the public by requiring that defendants be released if not assigned a lawyer within 20 days.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) The Houston Chronicle, in an editorial, said Bush should have signed the bill, since virtually alone among the states ``Texas has no system at all'' for public defenders.
When lawyers appointed by judges are competent, the paper said, they have an ethical conflict, since the judges who pay them want a speedy trial, not an aggressive defense.
Ellis, the state senator from Dallas who sponsored the bill, said Bush had given in to lobbying by judges who did not want to lose their patronage system.
``One can be a proponent of the death penalty, as I am,'' said Ellis, ``but also sane enough to realize we need a real public defender system''.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM)
The U.S.
Supreme Court on Thursday halted the execution of a Canadian murderer, saying it wants more time to consider the claims of the 61-year-old man who confessed to bludgeoning an elderly woman and then burying a butcher knife in her chest.
The stay was granted about 30 minutes before Joseph Stanley Faulder, convicted in the 1975 murder of the Gladewater, Texas, woman, was to be led into the death chamber at the Walls Unit in Huntsville.
Prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald broke word of the stay to Faulder, who was being held in a cell a short distance from the death chamber, shortly before 6 p.m.
CST ``Far out, that suits me,'' Faulder responded.
``He was a very happy man,'' Fitzgerald said.
``He again thanked the Canadian people and the Canadian media who helped to focus attention on the case''.
That Faulder was notified of the stay only minutes before the scheduled 6 p.m. execution, was ``absolutely abominable,'' said Sandra Babcock, his attorney.
Babcock, who was one of two people Faulder asked to witness the execution, detailed the convoluted series of legal actions to save her client, blasting the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for alleged irregularities in its clemency considerations.
``I am delighted, ecstatic,'' she said.
``But half an hour ago, I was saying goodbye to my client for the last time.
He was saying goodbye to his sister and niece, who are here.
He found out about the stay just minutes before the appointed hour of his execution.
That is cruel and unusual punishment''.
Although it had appeared Wednesday that Faulder might escape his date with the executioner based on his claims that Texas' clemency process is unconstitutional, that issue was never raised in the high court, said Doug Danzeiser, an assistant attorney general who handled the case for the state.
Instead, Danzeiser said, the Supreme Court granted the stay while it determines if it wants to hold formal arguments on claims that Faulder's rights had been violated under international law and that prosecutors suppressed evidence at his trial.
But Maurie Levin, an Austin attorney involved in Faulder's class action lawsuit over Texas' clemency process, said some lawyers were speculating that the Supreme Court may well have granted a stay knowing the clemency issue remained unresolved.
Since the only issues in Faulder's case pending before the Supreme Court involved international law and suppression of evidence, it could halt the execution only on those issues, Levin said.
``They may have it in their mind that they think they want to look at the clemency process,'' she said.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Texas Gov.
George W.
Bush said the governor ``hopes the courts will review and resolve this legal matter as quickly as possible''.
``Gov. Bush has said all along that the courts are the proper place to address the legal issues in this case,'' said Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director.
Adding to the confusion over what won Faulder the stay is the fact that two different panels of judges from the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled differently Thursday on the clemency issue, Levin said.
On Wednesday, U.S.
District Judge Sam Sparks of Austin halted the executions of Faulder and another killer, Danny Barber.
Barber was sentenced to die for the 1979 attack on Janice Louise Ingram at her home in Balch Springs, a suburb southeast of Dallas.
He also confessed to three other slayings for which he received life sentences.
Sparks found that since the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles casts its votes on clemency in secrecy there is no way to determine whether the Texas process meets due process requirements that the Supreme Court has said must exist.
The state appealed Sparks' rulings to the 5th Circuit.
One three-judge panel overturned the stay in Faulder's case, but another three-judge panel refused to in Barber's case.
Faulder, who would have been the first Canadian to be executed in the United States since 1952, had been on Texas' death row 21 years.
His death sentence focused international opposition on Texas' death penalty, with Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy joining U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in calling for a reprieve.
Faulder, an auto mechanic who had served time in Canada for auto theft, never denied that he had fatally beat and stabbed 75-year-old Inez Phillips during a 1975 robbery at her Gladewater home.
``I don't say that I shouldn't be here,'' he told Canadian television reporters in November.
``I say that death row should not exist.
Period''. Canada abolished the death penalty in 1976.
Much criticism of Texas centered on the allegation that state authorities had violated an international treaty in not allowing Faulder to contact Canadian consular officials after he was arrested.
Texas authorities said the killer was carrying a Colorado drivers license at the time of his arrest, and his nationality was not immediately known.
``At no time did we prevent or prohibit him from calling the Canadian Embassy,'' former Gregg County District Attorney Odis Hill told The Associated Press.
``If he thought that he got such a raw deal and that the embassy could have helped, don't you think he would have contacted them before he sat on death row for 15 years''?
Fifteen years elapsed before his family and the Canadian government learned of his incarceration in Texas.
A new execution date cannot be set for Faulder unless the Supreme Court lifts its stay; under state law, at least 30 days must elapse between the lifting of a stay and the setting of a new death date.
The decision by the Supreme Court also leaves standing orders by Sparks, the federal judge, to conduct evidentiary hearings on the clemency procedures in Texas.
Sparks set hearing dates of Dec.
21 and Dec.
22 in Faulder's and Barber's cases, respectively.
In ordering the hearings, Sparks took a swipe at the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for not settling the issue.
``This court bemoans the fact that neither of the state's highest courts have ruled on the merits of Faulder's claims or stayed the execution to give themselves time to consider the merits,'' Sparks wrote.
Faulder's claims that Texas' clemency procedures are constitutionally flawed are nearly identical to the claims that attorneys for Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman put to death in Texas since the 1800s, raised last year before she was executed.
Tucker, however, never was granted a stay on those claims.
In his Faulder opinion, Sparks noted that at the time Tucker raised her claims, there was no case law laying out a constitutional right to clemency under federal law.
After Tucker was executed, though, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled in the case of an Ohio prisoner who challenged that state's parole procedures.
In that case, Sparks noted, five justices ``agreed that a death-row inmate has a life interest in avoiding execution separate and independent from his life and liberty interests at stake in his trial and sentencing, and therefore `some minimal procedural safeguards apply to clemency proceedings'''.
Although the Supreme Court did not specify what process would meet minimal standards, Sparks wrote, ``it is unclear where the Texas procedure would fall'' because the parole board does not specify how it reaches its decisions.
``It is unclear how the board can document that its procedures are not arbitrary if it does not document its procedures at all,'' Sparks wrote.
Dave Atwood, president of the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty and one of Tucker's attorneys, praised the Supreme Court's decision and the pressure Canadian capital punishment opponents had applied in the case.
``If not for them, this execution would have gone forward,'' he said.
Faulder's niece, Barbara Allen, 39, of Jasper, Alberta, said she was ``ecstatic'' about the stay, then noted the word hardly conveyed the level of emotion she felt.
She said she had visited her uncle Thursday afternoon _ her fourth visit with him since her arrival Saturday _ and found him composed.
``He has had a long time to prepare for this,'' she said.
``But he was emotional, too.
When we left, I said, 'See you tomorrow,' and I will''.

AUSTIN, Texas _ George W.
Bush is proud to call himself ``the law-and-order governor''.
And rightly so.
In five years in office, he has overseen the executions of 113 death row inmates, more than any other governor in any state since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.
But the relentless efficiency of his state's death row machinery is about to intersect, vividly, with Bush's pursuit of his party's presidential nomination.
In the five weeks before the Iowa and New Hampshire presidential contests, Texas is scheduled to execute eight more people, among them convicts whose cases put the debate about the death penalty into high relief.
Two of the eight committed their crimes as juveniles.
One claims to have been convicted on the basis of a faulty DNA test.
One is a paranoid schizophrenic whose condition went untreated _ until he killed.
And then there's Johnny Paul Penry.
Even supporters of capital punishment have been troubled by the Penry case.
There is no excusing his heinous crime: In 1979, while on parole for a previous rape conviction, he broke into the home of Pamela Carpenter, raped her, and then stabbed her to death with the scissors she was using to make a Halloween costume for her niece.
But Penry has the intellectual capacity of a 7-year-old.
He never got past the first grade and spent his childhood years in and out of mental institutions.
Court records describe how his mother beat him as a baby and dipped him in scalding water.
She forced him to eat his bodily wastes, according to those records.
Penry's execution is sure to gain national attention, for it was in his case in 1989 that the US Supreme Court issued a controversial ruling that the death penalty for retarded individuals is not a constitutionally prohibited ``cruel and unusual punishment''.
He is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Jan.
13. Bush has not spoken publicly about the Penry case and, in keeping with his normal practice, he would not examine the facts of the case until the date set for execution.
Bush has never granted such a reprieve.
And it was the governor's opposition last spring that led to the scuttling of a bill that passed one house of the Texas Legislature.
It would have banned executions of the mentally retarded.
The case of another Texas convict, Larry Robison, who has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, poses another issue: whether the mentally ill should be executed.
In a bloody rampage, Robison slaughtered two men, two women, and an 11-year-old boy near Fort Worth in 1982.
Before he launched his murderous spree by decapitating and sexually mutilating his male housemate, Robison had no history of violence.
His illness had been diagnosed when he was 21, but he was turned away from treatment because he lacked health insurance.
He has requested Jan.
21 as an execution date, because he wants to die on a night of a full moon.
The scheduled executions of Glen McGinnis (Jan.
25) and Anzel Jones (Jan.
26) and David Hicks (Jan.
20) offer other windows onto the death penalty and how determinedly Texas and Bush enforce it.
McGinnis and Jones were both juveniles, 17 years old, when they committed their brutal crimes.
Hicks, meanwhile, claims that faulty DNA analysis helped convict him of a crime he did not commit _ the rape and murder of his grandmother.
The death penalty has not yet emerged as a campaign issue in a nation where roughly two of three voters, and three of four Republicans, endorse the practice.
Here in Texas, the most prominent victims' rights organization speaks for many when giving Bush its whole-hearted support.
``Governor Bush has been a very receptive and reasonable governor when it comes to issues of crime and criminal justice,'' said Dianne Clements, president of Justice for All, the Houston-based victims group.
``There is poll after poll that proves the citizens of Texas support the death penalty, the ultimate punishment''.
Clements defends the use of the death penalty, even in those cases where the offender was 17 at the time of the crime, or mentally disabled.
``If they are competent to be convicted, then so be it,'' she said.
But death penalty opponents contend that Bush's record-setting embrace of capital punishment may yet be a negative factor for him in the 2000 election.
He shows a callousness, they say, toward the solemn issues that arise from government's ultimate power: taking the life of its citizens.
Beyond the overall support given to capital punishment in the polls, ``the realization is growing that the death penalty, like a lot of other things that government does, has serious problems,'' said Stephen Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta.
``People reasonably expect that the governor of Texas ought to be concerned about executing the mentally retarded, or those who had poor legal representation,'' said Bright.
``If you are going to be executing those who were children when they committed the crime, or people who are mentally ill, the governor ought to at least be engaged.
You don't get the sense that Bush is engaged at all''.
Bush reinforced such doubts when, in a magazine interview last summer, he mocked the eleventh-hour plea for mercy by a convicted double murderer, Karla Faye Tucker, imitating her by whimpering ``Please, don't kill me'' with pursed lips.
Tucker, whose born-again faith and repentance for her crimes was cited in requests for mercy made to Bush by such figures as Pope John Paul II and televangelist Pat Robertson, was the first woman to be executed by the state of Texas since the Civil War.
And in a recent case that spurred headlines across the country, Texas authorities used an airplane and a team of medical attendants to fly David Long from the intensive care ward of a Galveston hospital to the death chamber in Huntsville on Dec.
8 so he could be executed on his appointed date.
He had tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose of anti-psychotic drugs.
``Putting him on life support and flying him out of the hospital so they can kill him?
People are asking, `What the hell are they doing down there'?
'' said George Kendall, who heads the NAACP's death penalty project in New York.
``There is a growing volume of cases in Texas that make it sound like however the system is supposed to work, this is not it''.
At a time when the well-publicized releases of dozens of death row inmates found innocent by DNA testing has sparked a national movement for a moratorium on capital punishment, and led to a slight downtick in support for the practice in public opinion polls, foes of the death penalty hope to use the upcoming primary season to publicize their cause and pressure Bush to intervene on behalf of those scheduled to die.
Bush's legislative record raises further issues.
Despite repeated judicial criticism of the way that Texas provides legal services to indigent defendants in capital punishment and other criminal cases _ via a court-appointed patronage system _ Bush vetoed a bill that would have reformed the system and established an independent public defender's office this year.
In a chapter on the death penalty in his campaign autobiography, Bush says that he treats his ``profound'' responsibility in capital punishment cases ``thoughtfully and carefully,'' but that he limits his decisions on whether to intervene to two matters: ``Is there any doubt about this individual's guilt or innocence?
And, have the courts had ample opportunity to review all the legal issues in this case''?
As a matter of political philosophy, Bush says, he does not believe he has the right to ``replace the verdict of a jury with my own'' in order to show mercy, or for potentially mitigating factors like age, mental illness, or mental retardation.
&UR; MORE &LR; &QC;
AUSTIN, Texas _ As a longtime advocate for prison reform and the leader of a national anti-death-penalty organization, Charlie Sullivan has seen the conservative side of presidential candidate George W.
Bush. But he's sayd he's still waiting for a glimpse of the Texas governor's compassionate side.
Sullivan, the executive director of Citizens United for Rehabilitation of Errants, or CURE, is attempting to focus the spotlight on Texas' use of the death penalty as voters put Bush through his first tests as this year's Republican front-runner.
The effort by Sullivan comes as Texas prepared to execute its fifth inmate this month, with two more executions scheduled during the next two days.
``Our members are working hard, not only in Iowa and New Hampshire, but in the other early primary states, trying to get this issue before the voters,'' said Sullivan, a one-time Texan whose office is in Washington, D.C.
``There have been so many executions in Texas, I doubt that George Bush even knows half of their names''.
Bush, the national front-runner in the GOP presidential nomination race, is an ardent supporter of the death penalty and makes no apology for the fact that he has presided over more executions than any governor in modern U.S. history, and some of the most controversial.
``I support the death penalty,'' Bush said during a recent campaign swing in Iowa.
``The reason I do is that it saves people's lives.
... If the punishment is swift, sure and just, it will save people's lives''.
Since Bush took office in January 1995, Texas has sent 116 inmates to Huntsville's death chamber.
Among those was Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman to be executed in the state since the Civil War.
Tucker's professed conversion to Christianity became the subject of countless media profiles in the weeks before she was put to death 23 months ago for participating in a 1982 pickax slaying in Houston.
Bush withstood pressure to spare Tucker's life from such diverse sources as liberal activist Bianca Jagger and conservative religious broadcaster Pat Robertson before allowing the 38-year-old former prostitute to die.
Bush's critics brush aside the argument that the Texas governor has only limited power to stop an execution.
Under state law, the governor may commute a death sentence only if the 18-member Board of Pardons and Paroles makes such a recommendation.
The governor may, however, grant a condemned inmate a one-time, 30-day stay of execution to allow the courts or the parole board more time to review the case.
``Texas has a governor that is basically leaving it to the bureaucrats and the people he appoints to make these life-and-death decisions,'' Sullivan said.
``He has adopted a policy that says, `Don't bother me unless there's something extraordinary about the case'.
'' Bush and his aides have disputed such assertions, arguing that each pending execution weighs heavily on the governor's conscience.
Bush has said he reviews cases to ensure that condemned inmates were granted full access to the courts and to erase any doubt about whether inmates are guilty of the crime for which they were sentenced.
Opponents say they are frustrated that the death penalty has not been much of an issue in many states, including Iowa and New Hampshire.
Alicia Claypool, executive director of the anti-death-penalty Interfaith Alliance of Iowa, said capital punishment is ``not on the radar screen'' in that state.
``No one's really talking about crime issues this year,'' said Claypool, who heads the 1,200-member organization.
``Iowa does not have the death penalty, and we've had some periodic battles over whether we should adopt it.
But this year, there has been very little mention of it''.
However, Craig Allin, a political science professor at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, said there might be growing notice of Texas' execution pace.
``It certainly is on my radar screen,'' Allin said.
``Texas has earned the reputation of being the death penalty capital of the United States.
Iowa has an active United Nations Association, various Christian liberal congregations, chapters of Amnesty International, etc.
, who take the death penalty seriously and who have lobbied against it here in Iowa''.
However, one of Allin's colleagues who is active in Iowa GOP politics, said that such lobbying will likely carry little weight in the caucuses.
``It's not the sort of thing that Republicans will squabble among themselves about,'' said Robert Sutherland, a Cornell political science professor and former Houston resident who supports Bush.
``Even those in the Christian Coalition and the right-to-life movement are far more concerned with the abortion issue than with the death penalty''.
Doug Challenger, a sociology professor at New Hampshire's Franklin Pierce College, said issues of crime and punishment are also taking a back seat in the Granite State.
``I think people up here are aware of what's going on in Texas with all their executions, but it's not making an impact,'' Challenger said.
New Hampshire has a death penalty statute, but there has not been an execution there in more than a half-century, Challenger said.
As Iowa voters made their choices for president Monday evening, Texas inmate Billy George Hughes was scheduled to be strapped onto the executioner's gurney and given a lethal injection in Huntsville.
Two more inmates are scheduled to die this week.
Last week, Texas executed Spencer Goodman, David Hicks and Larry Keith Robison.
Hughes' execution Monday night will be followed by Glen McGinnis on Tuesday night and James Moreland on Thursday.
Robison's case was the subject of international controversy because his supporters argued that his 1982 murder spree that left five dead in the Fort Worth area was likely fueled by paranoid schizophrenia, a condition that was diagnosed four years earlier.
Prosecutors and relatives of the victims have argued that Robison's admitted drug use caused any mental defects.
The Vatican, Amnesty International and the European Parliament repeatedly urged Bush to spare Robison, and the same groups are rallying around McGinnis, arguing that he be saved because he was 17 at the time of his crime.
Bush has routinely rejected overtures from abroad.
When the Canadian government objected to the pending execution of one of its countrymen and a boycott of Texas tourism sites was urged, Bush simply bristled.
``People just can't come into our state and cold-blood murder somebody,'' Bush said before Joseph Stanley Faulder's execution in June.
``That's unacceptable behavior, regardless of their nationality''.
Richard Dieter, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Death Penalty Resource Center, said such rhetoric defies Bush's campaign mantra of ``compassionate conservatism''.
``Where is all this compassion when it comes to the mentally ill on Death Row, the people who were sent to Death Row for crimes they committed as children''?
Dieter asked.
``He could send a meaningful message about compassion if he would commute their sentences.
Not set them free, just keep them in prison for life''.

AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov.
George W.
Bush, the would-be or wouldn't-be president, got another taste of international diplomacy during the debate over Texas' near-execution of a Canadian man.
Joseph Stanley Faulder escaped death by about 30 minutes last week when the U.S.
Supreme Court ordered a stay of his scheduled execution for the 1974 robbery and murder of 75-year-old Inez Phillips of Gladewater.
His case created a controversy in Canada, which blew into Austin like a blast of Arctic air.
It may not have been a clash of cultures, but it definitely was a clash of opinions.
Canada doesn't have the death penalty, presumably because many _ if not most _ Canadians oppose it.
Texas does, and has carried it out 19 times this year alone and officeholders such as Bush believe it has strong support among Texans.
At an Austin news conference, one Canadian reporter asked Bush what he would say to Canadians ``who seem to think that your state is running kind of a Wild West show down here''.
``If you're a Canadian and you come to our state, don't murder anybody,'' Bush replied.
He also insisted that Texas sought to assure due process for all, including death row convicts.
Bush was peppered with questions from several Canadian journalists, who had traveled to Texas to cover Faulder's case.
But he refused to be drawn into a debate over the death penalty.
He maintained his cool, prompting some observers to note that if he were in training for a presidential race, he passed an early, minor test.
The governor's potential political future, however, is only a byproduct of the debate over Faulder.
The relevant issue is Texas' clemency process, which once again has been challenged in a capital murder case receiving international attention.
Had it not been for the U.S.
Supreme Court, Faulder most likely would have been executed.
The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles rejected Faulder's petition for clemency.
Without a board recommendation for commutation of the death sentence or some other form of clemency, the only option remaining for the governor was one 30-day stay, or delay, of the execution.
Bush has never granted a stay of execution, including in the case of Karla Faye Tucker, who was put to death early this year for her part in two pickax murders in Houston.
Tucker also received tons of international publicity.
Unlike Faulder, however, Tucker didn't find a receptive court.
Bush's actions were consistent in the Faulder debate.
Despite pressure from U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, who contended that Texas' handling of Faulder's case violated an international treaty, the governor didn't intervene on his own.
Rarely does the parole board recommend clemency for a death row convict.
One of the few cases in recent years occurred a few months ago, when the board recommended commutation of alleged serial killer Henry Lee Lucas' death sentence to life imprisonment, and Bush agreed.
The board and the governor believed that sufficient doubt had been cast on the evidence in the only case for which Lucas received the death penalty.
Faulder's case may result in a judicial review of Texas' clemency process, which has repeatedly been attacked by death penalty opponents as secretive and unfair.
Bush obviously believes the parole board, which he appoints, does its job diligently and fairly and would never knowingly deny clemency to someone wrongly sentenced to death.
And his faith in the panel is probably justified.
Faulder once confessed to the murder for which he was convicted and didn't raise a claim of innocence in his clemency petition.
But the way the board normally conducts its business in clemency decisions _ taking votes by fax machine or telephone from 18 members scattered about the state _ creates at the very least a public relations and potential political problem.
Many people will always oppose the death penalty, but regardless of how one views capital punishment, there should be more openness in the parole board's clemency procedures.
It may be impractical for all 18 members to meet in the same place to vote on every case.
But maybe we should consider requiring board members to cast their votes _ and state their reasons for voting _ over conference call hookups, which reporters and other members of the public could monitor at a central location.
A lawyer friend says my suggestion is fraught with potential problems.
But state law already requires a school board or a county commissioners court to meet in public to discuss something as mundane as a printing contract.
What's wrong with shining more light on life-and-death decisions?

LOS ANGELES _ As Gov.
George W.
Bush confronts yet another closely scrutinized death penalty case this week, the immediate decision before him is one that has become remarkably familiar over the course of 134 executions in Texas during his five and a half years in office: whether or not to use his limited power to halt the next one.
But now that Bush is running for president and the eyes of an entire nation are upon him as never before, he faces a second, amplified challenge.
It is to demonstrate, through the tone of his voice and the set of his jaw, that he feels the full weight of his responsibility.
And it is to show, through his bearing and his choice of words, that he comes by his steadfast position in support of the death penalty after extensive soul-searching and careful thought.
Because of the stakes involved, the emotions it stirs and the welling questions about the fairness of its administration, the death penalty has become one of the tests of Bush's seriousness, a quality he arguably comes by less easily than his levity or spunk.
And while there is little or no hint in public opinion surveys that his advocacy of capital punishment in itself carries political risks, there is certainly reason to believe that more than a few voters are watching, and judging, the manner in which he navigates this sensitive terrain.
``He needs to be careful to portray this in the most sober and respectful of lights,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a professor who teaches courses on the presidency at the University of Texas.
``Any evidence of being perfunctory or lacking sensitivity is a problem for him, not necessarily in terms of politics but in terms of gravitas''.
The current case in question is that of Gary Graham, scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection on Thursday in Huntsville, Texas.
Graham was convicted of a 1981 murder largely on the embattled testimony of a single eyewitness.
Bush and his aides have said that because of the circumstances of this case specifically and the boundaries of the Texas governor's powers generally, he may have little or no discretion over Graham's fate once the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles renders its ruling on the matter this week.
If the board authorizes execution, the most the governor can typically do is grant a one-time, 30-day reprieve.
And Bush's ability to do even that in Graham's case is in question, since Gov.
Ann W.
Richards granted such a reprieve to Graham in 1993.
But whatever the limits on Bush's discretion, they do not alter the burden on his public comments and demeanor when the moment of decision comes.
``This gravitas issue is a very important one,'' said Stephen J.
Wayne, a professor of government at Georgetown University who specializes in the American presidency.
``I don't think he can say, in a snide way, `I'm going through with this, he's guilty, period,''' Wayne said.
``He's got to demonstrate some reflection in his words''.
The capacity to do so is something that many Americans want in a president, said Wayne, who, along with other political analysts, noted that there had been a few occasions when Bush failed to exhibit it.
A profile of Bush in Talk magazine last year described a scene, which the governor and his aides have said was mischaracterized, in which he mocked the last-minute clemency pleas of Karla Faye Tucker, a convicted killer whom Texas ultimately executed.
And there was a moment during a Republican presidential debate in early March when Bush laughed, perhaps somewhat nervously, when asked about a Texas lawyer who fell asleep during a trial that ended with a death sentence for his client.
Those examples are extreme.
But there have been many other times when Bush, who seldom holds any private introspection up to public light, has responded to questions about capital punishment with strikingly terse answers conspicuously lifted from a well-worn script.
Bush and his aides seem to be at least partly conscious of that and eager to cast his ruminations on death penalty cases as prolonged and profound.
That was the portrait of the governor that emerged in the autobiography he published last year, ``A Charge to Keep,'' written primarily by his communications director, Karen P.
Hughes. An entire chapter of the book was devoted to the death penalty.
Earlier this month, for the first time since entering office, Bush granted a death-row inmate a 30-day reprieve, in defiance of the Board of Pardons and Paroles.
The issue in the case was the possibility that further DNA testing could clarify the facts presented at trial, and Bush's decision allowed him to show that he was neither oblivious nor aloof to a central, scientific reason for the changing dynamics of the death penalty debate.
On Monday, aboard the campaign plane that brought him out to the West Coast to begin a week of campaigning that he knew would be dominated by the latest scheduled execution in Texas, Bush was more voluble on the death penalty than usual.
He said not only that he was standing his ground ``in the face of a pretty considerable movement to undermine the death penalty in Texas,'' but also that he understood the passion of that crusade.
``I harbor no ill will,'' Bush told reporters.
``I understand it's a very emotional issue for people.
It's an issue where fine people disagree''.
Talking about how much attention he was paying to Graham's case, he emphasized that he had spent the entire ``trip from the governor's mansion to the plane'' _ a drive of 15 to 20 minutes _ talking to a state lawyer about it.
Asked whether accounts like the one about the sleeping lawyer made him wonder whether people were getting fair trials, he quickly and succinctly responded, ``That's what the appellate process is for''.
But several hours later, he returned to the reporter who had posed the question and pointed out that in that case, the defendant had confessed.
Bush had clearly gone and done some research.
He had just as clearly come to the conclusion that it was a good idea to let people know that.
SACRAMENTO, Calif.
_ In a step he had never taken over the course of 131 executions in five years, Gov.
George W.
Bush Thursday night agreed to a 30-day reprieve for a death-row inmate in Texas, citing concerns that adequate tests on DNA evidence in the case had not been performed.
Bush made his decision, which he had telegraphed well in advance, after both the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, and the U.S.
Supreme Court late Thursday rejected final-hour pleas by lawyers for the inmate, Ricky Nolen McGinn, who had been scheduled for execution by lethal injection at 6 p.m.
Central time.
McGinn was convicted of raping and killing his 12-year-old stepdaughter in 1993, but Bush acknowledged over recent days that the DNA evidence connecting McGinn to the rape was inconclusive and might be clarified by modern tests.
It was the rape, layered on top of the murder, that qualified McGinn for a death sentence.
Bush, who had just arrived at the state capitol building here for a conference of governors, announced the stay only about 15 minutes before the originally scheduled time for McGinn's execution.
Bush noted that the actual reprieve would be granted by Texas state Sen.
Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat who was technically acting as governor while Bush and the lieutenant governor were both out of the state.
``I have recommended and Senator Ellis has accepted my recommendation to grant a 30-day reprieve in the case of Mr.
McGinn,'' Bush told a group of reporters who huddled around him in a corridor of the state capitol building here.
``Anytime DNA evidence can be used in its context and be relevant as to the guilt or innocence of a person on death row, we need to use it,'' Bush explained, in a straightforward, unemotional voice.
``We're doing so in the state of Texas.
I expect the courts and all relevant parties to act expeditiously to review the evidence and to finally determine his innocence or guilt as to the charge of rape in the case of Ricky McGinn''.
Because Bush is now the presumptive Republican nominee for president, his actions as governor are under more intense scrutiny _ none more so than his vigorous enforcement of the death penalty.
Texas easily leads the nation in executions.
Although his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, also supports capital punishment, some of his allies would like to use the issue to cast doubt on Bush's efforts to portray himself as a ``compassionate conservative''.
Additionally, Bush's unusual action in the case of McGinn underscored the way in which modern DNA testing and technology have begun to affect the debate over capital punishment by casting doubt on convictions once considered solid and just.
In recent months, even some staunch conservatives have begun to acknowledge qualms about capital punishment, in light of a number of death sentences that have been overturned recently after DNA testing exonerated the inmates.
How these developments will ultimately affect public support for the death penalty, which has been broad and strong and often independent of political party affiliation, remains unclear.
Bush's aides said that his action was not even remotely influenced by politics and noted that he had made many tough and unpopular decisions about the death penalty in the past, including several since he declared his candidacy for the presidency.
As governor, Bush's only independent authority is to grant a 30-day reprieve of an execution.
He cannot pardon someone or commute a death sentence without the prior recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles and, under those circumstances, has commuted only one death sentence over the last year, sparing the life of Henry Lee Lucas, a confessed serial killer.
In that case, as in this one, the argument against the death penalty was not a sentimental but an evidentiary one, with questions emerging about some of the testimony and material marshaled to establish the defendants' guilt and seal the particular conviction for which he received his death sentence.
But this was the first time that Bush agreed to a reprieve for a death-row inmate, and he did it against the wishes of the pardons board, which had voted 11-7 not to stay McGinn's execution.
For the moment, Bush's action merely delays McGinn's execution, although his lawyers hope that they can now perform new DNA tests that will shed new doubt on McGinn's guilt.
What Bush did Thursday, and the way in which he presaged it with a series of remarks on Wednesday, suggested that he was at least somewhat sensitive to his image as an especially fervent advocate of capital punishment and pleased to happen upon a case that allowed him to temper it.
In the past, Bush had almost always waited for courts to complete their reviews of death-row inmates' appeals before he signaled his own intentions or thinking on the matter.
But Bush broke from that pattern this time around, gladly telling reporters on Wednesday that he was likely to grant McGinn a 30-day reprieve.
At the time, the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals had yet to rule on the issue, and McGinn's lawyers had not turned to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
Several Republican political strategists around the country said that they doubted Bush was simply trying to soften his image by showing a capacity for clemency.
They noted that public support for capital punishment still runs high and that Bush three years ago declined to grant a reprieve in a much showier, more widely covered case: that of a woman named Karla Faye Tucker.
``I don't think that this is political,'' said Mike Murphy, who was the principal strategist for Sen.
John McCain's presidential campaign.
But, Murphy added, ``The truth is that the explosion in DNA technology has really changed the death penalty dynamic, and perhaps he's taking that reality into account a little bit''.
Karen P.
Hughes, a spokesman for Bush, said Thursday afternoon that McGinn's case was the first one Bush has faced as governor in which the possibility of further DNA testing was so central to the question of innocence or guilt.
``The DNA testing at the trial level was inconclusive and there's an opportunity to get more information now from that test, so he feels it's the right thing to do,'' Hughes said.
``These are life and death decisions, and Governor Bush makes them based on principle''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn The fate of McGinn from this point on remains unclear, because his lawyers are in waters largely uncharted in Texas.
They must obtain the evidence they want tested, including clothing from the victim that contained a semen stain and a pubic hair found on the victim's body, and then analyze the DNA.
But they said Thursday that they are not certain whether they have just 30 days to complete this, or whether the case now returns to a state district judge to set a new execution date, which would give the defense team at least 60 days.
If DNA tests show that the hair and semen were not from McGinn, ``obviously he's not guilty of rape and he can't be executed,'' said Barry Scheck, a DNA expert who joined McGinn's defense team last week.
``On the other hand,'' Scheck said, ``the DNA testing might link him to other crimes.
These are all things to find out''.
But no matter how the tests turn out, prosecutors say they expect the murder conviction to stand because of other evidence that tied McGinn to the girl's killing.
In Texas, murder is punishable by death only if the killing occurred under certain specified circumstances, including the murder of a police officer or fireman in the line of duty; committing murder during a kidnapping, burglary, robbery, rape, arson, or prison escape; murdering for money, or paying someone else to do so; and murdering a child under the age of six.
In this case, the death penalty threshold was achieved when the jury found McGinn had also raped his stepdaughter.
When John F.
Kennedy ran for president way back in 1960, one of the biggest obstacles he faced was his religion: He was a Roman Catholic, and no Catholic had ever been elected president of the United States.
At one point during his campaign for the Democratic nomination, Kennedy decided that he needed to address the religious issue, and he did so by pledging that if elected he would owe his allegiance to the Constitution and the American people, not to the Catholic Church and the pope.
The voters took Kennedy at his word, and he went on to win the White House in a close election over Richard Nixon.
Kennedy's religion was never an issue during his presidency; he adhered to his promise that the church would not be allowed to meddle in the secular business of America.
So. If a Catholic president elected nearly 40 years ago took no marching orders from the pope, why is the Baptist governor of Missouri giving the pontiff veto power over capital punishment in 1999?
During a visit to St.
Louis last week, Pope John Paul II urged Missouri Gov.
Mel Carnahan to spare the life of a triple murderer who was scheduled for execution in February.
Carnahan complied, commuting the killer's death sentence to life in prison without possibility of parole.
``I continue to support capital punishment,'' Carnahan said after granting the reprieve to longtime Death Row resident Darrell Mease, ``but after careful consideration of (the pope's) direct and personal appeal and because of a deep and abiding respect for the pontiff and all he represents, I decided last night to grant his request''.
The pope had preached against capital punishment Wednesday during a public Mass at the Trans World Dome in St.
Louis, and he later made a personal request to Carnahan to spare Mease's life.
Mease's execution date had been postponed from Wednesday to Feb.
10, apparently to avoid putting him to death while the pope was in Missouri.
Other than the pope's plea for mercy, there was no reason for Carnahan to commute Mease's death sentence.
There was no question that Mease was guilty of the 1988 murders of a fellow drug dealer and the dealer's wife and grandson.
Mease's partisans weren't even claiming that he had undergone a spectacular Death Row religious conversion in the manner of the late Karla Faye Tucker.
Remember Tucker, the Texas pickax killer?
The pope wanted Gov.
George W.
Bush to rescue her from the lethal needle, but Bush adhered to a ruling by the state Board of Pardons and Paroles, which permitted Tucker to receive the earthly justice she deserved.
The Texas governor evidently has a better understanding than the Missouri governor of the distinction between religion and government.
Carnahan, a Democrat who plans to run for the U.S.
Senate next year, would have been better advised to demonstrate his reverence for the pope by kissing the pontiff's ring rather than overruling a jury of Missouri residents and the various courts that have rejected Mease's appeals over the years.
Look, folks, I'm not here to criticize the pope.
I did that once, in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.
, and nearly got run out of town on a rail.
Besides, I spent 12 of my most formative years attending Catholic schools.
I don't want one of the nuns who ruled my life so many years ago tracking me down and rapping my knuckles for disrespecting the Holy Father.
The pope is a great and godly man, an inspiration to Catholics and non-Catholics all around the world.
No one will ever catch me saying otherwise.
The pope and religious leaders of all faiths are entitled to express themselves, in any forum they might choose, regarding what they believe to be the moral responsibilities of government.
But religious beliefs are not the law of the land _ not in the United States of America.
No president or governor, no official at any level of government in America, should make decisions based on the desires or dictates of any church.
That is the law of the land.

AUSTIN, Texas _ Of the 127 men and women who have been executed in Texas during his time in office, Governor George W.
Bush makes one categorical claim: none of them were innocent.
``There's no doubt in my mind that each person who has been executed in our state was guilty of the crime committed,'' Bush says.
The Texas governor's claim is supported by the prosecutors and law enforcement officials who worked on those cases, the juries that concluded that the defendants were guilty, and the failure of journalists and death penalty foes to find an incontestable case where an innocent person was executed.
Indeed, a Boston Globe review of the 127 Texas death penalty cases found that there was powerful proof of guilt _ uncontradicted scientific evidence, freely offered confessions, or an admission of regret just before the execution _ in nine out of 10 cases.
Yet, in a handful of Texas cases, in which convicts never wavered from saying they were innocent, doubts remain.
Doubts of varying degree.
Doubts that did not convince a jury.
Doubts that leave defense attorneys skeptical of Bush's claim.
``It is statistically inconceivable that no innocent people have been executed or will be executed,'' says attorney Stephen Latimer.
``The Texas system is not infallible''.
Latimer represented David Stoker, who was executed in 1997 despite years of insisting that he had been framed for the murder of a convenience store clerk.
While there was evidence tying Stoker to the pistol used in the fatal holdup, no physical evidence placed him at the store or established that he owned the gun at the time the crime took place.
An informant turned the gun in to police and blamed Stoker for the murder.
The informant, described by even Stoker's prosecutor as a ``lowlife scum drug dealer,'' received reward money and had charges against him dropped in a criminal case.
``Stoker maintained his innocence until the day he died,'' said Latimer.
Bush's presidential candidacy ensured that the Stoker case, and a handful of others like it, would become grist for the national news media.
CBS News and several major newspapers have dispatched reporters to Texas to investigate the governor's record.
Bush's aides, in turn, have polled prosecutors in far-off corners of the state, to make sure the governor can stand by his claim of certainty.
``The governor's office did call me,'' said Hidalgo County District Attorney Rene Guerra, who prosecuted Danny Castillo, executed in 1998.
``I did verify that he was guilty''.
Castillo was convicted and sentenced to death for fatally slashing and stabbing a south Texas liquor store clerk during a 1983 robbery.
The police found bloodied moneybags at the home of a relative where Castillo was staying, and a footprint left at the store matched a footprint discovered at the scene of another armed robbery for which Castillo was convicted.
But there was no physical evidence tying Castillo to the liquor store crime, and the footprints were from a common brand of athletic shoe.
It was a difficult case for both sides.
``There was no really hard-core physical evidence,'' Guerra said.
``I lost friendships afterwards over this''.
``I don't think there is a silver bullet in this case,'' said attorney Paul Swacina, who handled Castillo's appeals.
``David's case was in the gray area''.
Mike Jones, deputy director of communications for the governor, reacting to the handful of ambiguous cases turned up during the Globe survey, said that ``the governor and his legal staff carefully review each case involving a convicted killer who is sentenced to death.
In each case, state and federal courts have already considered evidence and arguments presented by the defendants.
``When the actual facts of these cases are reviewed fairly and objectively, instead of in a one-sided, sensational manner, it's clear each killer executed in Texas was guilty of the crime for which he was convicted,'' Jones said.
Bush declined an invitation to comment for this article, but when questioned about his record on the campaign trail, he has generally repeated what he said in his autobiography.
``I review every death penalty case thoroughly,'' Bush wrote.
``And early in my administration, I decided the standards by which I would decide whether to allow an execution to proceed.
In every case, I would ask: Is there any doubt about this individual's guilt or innocence?
And, have the courts have ample opportunity to review all the legal issues in this case''?
At the time that Texas executed pick ax murderer Karla Faye Tucker in 1998, Bush wrote, he was challenged at the dinner table by one of his teenage daughters, who declared her opposition to the death penalty.
``I told my daughter that sometimes in life you have to make decisions that are not easy, but they should always be based on principle,'' Bush wrote.
``In this case, the principle was to uphold the law of the land.
I took an oath to do so.
``I believe decisions about the death penalty are primarily the responsibility of the judicial branch of government,'' Bush wrote.
``I don't believe my role is to replace the verdict of a jury with my own''.
In just one case has Bush decided that there were enough concerns about innocence to intervene: that of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, whose confession to a Texas murder was shown to be a lie.
Bush agreed with the recommendation of the Board of Pardons and Paroles and commuted the sentence to life in prison.
The confluence of events that has pushed Bush's record on capital punishment into the public eye is likely to keep it there.
The governor will next confront an assertion of innocence in June, when death row inmate Gary Graham is scheduled to die.
Over the last two decades, Graham's case has attracted the attention of sympathetic journalists, movie stars such as Danny Glover, and organized foes of capital punishment.
Though Graham admittedly took part in a violent felonious crime spree that included 22 crimes in the spring of 1981, including an armed robbery in which a victim was shot, he denies that he shot Bobby Lambert in a robbery outside a Houston supermarket.
As in the case of Stoker, there is no physical evidence to tie him to the crime.
Graham was 17 at the time of the murder.
He was convicted largely on the basis of eyewitness Bernadine Skillern's testimony, though other eyewitnesses could not corroborate the identification.
A gun Graham possessed at the time of his arrest was tested by the prosecution and was ruled out as the murder weapon.
``Gary is the only client I have had in Texas who we thought is innocent, and I still believe he is,'' said Graham's attorney, Richard Burr, a veteran capital defense lawyer and death penalty foe.
Skillern, who saw the shooting take place and chased the assailant for a time in her car, ``is very adamant that she's right,'' Burr said.
``I'm convinced she is wrong, and there is no other evidence at all''.
Public support for capital punishment has slipped a notch in polls in recent months with the news that more than 80 inmates has been freed from death row, including seven from Texas, since the death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s.
In many of these cases, and in dozens of non-capital convictions, DNA technology has exposed flaws in the US judicial system.
``We certainly think innocent people have been executed,'' said Barry Scheck, a nationally known DNA expert and a leader of the New York-based ``Innocence Project,'' whose recent book on the issue helped persuade conservative columnist George F.
Will and others to call for a reexamination of capital punishment.

AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov.
George W.
Bush, who has presided over more executions than any governor in modern American history, said on Friday that he favors DNA testing on condemned inmates to ``erase all doubts'' that an innocent person might be put to death.
Lawyers who defend Death Row inmates called Bush's remark ``encouraging,'' but questioned why the governor has not pushed for a law requiring DNA testing in the state that leads the nation in executions.
``Not only should they be doing DNA testing for Death Row inmates, but for all inmates where the science could prove guilt or innocence,'' said Barry Scheck, who gained national prominence as part of O.J.
Simpson's legal defense team.
``The technology is such where we now have this magic bullet of truth and we should be using it in every case where it would make a difference,'' Scheck said.
Scheck is working with Austin lawyer Maurie Levin on behalf of Texas Death Row inmate Ricky McGinn, whose execution is scheduled for June 1.
The lawyers filed a petition on Friday with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on McGinn's behalf that DNA testing be used in his case.
McGinn was convicted of raping and killing a 12-year-old girl in Brown County in Central Texas.
He has denied committing the crimes, and his lawyers say DNA testing on the hair and body fluid samples found at the crime scene are essential to settle any doubt in the case.
McGinn had been scheduled for execution on April 27.
But Fort Worth lawyer Richard Alley, who was handling his case at the time, won a stay because the March 28 tornado that ravaged the city destroyed his office _ including papers relevant to his client's case.
Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, made the DNA remark during a teleconference from Austin with a Catholic journalists organization meeting in Baltimore.
The governor did not waver from his strong support for the death penalty, which has been carried out 217 times in Texas, 130 of those during his 51/2-year tenure.
And he reiterated his long-held assertion that none of those sent to Huntsville's death chamber were innocent.
``I don't believe we've executed a single innocent person,'' Bush said told The Associated Press.
``If the DNA testing helps to settle a case, or erase any doubts or concerns, we would support that''.
The death penalty has become a key issue in Bush's run for the presidency, not only because of the pace of executions in Texas.
Earlier this year, Republican Gov.
George Ryan of Illinois imposed a moratorium on execution once evidence emerged raising doubt on the guilt of 13 inmates awaiting the death penalty in that state.
Texas executed 35 inmates last year, the most in the nation, and this year is ahead of that pace, with 18 so far.
The state set a record with 37 executions in 1997.
Bush has spared only one condemned inmate since becoming governor in 1995.
He has rejected appeals from U.S. religious leaders, the Vatican and the European Parliament in several death penalty cases, including that of Karla Faye Tucker, the Houston pickax killer who had professed to having become a born-again Christian in prison.
Texas law limits the governor's power in capital cases.
A governor may commute a death sentence or grant clemency only upon the recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.
A governor on his own may grant a one-time, 30-day stay of execution to allow a condemned inmate more time to pursue court appeals.
Although Bush has been reluctant to intervene in death penalty cases, he has issued pardons to two inmates sentenced on sexual assault charges because DNA tests showed that the men were not guilty.

WASHINGTON _ Convicted murderer Gary Graham, set to be executed today in Huntsville, is hitting Gov.
George W.
Bush's presidential campaign with its greatest challenge since Arizona Sen.
John McCain put up a dramatic primary fight.
``Every campaign is faced with a major issue, either planned or unplanned, and it appears that Bush is being faced with his first major issue with this death penalty controversy,'' said Scott Reed, former campaign manager of Sen.
Bob Dole's 1996 White House bid.
``How he handles this will be one of the three or four deciding factors on election day.
I put it up there with the vice-presidential selection, the convention and the debates, big events that affect the way the world looks at the candidate''.
Bush told CNN Wednesday that he would, ``uphold the laws of the land and if it costs me politically, it costs me politically''.
But with the world watching, the 18-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, all Bush appointees, have taken the unusual step of delaying a decision on Graham's fate until noon today.
Under Texas law, Bush can accept or veto board recommendations to pardon Graham or commute his sentence.
He cannot spare Graham's life against the board's wishes because former Gov.
Ann Richards already did that in Graham's case in 1993.
The board has recommended a death sentence be commuted to life in prison only once and Bush accepted that recommendation.
Graham's conviction, based on the testimony of a single eyewitness, has been grabbing media attention for the past several week.
It has been driven by newspaper reports questioning the fairness of Texas' justice system; reports of innocent men set free thanks to DNA testing; and a Columbia University study that found two-thirds of death sentences in the past 23 years have been overturned on appeal.
In addition, the Rev.
Pat Robertson and conservative columnist George Will have called for a reassessment of the death penalty.
The Rev.
Jesse Jackson and human rights activist Bianca Jagger joined protestors in Austin to support Graham as death penalty opponents heckled Bush on the stump.
Nationally, death penalty support, still strong, has softened since 1980.
Texans, however, continue to firmly back the ultimate punishment, despite concerns that the state has executed innocent people and expressions of strong support by Texans for making DNA testing available to inmates, according to a Scripps Howard Texas poll released today.
The survey of 1,000 Texans, conducted May 22-June 16, showed 73 percent in favor of the death penalty, consistent with national polls.
Seventy-two percent still favored it even when presented with true life imprisonment as an alternative.
But 57 percent also said they believe that Texas has executed innocent inmates.
Thirty-eight percent said that the state's image benefits from its frequent use of capital punishment.
Texas leads the nation in executions.
``What was a little surprising to me is the number of people who think Texas has executed innocent people,'' said poll director Ty Meighan.
``I think that's more a criticism of the criminal justice system.
Perhaps people think that some of these inmates are not getting a fair trial or they don't have the proper legal representation''.
Seventy-six percent of the respondents said Texas should declare a moratorium on death sentences for inmates whose cases might be affected by DNA testing.
Eighty-seven percent said the testing should be available to inmates at no charge.
Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said Bush weakens his credibility when he insists that all 134 inmates executed on his watch have been guilty.
He said Vice President Gore, a death penalty supporter, has nothing to gain by speaking out.
But in one of his few statements on the issue, Gore said Wednesday that a moratorium on executions is the right thing for states with numerous criminal justice errors.
He said he did not know the record in Texas, pointing instead to Illinois.
``This is really a situation, to use the metaphor, of Bush hanging himself,'' Mellman said.
``The reality is the public still supports the death penalty, but the level of support is shrinking and shrinking fairly dramatically...Given what's happened in science and what's been revealed in these studies of the death penalty, for anybody to say they're 100 percent sure that everyone put to death has been guilty is ignorant''.
Republican Illinois Gov.
George Ryan suspended executions after 13 death row inmates were exonerated and released.
Recently, Bush granted his first-ever 30-day reprieve so that the inmate, Ricky McGinn, could get further DNA testing.
Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas law professor, said what Bush does today and later matters less in political terms than how he does it.
``This has not to do with Bush's chances to win the presidency so much as it is another opportunity for him to show whether or not he can seem brave and serious enough when he talks about these matters,'' Buchanan said.
This is particularly true since this issue will not fade away for Bush: at least 16 Texas inmates are scheduled to be executed by the November election.
Last year, conservative writer Tucker Carlson quoted Bush mocking Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman executed since the Civil War, who was convicted of the ax-killing of two people.
Tucker, a white woman who never contested her guilt, asked to be spared because she found religion and redemption on death row.
Graham, a black man with a string of crimes behind him, does not pose the same sort of public relations problem.
Houston police accused him of 22 crimes.
He pleaded guilty to 10 armed robberies.
Victim David Spiers was left unable tis allowed by law from Gov.
Ann Richards in 1993.
He cannot halt the execution unless the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles first recommends a reprieve, commutation to a life sentence, or a pardon.
He cannot overrule a board vote to proceed with the execution.
He can veto a board vote to grant a reprieve, commutation, or pardon _ and order the execution to proceed.

AUSTIN, Texas _ Amnesty International, an anti-death penalty group that monitors abuses of justice around the world, says in a new report that Texas' secretive clemency process for condemned criminals violates minimum safeguards for human rights.
The organization usually reserves such criticism for overseas countries.
``In a jurisdiction that executes more people than any other in the Western World, Texas has turned the final safeguard of executive clemency into nothing more than an empty gesture,'' according to a report the group released Tuesday.
Texas is one of 38 U.S. states with the death penalty.
The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles _ which recommends to the governor whether to commute sentences to life in prison or grant temporary reprieves _ has been widely criticized in recent months for not thoroughly reviewing cases, not holding meetings and not conducting its business in public.
The board has granted clemency only once in 17 years.
Such a system, the Amnesty International report said, ``violates minimum human rights safeguards by failing to provide any genuine opportunity for death row inmates to seek and obtain the reduction of their sentences''.
Victor Rodriguez, chairman of the 18-member parole board, dismissed the criticism as unfounded and unfair.
``Amnesty International is against the death penalty, so their conclusions are not surprising in the least,'' he said.
``The standard in this country that guides us for fairness and equity is constitutionality.
Texas has a fair and constitutional system, and the courts repeatedly have said that''.
When asked about the report Tuesday, Gov.
George W.
Bush, who appoints the parole board members, said the clemency system has withstood court challenge.
``The courts have looked at it.
It's fine,'' he said.
Rodriguez said he believes the report is timed to coincide with an orchestrated protest over the scheduled June 17 execution of Joseph Stanley Faulder, twice convicted of murdering an East Texas woman during a robbery.
The Amnesty International report noted that the U.S.
Supreme Court affirmed the need for a meaningful clemency process when it re-approved capital punishment in 1976.
The organization contends Texas' system falls far short of what the high court had in mind.
``Far from serving as the fail-safe mechanism envisaged by the U.S.
Supreme Court, the Texas (Board of Pardons and Paroles) had become something akin to a hostile and secretive agency interested only in preserving the illusion of meaningful clemency review,'' the report said.
The report cites several cases, including Houston pickax killer Karla Faye Tucker.
She was unanimously rejected for clemency even though supporters insisted she was a born-again Christian who no longer posed a threat to society.
Although the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected her court challenge, a dissenting opinion from Judge Morris Overstreet described the clemency process as ``totally inadequate'' and ``a legal fiction at best,'' because the overwhelming majority of petitions are denied.
In a separate court challenge, Danny Lee Barber and Faulder took the board to an Austin federal court last December where testimony revealed that only a handful of 4,000 letters in support of Faulder's clemency were forwarded to board members; some board members had little or no memory of the case they had decided amid a flurry of publicity; and board members do not meet to decide cases.
They review the files privately and vote by telephone and fax machine.
Although U.S.
District Judge Sam Sparks upheld the constitutionality of Texas' clemency system, he sharply criticized it.
``A flip of the coin would be more merciful than these votes''.
Rodriguez said the criticisms are misplaced.
He said the board recently has changed its rules to give members more time to review filings and to allow convicts face-to-face meetings with board members.
Mark Warren, a coordinator in Amnesty International's Canadian section who helped compile the report, said he hopes the report's conclusions do not go unheeded.
At present, he said, Texas' clemency process offers little public assurance that someone will be executed who should not be.
``That safety net is in tatters now,'' he said.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov.
George W.
Bush gets criticized for his hands-off approach to state executions, but state law leaves little room for governors to act in these life-and-death decisions.
Supporters say Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, allows the 18-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to do its job freely by maintaining an arm's-length relationship.
''The governor leaves it up to each parole board member to make their own decisions after they review the case.
They're an independent body,'' said Bush spokesman Mike Jones.
Others contend that Bush does direct the board -- through his public statements on executions and his power to appoint members to their six-year, $80,000-per-year jobs.
All current board members are Bush appointees.
''It does seem that they would want to be in line with his way of thinking about it,'' said Richard C.
Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.
Bush has said he supports the death penalty and doesn't believe an innocent person has been executed in Texas during his administration.
But David Dow, a University of Houston law professor who represents condemned inmates, suggests both Bush and his Democratic predecessor, Ann Richards, have used the parole board ''as an excuse to avoid having to make a tough, moral decision''.
In Texas, the governor can only issue a one-time, 30-day reprieve or act on a recommendation of the parole board to grant a stay, commute a sentence or issue a pardon.
Those limits evolved from a pardons scandal in the 1920s and are aimed at preventing a governor from granting continuous reprieves.
Since Bush became governor in 1995, the state has executed 143 people, including 32 this year.
Texas has executed 231 people in the past two decades, the most in the nation.
Three more executions are scheduled before the Nov.
7 presidential election, including that of high-profile inmate Ricky Nolen McGinn on Sept.
27. Bush granted a 30-day reprieve for McGinn in June -- the only reprieve he has granted as governor -- so that further DNA testing could be done.
But the tests failed to clear McGinn in the rape and murder of his 12-year-old stepdaughter.
Bush never has witnessed an execution.
For the most part, he limits his role to privately quizzing his attorneys about cases, aides say.
Unlike Richards, who met with her general counsel about executions, Bush has met with the staff lawyers who studied condemned inmates' cases, said Jim Sallans, a former staff attorney who reviewed death row cases for both governors.
Sallans left after Bush's first term.
Bush would read the lawyer's memo -- about three to four pages -- and talk with the attorney, usually from 15 minutes to 45 minutes but perhaps up to two hours, Sallans said.
Ultimately, Sallans said, Bush would ask: ''OK, Did he do it?
Did he get a fair trial''?
Bush did not try to instruct the board how to vote, he said.
''That's political suicide,'' Sallans said.
Gerald Garrett, the board chairman, said Bush takes a hands-off approach with members, telling them, ''in essence, make the right decision and if there is political fallout, so be it''.
The Texas governor does not have the power to declare a moratorium on executions, as Illinois Gov.
George Ryan, a Republican, has done.
But some suggest Bush, if concerned about the fairness of Texas' death penalty, could use his power of persuasion to generate public support for a moratorium.
''He could have a much higher profile in the Texas death penalty debate, if he wanted to,'' said Dow, the professor who has represented inmates.
Dow also contends that governors can communicate with the parole board as much as they wish, through direct dialogue or public statements.
Case in point: Henry Lee Lucas.
Bush asked the parole board to investigate the conviction of Lucas, a drifter sentenced to death for the murder of an unidentified woman known as ''Orange Socks''.
The parole board recommended commuting Lucas' sentence to life in prison, and Bush approved it in June 1998.
The case of Karla Faye Tucker -- a pickax murderer, a Christian convert and the first woman executed in Texas since the Civil War era -- was more clear-cut for Bush.
''I told him that's an easy one,'' Sallans recalls.
''She did it, she confessed to it, she got a very fair trial''.
Tucker was executed in February 1998.
As for Graham, Bush maintained his public silence about the case until the end, despite being dogged about it on the campaign trail.
Graham maintained his innocence in the murder of a man during a 1981 holdup.
In the end, Bush said he agreed with the parole board's vote in favor of Graham's execution.
''After considering all the facts,'' he said, ''I am confident justice is being done''.

Unlike past death penalty cases, where Bush waited until all appeals has been exhausted before indicating how he was leaning, he made his comments Wednesday ahead of an anticipated court ruling in the case.
Bush aides said Wednesday that they did recognize that this case was one of the more attention-getting death penalty cases, but they insisted that such factors have no bearing on how Bush acts or on what he says.
Yet the case also affords Bush a chance to speak in a moderate voice on the death penalty without seeming to pander, because the case involves some understandable questions of evidence that have drawn national attention.
One aide noted that this case, like that of Henry Lee Lucas, involves a question of evidence, and the aide suggested that Bush finds this sort of factor more relevant and compelling than sentimental, emotional factors such as those involved with the decision not to grant a reprieve to Karla Faye Tucker.
In other words, this case, like that of Lucas, has questions that go directly to the matter of guilt, not of contrition.
Tucker, a born-again Christian who said she had repented for her crimes and whose case drew pleas from religious leaders, was executed in 1998.
Bush commuted Lucas' sentence to life in prison in 1998, following a recommendation by the state pardons board, after serious questions were raised about whether Lucas committed the murder he was convicted of.
Bush's embrace of DNA testing for death row inmates, which he never advocated in Texas, comes as some parts of the nation have seen a rethinking of capital punishment amid concerns about the execution of innocent prisoners and polls that indicate support for the death penalty is at a 20-year low, although most Americans still favor it.
Earlier this year, Illinois Gov.
George Ryan, a Republican, imposed a moratorium on capital punishment there after the exoneration of 13 men on death row, and he said last month that executions will not resume until he has a ``100 percent guarantee'' that no innocent person will face the death penalty again.
Across the nation, bills have been introduced in a dozen states to halt executions.
And in New Hampshire, state lawmakers in May became the first to vote to abolish the death penalty since the Supreme Court allowed executions to resume in 1976.
The New Hampshire governor, Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, has vetoed the measure.
In addition to its appeal before the federal appeals court, McGinn's defense team, which includes Barry Scheck, the DNA expert and New York lawyer who helped defend O.J.
Simpson, has filed a civil lawsuit in Texas to obtain the hair and semen samples taken from the victim's body so they can be retested.
Should DNA tests indicate that the hair and semen did not come from McGinn, that would ``raise doubts about whether he could have committed the whole crime,'' said Scheck, who added that he has ``no idea'' about the guilt or innocence of McGinn.
Only two states, New York and Illinois, allow condemned prisoners to get new DNA tests of evidence in their cases, and Scheck said Congress should pass a bill making that standard across the nation.
Lee Haney, who prosecuted the murder case in 1993, said ``as far as humanly possible'' he is convinced of McGinn's guilt.
If new DNA tests indicated the hair and semen were not from McGinn, he said, ``It would obviously lead to the conclusion that someone else was involved in the sexual assault in addition to McGinn, but it would not affect other evidence in case that very clearly ties him to the murder''.
That includes blood from the victim in McGinn's car and on his clothes, he said.
Questions have also been raised about the adequacy of some of McGinn's legal representation.
A defense team investigator in the case, Tina Church, told the Dallas Morning News that McGinn's appellate lawyer, Richard Alley, did not know about the inconclusive DNA tests until a few months ago, when she brought them to his attention.
`He should have known about the tests,' Church told the newspaper.
Alley, of Fort Worth, Texas, has twice been publicly reprimanded by the State Bar of Texas _ once in 1985, the other time in 1992 _ and there are two private complaints pending against him, according to state bar officials.
Alley said neither pending complaint concerns the McGinn case, and he said he would have liked to have brought the motion for DNA retesting more quickly, but that it took time to obtain the necessary affidavit from a scientific expert.
AUSTIN, Texas _ The issue of law and order has always been part of George W.
Bush's politics.
He ran for governor of Texas in 1994 with a series of grainy black-and-white commercials depicting a man abducting a woman at gunpoint in a parking garage and, a moment later, a police officer draping a blanket over the woman's body.
Charging that his Democratic opponent, Gov.
Ann Richards, was soft on crime, Bush promised to get tougher with criminals.
That stand helped him win, and an examination of his record over the nearly five years he has been governor shows he has been consistent in pressing a law-and-order agenda.
Bush has presided over the nation's largest prison-building program and a record number of executions in his tenure as governor.
He has signed laws expanding the right of Texans to carry guns and has opposed gun-control legislation.
``For Governor Bush, gun control is not yet part of crime control,'' said Travis County Constable Bruce Elfant, one of the many law-enforcement officials who have come to see gun control as important as fighting drugs and gangs in the battle against crime.
In a conservative state where being ``Texas tough'' is high praise, Bush's positions have been popular.
How Bush's record on criminal justice, particularly gun control, will appeal to voters in other regions remains to be tested as he campaigns for the Republican nomination for president.
In Texas, experts on criminal justice are studying another question: whether his policies are responsible for the state's drop in crime Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said his initiatives, especially those toughening punishment for juvenile offenders and making convicts serve longer terms, had produced a 20 percent drop in the Texas crime rate.
But according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, crime had already fallen 25 percent under Gov.
Richards, from 1991 to 1994, as she pushed a multibillion-dollar-prison-building program.
Since Bush took office in 1995, crime rates have also fallen as much, or more, in most states as they have in Texas.
This has led governors and mayors across the country to take credit, even as many experts point out that the widespread decline in crime rates makes it less likely that any one policy can be credited.
Longer prison sentences are one factor in the overall decrease, experts say, but so are an improved economy, a decline in the use of crack, new police strategies and changing attitudes among young people.
When Bush ran against Gov.
Richards, when he pledged to support a concealed-weapons bill.
When, as governor, he signed the bill into law in 1995, he declared, ``This is a bill to make Texas a safer place''.
The bill had been championed by the National Rifle Association, but was opposed by the police chiefs of Texas' largest cities, who were concerned that the law would lead to more violent confrontations between individuals armed with guns and a greater risk to police officers.
The bill's opponents had predicted it would lead to a rash of shootings.
Supporters said it would sharply cut crime.
Neither seems to have happened.
Bush went against the police chiefs of Texas' seven largest cities this spring by opposing a bill to require background checks on all prospective firearms buyers at gun shows.
According to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, gun shows are the leading source of guns for criminals and juveniles in Texas.
The bill requiring background checks died in committee April 20, a few hours after the school killings in Littleton, Colo.
, which were carried out with guns bought at gun shows.
Under Bush, Texas has the largest criminal justice system in the country, with 545,000 people in prison or jail or on probation or parole.
Texas' prisons hold 724 inmates for every 100,000 residents, second only to Louisiana's 736.
By contrast, Minnesota, with the lowest incarceration rate, has 117 inmates per 100,000 people.
The buildup of the Texas prison system was underway when Gov.
Richards took office in 1991 and was far advanced when Bush took office in 1995.
In 1989, the state prison system had 41,000 beds.
When the buildup is completed next year, it will have 150,000 beds.
The Bush administration says the total cost will approach $3 billion, while some of the state's leading Democrats put the figure at $10 billion.
In any event, Bush has enthusiastically supported the continued growth of prisons, unlike California, where politicians have begun to question that state's prison-building program.
Republicans worry about increasing taxes to pay for the new prisons and Democrats argue that the program has taken money away from the state college and university system.
The money spent to build prisons is cutting into state spending for public education, one of Bush's priorities, said Eva DeLuna Castro, a budget analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research organization in Austin.
One of Bush's major planks in his race against Ms.
Richards was a promise to tighten the juvenile justice system in the face of skyrocketing teen-age crime, and as governor, Bush has transformed the juvenile justice code.
One result: a tripling of the number of young inmates in the Texas Youth Commission's juvenile prisons, to 6,000.
``If George W.
Bush can do for the United States what he has done for Texas, no one can lick his boots,'' said Dallas Juvenile Court Judge Hal Gaither, an adviser to Bush who describes himself as ``the most conservative man in Texas''.
The major change under Bush, Gaither said, was switching the main purpose of the juvenile system from protecting the best interests of the child, its historical role, to more of a prison system in which punishment is emphasized.
Among the changes was lowering the age at which juveniles can be sent to adult court for serious crimes to 14, increasing the maximum sentence for a juvenile to 40 years and requiring a one-year minimum sentence for anyone sentenced to the juvenile prisons.
Bush has strongly supported the death penalty and he has presided over a record 98 executions as governor, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
Among those executed was Karla Faye Tucker, whose death-row conversion to Christianity led to calls for clemency from the Rev.
Pat Robertson and other religious leaders.
She was only the second woman to be executed in the United States since the Supreme Court allowed the resumption of capital punishment.
This appeal from the Christian Right gave Bush ``maneuverability'' to commute Ms.
Tucker's sentence without offending his conservative supporters, said Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, which opposes the death penalty.
But Bush chose not to intervene, saying: ``In every death penalty that comes to my desk, I ask this question: Innocent or guilty?
And I will tell you of all the death penalties we have had in our state, I am confident that those that have been put to death have been guilty''.
Addressing appeals for clemency based on Ms.
Tucker becoming born-again, Bush said, ``I have concluded judgments about the heart and soul of an individual on death row are best left to a higher authority''.
Given the frequency of executions, some Texas legislators introduced a bill this spring to bar the execution of the mentally retarded.
Five mentally retarded inmates have been executed in Texas since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
After the bill passed the state Senate, Bush announced his opposition, saying, ``I like the law the way it is right now,'' with juries having the right to make the decision.
The bill died in the House.
DETROIT (AP) -- United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich is giving no indication that his union's troubled relations with General Motors Corp.
have improved since last year's costly strikes virtually shut down the No.
1 automaker's North American operations.
``We still have our problems,'' Yokich told about 2,000 union leaders Sunday as they gathered to set an agenda for this year's national contract talks with GM, Ford Motor Co.
and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG.
Yokich said job security again would be the UAW's priority when it begins the triennial contract talks in June on behalf of about 396,000 U.S. workers.
And he leveled his most pointed attack yet on GM's plans to reduce labor costs at its small-car plants through ``modular'' assembly methods.
Last summer's strikes at two parts plants in Flint lasted several weeks and cost GM about $2 billion while they idled nearly 200,000 GM workers and thousands of employees at independent suppliers.
The dispute was largely over job security and ``outsourcing,'' the practice of contracting in-house work to outside suppliers who generally pay less and typically are nonunion.
GM, which once made most of its parts, is moving toward becoming largely a designer and assembler of vehicles.
Since the strikes, GM has announced plans to convert its aging U.S. small-car plants to modular assembly, in which outside suppliers perform much of subassembly work now done on the assembly plant floor.
In a modular plant, preassembled parts clusters, such as an entire dashboard, are delivered to the assembly plant by outside suppliers and installed on the chassis.
Far fewer UAW workers would be needed to assemble each car, significantly reducing manufacturing costs.
``There's nothing new about modular assembly,'' Yokich said.
``It's just another word for...
outsourcing. It's just another way to destroy good-paying jobs and benefits, that we intend to deal with in this round of negotiations''.
The UAW argues that modular assembly will give the automaker less control over design and quality, increase logistical complexity and potentially add to warranty costs.
Yokich bristled at suggestions that GM loses money on its small cars because of its labor costs.
``They claim they lose $1,000 on every small car they build themselves.
It's funny, their competitors -- Ford and Chrysler -- never lose anything on their small cars.
So is it our fault or their fault in how they run their plants?
It certainly isn't our fault''.
Yokich also chastised GM for failing to consult with the UAW before it decided to spin off its big parts unit.
GM had an initial public offering of nearly 18 percent of Delphi Automotive Systems stock earlier this year and plans to spin off the rest of the company to GM shareholders by year's end.
The move has scared Delphi workers and retirees, said Yokich, who implied that the spinoff was being conducted with little, if any, consultation with UAW leaders.
GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said the company would have no comment on Yokich's remarks.
Yokich also attacked the high salaries paid to the industry's top executives, and singled out the multimillion-dollar stock options that former Chrysler Corp.
executives will reap as a result of the deal that created DaimlerChrysler.
``If it was good enough for them to get all that money because they sold off to Daimler, it should be good enough for us,'' Yokich said.
Yokich said Mercedes-Benz, the German luxury car unit of DaimlerChrysler that operates a nonunion assembly plant in Alabama, should be under the UAW contract.
The veteran union leader had no criticism of Ford, which has the best relationship with the UAW among the three automakers.
Yokich said the union will begin bargaining with the company that presents the best initial proposal.
In 1996, the UAW negotiated first with Ford and used that deal as a pattern for pacts with Chrysler and GM.
The current three-year contracts expire in September.
The UAW gained more workers than it lost in 1998, the first time that has happened since 1989, Yokich said.
Much of the gain, however, has come in businesses outside the auto industry, such as health care and government .
DETROIT (AP) -- The United Auto Workers reached tentative agreements with General Motors Corp.
and its former parts division Tuesday on contacts covering about 185,000 workers.
The terms of the union's deals with GM and Delphi Automotive Systems Corp.
were not released.
The UAW said the terms would not be announced until after ratification votes.
No date was set.
The deal follows a lucrative four-year contract the UAW negotiated with DaimlerChrysler AG.
And it leaves Ford Motor Co.
as the only automaker still to finish a contract with the UAW.
The DaimlerChrysler deal was a four-year pact with 3 percent raises each year, a $1,350 signing bonus and improvements in pensions.
The UAW traditionally negotiates the same basic terms for all contracts.
GM has been working on improving relations with the UAW after last summer's 54-day strike at two Flint parts factories.
The strike virtually shut down the automaker's North American production, costing GM about $2 billion in lost revenue and a chunk of market share it has yet to recover.
The strikes were largely over plant work rules and the loss of work to outside suppliers, issues certain to be back on the table in these talks.
GM has said it needs to be more flexible and efficient to compete.
GM also has spun off its Delphi parts unit into a separate company with 42,000 UAW employees.
GM said Delphi could be more profitable and compete better if it went after business from other automakers -- something it couldn't do as a division of GM.
The deal came after two days of intensive talks involving UAW President Stephen P.
Yokich and GM Chairman Jack Smith.
The UAW represents about 143,000 workers at GM, about 80,000 fewer than it did in 1990.
The job losses have come from GM closing factories, using fewer workers on assembly lines, relying on suppliers for more work and not replacing workers as fast as they retire.
Consequently, the UAW has made protecting jobs a major goal.
The DaimlerChrysler contract includes clauses aimed at keeping job levels near current totals.
The union also proposed a ban on outsourcing and the right to strike over sourcing issues -- including sending new work to a supplier that a GM factory could do.
And it asked for an ``America First'' pledge, saying GM should invest in plants in the United States rather than expand in foreign countries.
The UAW also wanted Delphi workers covered under the GM national contract for the foreseeable future.
Other demands included adding compensatory time off to overtime pay and giving the UAW a seat on GM's Board of Directors.
In addition to wage improvements, the DaimlerChrysler contract also improves pensions -- an important goal for the UAW's older workforce.
The average GM worker is 48 years old, and some 32,000 workers have 30 years of experience.
Talks at Ford were continuing at a lower level this week.
The UAW has said it was very concerned that Ford wanted to spin off its Visteon parts unit as GM did with Delphi.
FLINT, Mich.
_ Negotiators worked steadily Wednesday to resolve a monthlong strike at General Motors auto parts factories here, but more signs emerged that any deal would address local disputes and might not produce big improvements in GM's competitiveness.
General Motors Corp.
has used the strike as an occasion to warn that it may close car factories and eliminate car models while focusing more on high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks _ a shift in direction that Ford Motor Co.
and Chrysler Corp.
have already made and that Wall Street analysts would like to see GM duplicate.
Donald Hackworth, GM's group vice president for North American car operations, said in a message to employees this week that GM was working on a ``detailed rationalization plan'' for its factories and models.
But Richard Shoemaker, the vice president for GM issues at the UAW, told several reporters Wednesday that little attention had been given to any such move.
``We haven't had really focused discussions on that whole subject,'' he said Wednesday afternoon during a lull in top-level negotiations at a Holiday Inn.
Shoemaker strongly hinted that factory closings could lead to more strikes.
``If as a result of this strike they decide to close facilities, that obviously would not improve the relationship and it would go a long way to continuing confrontations,'' he said.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for labor relations, arrived in Flinton Wednesday afternoon for further discussions with Shoemaker but declined to talk to reporters.
GM's problem is that as the strike has dragged on, expectations have risen on Wall Street that a settlement will break the pattern of inconclusive deals in a dozen other local strikes over the last five years.
``They had better come up with something this time that is more than `we invest $50 million and agree to give them 100 jobs,''' the typical settlement in other local strikes, said Maryann Keller, an analyst at Furman Selz in New York.
``If it's something along those lines, it won't be enough'' to satisfy institutional investors.
Shoemaker also warned GM on Wednesday not to sell Delphi Automotive Systems, the automaker's parts division.
GM and the UAW reached an understanding more than a year ago that GM may sell up to 20 percent of the division, possibly through an initial public offering, he said, but a sale of the entire division would not be acceptable.
``That would probably set the stage for a hell of a battle,'' Shoemaker said.
GM estimates that the strikes here have already cost it $1.18 billion through June 30, with further losses likely in the coming days.
The strikes at two parts factories have forced GM to close 26 of its 29 North American assembly plants.
GM and UAW bargainers have been conducting long meetings for the last week, with each day's sessions lasting a little later into the evening as both sides struggle to reach a deal by Thursday or Friday.
A deal by that point would allow time for the 9,200 striking workers to vote on ratification over the weekend and reopen the struck auto parts factories Monday, the day when GM workers would normally return from the company's regularly scheduled two-week summer shutdown.
Even if the parts factories do reopen then, it could take another two weeks for enough parts to be produced to allow the reopening of the 26 GM assembly plants.
AUBURN HILLS, Mich.
(AP) -- When leaders of General Motors Corp.
and the United Auto Workers met Wednesday to start the long process of negotiating a new national contract, there was no sign of the acrimony that has long marked their relations.
Just the opposite: It was all smiles and comments chosen to offend nobody.
Quite remarkable, too, since just last summer the world's largest automaker and its biggest union were embroiled in a pair of costly strikes that only made their bad relationship worse.
``I guess the days of everybody beatin' the drum and rattling the swords are gone,'' UAW President Stephen P.
Yokich told reporters.
Gary L.
Cowger, the executive GM brought in to repair its union relations, repeated the policy that GM adopted shortly after the strikes, which cost it about $2 billion in lost revenue and a chunk of market share it has yet to recover.
``We've said since last summer that it is of utmost importance to the top leadership of this company to improve our communications with the UAW,'' Cowger said.
``We continue to work on that and continue to make that a focus and a priority''.
Even cynical UAW leaders said they were now convinced GM was serious.
Richard Shoemaker, the union's chief GM negotiator, said the relationship has changed considerably since the strikes, but that the change has yet to filter down to the plants.
``Obviously, that's where it ultimately has to get to for it to be successful, and I think it would be premature to say it's reached that point yet,'' he said.
``I also think it would be unfair not to say that I believe there's a sincere interest in doing just that''.
GM had good reason to dump its get-tough stance.
It need only look to rival Ford Motor Co.
, which has not had a national contract strike in 23 years and is the industry's poster company for good union relations.
Ford today is the most profitable of Detroit's automakers.
Last year's strikes were largely over plant work rules and the loss of work to outside suppliers, issues that will be back on the table in these national negotiations.
The focus of the work-rule debate is expected to be GM's plans to adopt ``modular assembly'' techniques at its small-car plants.
Modular assembly uses outside, lower-cost suppliers to do more subassembly work.
The suppliers deliver to the plant large parts ``modules,'' such as an entire preassembled door or dashboard.
As a result, fewer high-wage UAW workers are needed for final assembly of the car.
The future of workers at GM's former parts subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems Corp.
, also is a key issue in these negotiations.
GM divested Delphi in an initial public offering and stock transfer earlier this year, over the union's objections.
As a concession to the union, GM and Delphi have agreed to keep Delphi workers under terms of the new GM contract for at least the next three years, according to sources on both sides who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The triennial contract talks with Detroit's automakers began Monday at Ford Motor Co.
and were followed Tuesday by an initial meeting at DaimlerChrysler AG.
The talks will continue through the summer and intensify in early September when the union will pick a lead company to negotiate economic issues.
The current three-year pacts expire Sept. 14.
DETROIT (AP) -- With a set of precedent-setting contract terms from DaimlerChrysler AG in its pocket, the United Auto Workers appears ready to focus on negotiating a new contract with General Motors Corp.
GM will be expected to match many terms of DaimlerChrysler's apparent agreement -- a four-year contract with 3 percent raises every year, a signing bonus and clauses aimed at protecting union jobs.
Analysts said that given the industry's record sales and profits, the UAW could win more than in the past -- and that all sides would work to avoid costly national strikes.
``I don't think at this point that (UAW President) Stephen Yokich would have signed off on anything that wasn't a pretty good deal,'' said John Revitte, a professor at the Michigan State University School of Labor and Industrial Relations.
``He wanted something that would give him leverage at GM or at Ford''.
GM spokesman Edd Snyder said lower-level talks with the UAW took place Thursday.
The GM contract covers 222,000 workers, including those at Delphi Automotive, GM's former parts division.
The agreement on a new national contract for 75,000 DaimlerChrysler workers came after three months of talks and more than 40 hours of marathon bargaining.
Terms of the tentative agreement were not released by company or union spokesmen.
But local union officials in Indiana and New York said the deal was a four-year contract -- rather than the standard three-year pact -- with a 3 percent annual wage increase plus a $1,350 signing bonus.
Recent contracts had in some years paid lump sums rather than percentage increases.
The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press reported the base wages for assembly workers would reach $22.63 per hour in the fourth year, up from the current $20.11.
Roger Brown, president of Local 550 in Indianapolis, also said he had been told the deal includes a statement by DaimlerChrysler emphasizing its neutrality in union organizing.
The union has said it would like to organize DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes-Benz sport utility factory in Alabama with 1,600 workers and Freightliner commercial truck plants in the Carolinas.
It is against federal labor rules for the issue to be part of the UAW's contract.
But by stating its neutrality in the contract, DaimlerChrysler could stay on good terms with its largest union.
In addition, Brown said the deal includes an agreement not to spin off any parts of the company into independent businesses.
Such a clause might be aimed more at GM and Ford than DaimlerChrysler.
GM has spun off its Delphi parts unit, and Ford would like to spin off its Visteon parts unit, a move the UAW opposes.
Brown and Scott Stanton, vice president of Local 624 in Syracuse, N.Y., also said the deal includes improvements in retiree benefits.
Nearly half of the UAW's 407,000 active autoworkers at GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler are eligible for retirement within five years.
``That part of it sounds good,'' said Brown, whose local represents 1,350 workers at a DaimlerChrysler foundry.
``The rest of it we'll have to wait and see when we go to Detroit next week on Monday or Tuesday for an informational meeting''.
Stanton said a ratification vote was scheduled for Sept.
25. Workers interviewed leaving DaimlerChrysler's truck plant in Warren on Thursday afternoon said they had heard little about the agreement because of the secretive nature of the negotiations.
Some said they were pleased with what they had heard so far.
``We're doing well.
We're working a lot of overtime.
We're building a good product,'' said Matthew Lyons, 46, of Macomb County's Macomb Township.
``Chrysler has been good to us''.
According to the company, the average assembly worker at DaimlerChrysler is 43 years old, has 16 years of experience and earns about $70,000 a year, thanks to overtime and profit sharing.
The same worker gets 37 paid vacation days a year.
Union leaders have said that workers were entitled to a share of record automaker profits; the three companies combined earned more than $5.5 billion in the second quarter of 1999.
Wages are an issue at GM, which has sought to mend fences with the UAW after last summer's 54-day strike at two Flint parts factories.
The strike virtually shut down the automaker's North American production.
According to union newsletters, the UAW has asked GM for higher wages, and has sought better overtime compensation with more money and extra time off.
In recent years, automakers have held down employment by increasing overtime; the average GM hourly worker adds about 9 hours of overtime a week.
Union newsletters also said GM had proposed a lifetime employment guarantee for workers with more than 10 years of experience.
The largest issue between Ford and the union appears to be Ford's plans for Visteon and the unit's 23,500 UAW workers.
The UAW fears a separate parts company would try to cut jobs and lower wages.
Dale Brickner, a retired Michigan State University labor professor, said the no-spinoff clause might be aimed at Ford and GM, which spun off its Delphi parts unit, rather than DaimlerChrysler.
``I suspect that's going to weigh heavily in the Ford and GM unit talks,'' he said.
Brickner said the UAW may tell the companies ``you have to pay a price for doing something else with you parts companies.''
MATAMOROS, Mexico _ In one of General Motors' sprawling auto parts plants in a Matamoros industrial park just south of the Rio Grande, thousands of Mexican workers earn $1 to $2 an hour producing instrument panels and steering wheels for GM cars and trucks.
Until just a few years ago, U.S. workers earning close to $22 an hour at GM's Delphi East factory in Flint, Mich.
, made the instrument panels.
And those at a plant to the north in Saginaw produced the steering wheels.
GM's shift of production from Flint and Saginaw to this border city facing Brownsville, Texas, was part of a sweeping 20-year transfer of its U.S. auto parts industry across the border.
Since 1978, GM has built more than 50 parts factories in Mexico, which today employ 72,000 workers, making its parts subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Services, Mexico's largest private employer.
Other companies from the United States have, of course, also moved plants to Mexico.
Ford Motor Co.
has 11 parts factories in Mexico; Chrysler has none.
The transfer of production to Mexico and other countries has become a focus of the United Automobile Workers strike against GM, which began at a stamping plant in Flint and at the Delphi East factory.
UAW officials in the United States have accused General Motors of ``putting America last''.
In Mexico, where the strike has idled 23,000 workers at two dozen Delphi plants, Delphi managers have told workers that the union is demanding that GM close its Mexican plants and return its parts production to the United States, said Juan Villafuerte Morales, a union officer representing workers at Delphi's Matamoros factories.
The plants have been partially idled by the strike in Flint.
``Most of our workers understand that they're doing work that used to be done in United States factories because managers explain that to them on the plant floor,'' Villafuerte said.
``And let me tell you, the jobs are very welcome here''.
GM says that transferring production south has enabled it to cut costs in labor-intensive assembly production, compete more effectively against Ford, Chrysler and Japanese automakers, and also to keep engineering and other operations in the United States.
The financial advantages of producing parts in Mexico are substantial, and some economists say that the North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect in January 1994, has only increased them.
Many plants have no union, and those that do are represented by the Confederation of Mexican Workers, which is controlled by Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and works with the government to avoid strikes.
The union has kept the UAW at arm's length.
Thousands of Mexican workers at GM and other U.S.-owned factories live in dirt-floor shacks in slums ringing the industrial parks where they work.
Yet many say that they are delighted to have their jobs, which often start at Mexico's minimum wage of $3.40 a day but can pay experienced workers several times that.
A Delphi spokesman said the company would in the next 18 months help 7,000 employees buy their own homes.
``It's a good job,'' said a 23-year-old woman who earns $1.36 an hour painting buttons on car radios at Deltronicos de Matamoros, a Delphi plant.
The woman, who asked that her name not be used during an interview at her one-room wood-frame shed in a gritty, wind-blown Matamoros squatters' settlement, said the choking smell of solvents at her work station gave her headaches.
``It's difficult work,'' she said.
``But I'm glad to have it''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn GM opened its first factory in Mexico in 1935, assembling trucks in the capital from parts imported from the United States.
After a 1962 Mexican law required foreign automakers to increase the local content of their vehicles, GM built three engine and vehicle plants in the 1960s and '70s.
The new plants, like similar factories built by Ford and Chrysler, assembled vehicles for the Mexican market.
In the decades since, GM has continued to assemble vehicles in Mexico.
But in the late 1970s, in response to an earlier law encouraging foreign manufacturers to produce goods here for export tax-free, GM changed strategy.
``GM began to see Mexico as a supplier for its U.S. vehicle assembly plants, and in the 1980s built an entire parts industry here,'' said Arnulfo Arteaga, a Mexico City professor who studies the auto industry.
``Now, Delphi's Mexican plants basically turn out parts once produced in the United States''.
GM erected its first Mexican parts plant, to assemble wiring systems, in the large border city of Juarez in 1978.
``What is now Delphi Automotive had run into unprecedented competition,'' said Michael Hissam, a spokesman at Delphi's Mexico headquarters in Juarez.
``We embarked on a plan to reduce costs by focusing final assembly in Mexico while keeping our more capital-intensive engineering, tooling and prototyping activities in the U.S.
Did we come to Mexico for lower labor costs?
Yes. But we also found something else _ excellent Mexican management and a dedicated Mexican work force''.
Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto industry analyst with Merrill Lynch, said General Motors had no choice but to seek lower-cost labor for parts production.
GM is not doing anything that their competitors and that independent auto suppliers aren't doing,'' Lobaccaro said, adding: ``There's been tremendous pressure on parts pricing.
To compete in the global economy, you need labor to be paid commensurate with value added.
And you can't pay $46 an hour do wire harnesses''.
Dozens of other GM parts plants would be built across northern Mexico in the years that followed.
In Matamoros, four Delphi plants were built in an industrial park near the intersection of Ohio Street and Michigan Avenue.
One Delphi plant, Componentes Mecanicos, opened in 1980.
About 10 years later, Delphi began shifting production of instrument panels to the factory from Delphi East in Flint, said Larry Mathews, a spokesman for Flint's UAW Local 651, which is currently on strike.
``They just crated the equipment, hoisted it onto a tractor-trailer, and sent it away to Mexico,'' Mathews said.
``There's hardly anybody at this plant who hasn't seen machinery moving out in a crate with an address on it that says Mexico''.
In the 1970s, Mathews added, the Delphi East plant had 13,000 workers; today, it has fewer than 6,000.
A 37-year-old worker at Componentes Mecanicos who asked that his name be withheld, said in an interview outside his two-room Matamoros home that if he qualifies for a weekly attendance bonus, he earns about $1.90 an hour.
Newly hired workers receive $1.05 an hour, he said.
His wife also works at a GM assembly plant in Matamoros, and by pooling salaries, the couple has managed to rise slightly above subsistence.
They own a battered Ford pickup truck, and although their home has no indoor plumbing, they have equipped it with a television set and an electric fan.
He coaches his three sons in a soccer league.
Next door to Componentes Mecanicos is the Deltronicos plant, built in 1979.
In the mid-1980s, GM shifted much of its car radio production from its Delco plant in Kokomo, Ind.
, to Deltronicos, UAW officials said.
The work force at Kokomo has dropped to 4,800 from 11,000 in 1977, the union said.
The Deltronicos plant employs 5,400 workers.
Across the street from Deltronicos is a Matamoros plant owned by Trico Products Corp.
of Buffalo, N.Y., a unit of Tomkins PLC, which supplies windshield wipers to GM as well as Ford and Chrysler.
The transfer of much of Trico's production to Mexico since 1987, which came despite entreaties from Buffalo city officials, has reduced Trico's Buffalo work force to 200 from 2,400, UAW officials said. &QL;
DETROIT (AP) -- With quick and peaceful negotiations, the United Auto Workers wrapped up three new contracts with American automakers that promise some 360,000 workers more money and security for the next four years.
The automakers -- General Motors Corp.
, Ford Motor Co.
, and DaimlerChrysler AG -- were rewarded, too, apparently winning won the freedom they sought to reduce costs, including shedding workers.
And both sides avoided costly strikes that could have cut short what is shaping as a record sales year for the industry.
``The people who currently work for the automakers are all winners,'' said John Revitte, a professor at Michigan State University's School of Labor and Industrial Relations.
As for the automakers, ``I doubt they would have signed it if they thought it was too much,'' Revitte said.
``They probably assumed they could settle a pretty nice contract from the worker view, and they wouldn't have any trouble from Wall Street because the economy is doing so well''.
The pattern agreement made by the UAW is a four-year contract with 3 percent raises each year, a signing bonus of $1,350 and improvements in pensions and cost-of-living adjustments.
According to the UAW, the average DaimlerChrysler and GM worker will see gains of more than $29,000 over the life of the deal.
Estimates are not yet available on the Ford contract agreement reached Saturday.
The average assembly worker at DaimlerChrysler earns $70,000 a year, while the average Ford assembler earns about $60,000.
The figure for GM is not available.
The contracts with DaimlerChrysler, GM and GM's former parts unit also include clauses that prohibit the companies from selling off or closing factories or parts of their businesses.
All those terms will likely add to the hourly payroll at the automakers, which totaled about $22 billion in 1998.
Analyst Scott Merlis with Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc.
in New York said the deals would increase labor costs for the automakers about 5 percent a year, thanks to the increased wages and health benefits.
But automakers might win that increase back and even save some costs by cutting jobs through retirement.
The American automakers have been trying to cut costs to improve profits and compete better with more efficient foreign companies.
With contract provisions that make layoffs or firings expensive, automakers rely on retirement to shed workers.
The average UAW autoworker is in his mid-40s and has at least 15 years of experience; half of the more than 360,000 UAW workers will be eligible for retirement in five years.
The contracts sweeten retirement packages, and allow companies to shed jobs through attrition by setting a ratio for how many replacements must be hired to offset retirements.
When retirements are relatively insignificant, the carmakers would only have to replace one out of every three retirees.
Under the new contract terms, a factory could lose 24 percent of its workers over four years to retirement before an automaker would have to replace every additional retiree.
And automakers have been loath to add new workers, preferring instead to fill their needs with overtime.
Last year, GM added 500 hourly workers to its total of about 143,000, but the average GM worker put in nearly nine hours of overtime every week.
``The agreement can be somewhat on the expensive side, but it's highly workable and compatible with improved productivity,'' Merlis said.
The UAW's deal with Ford also allows the automaker to spin-off its Visteon Automotive Systems, with 23,500 UAW workers, into a separate company.
Visteon's current workers would remain Ford employees, while future hires would be covered by a Visteon contract that mirrors the deal Ford has with the UAW.
UAW officials had opposed a spin-off or sale of Visteon, fearing it could lead to fewer union jobs and lower pay.
``The fact remains there will likely be a spin-off, and this could be achieved without a long strike, and that the Ford-UAW relationship, which has been amicable and enviable, can be sustained,'' Merlis said.
The DaimlerChrysler deal has been approved by workers, while GM workers are expected to finish voting on their deal this week.
Ford local union officials will hear details of their contract Wednesday.
DETROIT _ With General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler scheduled to begin talks next week with the United Automobile Workers, it appears increasingly likely that negotiators will seek a national labor contract lasting four or more years, the longest such deal since the 1950s, auto executives and union officials said.
Chastened by last summer's 54-day strike against GM in Flint, Mich.
, and enjoying the soaring profits and bountiful overtime pay produced by record auto sales, management and workers appear eager to avoid another showdown this year.
Serious differences could still produce a strike, but industry and union leaders alike are now using the tamest rhetoric in many years.
Nearly two decades of declining inflation rates have tempered union fears that workers' pay would be ravaged by rising prices during a long contract.
For their part, the automakers would welcome the ability to predict long-term costs.
The current contract expires Sept.
14. By departing from the traditional three-year contract, the UAW would also be able to avoid having the next round of auto labor talks in the summer of 2002, when the union could be locked in a power struggle.
Longtime UAW president Stephen Yokich must retire when his current four-year term ends in June 2002 because he will become 65 next year.
The union's rules require that candidates for the presidency, an elected position, be younger than 65, and Yokich has no heir apparent.
A longer contract would not assure labor peace in the auto industry, however.
Unlike most unions, the UAW won from the automakers long ago the right to hold factory-level strikes for health and safety reasons at any time, even while a contract is in force.
Last year's strike in Flint involved such a walkout.
Key issues in talks to replace the current contract are certain to include job security, particularly for workers at auto parts subsidiaries that are being spun off, as well as modest changes to the automakers' health care plans and other employee benefits, executives and union officials said in interviews and public appearances in recent weeks.
The UAW has traditionally negotiated a contract with one auto company first, and then demanded that the other two sign virtually identical pacts.
The company that negotiates the first pact has an advantage, in that it can tailor an agreement to its own needs while driving up its rivals' costs.
Ford and GM seem to have a better chance of being chosen by the union to negotiate the first agreement than does DaimlerChrysler, but no decision has been made yet, a person close to the union said.
GM executives in particular have softened their criticisms of the union and called for reconciliation, in the hope of avoiding another strike.
``We are working hard with all our unions to nurture a more open relationship,'' said GM chairman and chief executive John Smith at the company's annual meeting Monday in Wilmington, Del.
``We want to build on common strengths, improve our cost competitiveness and work through our differences without costly work stoppages''.
But GM has in the past shown a peculiar knack for offending the UAW, sometimes unintentionally.
The automaker announced Tuesday, six days before the contract negotiations formally open next Monday, that it would spend $1.8 billion to buy a commercial lending business from the Bank of New York.
Although union leaders had no immediate reaction today, they have criticized diversification moves by the automaker, calling on the companies to invest more money in new equipment and factories instead.
All three automakers' current, three-year national contracts with the UAW expire at midnight on Sept.
14. Since the Eisenhower administration, national auto labor contracts have lasted for three years, and the triennial negotiations have been closely followed as a barometer of wage pressures in the U.S. economy.
While the automakers are no longer the nation's largest private employers _ Wal-Mart overtook GM two years ago _ the wages and benefits set in their contracts still strongly influence the rest of the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about a fifth of the nation's economic output.
Inflation and obscure accounting rules discouraged the union and the companies alike from pursuing longer agreements.
Inflation caused by the Korean War ravaged the earnings power of auto workers during a five-year pact in the 1950s and prompted union leaders then to vow that future deals would not exceed three years, a decision followed until now.
Recent contracts have only partly protected workers against inflation, guaranteeing that, in addition to wage increases, workers will receive an extra 1 percent raise for every 2.6 percentage points of inflation.
But the decline in the inflation rate has reduced union worries on this score.
Accounting rules also require the companies to charge certain pension concessions against their profits in the first year of an agreement, and the cost of these concessions rises with longer agreements.
But with all three automakers posting record or near-record profits, they are in unusually strong financial condition to take such a charge.
Yokich mentioned the possibility of a longer contract at a news conference in May.
``With all the money they've got, they might be able to put enough money on that table that we have to take a 4-year or 5-year or 6-year or 10-year'' contract, he said, speaking of the automakers.
While auto executives dismiss the idea of a 10-year contract, which would limit their options through at least two generations of new cars, they have been receptive to the possibility of a four- to six-year contract.
The UAW has been quarreling with DaimlerChrysler over how much help the automaker should give the union in organizing a Mercedes factory in Alabama and a DaimlerChrysler heavy truck factory in North Carolina.
With union leaders also nervous about a showdown with German executives they barely know, the union is expected to negotiate the first contract with GM or, perhaps more likely, Ford.
If Ford goes first, it would probably try to work out the terms of an eventual spinoff of Visteon Automotive Systems, its auto parts unit.
Such a settlement could have major implications for GM In previous spinoffs of smaller subsidiaries by Ford and GM contracts guaranteed that workers in the subsidiary could retire within the next few years with full pensions and health benefits from the automaker, not the subsidiary.
In May, GM spun off its 200,000-employee auto parts unit, Delphi Automotive Systems.
A big question now is whether Ford will agree to accept huge numbers of workers back from Visteon if it is ever spun off.
While Ford could use those workers in its expanding sport utility vehicle factories, GM has too many workers already and does not need more from Delphi.
But if Ford signs a pattern-setting contract first, the UAW may force GM to accept the same terms or face another costly strike. &QL;
DETROIT _ Crippling strikes at General Motors parts factories have left the United Automobile Workers union and GM fighting over whether the auto maker is pursuing an ``America Last'' strategy, but the reality lies somewhere in between their positions.
The UAW is accusing the General Motors Corp.
of spending billions of dollars on factories in developing countries while failing to invest in aging American factories.
GM has responded by publicizing what it calls plans to invest $21 billion in the United States by 2001.
The company's financial statements and projections show that its investments in the United States are substantial _ but that the amount invested annually will not increase in coming years and may actually decline.
GM's annual investments overseas are rising.
With few signs of progress toward resolving the strikes that began June 5, the union raised the prospect Monday that the walkouts could last into mid-August, which would make it the most serious strike against the company since 1970.
GM executives have made no secret that they think the best long-term opportunities now in the global auto industry lie in countries such as Brazil and China where adults still outnumber cars, unlike in the United States.
But in the last two weeks they have also been promoting their U.S. investment plans.
The $21 billion figure GM uses works out to an average of $4.2 billion a year.
``I'm unaware of any other company making that kind of investment in the United States,'' Donald Hackworth, GM's group vice president for North American car operations, said last week.
Most big companies do not disclose their investment plans, but Hackworth's assertion is plausible because G.M. is the nation's biggest company and it operates in a heavy-investment industry.
But notes at the back of GM's annual report show that GM invested $5.39 billion last year in North America automotive operations and $5.18 billion in 1996.
These figures include relatively small investments in Mexico and Canada, although GM refused to provide exact figures.
Gerald Holmes, a GM spokesman, said the annual amount of GM's car-building investments in the United States would stay flat or decline slightly in the coming years.
But he said that these investments remained a majority of GM's planned investments worldwide in building cars.
The level of investments is also not important, Holmes said, because GM has been working to make its investments more efficient.
``It's not indicative that we're doing less _ we're doing more with less,'' he said.
GM officials have consistently refused to provide figures for GM's future investments overseas, but they totaled $2.45 billion last year and are expected to grow.
GM is building new assembly plants in Argentina, Brazil, Poland, Thailand and China.
GM also announced Monday that it would invest another $100 million in its joint venture in China.
By contrast, GM has not committed itself to building any new factories in the United States, where it still has more assembly plants than can be justified by its market share, which has been shrinking for more than 20 years.
Hackworth said in an interview last week that GM might cut back even its current investment plans in the United States if the UAW did not heed the company's demands for labor peace and more flexible work rules in factories.
``Strikes and noncompetitive work practices jeopardize that investment,'' Hackworth said.
He said that the main issue in the strikes at two parts factories in Flint, Mich.
, was not where GM builds factories but rather the insistence of some workers there on collecting eight hours' pay for only four to six hours of work.
UAW officials have said that they are willing to change work rules in Flint, but only if GM follows through on a promise to invest another $180 million in one of the parts factories on strike there.
UAW officials had no immediate comment when told Monday evening that GM's investments in the United States would show no year-over-year increase and would likely decline.
GM's claim to be putting a majority of its investments in the United States also comes with a qualifier: All of its investment calculations, including the $21 billion figure, are for GM's car-building operations only, and exclude Delphi Automotive Systems, GM's large auto parts subsidiary.
Delphi, with $1.26 billion in worldwide investment last year, has been the most aggressive of GM's units in building new factories in Mexico and overseas while selling or closing them in the United States.
GM has also chosen to focus on investment rather than jobs as the measure of commitment to the United States.
But GM investments in the United States are mostly in costly operations like new assembly plant equipment, which preserves a few high-paying jobs for highly skilled workers.
GM's investments abroad tend to be parts factories that cost little to build but can employ thousands of low-skilled workers.
The UAW appears to be preparing members for a protracted struggle this summer.
Stephen Yokich, the union's president, said Monday at the opening of a union convention in Las Vegas, Nev.
, that the union would ``last one day longer'' than GM in the current showdown.
Richard Shoemaker, the union's vice president for GM issues, warned Monday at the convention that if no deal was reached this week, the strike could last until mid-August.
GM needs to begin mass production of its 1999 models then and will be under considerable pressure to compromise.
GM's factories have long been scheduled to close at the end of this week for the company's annual two-week summer vacation.
Union officials want to end the strike before then so that workers will be entitled to full vacation pay.
GM said that it had closed 24 of its 29 assembly plants, including one in Ste.
Therese, Quebec, that shut down Monday.
The strike has idled 122,400 GM workers across North America, while outside suppliers have also laid off thousands of workers temporarily.
General Motors Corp.
announced Monday that it planned to spin off its gigantic auto parts subsidiary to its shareholders next year, a move that could reignite the labor troubles that led to nearly eight-week-long strikes that ended only last Wednesday.
If completed, the move would represent a historic shift away from vertical integration, a corporate strategy in which a company produces most of the parts as well as the final product.
Through the 1970s, GM promoted its vertical integration as a source of financial strength and savings.
But John F.
Smith Jr.
, the GM chairman and chief executive, said Monday that General Motors wanted instead to be a company that assembles and markets cars, but does not necessarily make a large proportion of the parts inside.
The spinoff of the auto parts subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems, ``represents nothing less than a fundamental shift away from vertical integration,'' Smith said.
The United Automobile Workers union reacted furiously to GM's announcement Monday afternoon, which followed a regularly scheduled board meeting.
``Should GM decide to proceed with the sale as announced, the UAW's record is clear: we can and will aggressively work to protect the rights and interests of UAW members impacted by the sale,'' Richard Shoemaker, the union's vice president for GM issues, said in a statement.
General Motors' national contract with the union expires in September 1999, and the union could try to stop the spinoff of Delphi then with a strike.
Through strikes and the threat of strikes, the UAW has sometimes forced GM to postpone or cancel factory sales and closings over the years.
Robert Stempel, the former chairman of GM, announced in December 1991 the closing of two dozen factories and the elimination of 74,000 jobs, but some of those factories are still open and the jobs still exist.
But a spinoff of Delphi could be an attractive move for General Motors and its shareholders.
The UAW currently forces GM to pay the same wages of at least $19 an hour to assembly plant workers and parts factory workers alike, even though nonunion parts makers pay only half as much to their workers.
An independent Delphi could try to pay lower wages to its American workers who are members of the UAW.
It might be able to sell more parts to other auto makers, which have been reluctant to order from Delphi for fear that it would share parts designs and other competitive information with GM.
Ford and Chrysler have to pay the same wages to assembly workers and parts workers, but they disposed of many of their parts factories piecemeal in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when their survival was in doubt.
Japanese auto makers pay close to $19 an hour to their assembly plant workers but buy the great bulk of their parts from outside suppliers with much lower wages.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for North American personnel, had said last Tuesday, when a tentative settlement was reached with the UAW in Flint, Mich.
, that the automaker wanted a closer relationship with the union and would begin holding regular, top-level meetings with union officials.
Knechtel said then that the strike could only be judged worthwhile if it produced a lasting improvement in the relationship.
Workers ratified the settlement last Wednesday and returned to work, but GM lost $3 billion in after-tax profits because of the strike, or nearly half a year's earnings.
Smith said at a press conference Monday that GM's board had been planning for months to decide on the spinoff of Delphi at its August meeting, but that the company had not told the union until after the Flint strike had ended.
Even if GM divests Delphi, it will still be somewhat vertically integrated.
GM factories that produce engines, transmissions and exterior sheet metal are part of GM's auto assembly and marketing divisions, and would not be divested with Delphi.
The Delphi division makes hundreds of smaller parts, from spark plugs to dashboards to seats, that are less important to a car's exterior appearance or road performance.
The strikes in Flint affected two parts factories, a Delphi factory that makes speedometers, spark plugs and other parts and another, non-Delphi factory that stamps truck hoods and other parts from sheets of steel.
But GM's planned spinoff of Delphi nonetheless represents a big decision.
Delphi, based in Troy, Mich.
, is the world's largest auto parts maker, with slightly greater annual sales than Intel Corp.
Delphi's 200,000 employees around the world include 50,000 UAW members in the United States, a sizable number for a union with around 730,000 members.
There are another 150,000 UAW workers in GM's other operations that will not be divested.
General Motors said that it planned to dispose of Delphi in two steps.
During the first quarter of next year, GM plans to distribute to shareholders as much as 20 percent of Delphi's stock.
The automaker said it would dispose of the rest of Delphi later next year, by distributing shares or by exchanging GM shares for Delphi shares, or possibly by a combination of these approaches, in a transaction that is intended to be tax-free.
General Motors announced its plan late in the afternoon.
GM shares rose 37.5 cents Monday, to $72.6875.
DETROIT (AP) -- Despite months of labor peace since last summer's devastating strikes, United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich said Sunday that ``we still have our problems'' with General Motors Corp.
and hinted at another showdown when national contract talks begin later this year.
In a speech kicking off the union's triennial bargaining convention, Yokich said job security would again be the UAW's priority when it begins contract talks in June with GM, Ford Motor Co.
and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG.
The national contracts cover about 396,000 U.S. workers.
Yokich reserved his toughest criticism for GM, suggesting to about 2,000 union delegates that little if anything had improved in UAW-GM relations since last year's costly battle.
The strikes at two parts plants in Flint brought the world's largest automaker to a virtual halt in North America.
They lasted several weeks and cost the company about $2 billion while they idled nearly 200,000 GM workers and thousands of employees at independent suppliers.
The dispute was largely over job security and ``outsourcing,'' the practice of contracting in-house work to outside suppliers who generally pay less and typically are nonunion.
GM, which once made most of its parts, is moving toward becoming largely a designer and assembler of vehicles.
Since the strikes, GM has announced plans to convert its aging U.S. small-car plants to so-called ``modular'' assembly to make them more efficient.
The UAW describes it as a threat to union jobs.
Under modular assembly, outside suppliers preassemble parts such as an entire dashboard and deliver them to a plant, where they are installed on the chassis.
Far fewer UAW workers would be needed to assemble each car, significantly reducing manufacturing costs.
``There's nothing new about modular assembly,'' Yokich said.
``It's just another word for...
outsourcing. It's just another way to destroy good-paying jobs and benefits, that we intend to deal with in this round of negotiations''.
The UAW argues that modular assembly will give the automaker less control over design and quality, increase logistical complexity and potentially add to warranty costs.
Yokich also bristled at suggestions that GM loses money on its small cars because of its labor costs.
``They claim they lose $1,000 on every small car they build themselves.
It's funny, their competitors -- Ford and Chrysler -- never lose anything on their small cars.
So is it our fault or their fault in how they run their plants?
It certainly isn't our fault''.
Yokich chastised GM for failing to consult with the UAW before it decided to spin off its big parts unit.
GM had an initial public offering of nearly 18 percent of Delphi Automotive Systems stock earlier this year and plans to spin off the rest of the company to GM shareholders by year's end.
The move has scared Delphi workers and retirees, said Yokich, who implied that the spinoff was being conducted with little, if any, consultation with UAW leaders.
GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said the company would have no comment on Yokich's remarks.
Yokich also said Mercedes-Benz, the German luxury car unit of DaimlerChrysler that operates a nonunion assembly plant in Alabama, should be under the UAW contract.
The veteran union leader had no criticism of Ford, which has the best relationship with the UAW among the three automakers.
Yokich said the union will begin bargaining with the company that presents the best initial proposal.
In 1996, the UAW negotiated first with Ford and used that deal as a pattern for pacts with Chrysler and GM.
The current three-year contracts expire in September.
The UAW gained more workers than it lost in 1998, the first time that has happened since 1989, Yokich said.
Much of the gain, however, has come in businesses outside the auto industry, such as health care and government .
DETROIT _ A strike by 3,400 workers at a General Motors Corp.
metal stamping factory has closed seven assembly plants from Kansas to Canada and parts of three other plants, idling more than 18,000 workers by GM's count and quieting cash registers at nearly every business in Flint, Mich.
, where the walkout began five days ago.
But those problems are minuscule compared with what GM faces Thursday night when 5,000 workers at a second parts-making factory in Flint are expected to decide whether to strike over what they call unmet job security demands.
The plant builds an array of components, including spark plugs and speedometers, that are used in almost every GM vehicle.
Auto analysts said a strike there would ripple across North America within days, quickly shutting most of the 22 assembly plants not yet affected by the metal-stamping plant strike, causing hundreds of temporary layoffs at independent parts supply companies and depleting dealer inventories of cars and trucks.
``It could be a long June for GM and its suppliers,'' said Mike Robinet, managing director at CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich.
Robinet's firm estimates that GM has already lost 14,038 cars and trucks.
``The spark plug plant impacts production at almost every GM plant,'' he said.
As leaders of the United Auto Workers all but guaranteed the second strike, economists said a combined work stoppage could trim the nation's production of goods and services by $6 billion, on a yearly basis, if a settlement is not reached before the end of the month.
By the end of this week, some economists say, the metal plant strike alone will have reduced the nation's economic output by $500 million.
The automotive industry represents 3 percent to 5 percent of the nation's total economy.
Workers on the picket line say GM exacerbated longstanding tensions at the plant when it quietly removed several large stamping dies from the factory over the Memorial Day weekend.
The machines press steel into parts for its 1999 GMC Sierra, an eagerly awaited full-size pickup truck.
GM has not specified where the machines have been redeployed, although they are believed to be at a plant in Mansfield, Ohio.
That tactic, along with what the strikers called GM's broken promises on factory modernization, are partly why progress in resolving the strike has stalled, some UAW leaders said Wednesday.
Dick Shoemaker, the union's vice president in charge of GM negotiations, said, ``We have the right to expect that when GM enters into an agreement, they will abide by that agreement''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) GM is the automotive industry's largest employer, with 224,000 workers, many of whom earn $45 an hour in wages and benefits.
Last year, the average GM worker earned $52,800 by working six- and seven-day weeks.
For GM, the costs of the Flint strike are rising almost by the hour as one plant after another is closed.
The metal-stamping plant strike has not yet prevented the automaker from building the sport-utility vehicles and trucks that account for most of its profits.
But the strike has crippled production of several profitable cars such as the Pontiac Grand Prix and the Oldsmobile Intrigue.
The closing of assembly plants in Linden, N.J., and Moraine, Ohio, has halted the automaker's production of popular midsize sport-utilities like the Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Jimmy.
With GM coming off a stellar sales month in May, when it increased market share and lured back thousands of customers with rebates of $500 to $1,000, the situation is even more critical because inventories are already low.
GM's stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the strike began on Friday.
Yesterday, GM shares declined 50 cents, to $72.6875.
``The strike at the metal plant and tomorrow's threat couldn't come at a worse time for GM,'' said Scott Merlis, an independent auto analyst in Westport, Conn.
``In May, they made incredible sales gains with some really competitive products.
The lost momentum during the strike will be more negative than any profit impact''.
Merlis said GM improved its market share to 32.5 percent, from about 29.5 percent, since the start of the year.
Some dealers said Wednesday that they were alerting customers to the possibility of shortages and delayed factory orders.
``Strikes make you thankful for the used car business,'' said Dan Rudolph, owner of a Buick and GMC.
dealership in Lewiston, Idaho.
Rudolph is currently waiting to receive 25 Buick cars and GMC.
trucks and sport-utility vehicles.
``If they don't get this thing settled, who knows when I'll see those cars,'' he said.
People close to the negotiations at the metal factory said a quick end to the strike was unlikely.
The UAW contends that GM is reneging on a $300 million pledge to modernize and is ignoring more than 800 health and safety grievances.
GM's response is that the plant's productivity lags behind other stamping plants because of union work rules that bar managers from shifting workers into jobs outside their union classification.
What makes GM so vulnerable to UAW strikes is its reliance on an industry practice of delivering parts just in time for production, rather than warehousing supplies as automakers did years ago.
In addition, automakers are now able to become more efficient by producing parts at only a few factories, a trend that makes those factories easy targets for the long union strikes.
The UAW exploited that weakness in 1996 during a 17-day strike at two brake plants in Dayton, Ohio.
The strike caused GM to lay off 177,775 workers and cost the company about $900 million after taxes.
Within the UAW, the tactic of striking parts factories is viewed as the fastest and most cost-effective way to war with automakers.
The union only has to pay $150 a week in benefits to thousands of workers at just one or two factories _ a small price considering the $725 million it now holds in its strike fund.
Still, GM says it wants to win more control over what happens inside its plants and thus cannot afford to back down from battles with the UAW ``Ever since Dayton,'' said Robinet of CSM Forecasting, ``we've seen a new General Motors, one that is willing to make the hard decision in order to gain the efficiencies many of its competitors have''.
But some experts argue that GM's.
tough labor stance could jeopardize long-term labor peace with the UAW.
``It's one thing to go head-to-head with UAW once in a big way, but it's problematic to have it become a recurring theme when every other automaker is coming up with ways to work with labor,'' said Diane Swonk, an economist with First Chicago NBD in Chicago.``Only GM knows what the payoff is to their strategy.''
DETROIT _ Nearly 6,000 workers went on strike on Thursday evening at a General Motors spark plug and speedometer factory in Flint, Mich.
, joining fellow strikers at a nearby GM plant in an increasingly bitter fight that could close all of the leading automaker's North American assembly plants within days.
GM had already closed seven of those assembly plants and temporarily laid off 18,600 workers for lack of parts from the initial strike last Friday at a metal-stamping plant in Flint.
Most of GM's other 22 assembly plants in the United States, Canada and Mexico are now expected to quickly run out of the spark plugs, speedometers and other parts made by the giant factory where workers walked out on Thursday night.
Angry over what they called unmet demands for job security and improved health and safety conditions, hundreds of workers chanting ``UAW''! and toting red placards identifying their local union unit mobbed the spark plug factory's gates on Thursday evening.
They were joined by workers from the metal-stamping factory, who struck over the same issues.
Scattered among the picketers were UAW members from across Michigan and even Ohio and Illinois who had come to show their anger at GM, which has contended with steadily worsening labor relations in trying to make its factories run as efficiently as those of competitors.
GM said in a terse statement that it was disappointed by the broadening of the strike to a second parts factory.
``We have committed, talented people and we encourage the union to join management leadership at both facilities to urgently reach settlements that help us effectively work with them to improve GM's competitive position in the marketplace,'' the company said.
Union officials at both factories have cited health and safety concerns for their strikes, because the UAW's current contract with GM limits most other walkouts and does not expire for another year.
But union officials have acknowledged a broader agenda as well.
The spark plug factory workers have been increasingly alarmed in recent years as GM has bought more basic auto parts from outside companies, including some in Mexico, while selling its own factories or cutting back employment.
The metal-stamping factory workers have been worried that GM management is assigning other factories work on vehicles not yet in production, possibly signaling the stamping plant's obsolescence.The strikers have also been infuriated by GM's decision to remove, over the Memorial Day weekend, many of the casting dies needed to stamp hoods and other metal parts for GM's new full-size pickup trucks.
As in eight other local strikes over the last three years, GM executives have vowed to proceed with their long-standing plans to cut costs.
But senior UAW officials have increasingly come to see this confrontation as an emotional struggle, perceiving a threat to the union's long-term survival in GM's willingness to remove equipment from plants where workers are about to go on strike.
Two people close to the UAW said that with the broadening of the strike to a second factory, the overall walkout could easily last until the end of June.
Union leaders will face pressure to settle so that UAW members can collect full pay during the industry's annual summer vacation in early July.
National leaders of the UAW almost never visited the picket lines during eight local strikes against GM over the previous three years.
But they have been doing so daily this week.
While senior UAW and GM officials refrained from criticizing each other in public during the previous strikes, both sides have been doing so this time.
Even people close to the UAW concede that the metal stamping workers in Flint have had one of the most generous special deals in the auto industry.
Its provisions allowed some workers to draw a full day's pay for half a day's work.
Workers agreed two years ago to give up many of these provisions in exchange for further GM investment in Flint.
The union now contends that the investment has not been forthcoming, an accusation denied by GM.
The truck parts metal-stamping equipment was transferred by GM to an Ohio factory with a more efficient work force.
GM has been planning to build the pickups initially in Oshawa, Ontario.
But Basil Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers Union, warned in a telephone interview on Thursday morning that GM should not count on Canadian worker willingness to accept parts produced by equipment taken out of the Flint factory.
The Canadian workers were angry that GM managers had made such a presumption.
``We're not noted much for strike breaking,'' Hargrove said.
``If anybody says they're moving those dies and that's your livelihood, logic no longer plays any part of it, it's emotion''.

nn GM executives have said repeatedly this year that the company must become more efficient to stay competitive.
While Ford and Chrysler now derive most of their automotive sales and profits from pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles, with relatively little competition from foreign brands, GM still sells mostly cars and faces heavy pressure from imports and from non-union factories in the United States.
That pressure has only increased as the dollar's value has soared in global foreign-exchange markets this year, which makes it even cheaper for foreign automakers to sell their cars in this country with generous discounts.
GM's stamping operations are particularly inefficient compared with those of rivals.
The company gloated last summer that its cost for producing new dies was only twice that of GM's most efficient competitor _ but used to be eight times higher.
The stamping factory in Flint is among the least efficient of all, and under great pressure from GM to improve its results or face closure.``They have 14 stamping facilities and they probably need 9 or 10,'' said David Bradley, an analyst at J.P.
Morgan and Co.
A successful introduction of the new pickup truck is considered vital to GM, which earns up to half its worldwide profits just from sales in North America of full-size pickup trucks and the Suburban, Yukon and Tahoe sport utility vehicles, which share the same underbodies.
GM plans to introduce new versions of the sport utility vehicles a year after the new pickups.
Canadian law puts more restrictions than American law on the ability of unions to strike in between contract negotiations, and the current Canadian labor contract runs until late 1999.
But the Oshawa workers are among the most militant in the North American auto industry.
During a 1996 strike, GM sent a flat-bed truck with a police escort to the Oshawa factory and tried to remove parts-making equipment similar to the equipment removed from the Flint factory.
Hundreds of Canadian auto workers blocked the front gates and refused police orders to disperse.
GM sought a court order against the union action but later dropped it as part of a broad strike settlement.
Hargrove said that no parts from the moved Flint equipment had arrived yet in Oshawa, and he declined to speculate on what would happen if they did.
GM officials said that they had begun producing the pickup parts at another location but refused to identify where or say whether the parts were being shipped to Canada.
DETROIT (AP) -- National labor talks between Detroit's automakers and the United Auto Workers begin this week in the midst of record-breaking sales that have left General Motors Corp.
, Ford Motor Co.
and DaimlerChrysler AG flush with cash.
The triennial negotiations kick off today with ceremonial handshakes over the main bargaining table at Ford headquarters.
Similar ceremonies are set for Tuesday at DaimlerChrysler and Wednesday at GM.
The health of the U.S. auto industry and the costly lessons learned from last year's devastating UAW strikes against GM decrease the chance for a walkout after this year's contracts expire Sept.
14, some industry analysts say.
``They've got tough issues, but nobody wants to put the moneymaking on hold to sort it out,'' said labor professor Harley Shaiken at the University of California-Berkeley.
This year's talks will cover about 407,000 UAW members at assembly and parts plants nationwide, down 15,000 from 1996.
More than half work for GM.
Job security, health care costs, overtime demands and the assignment of work to outside suppliers are among the top issues in this year's talks, as they were during the last round in 1996.
But since then, the industry has been through a tumultuous series of reorganizations, cost-cutting programs, acquisitions and mergers.
Each of Detroit's automakers is financially stronger.
``It's important to note that for all the changes this is a very healthy industry, one that has enjoyed record profits and sales on a sustained basis,'' UAW spokesman Frank Joyce said.
``It's a good environment for negotiations''.
Though times are good, Detroit executives note that they remain under extreme pressure to keep costs down, invest heavily in new models and technology, and simplify the way they build and sell vehicles.
With production capacity worldwide far exceeding demand, automakers can no longer simply pass on higher labor costs to consumers, as they did for decades.
Many of their Asian and European competitors, meanwhile, compete directly on American soil with a growing number of modern, efficient, nonunion plants -- a sore point for Detroit and the UAW.
Against this backdrop, the union is faced with the same problems that have challenged its leaders for the past 20 years: How do they slow the steady decline of high-paying assembly jobs as the industry becomes more efficient and needs fewer workers?
And as suppliers take on a larger role in the design and assembly of cars and trucks, how can the union expand its influence?
The UAW only recently has begun to reverse its membership slide, largely by signing up more workers in non-automotive industries.
More than half of its active membership is still employed by the Detroit automakers.
In the last round of auto talks, the union won a conditional guarantee that at least 95 percent of UAW jobs at each plant would be maintained during the life of the contracts.
Much of focus this year will be on GM, which abandoned its combative stance toward the UAW after last year's strikes cost it about $2 billion and some of its U.S. market share.
But GM has managed to continue offending UAW leaders as it seeks ways to cut costs.
Until recently, GM had been publicly promoting ambitious plans to assemble small cars using ``modular'' assembly techniques.
GM says it needs to make the change because its current small cars built in North America don't make money.
In GM's modular plants, most of the subassembly work would be done by lower-cost suppliers who would deliver preassembled parts clusters, such as an entire dashboard or interior module, to the assembly plant.
Far fewer UAW workers would be needed.
UAW president Stephen P.
Yokich has declared modular assembly a dead issue, but to some extent all three automakers have already adopted or are planning to use more modular techniques.
GM and the union also will have to resolve the future of the 42,640 UAW members at Delphi Automotive Systems Corp.
, the big parts unit the automaker divested last month.
The union is expecting that those workers will remain under the next GM contract.
The future of parts workers will be an issue at Ford, too, which is preparing plans to spin off its Visteon parts unit.
At Ford and GM, management is likely to seek a lower wage for new hires at the parts concerns so they can more effectively compete against nonunion suppliers.
At DaimlerChrysler, the company that resulted from last year's acquisition of Chrysler Corp.
by Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, the UAW is seeking stronger assurances that the automaker won't hinder its attempt to organize the Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama and three Freightliner commercial truck plants in the Carolinas.
Though DaimlerChrysler's official position is that it's neutral in the organizing drives, executives realize it's a sensitive issue that could cause problems in this year's talks.
And there is likely to be some concern among UAW negotiators about who's calling the shots at the Chrysler unit.
``Daimler is a company used to dealing with a union and negotiation, but it's not going to be the same as Chrysler,'' said John Revitte, a labor professor at Michigan State University.
``The fact that it's now a German company is going to change things''.
The UAW, meanwhile, has sent signals that it will consider a longer-term contract, most likely a four-year deal.
That would make the next contract expire in 2003, a year after the union's leadership is scheduled to change.
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich.
_ General Motors chairman and chief executive John Smith said Wednesday that the world's largest automaker would build a new generation of highly efficient assembly plants in North America.
The plants would use far less labor than current assembly plants as outside suppliers, many of them with nonunion workers, would do much work previously done by GM employees.
Smith said the new plants would be modeled mainly on GM's efficient new operations in Brazil, and to a lesser extent on other GM factories overseas.
Those factories rely on outside suppliers to produce large chunks of vehicles, like fully assembled dashboards, instead of delivering lots of little parts that are bolted together on the assembly line.
That is in keeping with GM's move this week to become a company that designs, assembles and markets cars and trucks but makes few of the parts.
GM's new strategy, and particularly Wednesday's plan for new assembly plants, represents a challenge to the United Automobile Workers union, which last week settled a strike of nearly two months at two auto parts factories in Flint, Mich.
Four out of every five outside auto parts factories in the United States are not unionized, so shifting work to them weakens the UAW's grip on the industry and erodes its membership.
UAW officials were studying Wednesday's announcement and had no immediate reaction.
But GM and the UAW have been quietly discussing the new assembly plants for weeks and the union response in these meetings has been mixed, UAW officials said in recent interviews.
The union leaders are pleased that GM is interested in investing at all in the United States instead of overseas, but deeply troubled by the kinds of factories that GM plans to build.
The new factories could use half as many workers as the current factories.
In a rare speech and news conference in Traverse City, the usually reclusive Smith presented his plans for new assembly plants for the first time, part of a broad vision to change GM, the world's largest company in terms of sales and share of global economic output.
GM announced Monday that it would turn its vast auto parts subsidiary into an independent company, with stock in the subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems, to be distributed next year to GM investors.
GM announced Tuesday that it would combine the corporate staffs of Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Oldsmobile and Pontiac into a single marketing organization that might be able to sell cars more effectively, although the names on dealerships and car models would not change.
Smith said this week's moves had long been planned and that the strike had only delayed them a little.
But Smith has also been under enormous pressure from Wall Street to take decisive action to make GM more competitive.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Some Wall Street analysts even asked publicly during the strike whether Smith was the right person to lead GM, suggesting that while he had led the company back from the brink of bankruptcy after taking over in 1992, he had taken few bold moves since then and had not laid out a vision for the company's direction.
Many institutional investors had expected GM to inflict a crushing blow to the UAW at the end of a strike that cost the company $3 billion in after-tax earnings, and have pushed down the company's stock in response to the very limited settlement that actually resulted.
Smith discussed his plans for the company in Traverse City at midday and GM stock closed at $68.375, down $1.125.
Smith refused to discuss Wednesday when or where GM would build its new assembly plants, which would be its first in the United States since the construction of the 7,000-employee Saturn factory in Spring Hill, Tenn.
, in the 1980s.
``We are planning on building some new assembly plants to replace and consolidate older plants,'' Smith said.
``The new plants will be lean and agile in every respect, operating 24 hours a day''.
After describing the large role that suppliers play in Brazil, Smith said, ``We believe that vehicle manufacturing will evolve in this direction here in North America''.
Ronald Harbour, a manufacturing consultant in Troy, Mich.
, said GM would probably start by building one of the new type of assembly plant, which could take a couple of years, and then watch how it worked before building more.
Next to each new assembly plant, GM plans to put a factory that could stamp hoods and other automotive body parts from sheets of steel, Smith said.
That plan sheds new light on GM's strong stand against the UAW during the recent strike in Flint, Mich.
GM tried unsuccessfully to stop investing in a low-productivity stamping factory in Flint that would be a logical candidate for closure if GM builds new stamping factories.
In an olive branch to the powerful UAW, Smith said Wednesday that he wanted to develop a closer relationship with union leaders and planned to discuss how the new factories would work.
Speaking at the University of Michigan's annual auto industry conference here in this Lake Michigan resort, 200 miles northwest of Detroit, Smith also promised repeatedly that GM would not lay off anyone in the coming years, but would rely instead on allowing workers to retire without replacing them.
GM has already eliminated 125,000 hourly jobs in the United States since 1990 by not replacing people who retire or leave for other reasons, and thinks that it can continue reducing its work force this way, he said, adding, ``We're not talking about layoffs or anything like that, we're talking about working within the window of our attrition rates''.
With a steadily shrinking market share, GM has hired few employees since the late 1970's and has 220,000 hourly workers left in the United States, mostly represented by the UAW The automaker has 600,000 employees worldwide and continues to lag rival automakers in terms of the number of autos that each worker produces annually.
``How do we close the productivity gap without costly work stoppages is the clear focus in my head,'' Smith said.
The strikes in Flint severely hurt GM's sales in July.
The company said Wednesday that its sales of cars and light trucks dropped 37.7 percent, as car sales plunged 45.0 percent while sales of sport utility vehicles, pickups and vans fell 28.1 percent.
GM's overall share of the light-vehicle market decreased to 21 percent, trailing Ford Motor Co.
, at 27.5 percent, for the first time since a two-month strike in 1970 also crippled GM's production.
GM's plans to build efficient new factories might well provoke a flurry of offers of tax incentives and other financial assistance from state governments, Mexico and Canada.
Smith avoided saying whether GM would put any of the new assembly plants in Mexico.
But he did say that GM was considering the construction of new plants close to existing ones.
The UAW's contracts with the Big Three automakers give workers the privilege of turning down transfers to work sites more than 50 miles away, and the workers have virtually guaranteed lifetime employment.
TROY, Mich.
(AP) -- Delphi Automotive Systems Corp.
, the auto-parts manufacturer soon to be independent from General Motors Corp.
, has no more money-losing plants, is getting cooperation from its unions to cut costs and is winning more non-GM business, its chairman said Monday.
As the world's largest parts-maker, Delphi also plans to be a major player in the industry's consolidation through an aggressive acquisition drive, J.T.
Battenberg III told reporters before departing on a worldwide roadshow to raise his company's profile among investors.
Delphi was once a disparate collection of parts operations that, with parent GM, was near bankruptcy in the early 1990s.
Though it lost $93 million last year because of several one-time costs, Delphi earned $284 million in the first quarter this year.
GM is cutting Delphi loose to focus on its core business: building cars and trucks.
Delphi executives say they expect their business to grow as other automakers no longer have to fear working with a supplier owned by their biggest competitor.
There's evidence that's already happening, even though the spinoff won't be completed until May 28.
In the first quarter, Delphi won $4 billion in new contracts with GM and a surprising $2 billion worth of non-GM contracts.
Delphi stock price increased 18 percent in its first three months.
``The stock has performed well,'' said analyst Jonathan Lawrence of Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co.
``They're certainly winning business, and that's picked up since their announcement of the spinoff''.
Delphi, based in Troy, Mich.
, and Battenberg will face their first big test come summer when they will work out details of a new contract with the company's largest union, the United Auto Workers.
Talks already are under way with some UAW locals and Battenberg said there has been progress.
UAW hit Delphi with two strikes last summer that shut down GM's North American assembly plants and cost Delphi $450 million.
Both companies are trying to repair their long-contentious relationship with the union.
Battenberg declined to comment in detail on that relationship but said he was in ``personal touch'' with UAW leaders.
Though company insiders say UAW president Stephen P.
Yokich has been cooperative, publicly he has criticized the spinoff and urged GM to retain 51 percent of the company.
The Delphi-UAW talks will coincide with the union's triennial contract negotiations with GM, Ford Motor Co.
and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG.
The UAW is expected to demand that Delphi's hourly workers get virtually the same deal as GM's hourly workers.
Delphi no longer has any plants that are unprofitable, in some cases because its unions agreed to relax restrictive work rules, Battenberg said.
In Kokomo, Ind.
, for example, the UAW agreed to work rule changes to allow the electronics plant to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Battenberg said Delphi plans to focus on acquiring companies that can supply future technology, especially in the area of high-tech electronics as computers and satellite telecommunications become more integrated into the design of car and truck interiors.
``I look at Delphi becoming an electronics company that makes products for vehicles, which is a lot more attractive than a traditional auto-parts company,'' Lawrence said.
Though Delphi has been trimming its work force through attrition, the company may end up adding workers if it meets its goals to increase new business, Battenberg said.
Later this month, Delphi will debut a $1 million TV-and-print advertising campaign to coincide with the Indianapolis 500 auto race.
The campaign and 20-city roadshow are intended to make Delphi a brand known outside the auto industry.
DEARBORN, Mich.
(AP) -- The United Auto Workers and Ford Motor Co.
reached a tentative agreement Saturday on a new contract, hours after a handful of workers walked off the job when a strike deadline passed.
A joint statement announcing the deal contained no details, and officials declined to provide any, pending ratification meetings.
A source close to the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agreement followed the pattern set by the UAW in deals with General Motors Corp.
and DaimlerChrysler AG -- four-year agreements with raises of 3 percent each year and a signing bonus.
A local union official in Tulsa, Okla.
, said the agreement allowed the spin-off of Visteon Automotive Systems, Ford's parts division.
Wade McCaleb, secretary-treasurer of Local 1895, said workers at Visteon plants would remain Ford employees, while any new employees at Visteon will be covered by an agreement between the new company and the UAW that mirrors the one the union has with Ford.
UAW officials have said they were opposed to the company's plans for Visteon, which employs 23,500 UAW workers.
Officials were concerned a separate Visteon could cut pay and jobs and even close plants to compete against other parts companies.
The strike deadline of midnight Friday was a first in U.S. auto industry negotiations this year and a sign of strain in what had been billed as a close relationship.
However, the union said it did not authorize any work stoppages and workers at only a handful of plants walked off their jobs when the deadline passed.
Plants scheduled to operate on Saturday were back in business by the day shift.
The temporary walkout was designed to be ``kind of like a wake-up call'' to Ford, said Larry Senyard, treasurer of Local 325 in St.
Louis. The walkouts came at Ford plants in St.
Louis; Claycomo, Mo.
Flat Rock, Mich.
and St.
Paul, Minn.
There was no word on how many workers were involved.
Ford had made $6.6 billion in 1998, thanks to a lack of work stoppages and bulked-up production at truck and sport utility vehicle plants.
The average worker's profit sharing payment was $6,100.
There was no immediate indication what issues might have held up agreement on the contract for about 100,000 employees.
During a Labor Day parade in Detroit, UAW workers carried signs depicting Visteon as ``the alien within'' -- an orange monster busting out of the Ford logo.
And UAW President Stephen P.
Yokich told union members in a taped message earlier in the week that Ford was being ``stubborn'' about accepting contracts agreed to by GM and DaimlerChrysler.
The UAW negotiated some terms with DaimlerChrysler, GM and Delphi Automotive Systems that experts say could have applied to Ford and Visteon.
The contracts included promises from the companies that they would not spin off, sell or close any division or factory.
The contract for Delphi workers mirrors GM's deal; it also allows Delphi employees to transfer back to GM and retire by Jan.
1 with a GM pension.
Other terms include a $1,350 signing bonus, improved pensions and better cost-of-living adjustments.
GM and Delphi workers are expected to complete voting on their new contract by next week.
The last national strike by the UAW against Ford was 1976; it was also the last time the UAW struck during negotiations.
A local union in Atlanta struck Ford in 1986.
The UAW has not held a national strike in years, but has held several local strikes at GM, including a 54-day strike at two Flint plants last summer that shut down most of the company's North American production.
DETROIT (AP) -- National labor talks between Detroit's automakers and the United Auto Workers began today against a background of record sales that have left General Motors Corp.

The triennial negotiations kicked off with ceremonial handshakes over the main bargaining table at Ford headquarters.
UAW president Stephen P.
Yokich and Peter J.
Pestillo, vice chairman and chief of staff at Ford, shook hands first, followed by their chief negotiators Ron Gettelfinger and Robert H.
Marcin. The UAW negotiators presented Ford negotiators with a large banner with the words ``Bargaining for Families,'' signed by each of the UAW negotiators.
Gettelfinger said that was the theme the UAW-Ford negotiators picked for these negotiations.

DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp.
has signaled to Wall Street that it expects the United Auto Workers to make a stronger push for wage increases in this year's contract talks with Detroit's automakers.
That would mark a shift from previous negotiations in the 1990s, when the union sought relatively benign wage hikes in exchange for job security.
It means automakers may have to give workers more of their growing revenues to ensure labor peace, a change that has some on Wall Street fearing a possible inflationary effect on the U.S. economy.
At a recent meeting with about 40 major investors and analysts, GM chairman Jack Smith said the UAW felt it missed out on this decade's real wage growth and would likely place a higher priority on wage increases this year, according to investor sources who attended the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity.
GM declined to comment.
``It's our policy to negotiate with the union behind closed doors, which means we don't intend to begin negotiating in the public, with the media or analysts,'' spokesman Tony Cervone said Friday.
The UAW did not return phone calls for comment.
But the strategy expected by GM is in line with the collective bargaining resolution the union approved last May, arguing that its members deserve a larger share of the profits that GM, Ford Motor Co.
and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG are making on U.S. sales.
The automakers are on track to set an annual record for earnings in 1999.
``These staggering profits and the market inroads the Big Three have made justify our demand for real wage gains over the course of the next agreement,'' the resolution said.
The current three-year contracts expire Sept.
14. Analyst John Casesa of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
, who did not attend the Smith meeting, said there is some concern on Wall Street that automakers will be so fearful of a strike in a booming market they will give too big a wage increase.
``The biggest concern is that they're going to sign a contract that's going to not just spook the auto industry, but spook everybody to say, `Geez, it's inflationary,''' Casesa said.
Labor professor Harley Shaiken of the University of California at Berkeley said auto contracts historically have set wage trends for the nation because of the industry's size and the attention the deals receive.
He said he wouldn't be surprised to see a larger wage hike this year.
Negotiations began in June and will intensify around Labor Day, when the UAW is expected to target one company to negotiate an economic package that will set the pattern for all three.
Before the unexpected death last week of the UAW's chief negotiator with DaimlerChrysler, Jack Laskowski, conventional wisdom was that the UAW would select DaimlerChrysler.
Now analysts suggest Ford might be the lead company.
Ford's good relations with the union are being tested by its talk of spinning off its big parts unit, Visteon Automotive Systems Corp.
The union opposes a spinoff and has set a national strike-authorization vote for Tuesday to drive that message home.
DETROIT _ After 13 years without a strike, the Ford Motor Co.
is facing labor troubles in the United States and Canada even as labor relations at the General Motors Corp.
are finally starting to improve after 19 strikes over the last five years, union officials and auto executives say.
The increasingly contentious issues facing Ford are making it less likely that it will be chosen by the United Automobile Workers union this year as the first auto maker to negotiate a pattern-setting, three-year national contract for the industry, they said.
The UAW conducted talks first with Ford in 1993 and 1996, and Ford used both opportunities to conclude deals that helped it and hurt GM and the Chrysler Corp.
, which has since become part of DaimlerChrysler AG.
Ford wants to sell or spin off its auto parts division and has been reluctant to commit itself recently to building more vehicles and engines at less efficient factories.
Both moves have alarmed local union officials, who have put pressure on the UAW's national leadership to take a tough stance.
Ford has been negotiating lately to merge the auto parts unit with the Lear Corp.
as part of a complicated stock deal.
Those talks are now focused on finding a way to make sure that the transaction is tax free, but no deal is likely until after the expiration on Sept.
14 of the UAW's contracts with Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler, people close to the negotiations said.
It now appears possible, although still not certain, that the UAW will negotiate first this year with DaimlerChrysler, leaving for later in the autumn the difficult issues at Ford and the complicated but less contentious issues at GM.
The union has taken a renewed interest in the talks at DaimlerChrysler despite the death earlier this month of Jack Laskowski, the union's vice president for DaimlerChrysler issues.
The talks at GM, while complicated and hard to resolve quickly, have been going well.
``They seem to want to work with us,'' much more so than in the past, said a UAW negotiator.
Basil Hargrove, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, said in an interview that he wanted to hold talks first with Ford this autumn.
This would make it unlikely that the UAW would also negotiate first with Ford.
The American and Canadian unions have a history of not negotiating with the same auto maker at the same time because the American union is so much bigger that the Canadian union might then receive short shrift.
Hargrove said that if the UAW chose Ford, he would most likely choose another auto maker.
But Hargrove works closely with the UAW, and his willingness to express a preference for starting with Ford so close to the expiration of the labor contracts suggests that the UAW will not select Ford, although he added that he did not know what the UAW would do.
The Canadian union also tends to hold short strikes every three years before reaching contracts, often against the first company with which negotiations are held.
That is mainly because Canadian labor laws effectively prevent local units of unions from staging walkouts in the middle of a contract.
But the result may be to ruin Ford's remarkable string of strike-free years.
Sean McAlinden, the manager of automotive economic studies at the University of Michigan and an adviser to the auto makers and the UAW, said that the Canadian laws made it likely that Hargrove would call a strike at Ford.
``It forces him to do some sort of walkout every three years to show he has some teeth,'' McAlinden said.
The UAW's contracts do allow such strikes for health and safety reasons.
UAW local units in Flint, Mich.
, cited such reasons a year ago in a strike against GM that crippled the company's North American operations for nearly two months and measurably slowed the American economy during the second and third quarters.
In Canada and in the United States, the unions are demanding substantial wage and pension increases in addition to continuing the job security provisions that have been a staple of national contracts over the last two decades.
The auto makers are enjoying record sales and have accumulated huge cash reserves _ $24 billion in the case of Ford.
``The companies are doing very, very well,'' Hargrove said.
``The companies are making a lot of money and the workers are entitled to share it''.
Higher wages would put Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler at a disadvantage in competing with imports from countries like Korea and Germany.
But Japanese auto makers now assemble the majority of their vehicles in the United States and tend to match wage increases in Detroit so as to forestall unionization of their American factories.
DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp.
and the United Auto Workers appear to have patched up their relationship with a lucrative four-year contract -- but at steep price for GM, industry experts said.
That deal puts even more pressure on Ford Motor Co.
, the last of the major automakers still negotiating with the UAW.
The tentative agreements reached Tuesday between the UAW, GM and its former parts division Delphi Automotive Systems provide 185,000 workers with 3 percent pay raises each year for four years and a signing bonus of $1,350, a source close to the talks said.
DaimlerChrysler AG had a similar contract approved for 75,000 workers last weekend.
Lower-level talks with Ford have gone on while the UAW worked on contracts with GM and DaimlerChrysler.
The UAW typically expects all three automakers to accept the same terms.
``For Ford, basically the writing's on the wall that they're going to take the same deal,'' said Stephen Girsky, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.
Analysts said with record sales and profits at all three automakers, both sides were eager to avoid a strike.
That gave the union an opportunity to craft better deals while putting some pressure on the companies.
For GM, ``the deal is expensive,'' Girsky said.
``The UAW got a great deal from Chrysler and the number of things GM could do were limited''.
The UAW has not announced a date for a ratification vote, and said it would not release any details of the agreements until then.
The companies also declined to release any details.
The Delphi contract allows workers to transfer back to GM when openings occur, a union source said, and gives them until Jan.
1 to retire with GM pensions.
The Detroit Free Press said GM also agreed to a provision in the DaimlerChrysler contract governing how quickly it must replace workers who retire.
Under that clause, the companies could replace one of every two or three workers who retire as long as employment stayed above certain levels.
While the union and Ford have enjoyed warm relations over the past several years, there appear to be strains over its Visteon parts unit.
The union opposes a spinoff of Visteon, which has about 28,500 UAW members, saying it could lead to pay cuts, plant closures and fewer union jobs.
During the Labor Day parade in Detroit, many marchers carried signs depicting Visteon as ``the alien within''.
And the DaimlerChrysler contract contains a promise from the company not to close, sell or spin-off any factory or business unit.
Industry experts said it was unlikely the UAW could stop a Visteon spin-off, but the union could help shape the deal by requiring pension and job protections like those at Delphi.
``If they stop Ford when everyone else has already spun off parts divisions, they could seem hypocritical,'' said Dale Brickner, an emeritus professor at Michigan State University's School of Labor and Industrial Relations.
``They have the political problem of people (working) in Ford being very upset.
It may be a trade of dollars for principle''.
GM has been working to mend fences with the UAW after last summer's 54-day strike at two Flint parts factories.
The strike virtually shut down the automaker's North American production, costing GM about $2 billion in lost revenue and a chunk of market share it has yet to recover.
DETROIT (AP) -- United Auto Workers got more money and security for four years.
The automakers got the freedom they sought to reduce costs, including shedding workers.
And both sides avoided costly strikes that could have cut short what is shaping as a record sales year for the industry.
All in all, contract negotiations between the union and General Motors Corp.
, Ford Motor Co.
, and DaimlerChrysler AG were quick and peaceful.
``The people who currently work for the automakers are all winners,'' said John Revitte, a professor at Michigan State University's School of Labor and Industrial Relations.
As for the automakers, ``I doubt they would have signed it if they thought it was too much,'' Revitte said Monday.
``They probably assumed they could settle a pretty nice contract from the worker view, and they wouldn't have any trouble from Wall Street because the economy is doing so well''.
The pattern agreement made by the UAW is a four-year contract with 3 percent raises each year, a signing bonus of $1,350 and improvements in pensions and cost-of-living adjustments.
According to the UAW, the average DaimlerChrysler and GM worker will see gains of more than $29,000 over the life of the deal.
Estimates are not yet available on the Ford contract agreement reached Saturday.
The average assembly worker at DaimlerChrysler earns $70,000 a year, while the average Ford assembler earns about $60,000.
The figure for GM is not available.
The contracts with DaimlerChrysler, GM and GM's former parts unit also include clauses that prohibit the companies from selling off or closing factories or parts of their businesses.
All those terms will likely add to the hourly payroll at the automakers, which totaled about $22 billion in 1998.
Analyst Scott Merlis with Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc.
in New York said the deals would increase labor costs for the automakers about 5 percent a year, thanks to the increased wages and health benefits.
But automakers might win that increase back and even save some costs by cutting jobs through retirement.
The American automakers have been trying to cut costs to improve profits and compete better with more efficient foreign companies.
With contract provisions that make layoffs or firings expensive, automakers rely on retirement to shed workers.
The average UAW autoworker is in his mid-40s and has at least 15 years of experience; half of the more than 360,000 UAW workers will be eligible for retirement in five years.
The contracts sweeten retirement packages, and allow companies to shed jobs through attrition by setting a ratio for how many replacements must be hired to offset retirements.
When retirements are relatively insignificant, the carmakers would only have to replace one out of every three retirees.
Under the new contract terms, a factory could lose 24 percent of its workers over four years to retirement before an automaker would have to replace every additional retiree.
And automakers have been loath to add new workers, preferring instead to fill their needs with overtime.
Last year, GM added 500 hourly workers to its total of about 143,000, but the average GM worker put in nearly nine hours of overtime every week.
``The agreement can be somewhat on the expensive side, but it's highly workable and compatible with improved productivity,'' Merlis said.
The UAW's deal with Ford also allows the automaker to spin-off its Visteon Automotive Systems, with 23,500 UAW workers, into a separate company.
Visteon's current workers would remain Ford employees, while future hires would be covered by a Visteon contract that mirrors the deal Ford has with the UAW.
UAW officials had opposed a spinoff or sale of Visteon, fearing it could lead to fewer union jobs and lower pay.
``The fact remains there will likely be a spinoff, and this could be achieved without a long strike, and that the Ford-UAW relationship, which has been amicable and enviable, can be sustained,'' Merlis said.
The DaimlerChrysler deal has been approved by workers, while GM workers are expected to finish voting on their deal this week.
Ford local union officials will hear details of their contract Wednesday.
DAYTON, Ohio _ General Motors Corp.
and the United Auto Workers on Tuesday reached tentative agreements that could end two paralyzing strikes in Michigan and prevent two Dayton brake factories from being sold or closed before 2000.
The Flint strikes have crippled the world's largest automaker for 54 days, idling 200,000 workers nationwide and nearly half of GM's Dayton-area work force of 20,000.
About 9,200 strikers at the two Flint parts plants will vote on the proposed agreements today, UAW officials said.
If they approve a settlement, the Flint workers could begin returning to their jobs late tonight.
Analysts believe local workers idled by the strikes could return to other area GM plants in Dayton, Kettering, Moraine and Vandalia early next week.
The comprehensive settlement that includes the plants in Flint, Dayton and Indianapolis means GM will likely not face more crippling strikes this summer.
GM officials were pushing for a comprehensive deal throughout the negotiations.
Ratified settlements in Flint would end GM's longest walkout since 1970.
The dispute forced GM to shut down 27 of 29 North American assembly plants and cost the automaker close to $3 billion, analysts said.
``I hope in the future that the UAW and GM can sit down and find a different way of doing things, as we do with other automakers,'' said UAW president Stephen Yokich.
In Dayton, GM pledged not to sell or close two troubled Delphi brake plants, which employ 3,400 workers, until at least January 2000, said sources close to the Dayton plants.
In return, UAW Local 696 agreed not to organize a strike against the automaker during the same time period.
The International UAW will seek to extend the no-close-or-sale pledge in national contract talks, and in return, possibly agree to a four-year contract instead of the usual three-year deal.
But a source familiar with the Dayton agreement said GM was unable to eliminate a quota clause that requires workers to produce a certain number of parts in an 8-hour workday.
Workers sometimes complete the work in five or six hours, but get paid for a full shift.
Because of the quota clause, the brake plants have the lowest productivity rating among any of GM's parts plants, company officials said.
``The agreement in Dayton secures jobs until 2000,'' said Gary Hill, president of Local 696.
``The plant (on Wisconsin Boulevard) has been here for 59 years and I'd like to see it around for another 59 years''.
The Dayton dispute was the last obstacle to a comprehensive settlement on Tuesday, said union officials in Flint.
UAW Vice President Richard Shoemaker and GM officials in Dayton said the agreement includes ``a framework'' to improve the competitiveness of the brake plants.
``Now we must begin working together with the union and all of our employees to address the significant competitive challenges that these plants continue to face,'' said Gerald T.
Meier, director of operations for the brake plants.
Despite the local agreement, the brake plants still face a gloomy long-term future unless the union and company can overcome massive financial losses.
The plants, located on Needmore Road and Wisconsin Boulevard, have lost more than $40 million in the past two years.
``I don't see any change from general trends that affect the U.S. auto industry, said Steve Dandaneau, a labor expert at the University of Dayton.
``It remains a bleak outlook for auto workers and the union, and a strong one for the company''.
Dandaneau said the strikes didn't solve the core problems facing the union.
``It displaces the same conflicts into the future,'' he said.
``If anything, it wore down the workers a bit.
It strengthened the resolve of Wall Street and (GM) executives to take drastic action in the future''.
Assuming ratification in Flint, GM's attention will turn to catching up on production of 600,000 cars and trucks canceled by the strike-related parts shortage.
Analysts said GM probably will be able to make up only about two-thirds of the shortfall, or about 400,000 units.
It will take about a week or two to get all the assembly plants producing again, said Mike Robinet, an auto industry consultant with CSM Corp.
in Farmington Hills, Michigan.
The company said last month it expects July sales to fall as much as 40 percent below the year-earlier period as dealers face short supplies of some models.
``GM will have a killer 1999, since they've got to make up production lost during the strike,'' said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an automotive analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
Lobaccaro estimates the strikes will cost GM $3 billion in lost profit by the time production gets up to speed.
That includes $1.2 billion in lost second-quarter profit the company has already accounted for.
Assembly plants in the U.S., Canada and Mexico could resume production within 10 days and begin months of heavy overtime to fill back orders.
More than 15,000 idled workers at GM suppliers also could return to work soon.
While details weren't released of the pacts in Flint, some elements of the agreement emerged from company and union officials.
The UAW pledged to boost productivity and GM said it would invest in the Flint Metal Center, where 3,400 workers have been on strike.
The plant makes truck hoods, fenders and metal cradles that attach engines to frames.
GM also pledged not to sell the other Flint plant that is on strike.
The dispute was in its 54th day, the longest walkout against the automaker since a 67-day national UAW walkout in 1970.
The Flint strikes, however, are more costly, and solidify the central Michigan city's place in GM labor lore.
It was in Flint in 1937 that sit-down strikes first led GM to recognize the UAW.
The Flint Metal Center strike began June 5 and was followed by the Delphi East walkout June 11.
The disputes centered on the UAW's effort to preserve jobs and GM's effort to shed them to match its shrinking market share and catch more efficient rivals.
Negotiations intensified Saturday as GM and the union concluded a four-day binding arbitration hearing with umpire Thomas Roberts.
The arbitrator hadn't said when he would rule, but negotiators said both sides were worried about losing.
GM had sought the arbitration, alleging that the walkouts were illegal because they concerned national issues such as plant investments.
The UAW maintained the strikes were allowable under the contract because they concerned health and safety issues.
A break came Saturday, when GM agreed to return metal-stamping tools to the Flint Metal Center.
Workers cheered Sunday as the trucks entered the factory.
GM had removed the dies over Memorial Day weekend, two weeks before the first strike, in an effort to keep its redesigned Chevrolet and GM pickups on track for fall.
The dies are used to form truck body panels.
The removal infuriated the UAW, which said it violated the UAW contract and provoked the strike.
Talks to resolve the Flint strikes languished for weeks as costs mounted for GM and idled thousands of workers who missed paychecks and depended on unemployment benefits.
Strikers receive about $150 in weekly strike benefits.
UAW members in the U.S. make about $800 a week, excluding overtime.
Most of the Dayton-area workers idled by the Flint trikes are represented by the International Union of Electronic Workers and received about 95 percent of their wages and benefits during the shut down.
But about 1,000 UAW members at the Dayton brake plants will find out in about two weeks whether they will receive unemployment for the work they missed.
A hearing was held Tuesday in Columbus by the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services to determine if the strike-related layoffs are due to a labor dispute or a lack of work as the result of a parts shortage, said OBES spokesman David Garick.
If the state finds a parts shortage triggered layoffs, the local workers could be eligible for checks in about two weeks at the earliest, Garick said.

FLINT, Mich.
_ Top negotiators for General Motors Corp.
and the United Automobile Workers union disagreed Thursday on the likelihood of a settlement by Monday in the most expensive strike to hit GM in a generation.
In conversations with reporters here, Richard Shoemaker, the vice president for GM issues at the UAW, and Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for labor relations, said they were pressing for a settlement before the automaker's two-week summer shutdown ended Monday but conceded talks were moving slowly.
``I would be absolutely shocked'' if the strike was settled by Monday, said Shoemaker, who tried to rein in some of the speculation about an imminent settlement in the walkout, which has idled 26 of GM's 29 North American assembly plants.
But a more optimistic Knechtel said, ``It's very important that we get it done by this weekend, if it's at all possible''.
Neither side would specify the issues standing in the way of an agreement, but people close to the union said the talks were focused on resolving important investment and compensation disputes.
Knechtel said it was critical for GM also to resolve lingering strike threats at parts factories in Dayton, Ohio, where workers have already authorized a strike, and in Indianapolis, where a strike-authorization vote is scheduled for Sunday.
``We're trying to get them all done,'' he said, declining to say whether GM is seeking a no-strike guarantee regarding those plants.
Shoemaker said the union would prefer to focus only on the strikes at two plants here because adding the other disputes would only prolong the process.
Among major remaining issues for the union, officials close to the discussions said, is whether the 9,200 striking workers here and the 161,000 workers laid off in the dispute will be granted 32 hours of vacation pay and a week off sometime later in the year.
Those are benefits they would have normally received as part of the company's annual two-week shutdown.
They are thought to be protected by language in the national contract, according to one senior union official.
``We won't leave here without an agreement on that issue,'' he said.
People close to the talks said the union also wanted a formal time line for when GM will invest the remaining $180 million of a $300 million investment plan at the metal-stamping plant, where the first strike began on June 5.
The company has said it scaled back investment in the plant because the union failed to help rid the factory of inefficient work rules.
At the Delphi East spark plug and speedometer factory, the other plant on strike here, the two sides were still at an impasse over GM's plan to send work to outside sources, a move that the union contended would cut at least 2,500 jobs.
UAW officials said negotiators at both plants had resolved many of the hundreds of worker-safety grievances that centered on issues such as exposure to hazardous materials, noise levels and use of old equipment.
These people, while declining to specify how those disputes were settled, said the union had begun to look for places to hold ratification meetings once an overall agreement was reached.
Early in the day, Shoemaker denied reports that progress was being stymied by demands from GM that broader issues such as what to do with its auto parts unit, Delphi Automotive Systems.
``We have not had a conversation about that,'' Shoemaker said.
Delphi employs 50,000 UAW members but lags behind rival auto suppliers in profitability because its wages are more than double the typical pay for parts assembly work.
GM and the UAW reached an understanding more than a year ago that GM may sell up to 20 percent of the division, possibly through an initial public offering.
Industry analysts said the press for a settlement was on because GM needed to begin to make up some of its losses, which are calculated at $1.18 billion through June 30, before the strikes have a chance to dent its third-quarter results.
``If GM doesn't settle this strike in the next couple of days,'' said David Healy, an auto analysts with Burnham Securities, ``whatever they've lost, they lose for good''. &QL;
