SAN ANTONIO _ The conviction of white supremacist John William King last week for the murder of James Byrd Jr.
, a black man, begins to bring closure to a horrific chapter in the nation's history of race relations.
But the book didn't begin, nor will it end with the King trial, as a report by the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center demonstrates.
According to the report, the number of hate groups in the country increased again last year.
Hate and intolerance are dark threads deeply woven into our society's fabric.
They give rise to the environment that fostered King's prejudices and threatens all communities, not just his own in Jasper, Texas.
Consider his writings in the scrapbook of a fellow prison inmate.
In it, King professed, ``We, my Aryan Brother in arms, will rightfully claim what's ours and in the end our feet will be washed in the blood of the Jews''.
The scary thing is that King is only 24.
He didn't evolve overnight into the monster that killed Byrd.
Neither did his moral moorings come loose in a vacuum.
King's hate steadily was fed, tattoos on his body eventually mirroring the thoughts in his head: a black man being lynched; a Madonna carrying a baby Jesus with horns; Nazi symbols.
Other events throughout the country and even in Jasper show how King might have arrived at this point.
In Louisiana last week, a white man was convicted of a hate crime for trying to burn two cars belonging to black motorists.
And in Virginia Beach, Va.
, a 19-year-old man pleaded guilty to trying to burn a cross on the lawn of an interracial couple.
In Jasper, school officials were haggling with the parents of a student who, amid the raw feelings surrounding Byrd's death and King's murder trial, found it fit to wear to class his Confederate flag belt buckle.
The boy's parents called in help from a nearby Ku Klux Klan group when the boy was suspended for refusing to leave his buckle at home.
While not murderous acts, they reveal an indifference to humanity.
For these folks, Byrd's brutal death was only a blip on their screen, if they even bothered to blink.
Whites aren't immune from becoming hate-crime victims, but groups that hate minorities, Jews and gays far outnumber other separatist organizations.
And, make no mistake, they're hungry for more recruits.
Their new tool, according to the law center, is the Internet.
Cyberspace gives hate groups a forum from which they can reach not only the traditional working-class white teen-ager, but increasingly the middle-class youth in suburbia.
Along with white power rock 'n' roll music and the ongoing recruiting efforts of fringe groups, the outreach has bumped the number of hate groups to 537 from 474 in 1997.
The Southern Poverty Law Center previously recorded a 20-percent increase in hate groups from 1996 to 1997.
Take a good look.
This is how John William King learned to hate.
Right under our noses.
In our back yard.
``(It's) something that is a virus,'' Jasper County District Attorney James Gray told jurors in closing arguments last week.
``It's something that's dangerous.
It's something that spreads from one person to another''.
But hate also is something that each of us can stop, if only by challenging those who espouse it.
Byrd's murder is all the motivation we need.

EAST PEORIA, Ill.
_ For years, the hard-working residents of this mostly white town on the eastern bank of the Illinois River did not take seriously the white supremacist views of Matthew F.
Hale, 27, the son of a retired local policeman.
They recall trying to ignore his leaflets and appearances on public-access television.
When he set up the headquarters of the World Church of The Creator in his parents' home, some thought it was a joke.
But after the July 4 weekend, when Benjamin Smith, a former World Church member, went on a two-state rampage against Jews, blacks and Asian-Americans, killing two and injuring nine before shooting himself, the laughter stopped.
``We were sickened,'' said Dennis Triggs, 54, the city attorney.
``We had the sense that benign neglect must come to an end''.
Triggs called Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit civil rights organization, to ask what East Peoria could do.
Dees sent Triggs and Mayor Charles Dobbelaire, 59, a copy of the center's publication ``Ten Ways to Fight Hate,'' and advised East Peoria city leaders to do two things: Speak out immediately and form a broad-based coalition on race issues.
Dees also put East Peoria leaders in touch with the Rev.
David Ostendorf, a United Church of Christ minister in Chicago who leads the Center for a New Community, a group dedicated to fighting white supremacist ideas and organizations in the Midwest.
Ostendorf, who believes ``the only way this movement is going to be stopped is if communities stand up and say no and organize to oppose it,'' added a stop in East Peoria to a civil rights tour that retraced Smith's deadly trip through Illinois and Indiana.
On July 22, with members of Ostendorf's caravan and 200 local residents present, the mayor announced that East Peoria, which has only a few dozen non-whites in its population of 23,400, would set up a Human Relations Commission ``to guide us in combating hate and teaching tolerance''.
``We will not surrender the minds of our young to Matt Hale,'' Dobbelaire continued.
``I know that still today there are those who believe we should not attract attention to the hatemongers,'' he said.
``They believe that if we quietly go about our everyday life, those who preach hate will fade slowly into the night.
I ask you this: If we do not speak out, loud and clear, when the hate messages spewing forth from this so-called church lead to death, then when do we speak out''?
Dobbelaire's speech was followed by a prayer vigil in front of the Hale family home.
On the other side of the ordinary, tree-lined street, a neighbor had posted a sign saying ``Hate Has No Home Here''.
The mayor, who grew up in East Peoria and said racial issues rarely crossed his mind, appointed a new Human Relations Commission on Aug.
17 and does not intend to let the matter drop.
``We're in this for the long haul,'' he said.
He wants the commission to ``oppose hate, preach tolerance and celebrate diversity''.
East Peoria has survived severe blows before, the worst being the closing of a Caterpillar tractor plant that had been the cornerstone of the economy.
But it has enjoyed a comeback in recent years, with a new riverboat casino and jobs in entertainment, tourism and service industries.
The idea that their town might be seen as some kind of hate capital horrified the mayor and the Human Relations commissioners.
``This is really causing a bad image for our tri-county area, not just East Peoria,'' said David Mingus, the commission chairman.
``It's unfortunate and unrealistic.
Our towns are good towns''.
Mingus, 48, a mental health professional, said the commission intends to take a broad look at diversity and tolerance: ``We will keep it open to all areas.
It's something nobody has on the scope all the time.
We have to change attitudes''.
Another member of the commission, Charles Randle, 53, who is black, said he has lived in an upscale neighborhood of East Peoria for 17 years with no difficulty.
But Randle said he cannot forget the searing experience of childhood on a cotton plantation in Mississippi, where two of his brothers, then young boys, were once jailed for supposedly whistling at a white woman.
To escape that life, their father, a sharecropper, moved his wife and 10 children to Peoria, where he worked at a slaughterhouse and then started a series of successful family businesses.
Randle, the director of economic development for Illinois Central College, said he sees the Human Relations Commission as a chance for East Peoria ``to step outside the box and look around''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Other communities have made similar efforts.
Idaho's image began to worry the staff at Hewlett-Packard in Boise several years ago, said Cindy Stanphill, the diversity and staffing manager there.
``When we recruit, people know about Idaho potatoes and the Aryan nations,'' she said.
``The image does not necessarily represent the reality, but you have to deal with both''.
For three years, the Hewlett-Packard staff has tried to find ways to insure that people they recruit and employ in Boise feel welcome at work and in the community.
Staff members are now trying to organize an Idaho Inclusiveness Coalition, a group of major employers and human rights groups to promote tolerance and celebrate diversity.
In Pennsylvania, the state's Human Relations Commission has helped more than 50 communities form groups to do something about hate.
One group started in Boyertown, a historically all-white community northwest of Philadelphia where the Ku Klux Klan distributed recruitment literature once a month.
Residents formed a unity coalition and asked citizens to pledge 5 to 50 cents for each minute the Klan spent in town.
The money went to civil rights groups and helped organize the town's first rally to honor the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
The head of the local Klan complained that the group, which was collecting $1,051 an hour, was using the Klan's name to raise money, said Louise Doskow, a member of the coalition.
But the group persisted.
``We have raised over $11,000,'' Ms.
Doskow said.
``We did it every month for 13 months, then they didn't show up again for a year.
One person came to the corner at the end of June, so we did another collection''.
The experiences of these communities and others, collected by Jim Carrier, a former Denver Post reporter, have been added to an updated version of ``Ten Ways to Fight Hate''.
Carrier said the Southern Poverty Law Center will distribute a million free copies of the booklet and a companion, ``Responding to Hate at School''.
The booklets will go to every school principal, mayor and police chief in the nation, as well as to human rights groups, religious leaders and interested citizens.
One group profiled, Coloradans United Against Hatred, formed after an African immigrant was murdered by a skinhead in 1997.
Seeing the use of the Internet by hate groups, the group set up its own Web site to offer an alternative.
``Are we making a huge impact''? said Anita Fricklas, the Colorado director of the American Jewish Committee, which helped underwrite the project.
``It's hard to know.
But an impact? Definitely.''
SPOKANE, Wash.
(AP) --Facing eviction from its compound in northern Idaho, the Aryan Nations may move its annual white supremacist gathering to Pennsylvania next year.
The news was posted on the neo-Nazi group's Web site Friday, a week after the group was slapped with a $6.3 million judgment in a civil lawsuit.
The compound is scheduled to be seized on Sept.
29 and the assets sold to satisfy a portion of the judgment due to two people who sued the group after they were assaulted by Aryan Nations' guards.
The notice was the first indication that the lawsuit, brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center, may drive the group out of Idaho.
''I have been asked if I would continue to host the yearly National Congress and my answer was, of course, an astounding YES''! wrote August B.
Kreis III, Web master for the Aryan Nations and a Posse Comitatus leader in Pennsylvania.
Kreis wrote that if the compound is lost, the Aryan Nations ''National Congress 2001'' would be planned for a site near Ulysses, Pa.
Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler declined to talk with reporters Friday.
He is appealing the judgment to the Idaho Supreme Court, but that appeal is not expected to halt the seizure of the group's 20-acre compound north of Hayden Lake.
Morris Dees, the civil rights lawyer who led the plaintiffs' legal team, has said he expected the judgment to bring a quick end to the Aryan Nations and its racist, anti-Semitic message.
Butler moved to northern Idaho from California in 1973, and began holding an annual event called the Aryan Nations Congress in 1981.
The gatherings drew white supremacists from across the nation to hear speeches and participate in cross burnings and other activities.
Kootenai County Sheriff Rocky Watson has said his officers will seize the Aryan Nations compound on Sept.
29. The sheriff's office will store the contents and eventually hold a sale, with the money going to Victoria and Jason Keenan, who filed the lawsuit, and their lawyers.
Last week, a jury ruled that Butler, his organization and its corporate entity, Saphire Inc.
, were negligent in selecting and overseeing security guards who attacked the Keenans in 1998.
It's a free country.
But two upcoming cable specials may leave viewers wondering if too much freedom is a bad thing.
HBO's ``HATE.COM: Extremists on the Internet'' and Discovery Channel's ``Warnings from a Small Town'' both look at hate crimes and at how ``hate sites'' on the Internet are preying on impressionable young people with low self-esteem.
According to ``HATE.COM,'' many acts of domestic terrorism, such as the Oklahoma City bombing and the attack at a Jewish community day-care center in Los Angeles, are not the work of ``lone wolves'' but of soldiers in a loosely organized army whose marching orders come via neo-Nazi, white-supremacist and homophobic Web sites.
Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center and a crusader against intolerance, says the answer is not to censor the Internet.
So-called Internet ``filters'' that remove hateful language are often misguided, he says.
``I don't think those filter systems are worth very much because if you eliminate the word `Nazi' you might eliminate a major piece of history,'' Dees said.
``You might eliminate things that would be positive responses to hate on the Web.
``The best filter,'' he continued, ``is an educated public''.
Steven Stroud, a former skinhead who learned to hate as a teenager in Seattle, couldn't agree more.
Before he was taken in by a loving foster family, Stroud says hating other people, especially others different from him, made him feel superior.
Now a community activist in Portland, Stroud tries to reach other skinheads by conducting interventions.
One such exercise with a boy named Josh is described in ``Warnings from a Small Town,'' the third installment in Discovery's series, ``Hate &AMP; Violence: No Simple Answers''.
With information from the Internet, Josh created a model of a concentration camp for a school project and received an A from his teacher.
He showed how whites belong ``on top'' and all other races belong ``under the ground''.
Stroud says kids like Josh often feel that adults have let them down, through divorce, abuse, etc.
``The youth are looking for something,'' Stroud said.
``The kids are actually looking to this electronic medium for answers they can't get from adults''.
``Warnings from a Small Town'' airs Aug.
30 on Discovery.
``HATE.COM'' is scheduled to premiere Oct.
23 on HBO.
On her most recent shuttle trip last May, U.S. astronaut Mary Ellen Weber and her crew mates visited the International Space Station to replace three fire extinguishers, four fans and 10 smoke detectors because the warranties had expired.
Is it any wonder Americans don't get jazzed about space exploration anymore?
But Weber says she's OK with that.
``The same way that air travel is not quite the same event that it was when the Wright brothers flew an airplane, ...
that's the era we're moving into with space,'' says Weber, who has flown on two shuttle missions and logged more than 450 hours in Earth orbit.
``It's not necessarily about trying to get to one particular place and all cheer afterwards,'' she says.
``We're trying to take space and adopt it into our lives, to improve our lives, so I'm not upset at all that there isn't the same amount of excitement.
It just means we've moved on to a much greater level''.
Make that split level, as in ``contemporary, high-tech home on spacious lot with spectacular views''.
That's what the International Space Station will be when construction is completed, probably in 2005.
And even if Weber can forgive America's lack of enthusiasm for space exploration, the Discovery Channel can't.
On Dec.
10, Discovery will air ``Inside the Space Station,'' an hourlong look at probably the greatest engineering marvel of our time.
It will be the first of four quarterly specials dedicated to the final frontier.
Subsequent programs will look at other moons in our solar system, violent weather on other planets, and comets, asteroids and meteors .
The Good News About `Going Postal' On Aug.
20, 1986, an Oklahoma postal worker shot and killed 14 co-workers, then himself.
In the years since, there have been other incidents of violence and murder, sometimes multiple murder, by current or former postal workers.
On Aprril 17, 1994, in his ``On Language'' column in The New York Times Magazine, William Safire discussed whether ``going postal'' meant ``losing it'' or ``not being online''.
It was the first time that ``going postal'' appeared in The Times.
The rest is linguistic history.
Three-year-olds know what going postal means.
Is the Postal Service happy about this?
Not at all.
So, calmly, it commissioned a lengthy study on workplace safety, a study that _ with charts and myriad statistics _ strikes out at the notion that your friendly letter carrier is likely, at any moment, to whip an Uzi out of his mail pouch.
```Going postal' is a myth, a bad rap,'' the report says.
``Postal workers are no more likely to physically assault, sexually harass, or verbally abuse their coworkers than employees in the national workforce''.
Retail workers, it says, are eight times as likely as postal workers to be victims of homicide at work.
The study is a serious one.
``The level of violence throughout the American workplace is unacceptably high,'' it says, and offers a variety of remedies.
But it also seems intent on clearing the Postal Service's tainted name, noting that part of the problem is that it has so many workers _ as a civilian employer, it's second only to Wal-Mart.
But it will be rough.
A new expression, once it has burst from the starting gate, is awfully hard to call back.
And ``going Wal-Mart'' just doesn't work.
A Restaurant That's All Lobby Washington lobbyists, shod in tasseled loafers, once inspired someone to describe their eager, sartorially enhanced gatherings outside the closed doors of congressional hearing rooms as Gucci Gulch.
Now they have their own watering hole, the Caucus Room, and the list of investors is top heavy with a who's who of lobbyocracy.
Which is why it has more private dining rooms than any other Washington restaurant.
Thomas H.
Boggs Jr.
, one of its largest investors and one of the town's best-known lobbyists (his father, Hale, was a Democratic leader in the the House, his mother, Lindy, a former congresswoman from Louisiana and now ambassador to the Vatican), provided a simple explanation.
So many closed doors, he said, make it possible to keep people like House Speaker Dennis Hastert, a Republican, and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, a Democrat, from running into each other during fund-raising events.
Not so incidentally, lobbyists can deduct as much of their visits as business expenses as possible _ 100 percent for a banquet, but only 50 percent for a regular meal.
The roster of the Caucus Room's 65 shareholders includes Michael Brown, the son of the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, as well as James Lake, the deputy campaign manager for the 1992 Bush campaign.
It practically guarantees a full house nightly.
And if political junkies watch the comings and goings of the private dining rooms carefully, they might just be able to figure out the behind-the-scene machinations that make Washington tick.
In a town where politics has become a very nasty business, the lobbyists have put aside their differences and come together in one of their few bipartisan efforts, offering a culinary venue that fairly sizzles with accommodation _ a steakhouse.
A Missile Defense Strategy That Will Have to Wait &QL; President Clinton left to his successor the decision on whether to deploy a national missile defense system.
He said he would not do so himself because of test failures and diplomatic disputes.
The president, speaking at Georgetown University, said he had decided not to act after two huge $100 million tests of the system failed to intercept incoming missiles.
Clinton said more time is also needed to find a diplomatic solution to what has been a growing confrontation between the United States and Russia and China, staunch opponents to a U.S. missile defense.
&QL; Temps, Unite &QL; The labor movement has long been eager to unionize temp workers because they are such a fast-growing group and because they often receive inferior pay and benefits.
But for years they were off limits because they were not allowed to join unions unless the user company and temp agency agreed _ something that rarely happened.
The National Labor Relations Board opened the door to forming such unions by ruling that they no longer needed the temp agency's permission to do so.
Awards After an Uprising More than 500 former inmates who were beaten during the 1971 Attica prison uprising will split $8 million as part of a settlement with New York state, a federal judge ruled.
The awards, which range from $6,500 to $125,000, punctuate a protracted legal battle stemming from the uprising, in which 43 people died.
Still, the judge said many survivors ``remain casualties because of lingering physical problems and the inability to erase memories of Attica''.
No Terminator, Please The computer scientists at Brandeis University have created the first robotic system that can design and build other robots with almost no human help.
The technique will merely speed up the process of designing robots, said Dr.

Pollack, a professor of computer science at Brandeis and one of the researchers, and sharply drop the cost.
Crime Continues to Decline Violent crime in the United States dropped last year to its lowest level since the government began its annual national crime survey 26 years ago.
Law enforcement officials credited crime-prevention programs, anti-gun campaigns, more police on the street, tougher sentencing and a healthy economy producing jobs.
The rate of violent crime declined 10.4 percent in 1999, the Justice Department said, while crimes against property dropped 8.9 percent.
But there still were an estimated 28.8 million violent and property crimes committed last year.
The French and Corsica A plan by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France to give limited self-rule to the island of Corsica has caused turmoil in France's political class and led Interior Minister Jean Pierre Chevenement to resign in protest.
Any degree of regional autonomy is a deeply sensitive constitutional issue in France.
But the plan has also gained wide backing, including from Corsicans, because it aims to strengthen moderates and end the violent campaign of separatists, who have thrown bombs and practiced political killings for almost three decades.
Next, the Aryan Nations &QL; In an attempt to seize the compound of the Aryan Nations, Morris S.
Dees Jr.
went to court in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.
Dees, founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, has won a series of civil right suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations in a campaign to drive them out of business.
The Aryan Nations compound has been a base for white supremacists for more than 20 years.
His suit contends that compound guards, the Aryan Nations, its 82-year-old founder, Richard Girnt Butler, and his second in command, Michael Teague, should be held liable for an attack on a woman and her son, both white, by the guards in July 1998.
Dees' goal is to win a large judgment that will force the group to surrender their compound in payment.
Immigrant Influx in Nevada By one measure, at least, the future of America seems to be at the gambling table.
The Census Bureau estimated that jobs in Las Vegas lured so many people that Nevada grew the fastest of any state in the 1990s, with its population rising 50 percent.
Many of those pouring in to build or staff casinos and hotels were Hispanics and Asians, the nation's fastest-growing minority groups.
California, though, still has the largest Hispanic population _ 10.4 million, up 36 percent in a decade.
Eh, Get a Horse It was a tough week for Ford Motor Co.
The auto giant admitted it was aware of tire failures on Explorer sport utility vehicles in Venezuela as early as 1998.
A Superior Court judge in Alameda County, Calif.
, Michael E.
Ballachey, largely agreed with complaints that Ford knowingly installed defective ignition mechanisms in nearly two million Ford vehicles produced from 1983 to 1995.
The judge said he intended to issue orders to recall and repair the vehicles.
Analysts estimated the cost could run as high as $250 million.
Ford refuted the finding, and predicted it would be reversed on appeal.
A New Trial for American After an election marred by charges of voter fraud, President Alberto K.
Fujimori of Peru no doubt needs all the friends he can get.
That could well explain Peru's decision to grant a new trial to Lori Berenson, the New Yorker who in 1996 was tried in secret before masked judges and sentenced to life imprisonment for terrorism.
The case has been a thorn ever since in relations between Washington and Lima, but human rights officials remained wary, fearing that a new trial would be no fairer than the first.
A Finding on Death Row &QL; Not all Texas murder defendants get a decent courtroom defense.
Not in the case of Delma Banks Jr.
, who was sent to death row in 1980.
His lawyer, a former district attorney, failed ``to investigate or interview punishment-phase witnesses,'' a federal magistrate later found.
On Aug.
18, David Folsom, a U.S.
District judge in Texarkana, Texas, endorsed that finding, which was first reported Wednesday in The Texarkana Gazette, and ordered either a sentence reduction or new sentencing trial for Banks.
HAYDEN LAKE, Idaho _ At 81, Richard Girnt Butler knows he's in his twilight days.
He hopes the rest of the world is too.
For 27 years, Butler has preached about ``the great race war'' from his swastika- and crucifix-adorned pulpit here in the Selkirk Mountain foothills.
``We're approaching the end-time period.
I'd like to see the final conclusion, but that's up to my Father,'' says Butler, tromping across the United Nations and Israeli flags he uses as doormats at the entrance to his chapel.
In the process of creating a ``white homeland,'' the founder of the Aryan Nations and the Church of Jesus Christ, Christian, Butler has made the Northwest infamous as a spawning-ground for racism.
Buford R.
Furrow Jr.
, a former Aryan Nations security guard charged with killing a Los Angeles postal worker and wounding five in an attack on a Jewish day-care center, is the latest Butler disciple to make news for racist violence.
Butler is unrepentant.
``If a Catholic priest sodomizes an altar boy _ and they've had a whole string of them _ do you blame the church for it?
The pope''? he asked in an interview at his office Tuesday.
While offering a safehouse for neo-Nazi pilgrims, Butler's 20-acre compound has also fostered disciples who engaged in murder, robbery and racial assaults.
According to civil rights groups, those with ties to Butler include: _Members of The Order, who robbed armored cars and assassinated Denver radio host Alan Berg in the 1980s; _Colville native Chevie Kehoe, convicted recently on homicide charges; _Mark Thomas, Butler's former Pennsylvania state leader, who robbed banks to fund a white revolution; _Nathan Thill, a skinhead and former Butler organizer in Denver, who last November confessed to killing a man because the victim had black skin.
``I have no control over what people do,'' Butler says.
``I don't espouse violence at all, but it happens.
I'm not violent, but I failed Hypocrisy 101 in school''.
Regarding Furrow's alleged day-care assault, he says, ``I don't favor hurting children, but I can't get worked up about the wounding of some of my enemies, even though they're children''.
Quickly, he changes the subject.
``I do get worked up about white girls being assaulted and raped'' in violent crimes by minorities.
Civil rights groups that have fought Butler over the decades now wonder about the future of his organization.
The Southern Poverty Law Center is suing Butler, hoping to bankrupt him in a lawsuit for unspecified civil damages filed in Coeur d'Alene in January.
The suit was filed on behalf of Victoria Keenan, a Seattle woman, and her son, Jason, who were shot at near the compound in July 1998 by Aryan Nations security guards.
In police reports, Keenan said the guards mistook her car's backfire for gunfire after she stopped on the roadway and restarted the car.
The guards, according to police reports, barreled out of the compound after her in a pickup truck, chased her two miles down the road and shot at her car with assault rifles.
Kootenai County sheriff's deputies documented bullet holes in her car.
Butler's security chief, Edward ``Jesse'' Warfield, pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced in May to as many as five years in prison.
Two other guards remain fugitives.
Mark Potok of the SPLC said the group is refraining from comments about Butler pending a trial.
In the past, the SPLC has said Butler and his group did more to foment modern racism nationwide, and to tarnish the Northwest in the process, than any other neo-Nazi group.
``The Jews and I are at war,'' Butler says.
And he believes the lawsuit is part of that war.
The SPLC, headed by Morris Dees in Alabama, is known for having used civil law to break the back of the Ku Klux Klan.
``It's harassment.
The sole purpose is to bankrupt me,'' complains Butler, who says a less well-financed Aryan Nations legal defense fund has been set up for him.
``I've had to spend $55,000 so far''.
Regarding Keenan, Butler would say only that ``allegedly, she was shooting at our sign out there''.
Butler bought the land off Rimrock Road about 10 miles north of Coeur d'Alene for his compound back in 1972, when he was in California working for Lockheed.
The road winds over hills, past horse farms, fields of fresh-cut alfalfa and creeks where kids fish, a sea of tranquility interrupted by the jarring red, white and blue Aryan Nations sign at the foot of Butler's property.
Passing beneath the two flags at the entrance, one the Confederate stars and bars, the other a 13-star U.S. flag, the driveway climbs past a meadow of flowers until it rounds a corner, where a ``whites only'' sign precedes an empty guardhouse.
The grounds resemble any of the other small retirement ranches nearby, except for the big brown stage in the middle of the compound, and a big Nazi swastika on a corrugated roof.
In Butler's Aryan heyday, the compound was a popular mecca for racist sympathizers from around the world who assailed whole groups of people, seeking to unify neo-Nazi forces.
A ``who's who of the hate movement'' visited the place over the years, including William Pierce, author of a book about a race war called The Turner Diaries that allegedly inspired Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh; former Texas Klan leader Louis Beam; and Tom Metzger of the White Aryan Resistance, who lost his house and possessions to a SPLC lawsuit.
Last week, however, only seven or eight people were living on or visiting the compound.
Butler holds court at his desk, piled with papers, in a small office next to the church.
Gifts and framed documents hang on his office walls, including several pictures of Hitler.
Beneath his desk, his 5-year-old purebred German shepherd, Fritz, instinctively growls at strangers.
Fritz follows Butler everywhere, sometimes joining another German shepherd, Eva, roaming the grounds.
A picture of a sharp-featured Hitler peers across the doorway at a softer, glowing rendition of a Jesus with European features.
There are lots of swastikas, one made by a follower in prison from folded Camel cigarette filters; another crocheted, and another made of folded chewing-gum wrappers.
Among his favorite gifts is a line of carved ``little Klansmen''.
Behind his chair, above a whip sent by an admirer and a Nazi helmet, is a tot's drawing, orange silhouettes of a Klansman pasted on yellow paper, with blue crayon scribbling.
It was made by the daughter of Christian, his receptionist.
``I didn't even teach her that,'' Christian says proudly, ``she just did it.
It was pretty neat''.
Like his idol Hitler, Butler likes kids.
A school once operated on the property but no more, though kids sometimes attend church with their parents.
Race is a religion with Butler.
The 150-year-old ideology known as Christian Identity, which has the hallmarks of a conspiracy theory through which he believes that he and others of white northern European descent are the true Israelites tricked out of their birthright by Jews, and forced to live with other races.
Not everyone can understand the message of his race-based Christian Identity religion, Butler says.
White people are like radio receivers in their ability to hear the message, says Butler.
``Jesus said let those who have ears hear''.
Among Butler's more startling hypotheses: Whites, not American Indians, were the first in the Americas.
And Albert Einstein was brilliant only because he was taught by Germans.
He dislikes televangelists and spits out the word ``Judeo-Christian'' to describe the followers of mainstream Christian faiths.
Even followers of the World Wide Church of the Creator, white separatists, are heretics in that they have compiled their own Bible instead of relying on the original, he says.
How would Butler explain his reverence for Hitler and the swastika to those thousands of World War II veterans lying in Normandy graveyards, who died fighting what those symbols stood for?
``A lot of World War II soldiers now realize the war was a war against the white race and the white race lost,'' Butler asserts.
Butler, born in Bennett, Colo.
, on Feb.
23, 1918, is proud of his own German extraction, and says the war should never have been fought on the European theater.
A profile of Butler by the SPLC says his father, Clarence, a German-English machinist, did not hide his dislike for Jews or communists from his son.
When the family moved to East Los Angeles after the Depression, Butler studied aeronautical engineering and science at a city college.
He then got a part-time job at 25 cents an hour at an aircraft company that sent him to Bangalore, India, to overhaul planes for the Royal Indian Air Force.
Butler and his wife, Betty, who died in December 1995, were married in 1941.
During the war, Butler said he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and taught aircraft hydraulics to mechnics in the China-Burma theatre.
Butler said he never agreed with fighting Germany, and was invigorated by newsreels of marching Germans.
His racial activism, he said, began after returning from the war when ``things just didn't seem right'' and he became an admirer of Sen.
Joe McCarthy's movement about communism.
Butler's activism was galvanized during a signature campaign to expose communist teachers, when he met William Potter Gale, a retired Army colonel who had served on Gen.
Douglas MacArthur's staff, who introduced Butler to Christian Identity.
Butler also met George Lincoln Rockwell, a former Navy pilot who founded the American Nazi Party.
Through Gale, Butler said he met and studied under ``my mentor,'' Dr.
Wesley Swift, pastor of the Anglo-Saxon Christian Congregation in Lancaster, Calif.
, whose Christian Identity preaches that Eve mated with the devil, begetting Jews.
Now Butler is preparing to pass the torch, but not in the heavily mentored fashion in which he was ordained.
Butler last year appointed an heir apparent, Newman Britton, a longtime Aryan follower from Escondido, Calif.
, and the latest in a string of annointed successors who faded away over the years in philosophical differences.
His compound could disappear even without the lawsuit.
In January, one of Butler's two daughters, who don't share his neo-Nazi or white supremacist beliefs, said she and her husband would sell the 19-acre site, worth about $200,000, upon his death.
When he bought the compound in 1972, Butler hoped it would be the genesis of a white homeland, something his Christian Identity beliefs claim white people have been denied.
Even if the compound doesn't survive, he's confident in his racist religion.
``It's all pre-ordained.
There's no way you can jump off of a cliff and not proceed to the judgment that you will hit the ground.
You can't stop halfway.''
COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) --One of two men convicted of assaulting a woman and her son outside the headquarters of the Aryan Nations denied being a member of the white supremacist group Thursday during testimony in a civil rights case filed against them, the Aryan Nations and the group's founder, Richard Butler.
Lawyer Morris Dees, the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center who is representing Victoria Keenan and her son, Jason, introduced letters, photographs and depositions to contradict the men's testimony.
If the jury awards compensatory and punitive damages, the Keenans could demand the Aryan Nations' assets, mainly the 20-acre compound and the sect's buildings.
Dees has publicly said he hopes to bankrupt the Aryan Nations.
In court Thursday, Keenan's lawyers described Jesse Warfield, 43, as a former Aryan Nations security chief and John Yeager, 21, as former guard for the group.
Both men are serving prison sentences for the 1998 assaults, and another security guard, Shane Wright, is a fugitive.
Warfield testified that he wasn't a member of the group when he, Yeager and Wright jumped into his pickup with an assault rifle and chased the Keenans' car after hearing a loud noise outside the group's compound, north of Coeur D'Alene.
He said he only chased the Keenans, who are part-white and part-American Indian, to try to find out who had paid them to shoot at the compound.
No weapon was found in the Keenans' car, and authorities theorize the guards mistook a car backfire for a gunshot.
Warfield said he ''always acted as if I was security chief, even though I wasn't appointed''.
Yeager said he was drunk and didn't recall shooting an assault rifle at the Keenans' car.
Both men are representing themselves and testified that the atmosphere surrounding the Aryan Nations compound in the months leading up to a 1998 Aryan parade through town was one of increasing paranoia that others would try to stop them.
The two denied lying to protect Butler, whom they consider to be the protector of the white race.
Butler, 82, has also said the men acted on their own.
Edgar Steele, a lawyer representing Butler and the corporation that controls Aryan assets, has said he fears the Aryans' beliefs will be scrutinized by the jury rather than the evidence.
The lawyers for the Ayran Nations have not begun calling witnesses in the case.
Outside the Kootenai County Justice Building, security has been tight since the trial began Monday.
SWAT team members scan the crowd with binoculars from atop the building, visitors must pass through a metal detector and there is a daily lottery for courtroom passes.
At one point, federal agents were posing as journalists in the crowd to photograph neo-Nazi skinheads who had been rallying outside the courthouse.
The sheriff's department on Wednesday revoked the agents' false credentials.
Sheriff's Capt.
Ben Wolfinger admitted he initially directed seven agents to obtain media passes so they could blend in better with photographers covering the trial.
I was surprised it became an issue,'' he said.
Advocates for the news media said it is dangerous for law officers to pose as journalists.
Such deceptions could lead to physical threats against reporters, who are not armed, said Kyle Niederpruem, national president of the Society of Professional Journalists.
FBI officials did not immediately return messages for comment.
COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho _ Issuing a verdict that civil rights organizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest white-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a state jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan Nations to pay more than $6 million to the victims of an attack two years ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's compound near here.
Richard Girnt Butler, the 82-year-old self-described pastor of the Aryan Nations compound, and his deputy, Michael Teague, were ordered to pay most of the $6.3 million in damages by the nine-woman, three-man jury.
The findings, delivered late Thursday afternoon in the Kootenai County Courthouse, prompted tearful hugs among the plaintiffs, a mother and son who were beaten and shot at in the attack, and their lawyers.
The defendants responded defiantly outside the courthouse, even as protesters shouted at them to stop their ``message of hate''.
The verdict was obtained by lawyers for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization in Birmingham, Ala.
, that has successfully sued the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations.
Morris S.
Dees Jr.
, a founder of the center, hailed the jury's finding as a powerful message against racial intolerance and one that could force the group out of its 19-acre property.
``We intend to take every single asset from the Aryan Nations now and forever,'' Dees said at a news conference after the verdict was announced.
``We intend to even take the name Aryan Nations and hopefully, through the judicial pro- cess, close a sad chapter in this na- tion's history''.
The jury found that Butler and the Aryan Nations were liable for $4.8 million and Teague was lia- ble for $600,000.
The guards were liable for most of the remaining amount.
The multimillion-dollar award also represented the kind of message from the community that many civic leaders here had openly sought, hoping that it might help the area to shed what they called North Idaho's distorted image as a haven for people with racist views.
But Butler scoffed at the verdict, variously comparing himself to figures in the Bible and to signers of the Declaration of Independence who were harassed for their views.
``This is nothing,'' he said, after the verdict.
``We have planted seeds''.
Said Teague: ``The message doesn't take a lot of money.
We will spread the message''.
A lawyer for the group said an appeal was planned.
The extent of group's assets re- mained unclear, raising questions about whether Butler and his followers, whose numbers have been described by the local authorities as dwindling, would pay anything close to the full amount if the award is upheld.
Nonetheless, Dees vowed that it was the beginning of the end for the group and that the verdict was a rebuke of the Aryan Nations &UR; ------------------- &LR; leaders, who were technically found to be negligent in the training and supervision of the security guards who carried out the attack.
The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son, Jason, now 21, who were beaten and shot at by three security guards for the Aryan Nations in July 1998, had asked the jury for nearly $12 million in compensatory and punitive damages.
But the larger purpose of the lawsuit was to bankrupt the Aryan Nations compound, limit Butler's ability to spread a gospel of racial hate and persuade the jury to ``return a verdict that will be heard all over this nation,'' a lawyer for the Keenans, Dees said in closing arguments.
Butler's lawyer, Edgar Steele, argued throughout the six-day trial that however offensive jurors might find the views of Butler, he should not be held responsible for the actions of a group of drunken young men.
Steele said the Aryan Nations property was not the incubator of violence that Dees had portrayed it to be.
``What goes on at Pastor Butler's property,'' he told the jurors, ``is really more akin to a homeless shelter for exceedingly politically incorrect misfits, malcontents, borderline derelicts and all manner of people that drift in and out''.
Keenan and her son were attacked after stopping their car near the entrance to the 19-acre Aryan Nations property near Hayden Lake, about 20 miles north of here, on their way home from a wedding.
They were looking for a wallet that Keenan had accidentally dropped from their 1977 Datsun.
He had been in the Job Corps and had thrown his Job Corps card out the window on a whim and, inadvertently, his wallet along with it.
He quickly retrieved the wallet, but when the car started, it backfired, Keenan told the police after the incident.
At the compound, three guards, one of whom later told the police that he had thought the place was about to be attacked by militant Jews, picked up their guns, jumped in a pickup truck and chased the car.
They shot at the car, flattening a rear tire and forcing the car into a ditch.
In tearful testimony, Keenan said one guard, Jesse Warfield, 45, struck her with the butt of a rifle, grabbed her by the hair and screamed at her.
She and her son testified that they thought they were going to be killed.
Keenan said that she begged the men not to kill her son and that one of the guards then asked her if she was Indian.
She testified that while she is part Cherokee, she told the men, ``No, I'm a poor white farm girl''.
A guard then said that because they were white, the men would let them go.
At the trial, another security guard, John Yeager, 21, testified that he was too drunk that night to remember whether he or the other men had fired at the Keenans.
Under questioning, Yeager read portions of a letter from jail in which he expressed his allegiance to Butler, saying, ``Next to Christ you are the greatest man to ever walk the face of this earth''.
Yeager and Warfield have pleaded guilty to criminal assault and are in prison, while the third guard, Shane Wright, 23, remained a fugitive.
The two imprisoned men were brought here for the trial and testified that they were responsible for their actions, a point repeated by Steele.
Wilbert Jean Oliver, whose 1973 federal lawsuit had the practical effect of forcing funeral homes throughout the United States to provide equal services to blacks and whites, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Marksville, La.
He was 89 and lived in Mansura, La.
Oliver sued the Escude Funeral Home in Mansura, where he lived all his life, for discrimination after it refused to provide visitation for his deceased mother, Martha Pierre Oliver, because she was black.
Lawyers from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization in Montgomery, Ala.
, advanced his case in federal court, charging that the Escude Funeral Home and Hixson Brothers Funeral Home in Avoyelles Parish either refused to deal with blacks or offered ``distinctly inferior services'' for the same prices that they charged whites.
Oliver won his case.
Morris Dees, the chief trial counsel of the Southern Poverty Law Center and a member of the original team of lawyers that handled the case, said, ``Although the case was not binding, because it never reached the Supreme Court, it served notice to funeral homes, and even cemeteries and other businesses, that if they practiced discrimination against blacks they could be violating federal law''.
Dees said that after the ruling was announced, his organization heard reports from across the country that previously segregated funeral homes had begun to offer a full line of service to black clients.
``Nevertheless,'' he said, ``black funeral homes continue to prosper in the South as a matter of choice''.
Gaon Escude, a spokesman for the funeral home, said that his grandfather, who operated the home at the time of the lawsuit, provided all services, including embalming, but stopped at offering visitation to blacks ``because, if he did, he thought he'd lose business from whites''.
He added that his grandfather's competitors at the time would not accept any black clients at all.
The Rev.
August Thompson, who was Oliver's priest when his mother died, said Oliver had been distraught when he was told that the funeral home would not permit visitation for his mother.
``He lived in what used to be called a shotgun house, because it was so flimsy that if you fired a shotgun at the house it would go right through it,'' Thompson said.
``He wanted a better place for visitation for his mother''.
After the Escude Funeral Home rejected his request, Oliver, a salesman for John Deere, arranged to hold the wake in what was described in his lawsuit as ``a run-down storage building on the grounds of Our Lady of Prompt Succor Church''.
Oliver is survived by his wife, Catherine Carmouche Oliver of Mansura; two sons, Wilbert Jr.
of Chicago and Carroll of Kingwood, Texas; a foster son, Francis Sarpy of Charleston, S.C. six daughters, Catherine Demouy and Jacqueline Batiste of Mansura, Sister Laurita Oliver of New Orleans, Eloise Lee of DeRidder, La.
, Geraldine Barbin of Marksville and Hattie Turner of Alexandria, La.
39 grandchildren; 72 great-grandchildren, and 13 great-great-grandchildren.
``He was just an ordinary man, one of the common people and not a crusader,'' Thompson said.
``Life was a little harder for him because he had lost his left arm in an accident, but none of the local lawyers would touch the case.
I directed him to Julian Bond, who was then president of the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Bond took the case and within a month it was decided.''
MOBILE, Ala.
(AP) --A white supremacist arrested after buying hand grenades from an undercover agent said he wanted to send mail bombs to Washington and Montgomery, authorities said.
Chris Scott Gilliam said he didn't want to be like the Unabomber, who killed three person and wounded several others, a federal agent testified at a federal court hearing.
``He wanted to kill everybody,'' David Pasqualotto, a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said Friday.
There was no immediate indication what agencies or people might have been targeted in the national and state capital cities.
An ATF representative did not immediately return calls for comment Saturday.
Gilliam, 27, was charged with possessing an unregistered firearm found at his home in Foley along with what agents said was apparently a silencer.
Defense attorney Gary Arm said at the hearing that Gilliam legally owned the firearm and has no criminal record.
A federal magistrate ordered him held pending the results of a psychological evaluation.
If convicted, Gilliam, could face six or seven years in prison, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Greg Bordenkircher.
No charges were immediately filed in connection with the grenade purchase.
Pasqualotto testified that Gilliam met with him Thursday, arriving with a loaded, cocked.45-caliber pistol on his hip and his 20-month-old son in his arms.
``I knew he wasn't quite right,'' Pasqualotto said.
The investigation started three weeks earlier when Gilliam contacted a man about obtaining C4 high explosive, Pasqualotto testified.
He said Gilliam also told the informant someone should kill the FBI sniper who killed the wife of white supremacist Randy weaver during an 11-day standoff in 1992 at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, along with civil rights lawyer Morris Dees of the Montgomery-based Southern Poverty Law Center .
HAYDEN LAKE, Idaho (AP) --Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler vowed Saturday he will not leave northern Idaho, despite a $6.3 million judgment against his racist organization.
At a news conference on the 20-acre Aryan Nations compound, Butler said he did not have the $960,000 in cash bond that would be required for him to appeal the judgment issued Thursday by a civil jury Thursday.
But he said his neo-Nazi sect would continue, even if the compound is seized to pay the judgment as he expects.
''They cannot run me out of northern Idaho with my tail between my legs,'' Butler said from a church pulpit, standing next to a silver bust of Adolf Hitler.
He said he may seek a new trial.
A jury found that Butler and his organization were negligent in selecting and overseeing security guards who assaulted Victoria Keenan and her son Jason in 1998.
Jurors awarded the damages to the Keenans, who were chased, shot at and assaulted after they stopped their car near the entrance to the Aryan Nations' compound.
Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.
, represented the Keenans and has said he intends to take everything the Aryan Nations owns to pay the judgment, including the sect's name.
Butler compared his trial to trials in the former Soviet Union under dictator Josef Stalin.
He said local ''politicians want to improve the image of Idaho by mongrelizing the white race up here''.
Idaho politicians and community leaders expressed hope after last week's judgment that Butler would leave the area and take his organization with him.
Instead, Butler, 82, has applied for a permit to hold another parade down the streets of nearby Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, in October.
He bemoaned the expected loss of the compound, which he bought nearly 30 years ago and includes his home and church and has been the site of annual gatherings by his supporters.
''This place was built on love,'' Butler said.
''It is a place to worship with your own kind''.
There has been speculation that two wealthy computer industry executives who have been supportive of Butler in recent years might come to his financial aid.
But Butler said Saturday that he has not asked Vincent Bertollini or Carl Story, both of Sandpoint, Idaho, to pay the judgment.
''They don't have that kind of money,'' Butler said.
''We never talked about it''.
Butler also praised attorney Edgar Steele of Sandpoint for taking his case, even though he said Steele did not share the Aryan Nations' views.
''Mister Steele took the case for me out of his concern for freedom of speech,'' Butler said.
''For the past two weeks, freedom of speech has been on trial.''
COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) --A lawyer who specializes in bankrupting hate groups is going after the Aryan Nations, whose compound in the Idaho woods has served as a clubhouse for some of America's most violent racists.
In a lawsuit that goes to trial Monday, attorney Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center is representing a mother and son who were attacked by security guards for the white supremacist group.
The victims are suing the Aryan Nations and founder Richard Butler.
''Put them out of business, that's what we try to do,'' Dees said when the lawsuit was filed last year.
He has declined additional comment.
Butler said the lawsuit was brought by enemies of the white race.
''That's the way it is for the white man today,'' Butler, 82, said Wednesday.
''I think it's a rape of the American justice system''.
The case has its origins on July 1, 1998, when Victoria Keenan, 43, and her son Jason, 20, were driving on a country road near Hayden Lake.
Their car backfired as it passed the Aryan Nations' 20-acre compound.
Security guards for the Aryan Nations mistook the backfire for a gunshot, piled into a truck and chased the Keenans, who are part white, part American Indian, for two miles.
They fired five bullets into the Keenan car and forced it off the road.
Both Keenans were punched and threatened at gunpoint before the guards backed off.
Two of the guards were convicted of assault and are in prison.
A third remains a fugitive.
The Keenans are alleging assault, false imprisonment and emotional distress at the hands of the guards, who they contend were agents of the Aryan Nations.
They are seeking an unspecified amount in compensatory and punitive damages.
Butler and his attorney Edgar Steele are expected to argue that he should not be held liable for the actions of the volunteer security guards.
Steele did not return a call.
In court documents, Steele described the security guards as ''borderline derelicts'' who were not under Butler's control.
Butler's beliefs should not be used against him, the defense documents said, ''Demonizing Jews is still legal under the First Amendment''.
Dees has long used lawsuits to destroy the finances of hate groups.
In six such lawsuits, the Montgomery, Ala.
, lawyer has never lost.
In 1987, Dees won a $7 million verdict against a Ku Klux Klan organization over the slaying of a 19-year-old black man in Mobile, Ala.
, forcing the group to turn over its headquarters building.
In 1990, he won $9 million in Portland, Ore.
, against the White Aryan Resistance in the beating death of a black man by neo-Nazi skinheads.
The Portland case is similar to the Keenan lawsuit, in that Dees argued that White Aryan Resistance founders Tom and John Metzger incited the skinheads to commit murder.
Dees has received death threats in the past, so the Southern Poverty Law Center will have its own security force to augment the tight security promised by Kootenai County authorities.
Butler is pastor of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, which holds that whites are the true children of God, that Jews are the offspring of Satan and that blacks and other minorities are inferior.
He presides over weekly services in a chapel where an Israeli flag is used as a doormat.
Over the years, his disciples have included some of the most notorious figures in the white supremacist movement, such as Robert Mathews, Randy Weaver and Buford Furrow, a former security guard at the Aryan Nations compound who is awaiting trial in Los Angeles on charges of killing an Asian-American postal carrier and shooting up a Jewish day care center last summer.
Butler, however, has been largely able to escape jail time.
In 1988 he was acquitted of federal charges that he was involved in a plot to overthrow the government.
People who study hate groups consider Butler a godfather of the white supremacist movement.
From his compound, which is valued at about $200,000 and has a sign out front that reads ''Whites only,'' Butler mails his literature, recruits followers and plays host to the annual Aryan World Congress, a skinhead symposium that often draws more than 100 acolytes.
The gathering is generally held on Adolf Hitler's birthday.
Butler said the possible loss of his home ''bothers me a little bit''.
He is appealing for defense funds from neo-Nazi sympathizers, writing on his Web site: ''We must not let the enemies of our race win this round''.
Six distributors of skinhead music are donating proceeds from the sale of CDs with titles like ''Too White for You,'' and ''Holocaust 2000''.
Vincent Bertollini, a wealthy former computer executive who lives in nearby Sandpoint, Idaho, sent a mailing to thousands of Idaho households last week attacking Dees as an ''anti-white, Jew supremacist''.
''Just think about it,'' Bertollini's mailing said.
''A Jew team of lawyers trying to destroy a white Christian church''.
Dees is not Jewish.
Opponents of the Aryan Nations are looking forward to seeing the group punished.
Bill Wassmuth, whose Coeur d'Alene home was once bombed by white supremacists, said it is important to hold leaders of hate groups responsible for the actions of their followers.
''Will a successful outcome eliminate hate groups in the Northwest?
No,'' Wassmuth said.
''Will it have an impact?
Most certainly.''

COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho _ Issuing a verdict that civil rights organizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest white-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a state jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan Nations to pay more than $6 million to the victims of an attack two years ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's compound near here.

COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) --A jury on Thursday awarded $6.3 million to a woman and her son who were attacked by Aryan Nations guards outside the white supremacist group's north Idaho headquarters.
The jury found that Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler, the group and its corporate entity, Saphire, Inc.
, were negligent in the selection, training and supervision of the security guards who assaulted Victoria and Jason Keenan two years ago.
The Keenans' attorney, Morris Dees, had asked the jury to award more than $11 million in punitive damages.
Dees, of the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center, has said he hoped the penalty would be severe enough to bankrupt the Aryan Nations.
The 82-year-old Butler spoke briefly outside the courtroom, comparing himself to some biblical figures and also declaring northern Idaho a haven for racists.
''This is nothing,'' Butler said.
''We have planted seeds.
Most of north Idaho now is filled with the people who escaped multiculturalism or diversity or whatever you want to call it''.
Jurors set $6 million as a punitive damage award, with $330,000 in compensatory damages to the Keenans, who were chased, shot at and assaulted after they stopped to search for a dropped wallet near the entrance to the Aryan Nations' compound.
Dees said he doesn't intend to allow the defendants to begin disposing of their assets.
''We intend to enforce this verdict.
We intend to take every single asset from the Aryan Nations now and forever,'' he said.
''We intend to even take the name Aryan Nations and hopefully, through the judicial process, close that sad chapter in this nation's history''.
Victoria Keenan, 44, spoke briefly, thanking the jury, her lawyers and her family.
''Without them, I don't think I could have done all this,'' she said.
Edgar Steele, who represents Butler and the Aryan Nations, said he will move for a new trial.
If that fails, he will appeal and may also seek to have the judgment amount reduced.
Butler would have to post a $9 million bond to appeal.
''I consider this area to be one of the last bastions of free speech in America,'' Steele said.
''You can write the epitaph for that now''.
The jury found Butler, the Aryan Nations and Saphire Inc.
90 percent negligent and liable for $4.8 million of the award.
Butler's chief of staff, Michael Teague, was found 10 percent negligent and liable for $600,000.
The former guards Jesse Warfield and John Yeager --who are serving prison terms for the assaults on the Keenans -- were also found liable for punitive damages.
Yeager was assessed $100,000 in punitive damages and Warfield $500,000 in punitive damages.
The jury also awarded Victoria Keenan $250,000 and Jason Keenan $80,000 in compensatory damages.
Steele blamed the two guards and argued Butler was not responsible.
Steele said that Warfield and Yeager were drunk --against regulations -- when they attacked the Keenans on the evening of July 1, 1998.
Warfield and Yeager, who represented themselves, took responsibility for the attack, but steadfastly refusing to implicate Butler.
They said they mistook a car backfire as gunfire from the Keenans and perceived a threat.
Steele said Butler preaches nonviolence, except in self-defense.
Butler tried to distance himself from the actions of Warfield, Yeager and a third former guard, whom he called unpaid volunteers.
The third former guard, Shane Wright, remains a fugitive.
Butler presides over the Church of Jesus Christ-Christian, which holds that whites are the true children of God, that Jews are the offspring of Satan and that blacks and other minorities are inferior.
His disciples have included some of the most notorious figures in the white supremacist movement, such as Robert Mathews, who founded a neo-Nazi offshoot of the Aryan Nations, and Buford Furrow, who is awaiting trial in Los Angeles on charges of killing an Asian-American postal carrier and shooting up a Jewish day care center last summer.

COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho _ Morris S.
Dees Jr.
, who has won a series of civil rights suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist groups in a campaign to put them out of business, came to court here Monday to try to seize the Aryan Nations compound that has nurtured white supremacists for more than 20 years.
In his suit here, Dees, a founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a woman and her son, both white, who were attacked by guards near the compound in July 1998.
The idea is that a large judgment will force the Aryan Nations to turn over the compound to the plaintiffs in payment.
The suit contends that not only the guards but also the Aryan Nations, its 82-year-old founder, Richard Girnt Butler, and his second in command, Michael Teague, should be held liable, on the ground that they run their security force in a negligent manner and encourage violence.
At the time of the assault, the guards said later, they thought they were under armed attack by militant Jews.
And in response to the suit's accusation that he encourages violence, lawyers for Butler maintain in court documents that ``demonizing Jews is still legal under the First Amendment''.
``It is still legal in this country to be a bigot,'' the defense says.
``It is still legal to hate.
Pastor Butler quite properly erects the twin defenses of both free speech and religion contained within the First Amendment''.
Two of the security guards, who pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the assault and are now in prison, are expected to be called as witnesses for the plaintiffs.
A third guard is a fugitive in the criminal case.
Jury selection began Monday morning in the Kootenai County Courthouse as members of a special police weapons unit patrolled the roof and the grounds and a sole Aryan Nations supporter marched on the sidewalk nearby, waving the group's black and red flag.
The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son Jason, now 21, told the police that they were driving home to the nearby town of Sand Point from her niece's wedding at dusk on July 1, 1998, playing music and having a good time.
Keenan said that her son had been in the Job Corps and that he threw his Job Corps card out the window on a whim and, inadvertently, his wallet along with it.
The wallet had been a gift from his grandfather, she said, so she turned her car around and drove back to look for it.
Her son got out with a flashlight and quickly found the wallet, she said, and that is when she realized that they were near the entrance to the Aryan Nations compound, in the community of Hayden Lake.
Keenan testified at a hearing that when she turned around, her 1977 Datsun had backfired, as it often did.
Inside the compound, Shane Wright, an Aryan Nations security guard, thought he heard a gunshot.
Seeing a car parked on the road, he and Jesse Warfield, then head of security, jumped into a pickup and began driving down the compound's long driveway.
John Yeager, a skinhead from California, leaped into the back of the pickup, armed with a semiautomatic rifle.
The Keenans fled, with the guards _ three or more in all _ pursuing them.
Yeager, Keenan told the police, fired five rounds from an assault rifle as the guards bore down on her car, screaming for her to pull over.
When a bullet flattened the Keenans' rear tire, their car slid into a ditch.
Their pursuers ran up to them.
Keenan said a man, later identified as Warfield, struck her with a rifle butt, grabbed her by the hair and screamed at her.
Other men tried to pull her weeping son out of the car, she said, striking him with a bat and the butt of a rifle.
A gun ``was pointed at me,'' Keenan told the authorities.
``It made me very scared.
I thought I was going to die''.
She begged them to leave her son alone.
After determining that the Keenans were unarmed, the men relented, explaining that they were doing so because both were white, she said.
Witnesses are expected to testify that as a result of the assault, Keenan and her son suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety.
In court documents, Edgar J.
Steele, a lawyer representing Butler, Teague and the Aryan Nations, pointed out that on the night of the attack, the volunteer guards made no effort to notify Butler of their actions.
``Wright, Yeager and Warfield were way out of bounds, and they knew it,'' Steele argued.
``One can only do so much''.
He said Dees and his legal team were trying ``to paint this ragtag band of borderline derelicts as a highly organized, well-trained and disciplined military organization''.
That, he said, would be ``laughable if not so patently preposterous''.
In the 27 years since he moved to northern Idaho from California, Butler and his organization have welcomed many white supremacists later convicted of violent crimes.
One of the best known, and a model for the Oklahoma City bomber Timothy J.
McVeigh, was Robert Mathews, who in 1983 formed a terrorist group known as the Order.
Mathews and members of his gang robbed armored cars, bombed a synagogue in Boise and assassinated Alan Berg, a Jewish talk-show host in Denver.
Mathews died in a siege by the FBI in 1984, and other members of the organization are serving federal prison sentences of 40 to 100 years.
Butler himself and 12 other white supremacist leaders were arrested in 1987 on federal sedition charges but were acquitted at trial in Fort Smith, Ark.
Mark Thomas, the leader of the Aryan Nations in Pennsylvania, confessed to being part of another terrorist group, the Aryan Republican Army, that in the mid-1990s robbed 22 Midwestern banks in an effort to finance a white supremacist revolution.
Over the last two decades, the Southern Poverty Law Center has taken the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups to court, starting with a successful suit against the Invisible Empire Klan, which in 1979 attacked a group of peaceful civil rights marchers in Decatur, Ala.
In 1987, the center won a $7 million verdict for the mother of Michael Donald, a black youth who had been lynched by members of the United Klans of America in Mobile, Ala.
The group was forced to turn its headquarters over to the victim's mother, and two Klansmen were convicted of criminal charges.
In 1989, the center won a large verdict against Klan groups and members for an assault on peaceful civil rights marchers in Forsyth County, Ga.
, on Jan.
17, 1987.
The Invisible Empire, the major Klan defendant, was forced to disband, and the group's office equipment went to the NAACP.
Lawyers for the center also sued Tom and John Metzger, founders of a group called the White Aryan Resistance, in 1990 after skinhead followers of theirs from Portland, Ore.
, killed Mulugeta Seraw, an Ethiopian student.
A jury awarded the victim's family $12.5 million.
MANNING, S.C.
_ An hour past midnight, pastor Jonathan Mouzon sped toward his country church as fast as his Chevy Lumina could carry him.
A section of sky glowed the orange of a fireball.
Two days earlier, the Ku Klux Klan had nailed a flier to the door of Macedonia Baptist Church.
A skull and crossbones on the white paper illustrated an ominous warning: ``KKK _ is watching you''.
No one would torch a house of God, not even the Klan, Mouzon thought.
By the time he pulled up, what looked like a tornado of fire swirled from the middle of the church roof.
Before sunrise, Macedonia's ashes joined the heap of more than 120 African-American church fires investigated in the South since 1995.
An uneasiness prevailed.
``You were constantly looking over your shoulder,'' said Mouzon, a shift supervisor for a security company.
So when a white lawyer from Alabama called offering to sue the Klan and win justice, some in the Macedonia flock were skeptical.
Doubters figured Morris Dees was out to make a buck on their tragedy.
Since co-founding the Southern Poverty Law Center in 1971, Dees has wielded the civil lawsuit like a buck knife, carving financial assets out of hate group leaders who inspire followers to beat, burn and kill.
He is convinced the best weapons to combat organized hate are a finely honed legal complaint and a fully loaded bank account.
Now in his legal firing line sits the Aryan Nations, a white supremacist group in Idaho.
On Jan.
25, the Montgomery, Ala.-based law center filed a lawsuit on behalf of a mother and son who allege they were assaulted and terrorized by its neo-Nazi members.
The goal is the same legal tactic that worked against the Klan: seizing the compound and other assets of leader Richard Butler.
Dees had something similar in mind for the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a group he said recruited throughout the Carolinas.
Eventually, leaders of the Christian Knights were convicted of civil conspiracy _ inciting the fire that destroyed Macedonia Baptist Church on June 21, 1995.
By the next summer, Macedonia stood again.
Tucked away in one of South Carolina's poorest counties, the church took out a $100,000 loan, built a single-story brick sanctuary and went into debt for the first time in Mouzon's 13 years as pastor.
Dees said he could win a multimillion-dollar civil judgment that would put the South Carolina Klan out of business.
Dees explained how he had won money damages against the Klan before _ one for $7 million in Mobile, Ala.
, another for $1 million in Forsyth County, Ga.
He told how he had protected Vietnamese fishermen in Texas from Klan intimidation.
``He was not this enormous person that you read about.
He was one of you,'' Mouzon said recently in the rebuilt church, its floors covered by carpet as red as Santa's suit.
Macedonia signed on.
As he does in all his cases, Dees charged the church nothing.
Last summer, his litigators and investigators secured a $37.8 million judgment against the Christian Knights of Ku Klux Klan.
Even after a court reduced the damages to $20 million, it remains the largest punitive damage ever imposed against a hate group.
The law center estimates it collects less than 2 cents on the dollar for every successful civil judgment.
All money realized from settlements is given to the victims.
What the lawsuits have done, even some Klan leaders have conceded, is make extremist activity a bad investment, diminishing the will of financial backers of alleged hate groups.
In most of the cases pursued by Dees, the defendants also have lost what little property they held.
SWAYED BY RECORD To persuade Macedonia Baptist elders, Dees told them about Beulah Mae Donald, the elderly mother of 19-year-old Michael Donald, who was hanged from a tree in downtown Mobile in 1981.
Then 64, the cleaning woman agreed to bring suit against the United Klans of America.
She wanted neither vengeance nor money.
She wanted justice for Michael.
Dees sought to destroy the corporate Klan.
Bank records showed the UKA had several thousand dues-paying members in 30 states.
Depositions and record searches unveiled corporate fronts designed to hide Klan ownership of a building used as headquarters in Tuscaloosa.
Former Klan members testified that UKA President Robert Shelton had encouraged violence against blacks.
The conspiracy trial lasted four days.
An all-white jury of six found United Klans of America liable and ordered it to pay $7 million to Beulah Mae Donald.
The UKA as a machine of hatred had been shut down.
``The Klan of yesteryear is dead,'' Shelton said in a 1995 interview.
``Society's changing.
You can't have parades with Klansmen in robes anymore.
... The public won't go along with it.
The Klan is gone.
It will never return''.
Donald received the deed to the Klan faction's $125,000 Tuscaloosa headquarters _ the closest she ever got to the $7 million awarded by the jury.
She sold the property for half its appraised value and bought her first house.
Donald died in 1988, a year after the trial.
ASSETS UNDER ATTACK Using civil suits, the Southern Poverty Law Center seizes whatever assets the targeted hate group owns _ although it never amounts to the millions of dollars that ring up headlines.
In military terms, Dees goes after command and control centers.
Mouzon's church eventually may get only $200,000, if that, the law center said, from the Christian Knights and Horace King, the South Carolina grand dragon found guilty of inciting the burning of the Macedonia Baptist Church.
That's only a penny on the dollar.
But it will put King on the street and, theoretically, the Klan out of business.
Hate groups are paying attention to Dees' tactics.
One white supremacist group, fearful of being sued by Dees, transferred its assets to another organization.
A federal court ruled in 1996 against the attempted evasion, and the law center now is trying to collect an $85,000 judgment.
A 1996 edition of the ``Florida InterKlan Report,'' a publication ``serving the Florida Klan cartel,'' focused on Dees' efforts in Manning.
The advice: disband immediately.
``The Klan will always be around under one name or another,'' the newsletter said.
``Don't appeal for defense funds.
Close your bank accounts.
Forget about lawyers''.
A CRUCIAL LINK But proving organized hate isn't as easy as showing pictures of flaming crosses to a jury.
Newsletters, and Web sites stewing in fiery rhetoric aren't enough for conviction.
The convincing tie-in comes when a former member of the group testifies against the Klan, linking rhetoric to violence.
In the case of King, the South Carolina grand dragon, the law center found in its database a video of him at a Klan march in Washington.
In the tape, shown to jurors, King talks about blacks and yells, ``If we had this garbage in South Carolina, we would burn the bastards out''!
On top of that, Klansmen testified that King encouraged them to burn black churches.
King postponed one church fire, fearing the Klan would be suspected.
King's attorney, Gary White of Columbia, S.C., relied on a First Amendment defense: Derogatory remarks about blacks are protected free speech.
``That's not an easy pitch to a jury,'' White said.
``It was ugly and inflammatory, but that's what the First Amendment is all about''.
White dismissed the notion that the judgment had a financial impact on the Christian Knights since King owns only ``a couple of acres and a small, run-down house on it''.
However, Richard Cohen, legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, argues that huge damage awards ripple down to Klan foot soldiers.
``The fact that he is likely to lose his home is probably not the kind of thing he would just shrug off,'' Cohen said.
``That's the kind of thing that has a lasting impact.
When you're going off to the Klan rally and you're saying goodbye to your wife, she's not real happy about the prospect that if you get involved with these people you may lose your home''.
Tactics questioned Collecting evidence that will convince juries of clear-cut conspiracies costs a bundle.
Dees estimates the Manning investigation cost nearly $100,000 _ $500,000 if attorney time had been charged.
Which is why the law center devotes so much to fund-raising.
From 1992 to 1997, it raised $102 million, according to its federal tax filings.
Seventy-four cents of every dollar raised came from more than 300,000 private contributors.
During the same time, the group spent $15 million on fund-raising _ more than 22 cents of every dollar consumed by total expenses.
In 1974, the law center started with an endowment of $72,775.
Its goal was to raise enough money to permanently fund its mission of helping minorities litigate against civil rights abuses.
In 1997, the endowment topped $90 million _ $89.6 million of it invested in equity securities.
The organization's net assets exceeded $97 million.
Located in the same block as Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, which was once pastored by the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
, the law center will begin construction next month of a $10 million, six-story expansion across the street from its headquarters.
Dees drew a $205,339 salary in 1996 as the center's chief trial counsel and chairman of its executive committee.
He contributed $19,458 to the employee benefit plan, according to the center's 1996 federal tax form.
Tom Turnipseed, a Columbia lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for South Carolina attorney general last November, helped Dees get in touch with Macedonia Baptist Church.
``Morris loves to raise money,'' said Turnipseed, a distant relative of Dees'.
``Some of his gimmicks are just so transparent _ but they're good.
He knows how to get people to give him the money''.
In a recent fund-raising letter, Turnipseed said, his return envelope came with ``about six different stamps.
It was like they had to cobble them all together to come up with 35 cents''.
Smaller civil rights groups, like the Center for Democratic Renewal in Atlanta, which started as the Anti-Klan Network, wonder why the law center needs so much money.
``It appears they're just sitting on it.
The community doesn't see the product,'' said Chris Freeman, a Center for Democratic Renewal researcher who relies on statistics from the Montgomery group.
``But the question is: Where are the funds going?
Their research is geared to groups like us, but there's nothing in the com- munity''.
The criticism turns to vitriol among hate leaders, who lob their bombast in newsletters and on the Internet.
Tom Metzger, head of the White Aryan Resistance, lost a $12.5 million suit in 1990 to Dees for inspiring the beating death of an Ethiopian immigrant.
He pays $845 a month to the victim's estate.
Less than affectionately, Metzger calls his nemesis ``Morris Sleaze''.
``Sleazy must be given credit where credit is due,'' Metzger once wrote.
``He has compiled the largest direct mail financial sucker list in the country''.
The core of the law center's program is ``Teaching Tolerance,'' a classroom program started in 1991.
A magazine that promotes ``interracial and intercultural understanding'' goes to more than 400,000 teachers.
The program features books, videos and posters costing up to $30 each.
The law center also funds a three-year, $100,000 civil rights litigation program in Georgia.
The program is designed to stem federal cutbacks in programs that had provided free legal assistance to poor people in civil actions.
Mouzon, the Macedonia pastor, said he doesn't begrudge the law center one cent.
``Not at all,'' he said, ``because we know firsthand what they do.
He knew we didn't have any money to accept representation''.
THEY TEND TO RUN As the afternoon sun pours a honey-colored glow into Young's Country Mart near Manning, pallet makers from a nearby mill buy quart bottles of Colt 45 malt liquor at the counter.
``Maybe a few of them graduated from high school,'' said Jesse Young, a trustee at Macedonia Baptist and a former deputy sheriff who runs the convenience store.
One of the regulars is Romeo Haley.
His brother is Arthur, a Klansman who testified against the real big shots _ Horace King and Virgil Griffin, the main defendants in the Macedonia fire.
Stopping in to buy gas and chicken tenders, Romeo Haley says race relations have stayed the same since the lawsuit.
``I don't think it's changed except that people have hid themselves and run.
Everybody that was in the Klan has run from the Klan''.
Haley said he ``never had no use'' for the Klan.
``They're just poor rednecks looking for some kind of cause,'' he said.
``They're fed up with the federal government, but they'll get scared and run in a minute.
There are people who planted the tree and fertilized the tree but when it bore fruit, they ran''.
Since the civil verdict, a healing spirit has touched Macedonia.
Mouzon plans a church picnic for his country community.
Timothy Welch, one of those convicted for setting the blaze, grew up in the area, climbing a pecan tree just outside the church and playing with church members' kids.
Mouzon sent him a letter saying no one in the church had grown to hate him.
Welch's mother, Wanda, has attended recent Sunday services.
Each time, she apologized to the congregation.
But there's no need, Mouzon said.
All is forgiven.
``We're trying to move past it,'' he said.
``It comes up occasionally.
But we're trying to forget''.
FINANCING LAWSUITS FOR THE POOR The Southern Poverty Law Center has accumulated enough wealth in recent years to embark on a major construction project and to have assets totaling around $100 million.
But the civil rights organization still spends most of its money on programs to help poor people.

Story Filed By Cox Newspapers For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) --The number of organized hate groups in the United States grew last year, mostly through new chapters of established white power organizations, the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a report released Tuesday.
The research group based in Mongomery, Alabama, said 474 hate groups and their chapters engaged in some form of racist behavior in 1997, The Associated Press reported.
The center used a different methodology to count the groups so previous numbers cannot be directly compared.
But if the old methodology had been used, the latest figures would represent a 20 percent increase from 1996.
Most of the newer groups, according to the center, come from a growth in the number of chapters of groups like the Ku Klux Klan and churches belonging to the Christian Identity movement, whose followers cite the Bible as the source for their racist views.
The growth in hate groups has been fueled by the Internet and rock music touting white power and advocating violence against minorities, the report said.
It said there are 163 Web sites that advocate racial hatred; less than three years ago, there was one.
The report said one chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, the American Knights, expanded from one to 12 chapters last year and that racist and neo-Nazi Skinheads made a violent comeback in Denver, Los Angeles and the Pacific Northwest.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, which was founded in the 1970s to battle racial bias, won major legal fights against the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups.
More recently it has been tracking hate crimes and the spread of racist organizations across the United States.
CHARLESTON, S.C.
(AP) --The city council has declared the Ku Klux Klan a terrorist group and condemned other hate groups as well in a resolution approved after an emotional debate.
The resolution was approved on a voice vote Tuesday after council members were assured it would not infringe on anyone's constitutional rights.
``The United States has a no-tolerance policy for terrorist organizations,'' said councilman Kwadjo Campbell.
``This is an unprecedented move, undoubtedly''.
Mark Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.
, said this may be the first municipality to designate the Klan a terrorist group.
The Southern Poverty Law Center represented the predominantly black Macedonia Baptist Church in Clarendon County, which won a $21.5 million judgment against the Christian Knights and Klan members after the church was burned four years ago.
The resolution only expresses the opinion of council and doesn't create law, city attorneys said.
If the Klan wants to march, they may apply for a permit.
Sponsor Wendell Gilliard had said when he first proposed the resolution that he wanted to prevent the Klan from holding rallies in the city.
It has been several years since the group marched in Charleston.
``This is not a black thing.
This is a human thing,'' Gilliard said.
``This is about race relations.
This is about saving lives''.
The resolution says Charleston welcomes diverse opinions ``but not those views that instigate fear, bias, bigotry and hate''.
It condemns any organization ``whose purpose is to encourage hate of any individual, race, religion, culture or way of life''.
Several council members were concerned the resolution could lead to lawsuits and a resumption of Klan marches.
``I would prefer letting the Klan die a natural death rather than cutting off their First Amendment rights,'' said Paul Tinkler.
Horace King, leader of the Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in South Carolina, refused to comment.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala.
_ A federal grand jury has been hearing evidence for more than a year in a 1963 racist bombing that killed four black girls in a downtown Birmingham church.
In Louisiana, the wife of one of the first black deputy sheriffs in a small parish met last month with a prosecutor who recently began re-examining the 1965 killing of her husband in an ambush.
And in Mississippi, a white man pleaded guilty this summer, and three others are to go on trial this week, in the 1970 killing of a black sharecropper who was beaten and found dead in a rural river.
Across the South, these and other unresolved, racially motivated killings of blacks from the civil rights era are under new scrutiny.
This fresh round of investigations into the long-ago killings, many of which had been ignored by authorities for years, was inspired by the well-publicized conviction in 1994 of an aging white defendant in the 1963 assassination of the Mississippi civil rights leader Medgar Evers.
For years, black community leaders and relatives of victims had complained about the lack of action in both the higher-profile and the lesser-known of these cases.
But recently their urgings have been taken more seriously, experts and historians say, because the South's political, social and legal climate has changed significantly since the era of the killings.
Blacks have steadily gained political power and have pushed for these cases to be heard before today's racially diverse juries.
At the same time, more witnesses, perhaps with less fear of retaliation and with heavy consciences they want to unburden, are coming forward.
And a new breed of prosecutors and investigators, feeling an urgency as many witnesses and defendants in the cases grow old, is realizing the important role that resolving these cases can play in the South's efforts to move beyond its past of racial hate and terrorism.
``In the South, we now have a black constituency that has political clout, and a white constituency that is not against these hatemongers being brought to justice,'' said David Sansing, professor emeritus of history at the University of Mississippi.
``And the black constituency, emboldened by new-found political power, is saying, `Justice delayed is justice denied, so let's quit denying this justice'.
Surprisingly, they are being met with sympathy from district attorneys''.
At least seven of these long-dormant cases are currently being re-examined in the South.
A few are before grand juries or are being prosecuted.
But some have only just begun to be reinvestigated and have had little national attention.
The officials pursuing these cases are mostly Southern and mostly white.
Most are in their mid-40s to early 50s.
A few have childhood memories of the crimes and of the violent reaction of the Ku Klux Klan to school integration and black voter registration.
But they all share some sense that the decades-old cases are still a stumbling block to the South's progress.
``These prosecutors,'' Sansing said, ``are realizing that they've got to do it now, rather than leave it unsettled forever''.
For instance, U.S.
Attorney Doug Jones, 45, a Birmingham native, was 9 when Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church, a center for civil rights activity in the 1960s, was bombed, killing the four girls.
As a law student in 1977 he skipped classes for a week to watch Bill Baxley, who was the Alabama attorney general, successfully prosecute the Klan leader Robert Chambliss for murder in the bombing.
Baxley chose not to prosecute other suspects at that time, in the hope that better cases could be developed against them later.
When Jones became a U.S. attorney in 1997, he pushed for the current grand jury investigation of others named in FBI files as suspects in the bombing.
``To be able to get back and reopen the case, and let the community know that it's not forgotten, that's important for everybody,'' Jones said.
``If you can bring it to closure, everyone can finish the healing process''.
Another reason the climate is better for pursuing these cases today, said Morris Dees, executive director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.
, is that the FBI, which investigated some of the cases when they occurred, is more cooperative than it was 30 years ago.
In the Birmingham case, for example, documents show that J.
Edgar Hoover, who was then the FBI director, prevented bureau agents from meeting with prosecutors to present the voluminous evidence they had collected.
Now it is the bureau that is leading the new investigation, along with Jones' office.
The re-examination of the Birmingham bombing was a result of meetings between local black religious and community leaders and local bureau officials in the mid-1990s.
Officials close to the case now would not discuss specific evidence, but have said there are no new suspects, only new information.
Still, there are hints at the direction in which the case is going.
Of the three other suspects named in the original FBI report, two are living: Tommy Blanton Jr.
in Birmingham and Bobby Frank Cherry in Texas.
According to a book on the bombing, ``Until Justice Rolls Down,'' by a Birmingham News reporter, Frank Sikora, witnesses quoted in FBI files had named Cherry as the one who placed the bomb at the church.
Blanton was said to have owned a car linked to the bombing.
Both men have maintained their innocence.
The bureau interviewed Cherry recently and some members of his family have appeared before the grand jury hearing the case.
Also appearing before the grand jury this summer were two white supremacists J.B.
Stoner and Robert Shelton.
Stoner was convicted in another church bombing in Birmingham and shared a prison cell with Chambliss.
Federal civil rights charges were used in the 1960s to convict a few suspects in these kinds of slayings, but the statute of limitations on those charges has run out in the Birmingham case as well as in all the other cases from that time.
Jones said that his office was looking into using a federal law with no statute of limitations concerning the transport of dynamite in the bombing.
He said there is also a possibility of using state murder charges, which have no statute of limitations, as was done in 1977 against Chambliss.
But murder was the charge in the successful conviction in 1994 in Jackson, Miss.
, of the former Klansman, Byron De La Beckwith, who shot to death Evers, the field secretary of the Mississippi National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,. The conviction came after two prosecutions of Beckwith ended in mistrials in the 1960s.
The case inspired the film ``Ghosts of Mississippi''.
``The Medgar Evers case was a wedge in the dam,'' said Dees of the law center, which keeps track of hate crimes and first called attention to many of the unresolved killings with racial links.
``It gave everyone a tremendous amount of hope''.
(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn That hope helped to stir the call for reopening the Birmingham case.
It also prompted the family of Vernon Dahmer in Mississippi to push for a trial in his 1966 killing.
In 1998, a former Klan leader, Sam Bowers, was convicted of the fire-bombing murder of Dahmer, the Hattiesburg NAACP president.
Inspired by those successes, other families have begun pushing in the past year for answers in some of the lesser-known, long-ago slayings linked to race.
``The South is still in the process of a cleansing moment with these cases,'' said Myrlie Evers-Williams, 66, widow of Medgar Evers and chairwoman emeritus of the NAACP.
``I'm so thankful that others who have suffered the same injustice as we did have moved forth.
To see that pebble dropped in the water and the ripples go out says something about justice in this country.
There is still hope''.
Still, not everyone is happy that these cases are back in the public spotlight.
Many prosecutors said they had been asked over and over why they wanted to stir up trouble.
``I'll hear it from white people on the golf course,'' said Bob Helfrich, 45, the assistant district attorney in Hattiesburg who prosecuted Bowers and plans to prosecute Charles Noble, another man charged in the Dahmer case, next spring.
``They say, `Haven't we spent enough money on this'?
I have blacks tell me not to mess with this, too.
It is costly.
But you can't put a price on justice''.
In Birmingham, at a recent ceremony at the 16th Street Church commemorating the victims of the bombing, police officers stood guard outside.
The church's pastor, the Rev.
Christopher Hamlin, said such vigilance is necessary because the church has continued to receive bomb threats, especially in the three years since the case was reopened.
Across the street from the church, on a recent sunny day, Ronald Roscoe, 47, a heating and air-conditioning technician, who is black, was spending his lunch break in Kelly Ingram Park, near the church's memorial to the four girls killed in the bombing.
A city gardener using a leaf blower reminded Roscoe of the images from three decades ago of police officers wielding fire hoses in the park to disperse civil rights protesters.
Referring to the reopening of the bombing case, Roscoe said: ``It's a waste of time.
I wish them luck, but after all this time I don't believe the guys who did the bombing are ever going to be convicted''.
Nearby, Shane Buggay, 32, an orthopedic surgeon, who is white, disagreed.
``If they can get them, then those men should pay,'' Buggay said.
``Time has nothing to do with it.
They are still trying to convict Nazis for war crimes from World War II.
It is just like that''.
But not all of the recently resurrected cases in the South have resulted in convictions.
In Belzoni, Miss.
, this summer one suspect was acquitted in the 1970 slaying of Rainey Pool, a one-armed sharecropper.
Another man, Joe Oliver Watson, pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the case this summer and is awaiting sentencing.
Three others are set to go on trial Wednesday on charges of murdering Pool.
In Montgomery, earlier this year, a grand jury failed to indict two suspects, both former Klansmen, in the 1957 slaying of Willie Edwards Jr.
, a black truck driver.
And officials in Philadelphia, Miss.
, despite urging from the families of the victims, are not saying publicly whether they are investigating or will try to prosecute in state court any of the 18 men indicted on federal civil rights charges in the slaying of three civil rights workers there in 1964.
Seven of those 18 were convicted on federal charges, including Bowers, but none has ever been tried by the state for the Philadelphia killings.
Baxley, the former Alabama attorney general who prosecuted the Birmingham bombing case in 1977, said some of the same problems he encountered 20 years ago still exist.
For instance, he said his main concern in 1977 was to show the jury that Chambliss, by then a frail 74-year-old, was once capable of killing four children.
``It worried me,'' Baxley said, ``that they would look at him and think how could this old man be a threat to anybody.
So we had to let the jury see that this is not a harmless old grandfather or uncle.
They had to see the evil in this man''.
Other major impediments to getting convictions are aging witnesses with failing memories, or key witnesses who have already died.
In some of the slayings, no case files exist and no transcripts from trials on federal charges exist, as they do in better-known cases like the Evers slaying, the killings of the Philadelphia, Miss.
, rights workers and the Birmingham church bombing.
Another hurdle in the Birmingham case in 1977 was that people remained afraid of retaliation from the Klan.
Two major witnesses, whose testimony Baxley believed might have helped convict others in the bombing, refused to testify.
These days, some of that fear persists, but it is far less potent.
In the Birmingham case this summer, the third of Cherry's five wives told reporters before her grand jury testimony that Cherry had admitted his involvement in the bombing and had bragged about it.
``Not all people remain the same all through their lives,'' said Joseph Lewis, 47, head of the Birmingham division of the FBI, which has been investigating the case since 1996.
``When they are getting close to their final days, they may say, `Well, it's time to clear my conscience before I meet my maker'.
That's what you hope for in cases like this.''
COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) --Northern Idaho, predominantly white and rural, has been home for nearly three decades to the racist Aryan Nations.
It has struggled with a reputation as a haven for hate.
But residents say a $6.3 million jury verdict returned Thursday against Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler and three of his followers for attacking two people near the sect's compound may be the first step toward rehabilitating the region's image.
''It's a small step for human rights, one giant step for Idaho,'' said Marshall Mend, a human rights activist whose home and business were allegedly targeted for firebombings by Aryan Nations members.
''The people of Kootenai County said, 'No more hate'.
I see it as being very, very positive,'' Mend said.
Morris Dees, the co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.
, and one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs, said he intended to enforce the judgment, taking everything the Aryan Nations owns, including its trademark name.
He even suggested turning the 20-acre Aryan Nations compound into a center for tolerance, teaching about the Holocaust.
But putting a hate group out of business isn't easy: While Dees has won significant civil judgments against the Ku Klux Klan and the White Aryan Resistance, the groups have survived.
Brian Levin, a California State University professor who has studied hate groups, said legal moves have damaged the groups but their strong ideology has proved as vital as funding.
''What lawsuits can't do is cripple a movement,'' Levin said, adding that racist organizations now focus on small cells of individuals, rather than larger, organized groups such as Butler's.
New technology, especially the Internet, also has allowed extremists to reach a much larger audience at less cost.
Some organizations also have their own wealthy patrons.
In Butler's case, Vincent Bertollini, a self-styled evangelist in the anti-Semitic 11th Hour Remnant Messenger of Sandpoint, offered to pick up the expenses.
Bertollini reportedly made millions in California's Silicon Valley before moving to northern Idaho to found his sect, which pays for mass mailings of Christian Identity tracts.
''The money is nothing.
It's the idea,'' Bertollini said after the verdict.
''What we are sending is a message.
I can do it in any city in the country.
The message is separatism''.
Butler, in fact, appeared confident after the verdict.
Outside the courtroom, the 82-year-old Butler said Idaho's Panhandle would continue to be a haven for racists.
Friday, he applied for a parade permit to march in downtown Coeur d'Alene either Oct.
15 or Oct.
28, said Julia Aho, deputy city clerk.
The application will be reviewed by police, who will consider security issues, and then turned over to city leaders for possible approval.
The group's parade in 1998 attracted about 100 followers and many more counter-demonstrators.
In 1999, fewer than two dozen marched.
Kootenai County has about 220 blacks in an estimated population of more than 100,000, Mend said.
He downplayed Butler's claims, saying only about 100 Aryan Nations members lived in the state.
While Butler has never been convicted of any crime, his group has attracted neo-Nazis, supremacists and separatists to the region.
Most notorious of these groups was The Order, a violent offshoot that embarked on a nationwide crime spree in the 1980s, including armored car robberies and the slaying of Jewish talk show host Alan Berg in Denver.
Most of the group's followers are in jail and its leader was killed during a 1984 shoot-out with the FBI.
In this week's case, jurors found that Butler, his organization and its corporate entity were negligent in the selecting and overseeing security guards who assaulted Victoria and Jason Keenan in 1998.
The Keenans were chased, shot at and assaulted after they stopped to search for a dropped wallet near the entrance to the Aryan Nations' compound.
Jurors set $6 million as the punitive award.
''They wanted to bury the whole Aryan Nations,'' Judy Jacobson said of her fellow jurors.
The 45-year-old carpet layer said she and two other jurors prevented the panel from awarding a much higher judgment.
''They wanted to get the Aryan Nations out of the country,'' she said.
''I'm not going to force this guy out of his property and his home, just because you don't believe in his beliefs.''
How deep is the hatred?
After being sentenced to death in Jasper, Texas, last week, John William King was asked if he had anything to say to the relatives of his victim, James Byrd Jr.
, a 49-year-old black man who was chained to a pickup truck and dragged along a country road until his body literally was torn apart.
King, a 24-year-old white supremacist, did have something to say.
Grinning, he assured all within earshot that Byrd's grieving survivors were welcome to perform a sex act on him.
Most Americans would like to believe that the attack on Byrd was an aberration, that it was so far over the top, so sick and inhumane, that it should not be viewed as representative of a much larger societal problem.
The reasoning is more or less as follows: The vast majority of Americans were repelled by the murder, arrests were made quickly, and the legal steps toward the ultimate societal sanction already are being taken.
Let's move on.
That attitude presupposes that race hatred and other forms of prejudice and intolerance in America are not nearly as deep or as dangerous as the attack on Byrd might suggest.
A long litany of tragedies tells us otherwise.
Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college student in Wyoming, died last fall after he was kidnapped, robbed, tied to a fence, beaten in the head with a.357 Magnum, tortured with cigarettes, taunted as he wept and begged for his life, and finally left alone and helpless in near-freezing temperatures.
Authorities said he was murdered, at least in part, because he was gay.
A recent report from the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.
, which tracks hate crimes and hate groups across the country, is filled with other horrible examples that occurred last year.
In February, the report said, a dark-haired young woman named Amy Robinson was abducted in Fort Worth, Texas, and murdered by two white men who used her for target practice.
They were reported to have burst out laughing when she died.
The original plan, according to one of the men, was ``to go out and shoot black folks''.
Ms. Robinson was chosen because the men thought she was biracial.
They were mistaken.
Ms. Robinson was, in fact, white.
In October in Buffalo, N.Y., a group of black teen-agers attacked a 41-year-old white man, Gary Trzaska, as he was walking to his car.
Trzaska, who was gay, was beaten and stomped to death.
Witnesses said they saw the teen-agers jumping high in the air so they could land on Trzaska's head with both feet.
They said the boys appeared gleeful.
Last spring a group of whites ``armed with brass knuckles and chanting `white power''' attacked Lance Cpl.
Carlos Colbert, a 21-year-old black Marine, as he left a party in San Diego, Calif.
As many as 30 men joined in the assault.
Colbert was not killed, but his neck was broken.
He is paralyzed from the neck down.
Last May a racially charged exchange in a bar led to the murder of Mark Dale Butts, a 35-year-old white man.
He was beaten to death in a cemetery in Victor, Colo.
, by a group of black men and teen-agers.
A shovel was used in the attack.
Authorities said Butts was beaten so hard the handle of the shovel eventually broke.
Morris Dees, the chief trial counsel of the Law Center, said he is surprised by what appears to be the increasing frequency and viciousness of such attacks.
They are being committed by whites and blacks, he said.
Much of the hatred is fueled by the growing number of organized hate groups and the proliferation of Internet sites devoted to racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia and other forms of intolerance.
The desire to turn away from a crime as grotesque as the murder of James Byrd in Jasper, Tex.
, is understandable.
Once justice is done, what's the point of wallowing in the hideousness of the crime?
But there is a need to understand the rage and the frustrations and the impulses that lead so many to mayhem in the name of some warped sense of superiority, or inadequacy, or fear, or whatever.
Dragging someone to his death behind a truck may be unusual.
But torturing, maiming and killing people because they fit a certain despised profile is an everyday occurrence.

BRITAIN-RACE _ LONDON _ The 600-page report on the 1993 murder of a17-year-old black man named Stephen Lawrence in 1993 places the spotlight on the treatment of blacks in London and the rest of Britain, and is being described as the first shot in a revolution in race relations.
The report makes damning criticisms of the metropolitan London police, pointing out, perhaps for the first time in Britain, institutional racism.
It calls for widespread reform throughout government and highlights a rarely discussed problem in modern British society.
The investigation was so marred from the start that the five men accused of the crime will probably never be punished.

_ An hour past midnight, pastor Jonathan Mouzon sped toward his country church as fast as his Chevy Lumina could carry him.
A section of sky glowed the orange of a fireball.
Three days earlier, the Ku Klux Klan had nailed a flier to the door of the Macedonia Baptist Church.
A skull and crossbones on the white paper illustrated an ominous warning: ``KKK _ is watching you''.
By the time he pulled up, what looked like a tornado of fire churned from the middle of the church.
Before sunrise, Macedonia's ashes joined the heap of 400 other black churches burned from 1993 to 1996.
So when a white lawyer from Alabama called offering to sue the Klan and win justice, some in the Macedonia flock were skeptical.
Doubters figured Morris Dees was out to make a buck on their tragedy.
But since co-founding the Southern Poverty Law Center in 1971, Dees has wielded the civil lawsuit like a Buck Knife, carving financial assets out of hate group leaders who inspire followers to beat, burn and kill.
Now in his legal firing line is the Aryan Nations, a white supremacist group in Idaho.

It's been six years since Sinead O'Connor earned a permanent place in the Hall of Fierce when she shredded a photograph of Pope John Paul II, and intoned, ``Fight the real enemy,'' on ``Saturday Night Live''.
Sure, she evoked the wrath of Catholics, including a hypocritical Madonna.
But it was a refreshingly candid moment in an industry lousy with pretense.
Here was a beautiful woman who desexualized herself by shaving her head, a fiesty zealot with the voice of an angry angel forever raging against the machine.
She championed Public Enemy, flipped off the Grammys, and was threatened by Frank Sinatra for boycotting the Star-Spangled Banner.
Her actions were so jaw-droppingly over, it was hard not to admire their raw loopiness, though they overshadowed her talent and undermined record sales.
Now 31 and twice a mother, O'Connor seems a bit less prickly.
In the current &UR; Spin &LR;, O'Connor, on the road this suumer as part of the Lilith Fair, tells writer Chris Norris she has few regrets about actions which brought her grief in the past.
``I respect myself for being the age that I was and having this passion and integrity that I did have,'' she says.
``I can say about the Pope thing, I'm very proud of that and I stand by it and I would do it again.
Quite a lot of the other things _ like the national anthem and the Grammys _ I wouldn't do now because they're just (expletive) young moody (expletive)''.
Likewise, she has little regard for you musical descendants whose rage seems more like a fashion accessory.
``I suppose it bothers me that people like them have sold a lot more records than I ever sold.
They don't cause trouble and they play a game.
They're not controversial in any way''.
Speaking of playing games, is Jesse Camp for real?
Is Camp, anointed the newest idiot in MTV's village after beating 4,000 others in the network's ``I Wanna Be a VJ'' contest in April, really the lovable geek-stoner he claims to be or is he pulling one of his wool leg warmers over our eyes?
It seems like it may be the latter.
His dad, J.
Holden Camp, chairman of the humanities department at the University of Hartford, tells Spin his son, whose real name is Josh, ``is a good sweet kid who has created a bit of a facade.
He did well in school, and he had a lot of fun with drama''.
Looks like he still is.
&QL; ---- &QC; &QL; &UR; P.O.V.
&LR;, &UR; &LR; the men's magazine which is Details without urban cool or female readership, continues to genuflect to the guilt-free guyness which (thankfully) hasn't been on public display since Frank, Dean, and Sammy rampaged through the Sands Hotel.
You can practically smell aftershave on every page.
So in addition to a vodka primer _ Ketel One gets a A+ for its ``exceptionally clean finish _ there's Scott Bindley's entertaining mini-opus, ``In Defense of Bachelorhood''.
According to Bindley, married life can be can be a soul-sucking morass of soggy diapers, minivans, and sex as often as the World Cup.
Hence, men should be live it up as bachelors.
Singledom, he says, means more time and money for a cool sports car, titanium golf clubs, and a satellite dish which can get every sporting event from Little League to logrolling.
But Bindley is quick to say everything he writes ``is predicated on the belief that the bachelor existence should be temporary.
We are not advocating starting up a local chapter of Spanky and Alfalfa's He-Man Women-Haters Club''.
&QL; --- &QC; &QL; The women of &UR; Bust &LR; seem like they couldn't care less if they make men uncomfortable.
This smart New York-based quarterly is dedicated to celebrating all things female, and if the boys can't handle it, well, they don't have to go home, but they've got to the heck the out of here.
In short, chicks rule.
This month's edition is the Girlfriends issue, an ode to those faithful women who help us through our lives, those who are the Marys to our Rhodas, the Lavernes to our Shirleys.
There's Donna Lovell's too-true feature, ``Six Reasons Why Your Girlfriend is Better Than a Boyfriend,'' and ``Bosom Buddies,'' a funny meditation of the best girlfriends of all time, including Lucy and Ethel, Cagney and Lacy, Patsy and Edina of the late great ``Absolutely Fabulous''.
&QL; --- &QC; &QL; For nearly a decade, Queen Latifah, the first lady of hip-hop, has been bobbing and weaving questions about whether she prefers princesses to princes in her queendom.
Speculation on her sexuality only intensified after she played a lesbian bank robber in the 1996 urban caper ``Set It Off''.
So in the current issue of &UR; The Source, &LR; she pumps ``Order in the Court,'' her first CD in five years, and gives a shout-out to the late Biggie Smalls.
Mostly, though, she talks about those rumors.
``I have no problems with my sexuality, whatever you wanna think I am,'' the woman born Dana Owens tells writer Amy Linden.
``I'll never answer the question.
I'd rather have you die wanting to know.
You can assume whatever you want.
I'm me.
I'm not ashamed of who I am, and who I sleep with is nobody's businesses''.
Which is very similar to what George Michael used to say before he came out earlier this year _ not that there's anything wrong with that.
In the same issue, Morris Dees, leader of the Southern Poverty Law Center, gets an unwarranted slap in the MediaWatch column.
Dees has always gotten props for dropping dimes on the hateful activities of such groups as the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nation.
But then Dees added the Nation of Islam to SPLC's list of hate groups.
Writes Brett Johnson, ``If you want to make friends and influence people in the 'hood, dissing (Louis) Farrakhan and the Nation is not the place to start''.
Perhaps. But since Farrakhan has made anti-Semitic remarks, as well as homophobic and misogynistic comments, he belongs on Dees's list.
So to the Source, that slap is right back at 'cha.
LOS ANGELES _ A judge has declined to order a reporter to provide prosecutors and defense lawyers with notes and tape recordings of an interview with a defendant in a racially charged murder trial.
An FBI agent testified that the reporter told him that the defendant, Randall Lee Rojas, had admitted committing a murder in 1995.
He identified the reporter as Trish O'Kane, who writes for Intelligence Report, a magazine of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group in Montgomery, Ala.
Lawyers for two of Rojas' co-defendants, Ritch Bryant and Jessica Colwell, sought the material as evidence that their clients had no hand in the Nov.
25, 1995, beating death of a black man, Milton Walker Jr.
In a hearing on Oct.
27, Judge Lance A.
Ito of the Los Angeles Superior Court said the interview contained ``nothing close to being exculpatory'' for the defense.
He noted the material would assist the prosecution's case, but found the evidence was available through other means and that there was no need to pierce California's shield law, which essentially protects reporters from being compelled to provide evidence to the government.
The Southern Poverty Law Center tracks hate groups, and Intelligence Report covers right-wing extremists.
Rojas' lawyer, Donald Calabria, questioned how Ms.
O'Kane had entered the Los Angeles County Jail without filling out required media forms and had interviewed his client without his knowledge.
Judge Ito noted that a Los Angeles sheriff's department investigator helped arrange the interview and even participated, posing questions for Rojas.
Ms. O'Kane disclosed a portion of the interview to an FBI agent about a month later, though her editor, Mark Potok, said in an interview that the disclosure was inadvertent and that the magazine's reporters do not collaborate with law enforcement authorities.
ATLANTA _ Sixteen-year-old Bryan Taylor wants to be a singer when he graduates from East Point's Tri-Cities High School (Ga.), kind of like the guy who is the falsetto in Boyz II Men.
But he didn't have a clue about how to get from singing around the house to the cover of a compact disc _ until Tuesday.
Taylor was one of 700 students from 21 metro high schools who got a crash course in how to break into the music business at Grammy in the Schools, a daylong seminar sponsored by the Atlanta chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (the folks who bring us the Grammys).
Students, chosen by teachers and counselors for their interest in music, got to hear from some of the city's top industry insiders, such as producer Rico Wade (Outkast, Goodie Mob), engineer Phil Tan (Usher, Mariah Carey, TLC, Jermaine Dupri) and video producer Fred Taylor (``The Dip'').
The hard-work message was fairly consistent: ``You can't just buy a keyboard and make money; you may have to cut some grass,'' advised Wade.
But panelists also helped students understand what the word business means when it comes to making music.
``A lot of times, all they see is the glamour side of the business, but they don't see all the work,'' said Charles Driebe, an Atlanta entertainment lawyer.
As students realized they were brushing shoulders with heavy hitters, hands shot up throughout the Rialto Center for the Performing Arts.
``How do I copyright a song I've written''?
``Why does a musician need an attorney''?
``I want to be a gospel singer, but how do I get started''?
Students also were able to attend sessions on songwriting, composition, artist management, interactive media, entertainment law, publishing and public relations.
With his black cashmere coat, shaved head and cast of famous friends, Wade captured most of the attention, which seemed to be a bit of a deja vu experience for the hot young producer.
``It's inspiring to look out there and see these kids, because they look just like me,'' he said, recalling his childhood as an aspiring musician in southwest Atlanta.
``They are imagining and dreaming, just like I was when I was that age.
It makes me feel like I have a purpose in life''.
Wade also ended up giving Bryan, the sophomore from Tri-Cities, the tryout of his life.
``Can you sing''? the producer asked from the stage, after Taylor asked how to get ``discovered''.
Bryan shouted back yeah, grabbed a microphone and belted out Jagged Edge's ``I Got to Be'' as students gave him a roaring response.
``I've never sung in public before,'' Bryan said after the session.
``But I've learned that it's not just the singing.
You've got to work and get an education too''.

PORTLAND, Ore.
(AP) --Oregon, with the nation's fastest-growing economy and highest SAT scores, is hardly a place where you would expect a school funding crisis.
Yet many schools have overflowing classes, outdated textbooks, insufficient supplies and cuts in arts and sports.
The Lebanon School District has boarded up one school because there's no money for repairs, and classes are held in trailers, said Superintendent Jim Robinson.
``Anybody who doubts that there is a problem should go spend a day in a classroom,'' said Gov.
John Kitzhaber, who has been pushing for a major boost in school funding.
``You've got kids trying to learn algebra in classes of 40 students.
This isn't the kind of system we want our kids to learn in''.
The problem evolved over the past decade as voters slashed property taxes at the same time academic standards were being toughened.
Lincoln High School, on the edge of Portland's downtown, has cut all music programs.
Cellos and basses gather dust in a corner of a music room that is now a humanities classroom, with two teachers for 86 students.
``There are so many students that the teachers discourage people from writing papers,'' said graduating senior Paul Susi.
``They don't have time to read 86 papers''.
``Economically this country is at the peak of its game,'' Susi said.
``How is it that when we are the most prosperous and successful that we can't find out how to adequately fund our own schools''?
Property tax limits passed by voters during the 1990s largely left the state in charge of funding schools.
The state now pays about 80 percent of local schools' costs, compared with 30 percent before the tax limits.
Per-student spending has increased, but hasn't kept up with inflation.
And with statewide enrollment climbing 15 percent during that time --542,000 children now attend public schools -- classrooms are becoming more crowded.
The state school boards association says class sizes have increased from about 23 students to the 25- to 27-student range.
Margaret Johnson, who has three boys attending Astor Elementary in Astoria, said her son Max struggled through first grade because there were 31 children in his class.
``There was just too much distraction in that classroom to allow him to focus all day,'' she said.
The chief sponsor of one property tax limit measure passed in 1990, activist Don McIntire, said school administrators who complain about tough times are crying wolf.
``Eighty-five percent of the cost of schools is pay, perks and pensions,'' he said.
``The squeeze isn't coming from belt-tightening.
School budgets are getting fatter faster than we can punch new holes in the belt''.
McIntire said raises have boosted the average Oregon teacher's salary to $42,300.
Nationally, all teachers averaged $39,347 in the 1997-98 school year, according to a study released earlier this month by the American Federation of Teachers.
Oregon was 13th on that list, with an average of $42,301 that year; Connecticut ranked first, at $51,727.
In addition to large class sizes, there is a lack of up-to-date teaching materials, said Bonnie Elliott, who has taught for 30 years in the Bend-LaPine School District.
``Walk into the average classroom, and you'll see a MacIntosh computer that's 12 years old,'' she said.
And teachers say Oregon's cumulative average SAT score of 1,056 is deceptive because it reflects what today's older students learned years ago, not what younger kids are learning now.
Marcy Matsuo said she spends $1,000 a year of her own money to buy books and other supplies for her elementary classes at Portland's Smith School.
``I don't like to constantly be begging parents for money,'' Matsuo said.
``We have the `Run for the Arts,' scrip sales, coupon books, a hoop shoot, gift wrap for sale, a school auction, a carnival, painted clay pots for sale.
... I think parents have reached their limit.''
LOS ANGELES _ Merchant Street is a tattered row of produce warehouses and auto body shops, its littered sidewalks and cracked street home to the poor and to drug addicts.
This is not a pretty part of town, but here in the heart of what is known as skid row is a jewel.
At the back of an asphalt parking lot, in a wall decorated with dancing colored letters, a door gives a view into a charming urban courtyard.
A cheerful ceramic fountain amid ripening orange trees and palm trees is covered in hand-painted hearts, fruits, flowers and birds.
Youngsters often clean their paintbrushes under the spray.
Running almost the length of the courtyard is the glass front facade of a large, bow-trussed building.
On any given day, a circle of children sits inside, absorbed in painting self-portraits.
This is Inner City Arts, a nonprofit arts school that is both an enlightened model for arts education and a design landmark where education is embellished by architectural example.
Inner City Arts, founded in 1989, provides visual and performing arts classes and English language instruction to students from public elementary schools _ largely the offspring of immigrants from Mexico and Central America who work in the local garment and manufacturing industries.
The school was founded by Bob Bates, an artist and teacher, and Irwin Jaeger, a Beverly Hills real estate investor who decided there had to be more to life, as he put it, ``than working, taking vacations and going to charity dinners''.
Their aim was to fill a void in arts education created by Proposition 13, a property tax cut initiative approved 20 years ago this month by California voters that slashed financing for public services and schools.
In the year following the passage, said Beth Tishler, the school's executive director, virtually ``all arts curriculum was eliminated from the public schools''.
There are now more than 200 nonprofit arts programs in Los Angeles, many considered excellent, but Inner City Arts is rare in that it boasts, in its converted 8,000-square-foot auto body shop, an inspiring home, where the architecture elevates the social and arts-education experiences.
The building, officially called the Mark Taper Center/Inner City Arts, was designed by Michael Maltzan Architecture, in collaboration with Marmol &AMP; Radziner Architecture and Construction.
Maltzan, a protege of Frank Gehry and the project architect on the Disney Concert Hall planned for downtown Los Angeles, said that he felt compelled ``to do something'' after the city's 1992 riots and that he did the work pro bono.
``L.A. was my adopted city,'' he said.
``To see it rip itself apart was devastating''.
At the school, what the architects accomplished is a building that is expansive, airy _ with light pouring in through its vast window wall _ and bold in its sculptural forms.
The plan, described by Maltzan as ``a village of objects'' around a central courtyard, affords views from one area to another _ ``limitless horizons,'' Maltzan says _ as well as flexibility: spaces are constantly used in different ways.
The design is also an object lesson in construction.
Children study the raw surfaces _ the unadorned brick walls, the timber frame partly clad in plasterboard, the exposed trusses, the industrial roll-up garage doors.
They draw inspiration for their own drawings and paintings from the strong, simple shapes.
``Kids use the building as material for some of their art projects,'' Ms.
Tishler said.
``They talk about how the building was put together, the ways in which they contribute to the changing and molding of the building''.
Many children live in lamentable conditions in apartments for transients or in housing projects.
``I love it _ it's big''; ``it's fun''; ``it has pictures all around,'' were some reactions of a group of 7-year-olds on a recent visit.
Nick Estrada, 18, a former pupil and now a volunteer there, said, ``Inner City Arts is my home''.
Having started with 300 children from one school, Inner City Arts now caters to 8,000 children annually from 11 public schools who attend classes twice a week for six weeks.
More schools are clamoring to be included.
In 1994, the school moved from two temporary bungalows to its current premises, at 720 South Kohler Street (one entrance is off Merchant Street).
It has bought two adjacent industrial buildings and intends to triple in size, with plans that include animation studios.
The school _ now backed by an impressive list of donors, like the National Endowment for the Arts and the Mark Taper Foundation, which supports, among other things, social services and the arts _ has a unique relationship with the Los Angeles Unified School District.
The district provides transportation and security and has helped the school create a program for teaching English through art.
``This private-public partnership is a national model,'' said Leticia Quezada, a past president of the Los Angeles Board of Education.
``The quality of the arts experience the children are receiving is phenomenal, 400 percent better than it would be in the school classroom.
There's a sense of confidence in the arts experience those children are getting, and we want to see it extended to other schools''. nn
ZHENGZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) --Every weekend, students in Zhengzhou can take in a free concert, a traditional Chinese opera or a stage play in the city's Youth and Children's Palace, as part of a project to improve the younger generation's education in the arts.
The project was launched by the city government three months ago for students in local colleges, middle and primary schools.
Zhengzhou is the capital city of central China's Henan Province.
One concert featured the Henan Philharmonic Orchestra playing works by Beethoven, Chopin and Bizet.
During the evening, the young listeners were told how the different instruments work, given information about each composer and taught how to appreciate a symphony.
The sponsors of these activities hope that by providing young people access to classical music and opera, and dramatic works, they will turn away from the influence of vulgar art performances.
The "music and drama" weekends have also helped nurture civilized manners and moral conduct in young people, sources said.
BEIJING, August 17 (Xinhua) --Primary and middle schools across China will be equipped with more and better educational instruments as part of the drive toward higher-quality education.
Linguistic labs, computer labs, and specialized classrooms for other practical skills will be created in these schools, along with libraries and facilities for music, the arts, and physical education.
The Ministry of Education has required localities to further increase investment in educational technologies, and to guarantee that the investment grows annually.
The bulk buying of educational equipment in areas where conditions are ripe should be done by public bidding, in order to set up a sound operational and monitoring system.
The Ministry also has asked localities to map out plans for modern educational technology outfitting and to strengthen administration.
A large gap remains in the level of modern educational material between large- and medium-sized cities and many rural areas in China.
Computers, the Internet, and multi-media education have become standard components of school life for many primary and middle school students in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.
Students in poorer areas, however, may still be doing their homework bending over an earthen bed in the dim light of a kerosene lamp.
Gift-giving seasons come and go, but gloomy reports about the state of the educational system appear to be as eternal as a holiday fruitcake.
Fortunately, a slew of new online and off-line arts-education resources has arrived to help alleviate the latest slice of bad news.
The current generation of schoolchildren is close to being arts-illiterate, according to a recent study by the National Center for Education Statistics.
The survey of eighth graders found that fewer than one in four attend schools where dance or theater is offered, and only 25 percent could pick out a Cubist work from among four paintings.
(The nation seems to be training a population of bad guessers, too).
Secretary of Education Richard W.
Riley said the study ``verifies that most American children are infrequently or never given serious instruction or performance opportunities in music, the arts or theater.
That's wrong''.
What's right is that an increasing number of educators are using technology to interest children in the arts, just as their colleagues continue to strive to use computers to teach the basics of reading, writing and 'rithmetic.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology said last week that it would spend $27 million to add a new children's center to its famed Media Laboratory.
Areas of research will include new digital techniques for music, dance, storytelling and the visual arts.
Arts education is important, and technology will be an essential element in that educational process, said Mitchel Resnick, an associate professor at MIT who is involved in planning for the children's center.
``A lot of the richest learning experiences come when people are involved in designing, creating and expressing, and generally there aren't enough of those experiences in the lives of children,'' he said.
``The children of today, who have become very fluent with new technologies, are actually more poised to become expressive with those technologies than previous generations''.
Resnick continued: ``If all you have is modeling clay and finger paints, you can express yourself in some ways, but it's limited.
We want to make digital technologies that are extensions of modeling clay and finger paints, that provide a wider range of expressiveness''.
At least one intriguing program is already under development at MIT: the composer Tod Machover is creating a Toy Symphony that will allow children to perform on newly designed electronic instruments such as the ``squeeze tuba'' and the ``musical bug jar''.
The MIT children's center is scheduled to open in 2003, but two other high-tech learning centers devoted to the arts have already opened their doors.
The new Zeum, an art and technology center for children that opened on Oct.
31 in San Francisco, has an airy gallery for interactive art.
Those who ascend the 34,000-square-foot structure's Guggenheim-inspired spiral ramp --a skateboarder's dream -- will discover a digital production studio that gives a crew of children 30 minutes to assemble a short video, using visuals, sounds and graphics of their own devising.
Ultimately, the videos will be sent out over the Web; at the moment, an archive of recent creations can be accessed.
The idea of making a video might seem a bit dated, but Sheila Bergman, Zeum director, said, ``We're planting a seed here,'' and indicated that future programs will be more digitally focused.
Already, the arts center is leading Web-authoring sessions for teens.
In September, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra unveiled ECHO, an interactive music-learning center nestled in the ensemble's extensively renovated performance complex.
In the A-Musing Room, young visitors plug their hand-held ``instrument boxes'' into a computer system that introduces them to such musical basics as rhythm and pitch.
Many new digital arts-education resources can be experienced at home.
The composer Morton Subotnick has just premiered ``Making More Music,'' a CD-ROM that provides more advanced exercises than the fundamentals found in its highly regarded predecessor, ``Making Music''.
At the disk's core are two areas, ``Rhythm Band'' and ``Chamber Music,'' that enable aspiring composers to draw marks on a page of on-screen sheet music.
The marks can then be converted into standard musical notation and, more important, audible sounds.
Hearing them produces a magic moment akin to watching a page of photographic paper bloom into an image in the darkroom.
The disk's graphic design is dorky, but this and other quibbles are quickly overcome by the sonic results, which mostly sound pretty good, even when a string of random marks is drawn on the score.
The Web is also acting as a canvas for several noteworthy arts-education ventures.
ArtsConnectEd, a joint project of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and its neighbor, the ever-progressive Walker Arts Center, was quietly launched last month and is still in its early stages in terms of supplying teachers with lesson plans and other valuable tools.
But there is already much fun to be had.
The student-activities section of the ``For Your Classroom'' area has a toy chest's worth of interactive, art-themed games that range from the rudimentary (``Color Your Cabin'') to the highly sophisticated (``Private/Public Space,'' a tutorial in contemporary sculpture).
``People don't always know they're interested in the (art) object,'' said Kathy Halbreich, the Walker's director.
``One of the things that ArtsConnectEd begins to do is tie the object into a variety of life experiences.
There's so many stories there, there's so many opportunities to be charmed by discovery''.
The Museum of Modern Art in New York has a smaller-scale but similar program in the works.
``Art Safari,'' scheduled to be launched Dec.
12, will provide interactive exercises like a Java-enabled area for making collages.
However, a recent addition to the ``Exhibitions'' area of the MOMA site is likely to appeal mostly to adults: an animated how-to that supplements the museum's display of Joan Miro's ``Black and Red Series'' etchings.
Behind each of these high-tech teaching tools, there is an educational vision.
And that, said MIT's Resnick, is perhaps the most essential element of all.
``Just the fact of getting a lot of technology out there will not necessarily do anything for the arts,'' he said.
``In fact, without active effort, it won't be productive at all.
You can put all the finger paints in the world out there in kindergarten, and that's not necessarily going to lead to great artists''.

FUZHOU, January 5 (Xinhua) --A school in the western part of east China's Fujian Province has been set up to provide more qualified professionals, and sports, arts, and music teachers for primary and middle schools in rural areas.
More than 3,000 graduates from the Longyan Overseas Chinese Professional School, in the city of Longyan, are playing an important role in rural and coastal parts of Fujian and in Southeast Asia.
The school has a new series of courses on hydropower, electronics, architecture, building materials, electric appliances, tourism, computers, accounting, law, public relations, and practical English to meet the local economic and industrial development needs.
More than 100 students have won national or provincial prizes in a number of fields and all graduates have to pass tests and examinations.
To improve teaching conditions and facilities, the school has gotten funds in a number of ways, and has spent 10 million yuan, half of which came from overseas Chinese who were born in the city, on 30,000 sq m of rooms for a teaching center, teachers' hall, library, and technology and arts center.
It has also put a million yuan into a computer network with 200 computers for a number of key departments, workshops and labs.
While many public schools, struggling under budget constraints and competing academic interests, are marginalizing arts programs, if not eliminating them altogether, the opposite is happening in the small village of Greenport at the tip of the North Fork on Long Island.
Early next year, under the leadership of David Kapell, the mayor of Greenport since 1994, a new program will bring classical music to the 600 students in the town's single public school.
Kapell's support for classical music comes not just from his belief in the value of the arts but also from his personal history.
He is the son of the pianist William Kapell, who died in a plane crash in 1953 when he was just 31 and at the peak of acclaim.
At the time, David Kapell was 4.
Kapell's mission has been aided by another Greenport resident, John Serkin, also the son of a famous pianist.
Serkin, the third of Rudolf Serkin's six children and a onetime French horn player, is now a piano technician and tuner and serves on the village's Arts and Culture Committee.
He was instrumental in working out the details of the new arts program, which will bring students from the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia to classrooms in Greenport, where they will discuss and perform music.
Rudolf Serkin, who died in 1991, was a longtime director of the Curtis Institute.
To raise money for the program, Serkin has solicited the help of his younger brother, the pianist Peter Serkin, who is to play a benefit recital on Sunday at 2 p.m. in the Greenport School Auditorium.
Serkin will perform on a grand piano provided by Steinway &AMP; Sons in Manhattan.
With this gesture, the company is both supporting the educational initiative and honoring the memory of two major pianists who were exclusive Steinway artists.
The piano, valued at $50,000, is essentially being lent to the school, though the term the company prefers is ``long-term placement''.
It will be moved to the auditorium for Serkin's recital but will be kept permanently in a new wing of the village's Floyd Memorial Library, where the Curtis students will present concerts in conjunction with their work in the classrooms.
``We couldn't be more grateful,'' Kapell said recently, speaking of the contributions from the Steinway company and Peter Serkin.
``The arts program in Greenport has been minimal, if anything.
Our kids were missing cultural expansion, which is a shame''.
The benefit recital should generate enough money to support the music program for a full three years, John Serkin said.
The program has two goals: nurturing aspiring musicians and developing appreciation and audiences for the arts.
The response, Kapell said, is ``really surprising'' and ``very encouraging''.
The hall, which seats more than 700, is sold out for Sunday's concert, and the waiting list for tickets is approaching 100.
``It's overwhelmingly local people who are coming, people who live within 10 miles of the village,'' Kapell said.
And, thanks to benefactors who contributed $500 each, at least 150 seats will be occupied free by students from nearby school districts.
The mayor described Greenport as a ``true blue-collar town, fundamentally,'' though this ``belies the broader demographics'' of the area and its small, stable and diverse economy.
Local industries include fishing, wineries, retail and tourism.
While the population of the incorporated village is 2,100, the school serves a district of 5,000 residents.
John Serkin has been tuning the piano and voicing it (adjusting the density of the felt hammerheads for sound quality) in preparation for his brother's recital.
In choosing the works he will play, Peter Serkin has devised a substantive and varied program, including shorter pieces by Chopin, Debussy and Messiaen; recent works by Gyorgy Kurtag and George Benjamin; Schoenberg's Piano Suite, Op.
25 (a challenging 12-tone work that Serkin plays vibrantly), and, in the second half, Mozart's Sonata K.
332 and Beethoven's ``Les Adieu'' Sonata.
``We can't wait,'' the mayor said.
``The students are excited.
You never know where the next great musician is going to come from.
It could be Greenport.''
Thanks in part to programs like this, attitudes toward arts education have begun to change.
Buoyed by a revived economy, California politicians have, like their national counterparts, put education on the front burner.
And arts education has crept back onto the agenda in part because of lobbying from the entertainment industry.
``There's great demand for talented visual artists, but unfortunately we have to get people from outside California and the U.S.,'' said Scott Ross, a co-founder, with the director James Cameron, of Digital Domain, a visual effects studio in Los Angeles.
Delaine Easton, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, has called for the restoration of arts education in California public schools.
And last March the Los Angeles school district passed stringent graduation requirements citywide in visual arts, music, theater and dance, for kindergarten through grade 12.
``The hard part now is the implementation,'' said Don Dustin, the district's director of visual and performing arts.
``We do not have the resources, the background, the personnel''.
Inner City Arts, only nine years ago a modest alternative, does.
After the construction of Inner City Arts, Maltzan designed a new arts complex, completed in March, at Harvard/Westlake School, a private, affluent junior-senior high school in North Hollywood.
It is an equally forceful architectural composition of art rooms and art gallery.
Perhaps most important, the buildings surround a much-used communal plaza.
Enrollment in art classes has increased since the recent opening.
While Inner City Arts may be a curricular model, it is less likely to be an architectural one.
Because many public schools are struggling simply to keep roofs from leaking and bathrooms cleaned, concern for the surroundings as an educational asset is not a priority.
Even at Inner City Arts and Harvard-Westlake, Maltzan initially faced resistance to lavishing effort on the architecture.
At Inner City Arts, he said, ``they were used to living off donated paper''.
At Harvard-Westlake, the school deemed teachers and computers paramount and architecture as enclosure.
``In lay people's minds and the minds of most trustees,'' said Thomas Hudnut, Harvard-Westlake's headmaster, ``architecture implies added expense.
It's not until someone catches the contagion of creativity and inspiration of architecture that one appreciates what it can do''.
At present the challenge is to get art back into the schools.
Perhaps architecture will follow. &QL;
In findings that will dismay some arts advocates, a Harvard study released Wednesday casts doubt on the link between the arts and academic achievement.
In reviewing 188 studies over the past 50 years, Harvard researchers found some evidence that playing and listening to music improves spatial thinking, but little proof that music and art classes help students read better or score higher on tests.
``We're not saying don't use the arts in presenting other topics,'' said study co-author Lois Hetland, a psychologist affiliated with Harvard's Graduate School of Education.
``We're saying don't risk putting all your eggs in the basket that art will raise math scores, because the evidence is not strong enough to support that argument''.
But Don Campbell, a Colorado musician and journalist who has written two books on the so-called ``Mozart effect'' _ the idea that listening to classical music sharpens the brain _ said the connection between music and thinking defies measurement.
``The rhythm, harmony and melodies of the music all create different perceptions and sensations within different regions of the brain,'' Campbell said.
``The Mozart effect is far more than any one study can measure''.
The idea has sparked widespread interest ever since University of Wisconsin researchers linked music to IQ six years ago.
In that study, a small group of college students did better on certain spatial-reasoning tests _ such as mentally cutting and folding a piece of paper _ after listening to 10 minutes of Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major.
Despite warnings from the Wisconsin researchers not to read too much into the results, the study spawned a cottage industry of classical music videotapes and CD's designed to help infants, or even fetuses, think better.
Georgia and a handful of other states even began handing out classical music CD's to new mothers.
Meanwhile, advocates for school art and music classes, trying to reverse decades of budget cuts by cost-conscious school boards, began pointing to the Wisconsin study and others like it to bolster their arguments.
Given the national obsession with high-stakes tests, they reasoned, it made sense to promote art and music classes as a way to boost test scores.
The Harvard study suggests they should take a different tack.
Hetland and co-author, Ellen Winner, discovered a connection between music and spatial thinking and between drama and verbal skills such as reading, writing, and oral understanding.
But they didn't find any solid evidence that music, art and dance improve reading, or that classes in the arts improve test scores.
Hetland says she's a strong supporter of art and music classes, but that they deserve a place in the curriculum on their own merits.
``We don't ask history to justify itself on the basis of whether it raises English scores.
It's valuable on its own,'' she said.
Holly Rose of the Creative Movement and Arts Center near Boston, has been introducing children to music and dance for 20 years.
She said music has a developmental impact, if not a direct academic one.
``Music really enhances the learning experience, even if it doesn't necessarily spawn geniuses or people who excel in particular areas,'' Rose said.
Still, some arts educators insist that music and art classes can affect overall student achievement.
Arnold Aprill of the Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education said expanding the arts in Chicago schools has improved students' attitudes toward other subjects, spurred parents to get more involved, and even raised test scores.
``When the arts become integrated into the curriculum they are an important part of whole school improvement that shouldn't be ignored,'' Aprill said.
There is a national consensus that students need more competency in reading, math, science and history.
But Americans also want schools to teach citizenship, healthful lifestyles and creativity.
When people rely mostly on test scores to assess school quality, do they unwittingly sacrifice these other goals?
When schools are accountable only for higher scores, teachers inevitably emphasize more easily testable skills.
Less easily tested ones get shorter shrift.
For example, it is simpler to test vocabulary than creative writing, so test-driven curriculums may dilute literacy, not enhance it.
Just as important, tests do not assess important nonacademic competencies.
The public once trusted teachers and administrators to find a good balance between math, reading, arts, health and other activities.
They may not always have gotten it right, but today's data-driven accountability systems may not achieve a good balance either.
If basic skills were undervalued before, they are probably overemphasized now.
Curriculum planning requires weighing alternatives.
Teachers must decide whether to devote time to mock elections that develop citizenship habits, or to arithmetic and vocabulary practice.
Teachers evaluated only by student test scores are less likely to schedule the elections.
Schools increasingly confront such dilemmas.
Consider the Academy of Communications and Technology in Chicago, with mostly poor and minority students.
It may be closed if scores do not improve, so it now requires extra drills in basics.
To find time, teachers eliminated student discussions and debates of social issues.
Charlestown High in Boston also enrolls disadvantaged youth.
It has doubled math and English requirements for half its ninth-graders because they cannot graduate without passing state exams.
To schedule this extra drill, students must drop an elective, like fine arts or gym.
And in the affluent Washington suburb of Waterford, Va.
, an elementary school has cut back music assemblies and dropped plans for environmental studies because these cannot increase passing rates on statewide exams.
Certainly, the current math and science focus is working.
More high schoolers now study precalculus, biology, chemistry and physics.
Test scores are rising.
But more teenagers have fatty diets; physical education enrollment has plummeted.
Adolescent obesity has soared.
Neither children nor our economy will prosper if graduates have higher scores, but are overweight, with poor exercise habits or irresponsible sexual behavior.
Should Charlestown High do less algebra, and increase health education instead?
Employers today seek workers with problem-solving skills.
But pressure to raise scores tells schools to de-emphasize cooperative, project-based learning because teamwork is not measured on standardized exams.
People want schools to teach conflict resolution by negotiation, not violence.
But there is no standardized test for tolerance.
It is curious that while Americans hold schools increasingly accountable only for test scores, they also insist that schools do more.
A recent Gallup poll found that 46 percent of the public wanted schools' main emphasis to be training students to ``take responsibility''.
Only 39 percent say it should be academics.
The rest think teaching cooperation should have priority.
In 1994, Congress set national education goals _ being ``first'' in math and science was one, but others included preparing youth for responsible citizenship (with opportunities for community service), ensuring that students ``are healthy and fit'' and having them ``appreciate the nation's diverse heritage''.
Academics may be schools' most important activity, but perhaps Americans should sacrifice a few points in seniors' math scores if that is what it takes to inspire more of them to register to vote.
Perhaps not.
The public cannot debate these choices if schools are accountable only for basic skills results.
Standardized tests have improved many American schools.
Nonetheless, society pays a price for this progress.
If Americans do not equally demand accountability for less easily measured outcomes, they risk the balanced program they seek from public education.
PHILADELPHIA (AP) --A philanthropic foundation wants to reassert the value of the arts and culture in the United States by spending $50 million over the next five years to arts causes.
The goal of Pew Charitable Trust is to give money to support arts financing, zoning in historic areas and arts curriculum for public schools, said Stephen K.
Urice, who will direct the Pew initiative.
``What this is about is the long-term health of American creativity and the sustainability of American arts and culture,'' he said.
``The long-term goal is to strengthen both political and economic support for nonprofit culture''.
The $4.7 billion Pew foundation, started by the family owners of the Sun Oil Co.
, says it plans to establish a centralized information center for reliable data on all aspects of cultural life.
It intends to push greater media coverage, in hopes of promoting discussions among policy makers.
Pew will collaborate with museums and other arts institutions to build their cultural programs.
Whenever she is cooking dinner or taking her sons, Jack, 41/2, and Zach, 20 months, on short car trips, Dallas resident Shaun Mayner plays classical music.
Mayner grew up in the '60s and was raised on rock 'n' roll, but she wholeheartedly believes that classical music is good for her kids _ in a variety of ways.
``I'm convinced there's something there _ I know it directly affects their behavior,'' she says.
``Classical music is very organized, and that structure _ whether it's fast or slow and relaxed _ affects their mood and how they act''.
For one thing, she says, when the music's on in the car, her kids begin to notice the outside world.
Jack starts a two-way conversation with her instead of issuing a series of ``I want'' or ``I need'' demands, she says.
And both children are drawn to the kitchen when Mayner turns on the classical music _ otherwise, she says, they tend to stay in their rooms.
But it's not just mood that Mayner, and many other parents, are concerned with.
She is one of thousands of Americans who believe in the ``Mozart effect,'' a theory that classical music can affect the learning capabilities of children 3 and younger.
The theory is that although classical music has a calming effect on anyone, it is especially important to young children, whose minds are quickly developing and who need positive stimuli.
Based on studies in 1993 and 1995 at the University of California-Irvine, the Mozart effect has become the latest craze in child development, bringing with it several popular parenting books and an onslaught of CDs _ all aimed at directing American parents toward the music and at giving them one more factor in the formula for effective parenting.
But is cranking up the notes of dead European composers hype or helpful?
This summer, some researchers stepped forward to rebut the theory behind the Mozart effect.
The most well-known is Dr.
John Bruer, president of St.
Louis' McDonnell Foundation.
In ``The Myth of the First Three Years,'' which will be published Sept.
9 by Free Press (hardcover, $25), Bruer makes a case that too much emphasis has been placed on brain development in the first three years of life.
He writes that ``... there is no evidence at all for the claims that listening to classical CDs improves children's spatial reasoning skills''.
Kenneth Steele agrees.
A psychology professor at North Carolina's Appalachian State University, Steele says the Mozart effect does not exist, that the original conclusions of the California studies don't hold up.
Remember, says Steele, that the original studies didn't even include young children _ they were performed on college students, who were played classical music and then asked to immediately do a specific spatial-reasoning task having to do with folding and cutting a piece of paper.
This is, he says, hardly a measure of any sort of long-term brain developmental abilities.
Steele says he replicated the test exactly and found that there was virtually no difference in performance levels among subjects who listened to nothing, a Mozart sonata and a work of modern composer Philip Glass.
``We got no effect,'' Steele says; the results of his study were published in July in ``Psychological Science''.
``These students were equivalent across the board; their performance was the same''.
However, Bruer and other naysayers are still clearly in the minority, as the signs of Mozart madness proliferate.
Numerous stores offer display racks of baby-themed classical CDs, such as ``Baby Needs Mozart''.
Three of the 15 top-selling classical albums in the country are credited to Don Campbell, the author whose bestselling 1997 book ``The Mozart Effect'' (Avon hardcover, $24), has become the standard text for those who believe in the effect.
On the national level, Florida toddlers now listen to classical music in public schools _ by law.
The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences handed out free CDs of classical Grammy winners this past spring.
For many Mozart-effect aficionados, the theory makes sense.
Californian Heidi Brende, who teaches piano, says that classical music helps calm her 2 1/2-year-old, Carter, and her newborn, Emma.
``Classical music stimulates the same neural pathways used for complex reasoning tasks,'' says Brende, who has recorded two CDs of classical pieces, ``SmartPlay With Classical'' and ``SmartSleep With Classical,'' that are sold in stores nationwide.
``I am convinced.
I believe it''.
But critics like Steele say it may be something as simple as people's need to believe that actually gives the theory its power.
The whole Mozart-effect craze hinges greatly on people's desire to do something good for their children.
Parents who play their kids the music of Mozart feel some peace of mind from their belief that they're helping their child's development.
But there's something else fueling the rush to Mozart, too, Steele says with a laugh.
It all comes down to the money.
Babies will always be born to proud, new parents who want to do what's best _ which means that classical albums for kids may be major cash cows.
``There's a lot of commercial interest here,'' Steele says.
``A lot of companies see it as a way to sell a lot of CDs very fast''.

BLUE SPRINGS, Mo.
_ Mary Ogelsby is more motivated this summer in a drama class at the Blue Springs Fine Arts Academy than during the school year in any academic class.
``I love music, and I love theater,'' said Mary, a Blue Springs High School sophomore who wants to be a drama instructor.
``If I didn't have a chance to do music or theater, I just don't think I would do anything''.
Thousands of students in Missouri, Kansas and across the country share Mary's need for artistic expression.
Some say they might drop out if not for the arts programs.
Those students are riding a national wave of encouragement that has spurred the growth of programs like the Blue Springs Academy.
Also fueling the movement, recent brain research shows that some children learn in ways other than the traditional three R's.
In Missouri, fine-arts academies for middle and high school students have sprouted in the past four years in Springfield, Independence and Blue Springs.
In the Kansas City district, magnet programs for the arts are highly popular.
Educators in Kansas said more money is going to train teachers to expand music, theater and visual-arts programs by using existing art in the community.
And teachers are being taught to blend the arts into core subjects such as English, science, history and math.
``We are looking at meeting the needs of all students, the academically proficient and the artistically gifted,'' said Dee Hansen, fine-arts specialist at the Kansas Department of Education.
``The more we learn about how we learn, the more it validates fine arts as an integral part of the curriculum''.
In Missouri, arts academies are funded like other summer programs _ through state reimbursement for attendance.
Also, philanthropic foundations contribute toward field trips and equipment.
The Blue Springs Academy, in its first year, receives support from the Truman Heartland Community Foundation and offers theater, visual arts, vocal instruction, videography and creative writing.
About 55 students attend the academy, which was modeled after the nationally recognized George Caleb Bingham Fine Arts Academy in the Independence district.
The Bingham Academy, in its third year, offers a five-week program for five disciplines: creative writing, dance, instrumental and vocal music, theater and visual arts.
Students can get one-half credit for high school and three hours of credit through Blue River Community College.
``This is a new experience for me, and I really love it,'' said Kiley Smith, a Truman High School junior studying visual arts.
Sprawled on the classroom floor, Kiley worked on a drawing of a mysterious-looking woman wearing a black midriff that showed her navel through a sheer black shawl.
Kiley said the academy offers more freedom than art classes during the school year.
``Students here work at their level, and they get to do their own thing,'' explained Tom Creamer, Bingham's instructor.
``They don't have to follow a structured classroom curriculum''.
In addition, students from the Blue Springs and Bingham academies visit local museums, galleries and theaters.
This year the Bingham students also will spend a week studying the cultural arts in Santa Fe, N.M.
Both academies are free.
Like the 4-year-old state Fine Arts Academy in Springfield, the Bingham Academy selects students based on portfolios and auditions.
This year, 80 students attend.
They spend four hours a day in class, Monday through Thursday.
The local focus on arts responds to a national objective announced by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in 1998 to put high-quality arts education in all schools.
Though no federal law mandates the teaching of fine arts, in 1994 an objective of improving fine-arts instruction was added to the U.S.
Department of Education's Goals for 2000.
That ``confirmed the nation's commitment to having students educated in the arts and made grant money available to develop art programs and to train teachers,'' said Melinda Malico, a spokeswoman with the department.
In 1998, a sampling of 6,600 eighth-grade students from across the country was tested for knowledge of the arts.
That assessment, said Education Secretary Richard Riley, indicated that the nation was falling short in artistic instruction.
``Arts education is an essential part of strengthening academic achievement, creating strong schools and building a culture of learning,'' Riley said.
NEW YORK _ After a long morning of drills in reading, third-graders at Public School 156 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, spent an hour last Friday dancing to the urgent flutter of flamenco music.
Their small hands spiraled and their sneakers thumped as a professional dancer, Andrea Del Conte, guided them through stomps and whirls in a classroom with mirrored walls and glossy floors.
Dance is an indispensable part of the curriculum for all 750 students at Public School 156, along with music, art and creative writing.
Poems paper the school walls, parents sew costumes for special dance performances, and teachers gamely join students in daily artistic experiments linked to the subjects they are studying.
Flamenco, for example, ties into social studies and language arts lessons on the history and culture of Spain.
The school has developed a comprehensive arts program in partnership with several of New York City's nonprofit cultural institutions whose employees have advised the teachers, helped write the curriculum and frequently visited the classrooms to teach students about different art forms.
For the last two decades, schools like Public School 156 have increasingly turned to the city's museums, concert halls and theaters for lessons in art, music and dance.
They began to do so in the 1970s, when the city's near-bankruptcy eliminated hundreds of arts instructors.
Now, cultural institutions as large as the New York Philharmonic and as small as neighborhood dance troupes have become a permanent part of the city's educational landscape.
Even though the city is investing in arts education again, the institutions are playing a greater role than ever, not just giving occasional performances or tours as they once did, but helping schools retool their curriculums to integrate art, music and dance into every academic subject.
The institutions are involved not just to improve arts education, but out of self-interest: They want to cultivate future audiences and impress potential donors at a time when improving public education is considered an especially pressing and honorable cause.
Carnegie Hall spends close to $1 million a year training teachers to use music in the classroom, putting on concerts for school children and sending musicians to 22 schools across the city for seven visits per class over a school year.
The Roundabout Theater sends teaching artists to 40 classrooms in the city for 10 visits each.
Those artists teach students about reading, writing, directing and acting in plays as part of their language arts and social studies curriculums.
Artists from Lotus Music and Dance Studios in Chelsea work intensively with six schools across the city, including Public School 156, teaching students about the music and dance of different cultures.
The enthusiasm for such programs is striking at a time when city schools are under intense pressure to prepare students for increasingly rigorous standardized tests.
While Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani and Chancellor Rudy Crew have goaded schools to focus on reading and math, they have also increased the arts education budget by $150 million since 1997, providing about 1,000 art and music teachers and supplies for the city's 1,100 public schools.
That investment is not enough to bring the arts into every classroom, but in this flush economy, private foundations are joining cultural institutions in spending money on arts education partnerships.
Most notably, the philanthropist Walter Annenberg pledged $12 million to New York City schools in 1993 for academic offerings in the arts in a matching-fund program that is to total $36 million.
So far, 81 schools have received grants, most of them $75,000 a year, to develop programs with nonprofit institutions.
(OPTIONAL TRIM) ``The question now is not whether to teach the arts, but how to put them at the core of everything a school does,'' said Hollis Headrick, executive director of the Center for Arts Education, which oversees the Annenberg partnerships.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM).
Even with the infusion of money and the enthusiasm of cultural institutions, progress in arts education is slow.
Some institutions report tensions with teachers who say the programs occupy too much time.
So far, only the most motivated schools are truly integrating the arts into their curriculums, a process that requires extra work and money and a willingness to drastically change teaching methods.
This week, educators from 40 countries are discussing how to speed the progress at the International Conference on the Future of Arts Education, sponsored by the New York International Festival of the Arts, at IBM's conference site in Palisades, N.Y.
``We still need to teach the basic skills, but students today need an education that recognizes a much wider range of intellectual abilities and ways of communicating,'' said Ken Robinson, co-chairman of the conference and a professor of arts education at the University of Warwick in England.
Most arts organizations charge schools a fee for their expertise, ranging from a few dollars per student for a single lecture or performance to upward of $50,000 for ongoing classroom visits and teacher training by several teaching artists.
``It takes so much extra work to start something like this,'' said Verano LaRue, the arts education specialist at Lotus Music and Dance Studios, which Public School 156 is paying about $40,000 this year to incorporate dance into the school's curriculum.
At Public School 156 last week, the principal, Martha Rodriguez-Torres, nodded approvingly at a teacher and an aide who were learning steps with the young flamenco dancers, then walked down the hall to offer encouragement to fifth graders writing poems about things that comfort them _ part of a project on Native Americans that uses the help of another cultural group, Teachers and Writers Collaborative.
``Come on, Dennis, let the ideas flow through you''! she told a boy who had put down his pencil after writing one line.
She clapped loudly when another student read a poem that began, ``Oh dresser drawer, you smell so good with your aroma of fried chicken''.
Ms. Rodriguez-Torres said that reading and math scores at Public School 156, while still relatively low, have improved since the school won an Annenberg grant two years ago.
``Our reading scores have improved every year, and I can say that our children now enjoy writing,'' Ms.
Rodriguez-Torres said.
But even schools whose principals and teachers highly value the arts may have to work hard to convince parents and even students that they are as important an academic subject as math, reading and science.
After ebulliently whirling to the flamenco music last week, Katherine Nevarez, a third grader, solemnly said that while the rhythms lingered in her mind all day, dancing was not her favorite subject.
``When we do it, it's fun,'' she said.
``But my uncle told me that if I study math I'll get a college degree''.
(MORE) nn One way of getting families to value the arts as much as they value math is to measure student progress with traditional assessment tools, and New York State has started doing so by introducing standards that outline what students should learn through arts instruction.
But Terry L.
Baker, an education consultant who is trying to measure the effectiveness of the Annenberg programs, said educators still are not sure how to assess a student's grasp of such ``abstract, emotional and spiritual'' subjects as music and painting.
``If the arts are going to be taken seriously, they have to be held accountable in the same way that other disciplines are,'' he said.
``But we are still some distance from figuring out the best way to do that.''
WASHINGTON (AP) --If your teen-agers want to be in the high school band or drama club, let them.
It may improve their grades.
High school students who take music lessons and join theater groups do better in math, reading, history, geography and citizenship, according to a study of Education Department data to be published today.
``If young Americans are to succeed and to contribute to what Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan describes as our 'economy of ideas,' they will need an education that develops imaginative, flexible and tough-minded thinking,'' Education Secretary Richard Riley said in a message accompanying the study.
``The arts powerfully nurture the ability to think in this manner''.
The study, which tracked more than 25,000 students for more than 10 years, found that students who reported consistently high levels of involvement with instrumental music scored significantly higher on math tests by the 12th grade.
This observation held true for students regardless of their parents' income, occupations and levels of education, said James S.
Catterall, the lead author and an education professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
While 38.6 percent of higher-income students who were uninvolved in music scored high in math, 48 percent of those highly interested in music received the high marks.
``Kids who are more advantaged tend to be more involved in the arts.
Period. They have more opportunities and you'd expect them to do better,'' Catterall said in an interview.
But the influence of music was far more pronounced among lower-income students.
Among the lower-income students without music involvement, only 15.5 percent achieved high math scores.
But of the musically oriented group, more than twice as many excelled in math.
``It's not a matter of economic advantage.
It's a matter of something happening with the arts for the kids,'' Catterall said.
The study also found that as students progress through high school they are less likely to be involved in the arts.
``There's a clear trend,'' Catterall said.
``Kids participation in the arts declines.
It may be that high schools offer fewer programs than middle schools or that kids are more concerned with academics or admissions to college''.
Fewer than 3 percent of seniors take out-of-school classes in music, art or dance, compared with more than 11 percent of sophomores.
More than half of the ``high-involvement'' seniors are found in top levels on standardized tests, compared with fewer than 43 percent of the ``low-involvement'' seniors.
The study also indicated arts study affected students' racial attitudes.
``Students at grade 10 were asked if it was OK to make a racist remark,'' the authors wrote.
``About 40 percent 'no-drama' students felt that making such a remark would be OK, where only about 12 percent of high theater students thought the same''.
When the 12th graders involved in plays were compared to their uninvolved counterparts, 20 percent more of those active in drama had excellent reading skills.
Catterall noted that the work supports strong suggestions, but is not definitive.
This study was one of seven included in ``Champions of Change --The Impact of the Arts on Learning,'' by Edward B.
Fiske, former education editor of The New York Times.
The project was sponsored by the GE (General Electric) Fund and the John D.
and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation.

NEW YORK (AP) --President Clinton said Friday that ''it was tragic'' that school music programs frequently are the easiest target when budget-minded administrators have to cut education costs.
''I've been very disturbed'' about the problem, the president said.
''Over the last 20 years, more and more as schools have come under financial pressure, they have tended to drop their music programs''.
He spoke on NBC's ''Today'' show in tandem with the ''Save the Music'' fund-raising drive by music channel VH1 to preserve music programs in schools across America.
By some estimates, only 25 percent of American schools offer music programs as a basic part of the curriculum.
The interview was broadcast from a public elementary school in East Harlem.
Later, the president was visiting an elementary school in Queens to underscore the need for new school construction and repairs.
The president, a saxophone player who played in his high school band, has long championed the cause of preserving music programs in schools.
He said he volunteered to get involved when he heard about the VH1 program.
''We know that a lot of our young children learn better if they have access to music education,'' Clinton said.
''Not everyone learns in the same way, not everyone's brain is stimulated in the same way.
And the schools that have vigorous music programs tend to have higher academic performance''.
Clinton said the federal government should do more to ease the financial strain on schools by providing more money to hire new teachers and build more classrooms.
But he said it was important that parents raise their voices and demand music programs for their children.
''One of the things that really happened is a lot of folks just took the music programs for granted,'' Clinton said.
'A lot of people who were making tough budget decisions assumed nobody would care if they were eliminated.
And it was tragic, what happened''.
He continued, ''You'll see a big infusion of public money going back into these programs because of what VH1 has done and because more and more parents will insist on the music being there.
And I'll be glad to do whatever I can to help''.
Clinton was up early for the interview after spending the night at his home in Chappaqua.
As part of his New York visit, he was to speak at an evening fund raiser for Rep.
Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y.
The president was scheduled to stay in New York Friday night and return home on Saturday.
SEATTLE _ Mayor Paul Schell rode into office as the arts mayor, heavily backed by the city's arts groups.
In a press conference Tuesday morning he plans to earn the title, unveiling a series of proposals to revitalize the city's now creaky commitment to the arts.
Among his proposals will be a new director for the Seattle Arts Commission.
Present director Wendy Ceccherelli is moving to a newly created job of chief arts strategist for the Seattle Parks Department, focusing on the arts uses for the 151-acres of Sandpoint Park, now being developed as an addition to Magnuson Park on Sandpoint Way N.E.
The new space could house low-cost artist studios as well as performing arts spaces.
Schell will ask the city council for an additional $250,000 for arts from the general fund of next year's budget and increase the One Percent for Art attached to city construction projects to 1.5 Percent for Art.
In effect, he said, he's doubling the Percent for Arts Program, because he's going to extend the Percent for Arts Program to utilities such as the water and drainage systems located outside but owned by the city.
The additional money will go not just to visual artists' projects but to projects in a range of disciplines.
The $250,000 will help implement the mayor's small, concrete proposals to help bring the arts to the city's citizens.
He has a new slogan he'll try out Tuesday: ``Arts Every Day for Everybody''.
These ideas include making Sandpoint available for smaller performance arts groups for specific dates, renovating the 600-seat theater on the site.
On the fourth floor of Seattle Center's Center House will be what the major calls a ``black box'' room or theater space also available to arts groups seeking performance venues.
Such groups will also be able to book dates at the Museum of History and Industry and the Langston Hughes Cultural Arts Center.
The Bathhouse Theater at Green Lake will reopen for multiple arts uses, and an study will identity the economic gain provided to the city by individual artists and small arts groups, similar to the one the Allen Foundation funded last year through the Corporate Council for the Arts to study the economic impact of larger arts groups.
Schell also has big ideas for high tech arts access, hiring a so-called web-master to link arts groups with the schools and empower neighborhoods to continue to create their own arts identities.
The Seattle Public Library system will serve as focal point for information about the city's arts programs.
Schell's proposals come in response to the recommendations of the Seattle Arts Task Force Report delivered to the mayor in June.
The 21 artists, arts administrators and community activists who made up the the task force were chosen by Schell and City Council member Nick Licata nine months ago.
Although Schell's proposals fall short financially of the task force's recommendations, task force members contacted Monday were pleased by the mayor's annoucements.
Licata, who was out of town, issued a statement saying he was heartened by the mayor's proposals and he views them as a crucial first step.
Last June, saying that without adequate funding, the arts can't flourish, the task force asked the city to establish a $200 million public endowment for the arts, raising roughly $15.5 million per year for 10 years, eventually going to fund the Seattle Arts Commission.
In the meantime, the task force recommended that the city set side 1 percent of the general fund to support the arts commission, and that the commission become a city department: the city's centralized art source.
Schell plans to study and refine the $200 million idea but nixed the other two suggestions, saying the general fund's support for the arts is already more than 1 percent, closer to 1.5 percent, but it's spread over a variety of city agencies instead of centralized in the arts commission.
He's against centralization, as it turns out, preferring to continue to distribute arts funding not only through the commission but through community parks, libraries, community centers and the Neighborhood Matching Funds.
Centralizing information about the arts is another matter.
Schell wants the libraries to eliminate all red tape and give citizens specifics about the arts in a clean and direct fashion.
Jodee Fenton, library coordinator for fine and performing arts, says the library is already providing art access information, but not enough people know about it.
``We can do the best job on face of the earth, if nobody knows about it, what difference does it make''? she said.
Currently, the library provides music listening stations, a piano for practice, and a large collection of scores and recordings for public use, as well as an arts information line, 206-386-4612.
Arts information is also available through the library online: spl.org.
In the future, the mayor wants the library to provide exhibition spaces in neighborhood libraries for neighborhood artists; a music ensemble/theater arts room to try out new work, with video equipment available as needed.
Another information source will be a revitalized ``Seattle Arts'' program on TVSEA, showcasing the Seattle Arts Commission-funded artists and arts organizations.
Besides the possibility of studios for artists at Sandpoint, Schell is hosting a live/work forum for artists on Oct.
29. (For more information, call Amy Painter at the Seattle Arts Commision, 206-684-7306).
On Monday, artist and task force member Barbara Thomas said that however modest people may think the mayor's prospals are, they are specific.
``They give us a map of what he's thinking,'' she said.
``The city's commitment to arts was stalled.
The mayor is laying out where he plans to make his mark.
Some of his ideas are quite bold, like the increasing the One Percent for Arts.''
NEW YORK _ As a young girl in Trinidad, Cynthia Leveine used to peek from her windows to catch a glimpse of the steel bands, defying her parents, who forbade her to listen to the popular street music that was tapped out on refurbished 55-gallon metal drums.
``You dared not ask about it,'' said Ms.
Leveine, who is now in her 50s and lives in East Flatbush, Brooklyn.
``It was the music for the people who lived on the other side of the tracks''.
But Ms.
Leveine, who immigrated to New York 30 years ago, vowed that her children would not only listen to the soothing sound; they would also learn to play the steel drum, or pan, as it is commonly called.
And to her joy, Ms.
Leveine's 22-year-old daughter, Jacquii, a music major at City College, has been playing the steel drum for nearly a decade.
The drumming of Jacquii Leveine is part of a rising sound of the pan in those New York City neighborhoods transformed by the large influx of Caribbean immigrants.
Reflecting a growing appreciation for steel drums in the Caribbean and around the world, the drum has even taken a place next to the trumpet and clarinet as a musical option for students at some city schools.
Its popularity has been increased immeasurably by the annual West Indian American Day Carnival, the sprawling pageant that showcases the artistry of the steel drum.
This is all a bit of a passage for the pan, which was once burdened by its image as an instrument of rabble-rousers _ an image promoted earlier this century by Trinidad's British rulers, who saw the music as a magnet for subversive gatherings.
``This is the way the world turns,'' said the elder Ms.
Leveine. ``Parents are realizing the value of the instrument.
Music is music no matter how and who plays it''.
In Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, many public schools now offer steel drum classes as part of their music education programs, and professional pan players who migrated from Trinidad and other islands are offering private lessons.
Many bands that take part in the Carnival celebration are also conducting classes for teen-agers.
The instruments, which were once fashioned crudely out of used oil drums, are now custom-made at several storefronts in Brooklyn where entrepreneurs make a living carving, tuning and painting drums for sale.
They sell for about $500 to $900, said William Jones, a steel drum aficionado from Brooklyn.
Teen-agers, who now form the core of many steel bands in Brooklyn, hold jam sessions in so-called pan yards, a term borrowed from the outdoor sites where steel drums are played in the Caribbean.
They are drawn to the pan yards by camaraderie and by the sound of the drums.
``To me it's like another language,'' said Horace Moore, 17, of East Flatbush, who was at a steel drum jam session on a recent night at the St.
Francis of Assisi Church on the edge of Crown Heights in Brooklyn.
``At its highest, the steel drum has a crisp, straight sound with no aftereffect''.
Nicole McCarthy, 17, who was playing a double drum set nearby, chimed in: ``It's really soothing.
It's like you're in this groove and you're making a sound unlike anything we're used to here''.
Ms. McCarthy's friend Sandra Thompson, 17, pointed to Ms.
McCarthy and said: ``I started playing because of her.
I used to go to her house, and her father and her played it and it sounded good.
So now I'm into it''.
The steel drum is trimmed with chisels and tuned with sledge hammers.
It produces muted, bell-like tones.
As a solo instrument, the steel drum does not compare well with some other instruments like the guitar.
But in an orchestra, it produces a full, melodic sound.
A typical steel band ranges in size from about 10 to 140 members, each playing drum in tenor, soprano, baritone and bass.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) The origin of the steel drum as an instrument is credited to Winston Simon, a popular Trinidadian musician who recognized in the 1930s that a dented section of a barrel head produced a tone.
The instrument was assailed by the British colonials, who ruled Trinidad from 1797 to 1962, as a tool for popular uprising and banned its playing.
The British view of steel drums took hold in the upper reaches of Trinidad's society.
By 1967, however, the drum's stigma had begun to lift.
Now the steel drum, which carries the full chromatic range of notes and produces just about any type of music from classical to calypso, has become as much an icon of the region as a swaying palm.
There are more than 200 professional steel bands throughout Trinidad, and steel drum is taught side by side with mathematics and science in most schools.
Nearly every school has a steel band.
``Steel pan is a natural art form,'' said William Jones, founder and executive director of the Caribbean American Sports and Cultural Youth Movement, which runs one of the largest steel bands in New York, a perennial winner of the Carnival's band contest.
``It comes out of the black poor of the island.
It is spontaneous and at the same time formal''.
The excitement of the instrument is also drawing non-Caribbean, particularly black American, youngsters looking for a different music than the blues, jazz or hip-hop that dominate their musical environment.
``I had never explored this sound before,'' said William Johnson, 19, a psychology major at Medgar Evers College in Crown Heights, who is not of Caribbean ancestry.
``I wanted to try it.
It's a delicate instrument; you have to hit the notes just right''.
Steel drum has gained momentum in the city's public schools, which received $25 million last September from the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to restore arts and music programs that were cut several years ago.
Schools like George W.
Wingate High School in Brooklyn have used some of the money to buy more steel drums and to expand steel drum classes.
Ed Morgano, the school board's director of arts education for Brooklyn, said that having steel drum classes helps ease the transition for newly arrived Caribbean students.
At the same time, it opens American-born students to something different.
``I see it growing,'' Morgano said of steel drum classes in the public schools.
``I think you will see that instrument introduced in a more avant-garde sort of way by blending it with other instruments.''
HAVANA, Cuba _ The Milwaukee Symphony's recent mission to this city looked different to different people.
Was it a gift of musical culture to the Cuban people?
Well, Cuba has its own symphony orchestras, and the players I came across were good indeed: lots of technique, lots of style.
Maybe if we close our eyes and imagine a colonial superpower steaming across the Gulf of Mexico, bent on reinforcing a stranded enclave of classical music, then the trip makes more sense.
The word ``colonial'' is big in Cuba, defining the island's long history of occupation and exploitation.
And classical music in Cuba could, from this point of view, use a little rescuing.
The breakup of the Soviet Union deprived Cubans not only of heavy machinery and export credits but also of a link to Central and East European musical tradition.
Czech and Soviet teachers came here to teach; Cubans went to them to study.
Music education is big in Cuban schools, but the instruments are 30 years old and in disrepair.
Before the Milwaukee concerts in Havana, the closest thing to an American orchestra visiting here was a youth ensemble from New England a year or so ago.
So complex is the ritual of cultural exchange that it has generated a whole new industry, namely Canada-Cuba Sports and Cultural Festivals, with offices in Toronto and Havana.
This is not a sideline enterprise; it is based on Cuba alone.
Canadians have an easier time of it here: officially friends, not enemies.
Jonathan Watts, president of the company, reports that officials here are no harder to deal with than any others but that telephones and telecommunications are in bad shape.
Canada-Cuba has responded by building its own private network of phones, faxes and e-mail, and hiring people here to run its office.
Arts exchanges are only part of the business.
The University of Colorado sends archaeologists; the University of Wisconsin, nurses and nursing know-how.
Watts' worst Cuban-American experience was the recent visit of the Baltimore Orioles.
``They tried to politicize everything,'' he said.
``There was arguing whether Fidel Castro would get the proceeds of the gates at baseball games.
The tickets were either free or cost 5 cents.
This added up to about $50''.
One more way to describe Milwaukee in Havana is this: picture an American orchestra with Liszt and Strauss as its imports and set it against the much larger picture of musical Cuba as a whole.
Anyone who has succumbed to ``The Buena Vista Social Club'' _ either the movie or the recording _ has to wonder whether we shouldn't be listening to the Cuban popular tradition rather than Bernsteinian syntheses of it in ``West Side Story''.
Maybe the classical European tradition arriving by way of North America is a marginal affectation.
A more paranoid Cuban might find here the latest colonialist plot to impose the will of foreigners on local sensibilities.
The divide between cultures is more vivid in Cuba, given its recent isolation and its ethnic core heavily based on the black slave population sent long ago to work the country's lucrative sugar cane.
Europe came to this island, and the genetic memory of that coming survives.
And, of course, any ``native'' music, with a little historical digging, can be shredded into many musics, all of them originally from somewhere else.
But in the drums, bongos, claves and maracas that underlie the Cuban music that one hears performed in nearly every bar, restaurant and cafe, there is something distinctive.
The distance to Spain and Britain seems far, and to Africa just a brief hop.
Whose music is whose becomes more complicated in the United States.
German, Hungarian and Polish immigrants in the 19th century didn't import classical music; they brought it with them.
Maybe European music has as much a proprietary claim to original Americanness as the country's own black tradition.
Or is the real America in sound the beating drums and ritual whoops of Iroquois and Sioux?
The last argument may be in trouble.
Recent anthropological musings suggest that some form of Caucasian may have beat the Indian to America after all, a possibility that sits uneasily with tribal lawyers suing for the return of, or compensation for, confiscated lands.
For who knows from whom, if anybody, tribes got their territory in the first place?
Did some prehistoric Bach once sound through the canyons of New Mexico?
To anyone interested in the question of aborigine and interloper, I suggest ``The Enigma of Arrival'' by V.S.
Naipul. Similar questions can be argued in the public spaces of Havana, all teeming with live popular music.
Trios and quartets of guitarists and singers seem to go with every place that sells a drink or food to eat.
My bus passed by a big curbside band including oboes and a cello; I wish I had heard them play.
Next to the gritty intricacy of ``The Buena Vista Social Club,'' most of these musicians seem bland.
Rhythmic complication is smoothed out; the rough edges of singing style are sandpapered clean.
But the basic impulses of Cuban music are there to be heard.
The Milwaukee Symphony did have its grateful audience of conservatory students, older music lovers and children, but with the incessant hum of another music all around it, the image of a small and isolated enclave was not far off.
Liszt and Strauss played by a major orchestra made a nice change, but the next important music of this world may arrive not by way of New York or Vienna concert halls but from the streets of Latin America.(BOX)
LONG BEACH, Calif.
(AP) --The two public university systems in the nation's most populous state have agreed to require the same high school course work for admission.
The two systems have different mandates.
The more prestigious University of California schools consider only the top one-eighth of the state's high school seniors, while California State University, dubbed the ``people's university,'' takes the top one-third.
The systems also have had slightly different class requirements for admission.
That often has forced students to choose which standards to satisfy or has made them take extra courses to meet both.
Under the new requirements, incoming CSU freshmen will be required to have an extra year of high school laboratory science and another of social science; UC will require a year of art, dance or music classes.
CSU's governing board unanimously approved the new plan on Wednesday.
The University of California regents approved the guidelines in March.
The new requirements will begin with this year's crop of high school freshmen.
The standards apply to all students who apply, whether they are from California or outside the state.
The requirements include four years of English; three years of math; two years of social science; two years of lab science, two years of foreign language; one year of visual or performing arts and one year of electives.
Never mind that Mozart's concertos strike peaceful chords in music lovers.
In academia, the battle lines are drawn, and the next salvo in the Mozart wars is about to be fired.
Researchers are mustering data to counter those who are intent on debunking the ``Mozart effect'' _ the theory that classical music makes the brain work better _ and they have some high-profile allies.
President Clinton and the musician Billy Joel, for example, spoke in June at a school in New York City's East Harlem that received a donation of $5 million in musical instruments from VH1 Save the Music Foundation, in support of the notion that musical education can provide a powerful intellectual stimulus.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) In May, Harold O.
Levy, the chancellor of New York City's public schools, surprised 43 school superintendents by arranging for them to take a group violin lesson from Isaac Stern.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) Music educators have long claimed that music, one of civilization's great gifts, bestows a bouquet of benefits upon children.
They say that music sharpens children's concentration and makes them brighter and livelier.
If music's beauty and mystery fail to impress cost-conscious school boards, the thinking goes, then proving its ancillary benefits might save music programs from the budgetary ax wielded by those who regard music as an expensive luxury unrelated to reading, writing and `rithmetic.
To help determine who is right, an array of scientists is studying how music works in the brain.
The researchers have analyzed babies' responses to lullabies, as well as their awareness of pitch and rhythm, showing, in some studies, that infants experience music much as adults do.
We arrive ready to join the band, the scientists say, but too often the instruments have been packed away by schools that no longer use them.
A report that will appear in the fall issue of the Journal of Aesthetic Education, published by the University of Illinois Press, suggests that those instruments should be hauled out and tuned up.
According to the report, written by Lois Hetland, a cognitive psychologist at Project Zero, a research organization co-directed by Howard Gardner at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, something happens to young children when they are given keyboard lessons for several months or years: while the instruction lasts, and for up to two years afterward, the children's performance on spatial reasoning tests improves.
That observation was the genesis of the term ``Mozart effect,'' which has been trademarked by the musician and author Don Campbell, although his new book, ``The Mozart Effect For Children,'' to be published in September by William Morrow, is unrelated to the study that started the debate.
In the original 1993 study, Gordon L.
Shaw and Frances H.
Rauscher showed that a small group of college students performed better on certain spatial-reasoning tests after listening to a Mozart sonata.
The so-called ``effect'' _ an increased ability to ``see'' the design of a snowflake, for example, after mentally cutting and folding a piece of paper, or to rotate and compare objects conceptually in space _ lasted only 10 to 15 minutes, but the news was treated like a formula to get smart quick.
Classical music seemed like the latest mega-vitamin: a little hard to swallow, but so good for you.
The theory, which made the rounds of magazines in cover stories, quickly found its biggest audience in the conscientious parents of young children and to the parents of children-to-be, who hurried to buy specially packaged music CDs so they could play Pachelbel's Canon to their babies in utero.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) In Georgia, no purchase was necessary for newborns.
Gov. Zell Miller, citing the Mozart effect, proposed in 1998 providing the parents of every Georgia newborn with a classical music cassette or compact disc.
Sony produced the albums free, and they were included in gift packets at hospitals.
The Mozart data was absorbed into current views of cognitive development, and parents rushed to improve those new brains.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) Some neuroscientists, however, cringed at the simplistic scenario.
So did Rauscher, who cautioned against distorting her team's modest findings.
The Mozart hype, especially in relation to infants, was ripe for puncturing, and Dr.
John Bruer obliged in his book, ``The Myth of the First Three Years,'' published last fall by Free Press.
Bruer, president of the McDonnell Foundation in St.
Louis, which finances research in neuroscience and cognition, argued that no one need rush to program music or anything else into babies' brains.
The brain, he reassured parents, was most likely malleable for life.
Hetland, whose work addresses college students as well as preschool and elementary-school children, conducted two comprehensive analyses of all the known studies of the subject as part of Project Zero's Reviewing Education in the Arts Project, which she served as manager.
In the first analysis, more than 2,000 college students participating in 31 studies listened to several different kinds of music, as well as to silence and to a vocal-relaxation tape.
They scored higher on spatial-reasoning tests after they heard Mozart, Schubert and Mendelssohn than under any other conditions, including listening to music by Philip Glass, Pearl Jam and other rock groups.
Music with a complex structure and rhythm won out over repetitious, more predictable music, Hetland said.
Advocates of music in the schools say that it is good, but not enough, to sit children in an auditorium and present them with a well-played rendition of ``Peter and the Wolf''.
For children to benefit most, they need to make music themselves, those advocates say.
Indeed, Hetland's second analysis showed that.
It involved 700 preschool and elementary school children who participated in 15 different studies.
Some children received weekly 15-minute periods of active music instruction, both individually and in groups.
They listened to music and moved to its rhythms, played percussion instruments like triangles, rhythm sticks and cymbals, sang and took piano lessons.
The control groups received either passive music instruction, computerized reading and arithmetic instruction or no special instruction.
nn &QL; The gap between the before-and-after scores on spatial-reasoning tests of the children who received active music instruction was much greater than the gaps in the scores of the children in the control groups, Hetland said.
She defined spatial skill as the ability to conceive of and understand the placement of objects and images in two- or three-dimensional space.
The test scores of children who learned to read notes on a musical staff jumped highest of all.
``This does give music education advocates a lobbying tool, if they want to justify a music program,'' Hetland said.
Surgeons, engineers and archaeologists need spatial skills.
So do artists and chess players.
``Spatial instruction is a great way to teach math,'' she said.
``If you can enhance people's spatial ability through a program of music instruction, we're not sure why, but most kids would benefit''.
That lack of an explanation for the demonstrated benefit of music instruction keeps controversy bubbling in the overlapping fields of cognitive science and early-childhood education.
Does music per se improve mental gymnastics?
Or is the spatial-reasoning effect a result of something else _ the spatial patterns made by the black and white keys on the keyboard, perhaps, or a factor like change of mood after participating in music?
Dr. E.
Glenn Schellenberg, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, is skeptical about the Project Zero report.
``Just because there's an association doesn't mean it's causal,'' he said.
``They've got to show that the effect is specific to music.
The right experiment has not been done''.
Schellenberg has a $150,000 grant from the International Foundation for Music Research in San Diego to give 36 weeks of free arts lessons to 6-year-olds, beginning in September, randomly assigning groups of children to keyboard, voice or drama classes.
``We'll be looking to see whether the two music groups show greater levels of improvement on before-and-after-tests than the drama groups,'' he said, ``and whether the two music groups differ''.
``Who knows,'' he added, ``music could be special''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) But some music teachers are impatient with the plodding scientific approach.
``I don't need proof,'' said Lisha Papert Lercari, director of the Music and the Brain Project of the 42nd Street Development Fund in Manhattan, which has developed a keyboard program that is now being taught in 23 schools ``The kids are discovering form and patterns, and noticing things we never saw''.
She said the keyboard training, which involves reading music, also helped immigrant Hispanic children in Queens pick up English unusually fast, a language effect she expects to document in a nearly completed study.
Educators like Lercari regard Rauscher, one of the original Mozart-effect researchers, as their spokeswoman.
Not surprisingly, Rauscher was elated by the advance news of Hetland's report.
``I think that to ignore these findings is really to do a disservice to the children who can benefit most from them, especially disadvantaged children,'' Rauscher said.
``These are kids whose parents can't afford the time or the money to take them to piano lessons.
They really rely on the public schools for this, and a prekindergarten program would be the ideal place to start''.
Rauscher, a former concert cellist who is now an assistant professor of cognitive development at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh, has conducted her own research since 1993 and consistently found higher spatial-reasoning scores correlating with keyboard and xylophone instruction for elementary school children.
Singing also has its place in the new emphasis on musicmaking.
In White Plains, N.Y., which was recently named one of the top 10 communities in the country for music education in a survey conducted by the American Music Conference, the National Association for Music Education, the Music Teachers National Association and the National School Boards Association, singing is being integrated into prekindergarten and kindergarten classrooms.
Teresa Niss, coordinator of fine arts programs in the White Plains schools, said that if kindergarten children are learning about the letter ``S,'' for example, they may sing songs about snakes and starfish.
Musical counts help illustrate groups of numbers, while songs sung in connection with pictures facilitate reading.
``We have seen changes in children's language development faster than we normally would,'' she said.
The district is 35 percent Hispanic, and like Lercari, Niss said that Hispanic children arriving in school without knowledge of English ``are acquiring the language more quickly'' after their exposure to the music program.
With a $100,000 three-year grant, provided by Texaco and the Eastman School of Music through their Partnership Opportunities program, the district recently extended its program to prekindergarten students and brought Linda P.
Neelly, an early-childhood music consultant in Rochester, into the lower grades to work with music teachers and classroom teachers.
One recent morning, Neelly gathered kindergarten students in a circle and asked them to take turns singing their names as she beat the rhythm on a tambourine.
Then, in a clear and melodious voice, she repeated what each child had sung, enticing the children into a musical conversation as they drew or worked on group activities.
When groups of children drifted over to a xylophone on the floor, she used it to make up songs with them.
The class illustrated Neelly's view that music should flow naturally throughout the school day, much as the arts are taught ``through the curriculum'' in some middle and high schools.
For this to happen, classroom teachers must also become musicmakers, and part of Neelly's job was to show them how.
For example, one technique was to ask the teachers to sing in a higher key than normal so that children could replicate the sound.
``Children will sing in tune if they sing higher,'' Niss said.
All the musical failures critics portray seemed to fall on the small shoulders of Aifa, who was silent when it was her turn to sing her name in a White Plains classroom.
``I don't know how to sing,'' she said, crestfallen.
Neelly moved on to the next child, but when the group sang together later, Aifa joined in.
No longer in the spotlight, she found her natural voice, which, music advocates say, is like finding herself.
``Every child has innate musical capacity,'' Neelly said.
``If we're not tapping in and finding ways to develop that ability, we're not doing our job as educators.''
NEW YORK _ They applauded Philip Glass as if he were a rap star and greeted the first notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony with a gasp of delighted recognition.
The Carnegie Hall audience the other day was composed of hundreds of students in grades four through six from schools around the city.
Most had participated in Carnegie Hall's Linkup music education program, and it showed.
Linkup was developed in the 1980s when arts programs were being slashed in New York City public schools and elsewhere around the country.
But how much the students actually learned was measured largely through anecdotes until now.
Carnegie Hall tried to improve on this with help from Columbia University's Teachers College and Educational Testing Services.
Program administrators asked 6,000 students participating in the program to develop musical compositions at the beginning of the course and again at the end.
The students used commercially available glockenspiels and homemade thumb pianos, guitars made of cardboard, a set of three can drums, can shakers and trumpets made from garden hoses.
Using a complicated scoring formula, testers evaluated the differences between the two compositions.
The improvement was far from earthshaking, but evaluators concluded that it was ``significant'' given the modest length of the program, which ran for seven 45-minute sessions.
The final compositions showed small improvements in how students produced sounds and alternated instruments.
And in written responses to questions about composing, the students gave more detailed explanations of how they used the instruments to create action, character and mood.
Results of the study were released this month.
``I was very pleased with the modest gains,''said Carol Myford, a senior research scientist at Educational Testing Services in Princeton, N.J.
``This is a short-term program''.
Linkup emphasizes basic music concepts and music's relationships to other academic subjects through classes, planning sessions for teachers and artists, and concerts in schools and neighborhoods.
This year, the 14-year-old program involved 22,000 students and 733 teachers at 176 schools in New York.
For the study, conducted in the 1996-97 school year, students working in groups of six were given a set of instruments and asked to write a piece of music that would illustrate a short story they were asked to read.
Then they were asked, after some instruction in how to use the instruments, to choose sounds that ``show'' characters, action and mood.
The students had 15 minutes to create and practice a piece that was a minute or two long.
Each group played its piece, which was recorded.
The exercise was repeated at the end of the program, and the compositions were taped again.
The students' efforts were evaluated for use of timbre, texture, portrayal of the text and overall effectiveness.
The students also responded to written questions on work sheets.
The study found that sixth graders made the greatest gains while fourth graders made the smallest.
The report hypothesized that older students had had more exposure to the concepts of text, timbre and texture.
Another hypothesis was that the curriculum was more appropriate for older students.
Overall, students showed the most improvement in their use of texture and the smallest gain in their exploration of timbre.
Howard Gardner, a professor of cognition and education at the Harvard University Graduate School of Education, whose theories of multiple intelligences have gained wide popularity, said that the study sounded like a positive step but that follow-up was needed.
It is important to determine whether the students continue to improve, after such a short program, and at what rate, Gardner said.
``That you can do something in a short time is worth noting,'' he added.
``It's a good message to kids that this is something you can get better at.''
SAN FRANCISCO _ Dear Gov.
Gray Davis: Because you said you wanted to be ``the education governor'' of California, I am writing to you on behalf of some 50,000 San Francisco school children in grades kindergarten through nine.
Could you and your pals in Sacramento please knock off the finger pointing long enough to see that you are punishing a whole lot of kids down here because a handful of adults once made some questionable choices?
On June 23, at about 4:45 a.m.
_ yes, a.m.
_ the San Francisco Board of Education unanimously but miserably approved a substantially shrunken $533 million budget for 1999-2000.
Gone from that sum was the money to pay for _ surprise, surprise _ what little remained of this city's elementary school arts programs ($650,000).
Gone too was the money to pay for an extended day, or seventh period, for middle school students ($4.5 million).
That extra hour may not seem like such a loss, but when you raise academic standards for graduation _ as San Francisco Unified School District did awhile back _ it makes a huge difference for thousands of kids who need all the learning time they can get.
As for the arts programs, how can we pretend to be an advanced, let alone civilized, society and keep treating art and music as if they are luxurious fluff?
Worse, how can we continue to do this during the flushest economic times in the history of the state?
As school board member Jill Wynns said after the pre-dawn budget vote: ``The state is drowning in tax money, and we're cutting core, essential programs in San Francisco.
We hate this budget.
But we had no choice, no options''.
Now, governor, I know you many not think much of anybody who sits on the San Francisco board.
A few of your recent vetoes stand as monuments to your disappointment.
Those vetoes _ worth millions to San Francisco Unified _ gave the board little choice but to cut the seventh period and the arts.
Which gets us back to the bodies on the bottom of this pile: the kids.
It isn't their fault that San Francisco, like a lot of California urban school districts, financed for years some expansion projects and academic upgrades by sort of borrowing against the bucks they were accustomed to getting _ sooner or later _ from the feds and state for desegregation programs.
It isn't the kids' fault that San Francisco's former superintendent, Bill Rojas, performed this perfectly legal but risky financial jukestep longer and more spiritedly than any other superintendent, or that his cash-strapped board juked along so docilely.
Neither is it the kids' fault that Rojas' in-yo'-face, gimme-the-bleeping-money style offended your predecessor, Pete Wilson, half the Capitol and _ until he left for Dallas _ you.
I've read enough to turn my eyeballs bloody about this stuff: The overuse of the desegregation money; the Legislature's retroactive rescission of California's share of the dough; your vetoes of the Legislature's attempts to put back all or some of the money.
What a mess.
Some people say the state OK'd and promised that money to the schools and, by law, ought to pay up; some say new laws supersede that.
No doubt you will all spend the next 18 months arguing about it, and many lawyers will get rich in the process.
As the lawyers argue about the desegregation millions, guess what will happen to the kids?
They'll get the royal shaft.
Although it amounts to a measly half-hour of instruction per week for only about half the kids, San Francisco still has a shred of a public grammar school music program.
Do you know why?
It isn't thanks to the state.
A one-time windfall blew into the city's budget several years ago, was allocated for public school music programs and got locked into the protective arms of Proposition J, the Children's Amendment.
It was a fluke.
Governor, in your heart, that fact must strike you as shameful, especially in a state whose legislators are contorting themselves trying to find ways to ``give back'' a great budget surplus.
Music by fluke?
Logic dictates that the more time a junior high kid spends in class, the better chance she or he has to improve learning skills.
And numerous studies have proved that visual and musical arts programs increase a child's overall learning ability and make for better, healthier socialization.
Please, governor, your vetoes show you have the power.
Your political record shows you know how to make things happen.
Reimburse the desegregation funds or tap some other source.
Don't punish the kids.
Find a way to do the right thing for them.

CLARKSTON, Mich.
(AP) --Veteran musician John Mellencamp was on hand for a ceremony designed to help rookies start playing.
Before a Wednesday night concert, Mellencamp and officials with the Save the Music Foundation announced the donation of $75,000 worth of musical instruments to three Detroit schools.
The nonprofit foundation is dedicated to restoring music programs in schools nationwide and raising public awareness about the importance of music education.
``I'm very excited about it,'' said Charles Moody, the principal of Bethune Elementary School in Pontiac, one of the three schools.
``We know the impact that music has on a child's development.''
BONN, April 20 (Xinhua) --Private investors are set to benefit from the 1999 introduction of the single European currency, the euro, thanks to expanded investment opportunities, reduced currency risks, and rising competitions, the German central bank Bundesbank said Monday.
In its latest monthly report issued Monday, the Bundesbank said that as national currency boundaries vanish and most European stocks and bonds are denominated in euros, investors will be able to make use of a variety of cross-border investment opportunities in the euro area which will become the second largest capital market in the world.
Moreover, investors are also set to benefit from reduced transaction costs and improved market transparency resulting from heated competitions among financial institutions after the advent of the euro, the Bundesbank said.
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Eleven of the European Union's 15 members soldered their moneys into a single currency Thursday, but that act of monetary union also had consequences for such diverse places as Monaco, the Vatican and the islands of St.
Pierre and Miquelon off the coast of Canada.
The Vatican and the Republic of San Marino are microstates located wholly within Italy and use the Italian lira as their currency.
Monaco is a tiny principality on France's Mediterranean coast.
St. Pierre and Miquelon, minuscule islands off Newfoundland, are part of France's far-flung territories, as is the Indian Ocean island of Mayotte.
All use the French franc as their currency.
Italy and France have adopted the euro, as the European Union's new single currency is known.
That leaves these various tiny places, all non-members of the EU, without a money of their own unless they make special arrangements to adopt the euro.
EU finance ministers, who fixed the exchange rates between the euro and the national currencies of the 11 as the final step before creating the new currency at midnight, said the tiny countries and territories could use the single European currency under certain conditions.
The ministers ruled that San Marino, the Vatican and Monaco will be entitled to use the euro as their official currency, but they will not be allowed to issue any banknotes or coins unless they agreed to conditions imposed by the EU.
Euro notes and coins, which will be put into circulation in 2002, will feature bridges, windows and doorways in various European styles.
Euros stamped with a likeness of the pope, for example, would be certain to arouse strong opposition among some segments of the European population.
Italy was designated to begin negotiations with San Marino and the Vatican over their use and eventual issuance of euro currency.
France was tapped to negotiate an agreement with Monaco.
``Vatican City will have the right to continue issuing collector coins and the Republic of San Marino to continue using gold coins denominated in scudi,'' the ministers said.
Those three also will be required to adopt EU rules on currency and to ``cooperate closely with the community with regard to measures against counterfeiting of euro banknotes and coins''.
With regard to the two French territories, the ministers decided that the euro would be their currency two and that France would continue to grant legal status to their banknotes and coins.
France will be required to pass national legislation putting these monetary arrangements into law. (ju)
BRUSSELS, May 2 (Xinhua) --Trading in Europe's new single currency will begin on Monday as a United States bank and a Dutch one have offered to quote prices in the euro.
Citibank, the world's largest foreign exchange operator, and ABN-AMRO said that they had planned to quote prices in the euro for their clients starting next Monday.
The founder countries of the euro, as the new single currency is known, are scheduled to adopt new currency while banks and exchanges will start using euro in all scriptural transactions such as writing checks, using credit and charge cards, and buying bonds and stocks.
Euro bank notes and coins will become legal tender on January 1, 2002 while national currencies of the euro founder countries stop circulating completely by July 1, 2002.
The two banks' announcement to offer an unofficial market in the new single currency before it effectively comes into existence shows a strong sign that the financial markets have fully accepted the launch of the euro.
The European summit at heads of state and government level is scheduled to confirm which European Union member states are eligible to become the original members of the euro zone.
Both the European Parliament and the European council of economy and finance ministers have approved the recommendation of the European Commission that Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland be the founding countries.
Britain, which is serving the rotating presidency of the 15-nation European Union, and Denmark have opted out of the euro club whereas Greece and Sweden have been judged by the commission not economically ready to join in.
Once confirmed by Saturday's summit of European heads of state and government, the 11 euro countries will have to prepare to put 70 billion euro into circulation while pool another 50 billion euro in the reserve to make the new money impregnable against speculators.
The total cost of introducing the euro is estimated to be at 1 to 1.5 percent of the gross domestic product of the 11 euro countries.
SOFIA, October 22 (Xinhua) --Bulgaria has been working to link its currency, the lev, with the proposed European single currency, the euro, in a bid to speed up the country's financial integration into the European economy.
In order to seize the opportunity to share in the start up of the euro, which is scheduled for January 1, 1999, the Bulgarian government adopted a system of monetary commission on July 1, 1997, and established a connection between the Bulgarian lev and the German mark.
Under the new system, one German mark is equivalent to 1,000 Bulgarian lev.
The mark has also been used for the settlement of foreign exchange reserves.
Bulgarian Finance Minister Muravei Radev has pledged that the lev will experience its connection with the euro automatically as the European single currency comes into use less than three months later, and that the entire process of transition will be accomplished by July 1, 1999.
With regard to easing the accounting, the Bulgarian government plans to print next year a new national currency, with a face value of one lev equivalent to one Mark.
Meanwhile, the euro will be used to replace the German mark as the accounting unit for Bulgaria's foreign exchange reserve.
BUCHAREST, November 12 (Xinhua) --The introduction of the single European currency, the Euro, would pose strategical as well as tactical problems to the economy of Romania, an associate EU country seeking admission, the Rompres news agency Thursday quoted Romania's Central Bank Governor Mugur Isarescu as saying.
Romanian bankers and economists could not be indifferent to the future of Euro in the international payment system and as a reserve currency, the evolution of the Euro-Dollar exchange rate, the relations which will be established between the national currency Leu and Euro, or Euro's effect on Romanian commercial and payments balance, Isarescu said at a Wednesday colloquium on Euro by the Romanian Society of Economics.
The answers to these matters represent the precondition for identifying the monetary and currency policies which might ensure, in the shortest delay, the criteria for a convergence between the Romanian economic and monetary system, on the one hand, and the Economic and monetary Union, on the other hand, the Governor added.
LONDON, May 16 (Xinhua) --Britain's biggest mortgage lenders are planning to overhaul the traditional home loan ahead of a single European currency with the launch of euro mortgages.
Lending giants in Britain have put detailed plans in place for financial life in the country after 1999, when they believe European currencies will join in a single currency, the euro, with the UK forced to accompany them within several years.
Local press reports today said that the building societies have produced blueprints for euro savings accounts, passbooks and cash-dispensers despite the government's increasingly Eurosceptical tone.
A spokesman of Halifax, the biggest mortgage lender in the UK, said, "Our view is that a single European currency will happen and that the UK will be brought in within two or three years.
This will mean substantial changes for our products, the housing market and the economy as a whole.
We have to look forward and be prepared".
Bradford and Bingley's plans for a euro mortgage are already at an advanced stage, and will be launched ahead of the UK's participation in the single currency.
Its chief executive Geoffrey Lister said, "We believe euro mortgages will be popular because they will offer lower interest rates than sterling mortgages.
We could even reach the stage where Britain remains outside the currency alignment but employees ask to be paid in euro."
BONN, April 2 (Xinhua) --Despite skepticism about the actual realization of a single European currency as scheduled on January 1, 1999, preparations for the design of the Euro note have already begun.
The European Monetary Institute, responsible for the preparations, has set up a consultative group of artists, art historians and psychologists to come up with designs.
The Frankfurt-based body said in its annual report released today that it has decided on two themes for the new currency: history of European civilization and abstract or concrete paintings.
The Euro is expected to have seven notes with face values ranging from five to 500.
The institute, which functions as a preparatory European Central Bank, began to invite tenders for making the new currency in February.
The institute requires the design of the Euro to include five languages of the European Union together with the symbol of the EU --12 stars in a ring.
It hasn't been decided whether the Euro should include country emblems.
The Euro must also be counterfeit-proof and must include special designs to accommodate blind or poor-sighted people.
BRUSSELS, April 25 (Xinhua) --The European Commission, the European Union (EU)'s executive body, today welcomed the decision by the Maintenance Agency for ISO 4217, the body responsible for the issuance of currency codes, to attribute the code "EUR" to the Euro.
This new code has been issued to allow progress with the technical preparations for the European single currency, scheduled to be launched on January 1, 1999, said a press release issued here today.
The code is intended for use in any application of trade, commerce and banking which is based on uniform, internationally agreed representations of currencies.
It will allow currency users to identify the new currency easily.
The early attribution of the currency code will help economic agents, in particular financial institutions, in their preparatory work for the introduction of the single currency.
BUCHAREST, December 15 (Xinhua) --The Romanian banking system is ready to perform services in the European single currency, the euro, the Rompres news agency reported on Tuesday citing sources from Romania's Central Bank.
"Romania's Central Bank (BNR) and the country's commercial banks fear little about the introduction of the euro and will easily adapt to it," BNR Foreign Currency Director George Mucibabici told a recent colloquium on euro in Bucharest.
BNR and Romanian commercial banks that want to perform euro services will have to open accounts in euro by January 4, 1999, the first scheduled day of euro use, and inform their foreign partners.
BNR indicative exchange rates will be modified to include euro instead of the current European single currency, the ECU.
BERLIN (AP) _ European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Thursday that Europe's new single currency, the euro, won't compete with the U.S. dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves.
The Frankfurt-based European Central Bank does not plans to encourage the use of the euro as a reserve currency, Duisenberg said, speaking at a conference in Berlin.
The euro will be adopted by 11 of the European Union's 15 countries on New Year's Day, but won't go into circulation on the streets until 2002.
It is the key element of Europe's imminent economic and monetary merger.
Speculation has surrounded the euro's launch, with some economists predicting countries may switch the foreign reserves from the U.S. dollar to the euro, which represents some of the strongest economies of the world.
Duisenberg emphasized that the priority of the new economic zone is price stability, adding that the bank does not plan to encourage the euro's use as an investment or transaction currency, or to use it as an instrument of foreign policy.
However, the bank would monitor carefully fluctuations of international exchange rates, especially that of the dollar, since ``possible major dollar movements could have negative effects on the euro zone's domestic economic situation,'' Duisenberg said.
The dollar has been weakening against European currencies in recent months.
Currency fluctuations could affect the movement of money to or away from investment portfolios in Europe, and that was something to be watched, Duisenberg said.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Europe's new currency, the euro, will rival the U.S. dollar as an international currency over the long term, Der Spiegel magazine reported Sunday.
A number of countries are already planning to hold the euro as part of their foreign currency reserves, the magazine quoted European Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg as saying.
Oil imports to Europe can also be calculated in euros as well as dollars, Duisenberg was quoted as saying.
``That which the Americans see as their automatic right, namely the financing of their enormous trade deficit by other countries in their own currency, won't be automatically acceptable any more,'' Spiegel quoted Duisenberg as saying.
The report also said Duisenberg expects the future relationship between the dollar and the euro, which officially goes into effect on Jan.
12, to be stable. (gb)
PARIS, November 19 (Xinhua) --France has already struck one billion coins of the European single currency euro, which will be launched by January 1999, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Thursday.
Besides France, only Finland, Belgium and Spain have begun their production of the euros, but not as much as France, said AFP quoting official sources.
Germany is in "an advanced stage" of experimenting striking the euro, while other European nations which will join euro are due to begin producing the coin next year.
A total of 70 billion coins of the single currency should be issued to replace the national currencies by January 2002.
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) --Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today that the Chinese government welcomes the initiation of the Euro currency early next year.
In response to a question concerning the issue at today's news conference, Zhu said the introduction of the Euro is expected to stimulate European integration, help establish a more balanced world financial system and exert influence on the world's economy and politics.
The European summit confirmed Sunday that Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland will be founding members of the Euro organization.
The summit has also confirmed candidates for the presidency of the European Central Bank.
BRUSSELS, January 29 (Xinhua) --The European Commission (EC) spokesman today formally denied newspaper reports that the EC is "secretly" drawing up plans to delay the launch of the single currency, the Euro.
"The commission firmly sticks to its position that the Euro shall be introduced in conformity with the (Maastricht) Treaty criteria and timetable which have been confirmed by the December European Council of Madrid," the spokesman said.
At the Madrid summit last December, leaders of EU member nations agreed unanimously that the European single currency will be formally launched on January 1, 1999.
BONN, September 11 (Xinhua) --The mass printing of the banknotes of the single European currency, the euro, would be started at the beginning of 1999, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced in Frankfurt Friday.
The decision was made by the ECB's governing council during a meeting in Frankfurt on Friday.
Meanwhile the bank also decided to start this Autumn a test printing of the euro banknotes, which have a total of seven face values.
European Union's single-currency plan will take effect in 11 of its member states on January 1, 1999, when the euro will become a currency in the financial sense, but will first be used only in cashless tradings.
The actual banknotes and coins will be introduced over a six-month period starting January 1, 2002, after which the participants' present national currencies will cease to be legal tender.
Germany already started to mint euro coins early August.
SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) - The Bulgarian National Bank announced Thursday its national currency, the lev, will be fixed at 1,955.83 to the euro.
Under the currency board system established in July 1997, the domestic money supply is backed by foreign currency reserves.
Since its launch, the domestic money supply has been backed by German marks at a rate of 1,000 to the mark.
With the launch of the euro on New Year's Day, the lev will formally be backed by euros.
The currency board was established to help reduce inflation by preventing the central bank from lending to the government or local banks.
Inflation is expected to fall below 9 percent in 1998, down from 573 percent in 1997.
The government has said it will keep the currency board in place until the country is in a position to adopt the euro as its own currency.
The government doesn't expect to be in a position to begin membership negotiations with the European Union until 2001.
EU membership is a prerequisite for adopting the euro as a national currency. rr/sof
BUCHAREST, December 14 (Xinhua) --The Administration Board of Romania's central bank (BNR)has had made a number of decisions in connection with the introduction of the single currency in the European Union's member states beginning January 1, 1999, BNR director Adrian Vasilescu said on Monday.
Vasilescu said the central bank had decided that the rates of exchange posted by hard currency operators should also include the single currency unit.
The single currency will be also used in the reports issued by the General Directorate of Monetary and Hard Currency Policy, he added.
Vasilescu said the BNR would use the Euro money unit in printed matters destined for the mass-media.
The daily exchange rates released by the central bank would include the single currency, too, he said.
The new currency will affect only the Romanian businessmen in the Euro zone and those whose trade is dominated by the single currency unit, Vasilescu said.
According to statistics, the EU is the most important commercial partner of Romania, with the bilateral trade making up 60 percent of Romanian total foreign trade.
BRUSSELS, September 21 (Xinhua) --Those who take interest in the single currency due out soon were offered from Monday onward Internet access to free information on the euro.
Eurostat, the statistical bureau of the European community, is responsible for this euro-related information program and the euro data will be updated on a daily basis.
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, European economy and finance commissioner, told the press that the publication of key euro indicators on the Internet is an important initiative and the data provided will prove useful for the economic management in the euro zone as well as in the European Union.
The commissioner said, "The euro indicators will provide member states, the European Central Bank, national central banks, financial markets, enterprises, the media and the public with the latest Economic and Monetary Union statistics essential for decision-making".
He added that the statistics would be updated at noon every day, a significant improvement on Eurostat's service.
The indicators, accessible at http:\\europa.eu.int/eurostat.html, will include national accounts statistics, monetary and financial indicators, external trade, balance of payments, prices, industry, labor market, public finance and short-term qualitative surveys.
The single currency and employment were among the top three topics for which more information is desired by the respondents to a recent EU questionnaire.
The other top topic is the rights for being a European citizen.
BRUSSELS, January 22 (Xinhua) --Two recent Eurobarometer opinion polls showed that a majority of European Union(EU) citizens are in favor of the single currency.
Two representative EU-wide opinion polls, conducted between mid October and shortly before Christmas 1995, showed that 54 percent of citizens interviewed are for the European currency, 37 percent are against, 9 percent have no opinion.
Seven out of ten find the name of the Single currency "Euro" acceptable, almost one in four say the opposite, and one in twelve have no opinion.
About the future European currency, 20 percent feel "well informed", 79 percent feel to be not well informed.
In countries such as Sweden, France, Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, more than 80 percent people feel to be "not very well informed" or "not at all informed".
BANGKOK, November 10 (Xinhua) --Thailand is considering using the European single currency, the euro, in the country's foreign reserves, the Nation reported Tuesday.
The Council of Economic Ministers of Thailand has ordered the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Thailand to study the possibility as the single European currency is set to go into circulation on January 1 next year.
A special task force will study the impact of the euro on the country's official reserves in a bid to help stem volatility of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.
"If the euro proves stable, Thailand will use it as part of our international reserves," a government official was quoted as saying.
In addition, the council also assigned the Commerce Ministry to set up a group to work with state agencies, including the Foreign Ministry, to examine the impact of the euro on Thailand's international trade.
Moreover, a study on the impact on the country's investment will be undertaken by the Board of Investment while the National Economic and Social Development Board will join hands with the central bank to dig into the impact of the European single currency on Thailand's macro-economy.
A combined European Union market is expected to be helpful for Thai exporters to gain more excess into the market.
The single currency will also benefit Thailand's import from the EU as it will reduce the operating costs of European traders.
However, the arrival of the euro is likely to reduce Thailand's trading volume with other countries significantly, the official said.
BONN, October 10 (Xinhua) --German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said today that most German companies are not prepared for the shift to the single European currency, the Euro, which is due to be launched on January 1, 1999.
Only 20 percent of German companies have taken concrete steps to get prepared for the Euro, Rexrodt said, adding that the country's state institutions were also not well prepared.
As a result, they possibly wouldn't be able to do transactions in Euro from the day it takes effect.
The European Union member states are required to completely replace their own national currencies with the Euro from January 1, 2002.
NEW DELHI, November 21 (Xinhua) --The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has permitted Indian banks to transact in the Euro, the new currency unit of the European Monetary Union (EMU), RBI sources said here Saturday.
The Euro will be launched on January 1, 1999.
In a circular issued to banks on Friday, RBI permitted banks to trade and invoice in the Euro, freely convert legacy EMU currencies into the Euro, and accept Euro-denominated bank deposits and remittances.
It also asked banks to ensure their information system's Euro-compliance.
The RBI has set up a working group to study the implications of the Euro launch.
Requests for conversion of existing deposits to Euro may be freely allowed and these rules apply to export earners' foreign currency and residents' foreign currency accounts, it said.
LUSAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) --Zambia will benefit from the establishment of the European Union Common Currency and the proposed dollar, the single currency of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), a Zambian bank official has said.
Abraham Mwenda, director of financial markets of Bank of Zambia, said that if the EU comes up with one single Euro-currency this will make it easy for Zambia to deal with one currency and help reduce costs, according to Financial Mail.
The local newspaper today also quoted senior economist with the bank Jacob Lushinga as saying that the idea of a single currency is to help facilitate trade and enhance exchange of goods that could be beneficial to Zambia.
Lushinga said the importance of the Euro-currency will depend on Zambia's major trading partners.
The EU is Zambia's second main market for non-traditional exports after COMESA.
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) --The European single currency euro will go ahead on schedule on January 1, 1999 with a broad membership, according to a survey of some prominent British economists.
The survey, carried out by the pro-European pressure group named European Movement, revealed that a majority of those polled agree that the single currency to be broadly successful, but none of them expects Britain to join the European Monetary Union (EMU) in the first wave.
Those who believe that the EMU will be a success cite low interest rates, low unemployment and low inflation as benefits of the planned single currency.
Fears of a single currency failure focus on the reduction of monetary flexibility and the risk that the European Central Bank will set interest rates too high.
Director of the European Movement Stephen Woodard said, "The single currency debate in this country has suffered from too much ill-informed speculation and too little fact".
sooddard called on Britain to make various preparations and rational debates on the single currency as "the single currency is going to happen".
"If Britain is to make up its mind on this crucial issue, it must be discussed in an informed way, free from prejudice and hype," he added.
PARIS, February 20 (Xinhua) --Declaring that "Currency is politics," French Prime Minister Alain Juppe today reiterated France's determination to realize the single European currency.
"The economic and monetary union is neither a technical issue, nor an economic demand," Juppe noted at a debate on the European economic and monetary union in the National Assembly.
"It is firstly and mainly a political plan for us".
He pointed out that such a political plan concerns the future of France and Germany, as well as the future role which the European countries will play in the world.
Stressing that the introduction of a single currency will be a great contribution to the unity of an expanded European Union (EU), Juppe reiterated France's commitment to the timetable and criteria of the single currency system set in the Maastricht treaty, under which the single European currency, recently named Euro, will be realized by January 1, 1999.
At present, qualms about a single currency still exist in France and many other EU member countries as some economists fear that a single currency means a country's loss of financial sovereignty.
Many people worry that the tough budgetary criteria for the single currency will cause rising unemployment and worsening social welfare.
In view of these confusions, Juppe gave a clear-cut answer by saying in the speech that only a single currency can guarantee currency stability, which means "lower interest rates, sustained economic growth and good prospects of employment".
Juppe demanded French leaders make efforts to eliminate the confusions.
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With the 10th anniversary of Myanmar's failed democracy uprising approaching, London-based Amnesty International is urging the military government to avoid possible violence by improving human rights.
``As this important anniversary approaches, we hope that you will begin to defuse possibilities for conflict by taking immediate steps towards improving the human rights situation,'' Amnesty's International Secretary General Pierre Sane said Thursday.
His comments were contained in an open letter to Gen.
Than Shwe, leader of the military government.
Sane suggested releasing political prisoners who were old and sick, freeing jailed members of democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's political party and ending repression against candidates who won a 1990 election the military refused to honor.
August 8th will be the tenth anniversary of the day when millions of people across Myanmar, then called Burma, demanded an end to 26 years of military rule and the installation of a democratic government.
The military responded with brutal force, gunning down at least 3,000 protesters, including Buddhist monks, and jailing thousands of others.
Rumors of planned civil disobedience inside Myanmar on the anniversary have been circulating in Myanmar exile communities in Bangkok.
The anniversary ``holds great symbolic significance for the Burmese people and for the international community.
Amnesty International is deeply concerned, therefore, about the potential for heightened tension at this time between the authorities and political activists,'' Sane wrote.
``This has been reflected over the past few weeks by political arrests and increased restrictions and surveillance of opposition leaders,'' he added, referring to the recent beating of members of Aung San Suu Kyi's party by government security forces as they tried to visit her compound.
(by Wang Jinyu) NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) --The Kenyan government last night criticized Amnesty International (AI) for its "presumptuous" report "calculated to incite Kenyans against their government".
In a press release issued here on Wednesday following a 12-day fact-finding mission in Kenya, the AI accused the government of violations of human rights and of dragging its feet on legal and constitutional reforms.
In a strongly worded rejoinder last evening to the AI statement, the Kenyan government told the visiting AI Secretary-General Pierre Sane that it would not tolerate prescriptions from AI on how to deal with alleged violations of human rights.
Kenya reminded AI that it had machinery and a working system of handling matters such as human rights violations and would continue to address itself to cases of human rights violations.
The rejoinder said that the AI obsession with the torture and human rights violations in Kenya were not genuine but were political in support of opposition political activities.
It pointed out that some cases of torture and human rights violations had always been individualized and the government had already taken actions against the perpetrators of such crimes.
"If Amnesty wanted to be fair and objective, it should have recognized the positive steps that the government has taken to deal with law enforcement officers who have gone overboard in the execution of their duties".
During its stay in Kenya, the AI delegation claimed that they interviewed a cross section of Kenyans, among them politicians, human rights activists, donors and diplomats, and released a manifesto on human rights situation in Kenya to which Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti reacted angrily.
In a commentary, the local newspaper Kenya Times, organ of the ruling Kenya African National Union, accused AI of having taken side on Kenya's political affairs, asking "can Amnesty International be trusted to produce a credible report on the human rights situation in this country"?
The commentary said that "while hundreds of thousands of innocent people were slaughtered in Rwanda, Amnesty International was busy searching for non-existent 'evidence' of human rights abuses in peaceful Kenya."
DAR ES SALAAM, August 7 (Xinhua) --The Tanzanian government today characterized the 1996 Amnesty International Report as biased and aimed at sowing seeds of hatred among the Tanzanian population.
This stand was included in a press release issued by the Tanzanian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, which said the report is one-sided narration derived from hear-say and wild allegations made by some disgruntled members of the Tanzania community bent on furthering their personal and political ends.
The press release accused the Amnesty International of portraying a negative image of Tanzania as a hostile country to refugees while internationally omitting the great care it has always undertaken to uphold conventions governing the accommodation of refugees.
On the allegation that there were acts of human rights violations in Zanzibar, the release deplored the organization's report for relying only on complaints made by the opposition party in Zanzibar without carrying any considerations or views of the government and the ruling party.
In conclusion, the press release of the Tanzanian Foreign Ministry said the Amnesty International report seriously lacks probity and in-depth scientific research, an absolute essential for the credibility of any presentation on social work.
NAIROBI, March 14 (Xinhua) --The Rwandan government has expressed deep outrage about Amnesty International's continued campaign aimed at tarnishing the image of the country.
The Rwandan government said that the London-based international human rights watchdog is siding with "genocidal" forces sowing terror in parts of the northwest of the country.
In issuing slanderous and baseless allegations that the Rwandan army has massacred hundreds of unarmed civilians, Amnesty International "is serving the interests of those who decimated up to one million people in 1994," the army spokesman Emmanuel Ndahiro told Rwanda News Agency (RNA) Saturday.
Amnesty International released a press statement on Friday in which it accused the army of killing several hundreds of civilians for the January-February period.
Reports published by Amnesty International since the Rwandan Patriotic Front took over power in 1994, have always been characterized by bias and tendentious allegations which throw doubt on its commitment to the defense of human rights.
"Amnesty seems to be another hand of the insurgency and therefore is pushing the arguments and the agenda of the criminals who are continuing the genocide," Ndahiro observed, accusing Amnesty International of being the mouthpiece of Hutu hardliners.
For Rwandan authorities, it is no surprise that Amnesty International is making up new reports shortly before the visit by the U.S.
President Bill Clinton later this month.
"Amnesty International is part of international lobbies championing the cause, if any, of diehard Hutu extremists," Ndahiro alleged.
"It is totally unacceptable that at a time some people are trying to associate with Rwandans in the process of recovery from the aftermath of the genocide, Amnesty International is busy mud-slinging the Rwandan government," he noted.
MOSCOW (AP) _ Serious human rights violations persist in Russia despite President Boris Yeltsin's declaration of 1998 as Russia's Year of Human Rights, Amnesty International said Monday.
Derek G.
Evans, deputy secretary general of the human rights group, said in a statement that torture of prisoners continues, the death penalty has not been abolished and there is still no alternative military service for conscientious objectors.
``Amnesty International remains seriously concerned at the deep gap emerging between the president's declared intentions and the practical measures being put in place,'' Evans said after meeting with Russian media.
Although Russia promised to abolish capital punishment when it joined the Council of Europe in 1996, Justice Minister Pavel Krashennikov said last week it would be premature to do away with the death penalty.
Evans said the Russian government was keeping the death penalty because it did not want the expense of providing for life imprisonment for about 1,000 people.
``In other words, it is cheaper to kill,'' he said.
Another concern for Amnesty International is conscientious objection to military service.
``While the Russian Federation's Constitution guarantees this right, no legislation has been enacted to create an alternative civilian service of non-punitive length,'' Evans said.
He also said that civilian prisoners in pre-trial detention were kept in conditions ``so severe as to constitute torture''.
Evans said Amnesty International has provided the government with a preliminary analysis of the human rights situation in Russia and some 51 proposals for meeting international standards. (jai/mr)
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A leader of Brazil's landless movement, sentenced to 26 years for his part in two killings, did not receive a fair trial, Amnesty International said Tuesday.
The human rights group called for an impartial retrial of Jose Rainha Jr.
, one of the leaders of the Landless Rural Workers Movement and said he was a potential prisoner of conscience, in a report that was to be issued Wednesday.
Amnesty International uses the term ``prisoner of conscience,'' for people punished for their ideals rather than for criminal acts.
Rainha was found guilty last November of participating in the 1989 killings of a farmer and police officer that occurred when movement members stormed a farm in Pedro Canario 370 miles (600 kms) northeast of Rio de Janeiro.
He was sentenced to 26 years in prison.
The landless movement promotes the takeover of land it considers unproductive as a way to pressure the government into speeding up its agrarian reform program.
Amnesty Internation's report was to call for stepped-up pressure up against police violence and maintains that human rights violations continue against Indians and the landless, Fiona Macaulay, the organization's Brazilian researcher, said by telephone from London.
The report, however, praised the government for creating a National Human Rights Secretary.
It also backed moves to protect crime witnesses and reform the country's police and criminal justice system.
Rainha remains free pending a retrial, which Brazilian law grants anyone sentenced to more than 20 years for a single crime.
Rainha is due to be retried later this year in Vitoria, the capital of Espirito Santo, a move that Amnesty International has backed.
Amnesty International has said in the past that there is ``compelling evidence'' that Rainha was falsely convicted of the killings.
At the first trial, defense lawyers argued that 14 members of the 21-member jury pool had links with local farmers, and three were related to one of the shooting victims.
``His trial did not meet international standards of impartiality.
If he is jailed under the same circumstances at his retrial we will consider him a prisoner of conscience,'' Macaulay said Tuesday.
ANKARA, June 24 (Xinhua) --Amnesty International's 1996 annual report on human rights is flawed and one-sided, a statement issued by Turkey's Foreign Ministry said here today.
The statement said that Turkey is surprised and disappointed to find itself again the target for unfair accusations by Amnesty International, adding that the Amnesty International's annual report gives a distorted and defective picture of the human rights situation in Turkey in 1995.
The report fails to take adequate account of changes in Turkey during 1995 and simply repeats allegations it made in previous years.
It makes no mention of the constitutional and all legal reforms that Turkey carried out last year in a bid to enhance human rights, the statement noted.
It added that Amnesty has again brushed aside the fact that Turkey has a functioning parliamentary democracy and terrorists are trying to undermine it by force.
Amnesty plays down terrorist violence but exaggerates alleged abuses by the forces of law and order, said the statement.
Amnesty fails to make it sufficiently clear that violence can never be a legitimate instrument in the pursuit of human rights.
Indeed, some people reading this report could get the impression that Amnesty believes violence can be a legitimate instrument, the statement said.
KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Amnesty International called on Rwanda Monday to reinstate the U.N. human rights mission it suspended in May because of a disagreement over the agency's operations in the country.
A delegation representing the U.N.
Human Rights Field Operations in Rwanda arrived in Kigali Sunday for five days of talks with the government.
``The UN Human Rights Field Operation is one of the very few international organizations left monitoring and publicly reporting the human rights situation in Rwanda,'' said London-based Amnesty International.
``It would be disastrous if the U.N.
High Commissioner for Human Rights now agrees to remove or dilute this essential part of the operation's mandate''.
The Rwandan government said in May it suspended the mission because of lack of coordination.
The government said the mandate of the mission, which was set up following the 1994 genocide, was due for review.
Rwanda wants the mission to halt monitoring human rights abuses and devote its efforts to educating people about human rights.
The Amnesty statement said the Rwandan government has set a deadline of July 27 for reaching agreement on the mission's mandate, otherwise it will close down the operation.
``The human rights situation in Rwanda is critical,'' the Amnesty statement said.
``We receive almost daily reports about killings and `disappearances,' and the UNHRFOR is indispensable for investigating and documenting these cases on the ground''.
Rwanda's present government took control in July 1994 after Tutsi-led rebels ousted the extremist Hutu government that had sponsored the genocide.
The slaughter left more than half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus dead.
Many of the former Hutu government soldiers and militias fled among bona-fide Hutu refugees, fearing reprisals, and returned only in Nov.
1996. Amnesty and the U.N. human rights agency have reported that thousands of people have since been killed in attacks by Hutu rebels and counterattacks by the predominantly Tutsi military. (dmc/sl)
LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for Amnesty International sought a High Court injunction Wednesday to stop Gen.
Augusto Pinochet fleeing the country if the British government blocks his extradition to Spain to face charges of genocide and torture.
The lawyers moved as speculation increased that Home Secretary Jack Straw was close to announcing the decision he has to make by Friday.
Amnesty International fears that if Straw blocks extradition, the 83-year-old general will be whisked back to Chile before the group can make a last bid to keep him in Europe.
Its first move would likely be to argue before a judge that any decision by Straw to block extradition would be lawfully wrong.
``We are asking the court to give us the opportunity to challenge any decision he might make which is adverse to us,'' said Geoffrey Bindman, a lawyer for Amnesty International and other human rights groups.
``Effectively, we are seeking an injunction deferring implementation of any adverse decision pending a challenge,'' Bindman said.
Meanwhile, the general's lawyers have complained that a five-member panel in the House of Lords, Britain's highest court, that ruled 3-2 on Nov.
25 that Pinochet did not have immunity from arrest is the head of Amnesty International fundraising arm.
Spain is seeking the general's extradition for killings and torture by his security forces during his 17-year regime.
Pinochet, not seen in public since his Oct.
16 arrest in a London hospital, remained under police guard in a rented mansion at Wentworth, 20 miles (30 kms) west of London.
Earlier, The Times of London reported that Straw had refused to give Bindman any advance notice of his decision.
From the other side, lawyers for Pinochet may ask the House of Lords to reconsider its decision because of Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann's connections to Amnesty International, British newspapers reported Wednesday.
&UR; Amnesty International, 10th graf pvs (mb-mj)
LAGOS, November 6 (Xinhua) --The Amensty International (AI) launched a worldwide campaign today in an attempt to force the Nigerian government out of what the organization called "comtempt for human rights".
The group has submitted a 10-point document on reform of human rights to the Nigerian government, demanding the immediate release of all prisoners.
In another development, the Nigerian government has uncovered plans by the AI to organize a massive demostration on November 10 this year.
JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Amnesty International human rights group urged Indonesia on Monday to allow a fact-finding team to investigate accusations that the military abducted and tortured pro-democracy activists.
Dozens of activists were allegedly kidnapped by elite military troops in the months before riots and protests forced former autocratic leader President Suharto to quit in May.
Indonesian human rights workers say 14 are still missing.
Some fear they are dead.
Ten soldiers are to face courts-martial over the abductions.
The military last month dismissed former commander Gen.
Prabowo Subianto, a son-in-law of Suharto, over the affair.
To date only military tribunals have probed the kidnapping cases.
However, Amnesty International campaigner Kerry Brogan said those charged should be tried by a civilian court.
``We urge the government to give access for an independent fact finding team'' to question those allegedly involved, she told a news conference.
She said the London-based group also wants the government of President B.J.
Habibie to reveal details of human rights abuses in three troubled provinces, East Timor, Aceh and Irian Jaya, where the military had cracked down on separatists.
Last week representatives of Amnesty, a longtime critic of the former Suharto regime, held talks with Indonesia's armed forces Commander Gen.
Wiranto and his intelligence chiefs.
Brogan also urged Habibie to abolish an anti-subversion law under which hundreds of dissidents were imprisoned for criticizing the Suharto government.
Habibie has pledged major political reform and has released more than 100 political prisoners, although some still remain behind bars.
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thailand office of Amnesty International announced Monday that three publications and two journalists have won its 1998 Journalism Award for Human Rights.
Suwimol Taewasilachaikul, director of the office, said the award _ being given for the first time _ recognizes extensive human rights coverage.
The publications are the English-language newspaper The Nation, Mathichon, a Thai language daily, and Arthit Wikroh, a weekly magazine focusing on social and political developments.
The individuals are Kavi Chongkittavorn, executive editor at The Nation, and Boonlert Changyai from Mathichon.
Suwimol said that Boonlert had extensively covered the plight of the general public in Thailand and that Kavi's coverage had made a strong impact in Southeast Asia.
The awards will be presented Thursday.
LONDON (AP) _ A judge who ruled that Gen.
Augusto Pinochet does not have immunity from arrest is a director of a charity run by Amnesty International, the group campaigning for the former Chilean dictator to face charges of genocide and murder acknowledged Tuesday, while lobbyists stepped up pressure over Spain's request for his extradition.
Shouting ``take your hands out of Chile,'' Pinochet supporters demonstrated outside Prime Minister Tony Blair's Downing Street office, and opponents planned a wreath-laying for victims of his secret police.
``We are widows of members of the armed forces and policemen that were killed in terrorist attacks by Marxist terrorist groups in Chile,'' said Veronica Vallejos who handed in a letter on behalf of 700 families urging the government to block extradition of the 83-year-old general and send him home.
Controversy over links with Amnesty International of South African-born Lord Justice Leonard Hoffman was the latest twist in the tug-of-war over Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain who was arrested Oct.
16 on a Spanish warrant.
Home Secretary Jack Straw must decide by Friday whether extradition proceedings can go ahead following the 3-2 ruling Nov.
25 by five judges of Britain's highest court, the House of Lords, against Pinochet.
He is awaiting Straw's decision under police guard in a rented mansion at Wentworth, some 20 miles (30 kms) west of London.
A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or disappeared at the hands of the secret police during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule after he overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist.
But Chile's government wants him back, partly to avoid exacerbating domestic tensions and threatening the country's newly built democracy.
Amnesty International said Hoffman, 64, an opponent of apartheid who settled in Britain in the `60s, has served since 1990 as the unpaid director and chairman of Amnesty International Charity Ltd.
which gets donations for work on human rights.
His wife, Gillian, also a liberal South African, is a secretary in Amnesty International's press office in London.
Hoffman and his wife had no involvement in the Pinochet campaign, said Amnesty International spokeswoman Soraya Bermejo.
She accused Pincohet supporters of trying to divert attention from the basic issue of whether he should be tried.
``There are many lawyers who have links with human rights organizations,'' Ms.
Bermejo told the AP.
``In fact when Lord Hoffman was appointed to this case we saw him as being slightly unpredictable on a human rights,'' she added, noting that he recently ruled against a man who was sentenced to death sentence in the Bahamas, a former colony which still allows appeals to Britain's highest court.
In the Pinochet case, the five judges _ in an usual move _ allowed lawyers for Amnesty International to make representations.
The judges included another native South African, Lord Johan Steyn, who also ruled against Pinochet. (mb-mj)
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Amnesty International denounced the human rights climate in Cambodia as campaigning for parliamentary elections drew to a close Friday and urged the international community to wake up to intimidation and violence against the opposition.
Demelza Stobbings of the London-based human rights group said that political killings and threats have soared since Cambodian strongman Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier in a coup a year ago, but that on an international level ``many people are not prepared to say what is happening here''.
Killings and attacks on members of the opposition have continued during the one-month election campaign, she said, and human rights workers are inundated with reports of threats or other forms of intimidation against those who oppose Hun Sen or his ruling party.
``Activists have been intimidated, politicians have been threatened, party agents have been shot and killed, and prisoners have been illegally arrested and badly beaten by policemen while held in detention,'' Amnesty said in a statement.
``Much of the international community plays down the level of violence, sanitizes the trauma of victims and ignores the impact of human rights violence on freedom of association and expression,'' the statement said.
Hun Sen has called the elections to try to win back legitimacy and aid lost after his violent takeover, but has been accused by his critics of rigging the electoral machinery in his favor and using fear, murder and intimidation to ensure his Cambodian People's Party wins.
Unlike the 1993 United Nations-sponsored elections, which were backed by 20,000 peacekeepers, Sunday's polls are being organized by Cambodia.
But the U.N. and foreign countries have donated the bulk of the dlrs 34 million price tag and have sent 678 observers to assess whether they are credible.
The United States, which has called the process fundamentally flawed, is at odds with other entities, particularly the European Union, which find the elections the best way of returning a degree of political stability even if the elections are troubled.
Amnesty International blamed ``near silence'' from the international community for perpetuating the cycle of violence.
NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) --Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has accused Amnesty International of applying double standard in the assessment of human rights violation in the country.
He was speaking on Wednesday at both the Kenyan International Conference Center and the Kenya Science Teachers College during a workshop of the stakeholders in the small-scale enterprises.
The president wondered why government officers serving in the police force were never regarded as victims of human rights violation whenever they were murdered or injured during their course of duty.
The Kenyan Head of State pointed out that Amnesty International treated police officers as if they were not part of mankind.
He wondered what standards were used to define human rights in Africa as children carried guns in certain countries while mass killings occurred in others yet no human rights action appear to deter the trend.
President Moi pointed out that Kenya's human rights record was far much better than the grim picture the Amnesty International were trying to paint and urged the organization to be more serious in its work.
He said that Kenyans did not require people like Pierre Sane, Secretary General of the Amnesty International, to lecture them on how to conduct their affairs.
At a press conference held yesterday following a 12-day fact-finding mission in Kenya, Sane accused the Kenyan government of alleged human rights violations and police torture of suspects in the east African country.
In a statement in response to the manefesto and press release issued by Amnesty International, the Kenyan government said that all allegations by the organization were calculated to incite Kenyans against their government.
ISLAMABAD, October 3 (Xinhua) --The Afghan Taliban Militia today criticized Amnesty International for interfering in Afghanistan's internal affairs, said a report coming from Kabul.
The report quoted Amir Khan Muttaqi, minister of Information and Culture of the Taliban interim government in Kabul, as saying, "When the world says the Taliban shouldn't chop off hands of thieves, sentence murderers to death, and stone adulterers, it is interference in our internal affairs".
Muttaqi's comments followed a statement issued in London by Amnesty International that hundreds of Afghan people who sympathized with the ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani were at risk of torture, ill-treatment or worse.
"It is clear that Taliban guards are busy implementing a reign of terror in Kabul," Amnesty International was quoted as saying.
Muttaqi noted that such criticism was "an aggression against Islam" and could not be tolerated.
In the new Islamic State of Afghanistan there will be no compromise to secular laws about penalties for crimes such as theft, murder and adultery, he said.
The Taliban captured the Afghan capital last Friday after three days of fighting with troops loyal to Rabbani.
LONDON (AP) _ Amnesty International gave its backing Friday to Malayasia's jailed former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, saying that he was a ``prisoner of conscience''.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohhamad dismissed Anwar on Sept.
2 and Anwar was arrested on Sunday.
Fourteen of his associates have also been detained, Amnesty International said.
``Anwar and his associates are prisoners of conscience detained solely for non-violently calling for political reforms and for holding different opinions to the prime minister,'' Amnesty International said.
``By misusing Malaysia's laws to detain political opponents, Prime Minister Mahathir is contravening international legal standards on freedom of expression, the right to a fair trial and the treatment of detainees,'' the organization added. (rb)
NAIROBI, June 5 (Xinhua) --Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti today expressed the hope that Amnesty International would in the future "be sensitive to Kenya's national sovereignty".
He noted that his government would not succumb to "recommendations which question Kenya's national sovereignty or are couched in the peremptory and prescriptive terms which are usually employed in master-servant relationship".
In response to a memorandum by Amnesty International on human rights situation in Kenya, the Kenyan leader told the visiting Amnesty International delegation led by Secretary General Pierre Sane that his government appreciated constructive criticism made in good faith.
The concerns raised in the memorandum cover a range of issues including constitutional reform, ordinary legislative reform and executive administration of laws.
Saitoti, who is also Minister of Planning and National Development, highlighted his government's commitment to upholding the doctrine of separation of powers, and termed as "fiction" of alleged executive interference of judiciary.
He underlined the independence of Kenya's judiciary, adding that a legal notice had been promulgated delinking the judiciary from the executive.
Referring to the constitutional reforms, the vice-president said that after the general elections this year, a commission would be appointed to review the Kenya constitution.
He pointed out that the government had appointed a task force to review public order and security laws including the preservation of public security act, the administration police act and the societies act.
The Kenyan government also appointed another task force to review the penal laws and procedure and both task forces are at work, he added.
The Kenyan leader said that President Daniel arap Moi pledged on June 1 that the public order act would be replaced by a peaceful assemblies act which would liberalize the exercise of the freedom of assembly.
LONDON (AP) _ War crimes are being committed in Kosovo, and each day greater numbers of civilians are falling victim to displacement, torture and death, Amnesty International said Tuesday.
The vast majority of victims are ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of the population of the Serbian province, but Serbs are also suffering human rights abuses at the hands of armed Albanians demanding independence, the international human rights organization said.
``Excessive use of force seems to be the norm for both sides in the conflict,'' it said.
``Albanian civilians in particular have come under artillery, mortar and other weapons fire from the Yugoslav forces, but the Kosovo Liberation Army has also deliberately or indiscriminately attacked civilians _ Albanian as well as Serb''.
Clashes between Serbian government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, the armed wing of the Albanian independence movement, have left more than 300 people dead and an unknown number of others wounded and missing.
Some 70,000 people have fled their homes _ about 45,000 to other parts of Kosovo, 13,000 to neighboring Montenegro, and another 13,000 to northern Albania, Amnesty International said.
``Survivors are fleeing a combination of deliberate or indiscriminate attacks resulting in many dead and wounded, arbitrary arrests or abductions, the deliberate destruction of homes and other gross human rights abuses,'' it said.
Amnesty International's Secretary General Pierre Sane told a news conference that ``war crimes are being committed in Kosovo today''.
``Only the high level of scrutiny given by the international media...
has prevented the number of people displaced, missing, tortured or killed from escalating much farther,'' he said.
Sane urged the international community to recognize Kosovo ``as a human rights crisis ...
not simply a threat to regional security''.
And he said ``only when a comprehensive human rights agenda is put in place can Kosovo's crisis begin to be resolved''.
Earlier this month, the U.N. war crimes tribunal investigating human rights violations in Yugoslavia announced that it was sending investigators to Kosovo.
Paul Miller, an Amnesty International researcher who returned from Kosovo on Sunday, cited a number of incidents where there may have been ``grave breaches'' of international law.
These included the killing of some 50 Albanians, including women and children, by excessive Serb force in the village of Prekazin March; the May 25 shooting of where five ethnic Albanian men in the village of Ljubinic; and the disappearance of nine men from Poklek who were taken into custody by Serb forces on May 31.
But Miller said it has been difficult to determine who among the 250 ethnic Albanians and 50 Serbs had been unlawfully killed, and so far no suspected perpetrators of war crimes have been identified. (eml)
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Amnesty International on Friday demanded a government probe into what it said were unauthorized detention camps run by two armed Tamil groups opposed to the secessionist Tamil Tiger rebels.
In a letter to President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the London-based human rights organization said the two groups were helping Sri Lanka's military fight the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, known as the LTTE.
``In the last few years, Amnesty International has repeatedly raised concern about the persistent practice on the part of the army and the police in the north and east to allow (if not encourage) members of armed Tamil groups opposed to the LTTE to carry out search operations or screen civilians,'' Amnesty International said in a statement.
The statement said the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam and the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization operated by more than 20 detention camps.
Sri Lanka's government has introduced several measures to safeguard the welfare of detainees, but Amnesty International said the measures are enforced poorly, if at all.
The Tamil Tigers are fighting for a separate homeland in northeastern Sri Lanka for the island country's minority Tamils.
They accuse the majority Sinhalese of discriminating against Tamils in education and jobs.
More than 54,000 people have been killed in the fighting since 1983.
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The human rights group Amnesty International on Tuesday called on countries concerned about Cambodia's political crisis to pressure its government to end violence and intimidation directed against the opposition.
The London-based organization urged the ``Friends of Cambodia'' _ a grouping of foreign governments formed to help restore stability after a coup d'etat last year _ to use its influence to ease repressive measures, including a ban on foreign travel by opposition members of parliament.
Foreign ministers from the group are meeting this week at the U.N.
General Assembly session in New York.
The appeal came two weeks after the Cambodian government ordered police to break up street rallies protesting alleged ballot fraud by strongman Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party during the July election.
At least four protesters were killed and dozens more injured and arrested during the crackdown.
United Nations human rights investigators have discovered 21 corpses, many with signs of torture, in its aftermath, prompting speculation that the death tally could be higher.
Amnesty called on the Cambodian authorities to publicly account for all opposition activists who have been arrested and to release anyone who has been detained for participating in ``peaceful political activities''.
``These latest human rights violations are the consequence of near-total impunity for authorities who abuse their power, reinforced by the complicit silence of the international community,'' Amnesty International said in a statement received by e-mail.
Amnesty also urged the opposition, led by Ranariddh and former finance minister Sam Rainsy, to refrain from using anti-Vietnamese rhetoric in speeches.
As many as five ethnic Vietnamese were recently killed in Phnom Penh by angry mobs after a poisoning scare.
``We regret the inflammatory rhetoric that opposition figures have used against Cambodia's ethnic Vietnamese minority, and condemn recent racist attacks,'' Amnesty said.
``But these do not excuse a more generalized crackdown on legitimate and peaceful protest and expressions of public discontent''.
The government responded over the weekend to the U.N.'s discovery of bodies with a report from its own recently-created ``Cambodian Human Rights Committee'' summarizing its investigations into six bodies found between Sept.
1 and Sept.
18. Suggesting that at least some of the murders were the result of common crimes, the government reported that one murder appeared to be the result of an extramarital affair, another was related to a theft of bananas and that the other four were still under investigation.
Several of the bodies, the government's report noted, were found with their hands bound behind their backs or shot at close range, but no link was made to the crackdown on the street demonstrations.
BONN, July 3 (Xinhua) --The human rights watchdog Amnesty International accused German police of racism in a report issued here today, repeating a similar charge in 1995.
According to Michael Butler, Amnesty's investigator responsible for Germany, evidence collected since 1995, which listed 40 cases involving police violence against non-Germans or German nationals of foreign extraction, showed that police racism was part of a pattern.
Butler also accused prosecutors of being dilatory over claims of police violence and the courts of being partial to police in dealing with such cases.
Amnesty demanded that the states establish independent complaints boards and compile annual statistics of such complaints.
The Amnesty report was immediately challenged by the interior ministers of Germany's 16 states, who denied the police were racist as a whole and noted that the misdeeds of individual policemen were objectively and thoroughly investigated by prosecutors and the courts.
In Germany, every state has its own police force.
Amnesty International also complained of similar police violence in Britain, Denmark, Italy, France, Austria and Switzerland.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ London-based human rights group Amnesty International accused the South Korean government Saturday of trying to control what was supposed to be an independent national human rights commission.
President Kim Dae-jung has promised to launch a watchdog commission to monitor human rights violations by police, prosecutors, intelligence officials and other government agencies.
But according to the Justice Ministry's draft law, most of the commission members will be government officials or people recommended by the justice minister and appointed by the president.
The draft legislation ``does not in its present form conform to international human rights standards.
It would result in a commission which lacks independence and investigative powers,'' Amnesty International Secretary General Pierre Sane said in an open letter to President Kim.
``We are therefore extremely concerned that the government...
intends to secure adoption of this law without adequate public consultation,'' said the letter, a copy of which was faxed to The Associated Press.
On Tuesday, Justice Minister Park Sang-cheon said the government plan was ``just a draft'' and more public consultation will follow.
President Kim, who had himself been persecuted by former authoritarian leaders, became the first opposition leader to win the presidency after emerging victorious from elections last December.
He has since promised to promote human rights .
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) --Secretary General of the Amnesty International Pierre Sane warned today that Israel will set a sinister precedent if it legalizes forms of torture against Palestinian detainees.
Sane issued the warning during a meeting with Israeli Justice Minister David Liba'i here, urging Israel to stop such legislation.
Speaking to reporters following the meeting, Sane criticized Israel's continued use of torture and other inhumane methods in interrogating Palestinian detainees suspected of being involved in violent attacks.
On the first visit ever by head of Amnesty International to Israel in nine years, Sane said that he has come to the region to ensure that human rights guarantees be respected by both Israel and the Palestinians as the peace process advances.
He demanded that both Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) ban policies that violate human rights.
Israel must ban the use of torture against all the detainees and revise open-fire guidelines established by the military, he said, adding that administrative detention must also be stopped and the Israeli authorities must ensure that the trials are fair.
Meanwhile, Sane demanded that the PNA halt methods of torture and put an end to arbitrary political arrests in the autonomous areas.
In addition, he made a request that the PNA stop unfair trials and abolish death penalty.
Sane and his delegation arrived here on Tuesday.
The delegation met with PNA President Yasser Arafat and four Palestinian Council members in the Gaza Strip Wednesday.
On Wednesday, Sane warned that human rights can not be ignored in the rush to attain peace.
He said that he was concerned that human rights issues are being pushed aside in favor of security concerns.
"When you look at the priorities of the various parties, their priority is peace, not human rights," he said.
LONDON (AP) _ Despite its human rights pledges, Britain's Labor Party government continues selling arms to countries such as Indonesia and Algeria, and seeks to deter political asylum seekers, Amnesty International said Tuesday.
The London-based organization said, too, that Prime Minister Tony Blair's government is quick to condemn human rights abuses by nations with which this country has negligible trade, including Sudan, Iraq and Myanmar, while reluctant to act against important political and trading partners.
In a report, the organization cited China, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and the United States _ criticized by Amnesty International for having the death penalty _ as countries that Britain treats delicately.
``Commercial and strategic interests often still dominate foreign policy,'' said Amnesty International.
``This has led to `constructive partnership' with countries involved in serious human rights abuses such as China and Saudi Arabia but clear public condemnation of abuses in countries of limited strategic importance such as Sudan and Myanmar,'' it added.
Myanmar is also known as Burma.
However, Amnesty International said the Foreign Office has made real improvements since Labor defeated the Conservative Party government in May 1997 national elections.
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook pledged soon afterward to put human rights ``at the heart of foreign policy''.
In an audit of Cook's pledge, Amnesty International praised Britain for, it said, seeking to set up an International Criminal Court in Rome, publishing an annual report on human rights, banning land mines, and taking ``limited measures'' to restrict arms sales to countries that may use them to commit human rights abuses.
However, the organization complained that since Labor took power, the Trade Department has granted 10 licenses for arms exports to Algeria, 10 for Colombia, 59 for Saudi Arabia, 64 for Indonesia and 146 for Turkey.
A Trade Department spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said licenses were granted only after consultations with the Foreign Office and Defense Ministry.
A year ago the government blocked two small arms deals to Indonesia of Land Rovers and sniper rifles worth about 1 million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million).
Britain's total weapons trade with Indonesia is worth more than 200 million pounds (dlrs 320 million) a year.
On asylum seekers _ whose numbers have soared in recent years, including many seeking a better way of life, Amnesty International said genuine cases were regarded with grave skepticism by government officials.
``The principal message that the government is sending to those who flee persecution is to keep out of the United Kingdom,'' said the report. (mj-acw)
MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA reiterated its willingness Monday to open peace negotiations with the government, but fell short of announcing a permanent cease-fire as has been demanded by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
ETA also said that there have been no direct contacts yet with Aznar's government.
The group apparently was responding to a government spokesman's statement Friday that officials had made ``significant contacts'' in peace efforts with ETA.
The organization, blamed for nearly 800 killings in its 30-year-old battle for an independent Basque homeland in northern Spain, began an open-ended, unconditional cease-fire Sept.
18. Aznar has said the group must do more to show that it is committed to a permanent peace before substantial negotiations can begin.
In its three-page announcement Monday, written in the Basque language, ETA said it will maintain its truce but it made no mention of making its cease-fire permanent or of laying down its arms.
The government, in a goodwill gesture, announced Friday that 21 ETA inmates from far-flung prisons will be moved to jails closer to their homes.
Those transfers will take place Tuesday.
ETA, a Basque-language acronym which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has long demanded that the more than 500 ETA prisoners held in Spanish jails be transferred closer to home.
The government keeps them scattered around Spain to prevent them from plotting while behind bars.
&LR; &LR; BILBAO, Spain _ As NATO rushes troops and equipment to the Balkans, a powerful ethnic separatist movement is building toward a showdown on the Alliance's own Atlantic flank.
Confronted with unprecedented political opposition and public anger, Spanish rule in Basque country is close to foundering _ adding a Western European chapter to the breakups that have shattered Yugoslavia and other Eastern European countries since 1990.
For the first time, a unified Basque-nationalist regional government was elected in October, following the declaration of a cease-fire by ETA, the underground separatist army that has waged a bloody 30-year war against Madrid.
The cease-fire was answered by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar with a hard-line crackdown, deeply alienating most voters and ending decades of cooperation between Basque moderates and Spanish political parties.
``I don't make gestures.
I apply the law,'' Aznar says about his refusal to meet the cease-fire with conciliatory measures, much less peace negotiations.
``There's essentially no contact anymore between our people and the central government,'' says Gorka Agirre, a leader of the mainstream Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) in Bilbao, the region's largest city.
``Our fathers and grandfathers could only &LR; &LR; dream of a free Basque land.
My generation believes that we will actually create one,'' says Dabid Lizarralde, 21, a university student in the coastal town of Algorta, 10 miles north of Bilbao, as long-distance runners swept by in a province-wide race organized to support Basque language studies.
The runners, backed by $35 donations for each kilometer, were diverted around the town center to avoid colliding with a parade sponsored by Herri Batasuna, the political arm of ETA.
They passed directly in front of an 8 p.m. demonstration by parents of Basque political prisoners that has occupied Algorta's main intersection every evening for four years.
Portraits of the town's 13 sons and daughters in Spanish prisons were posted in taverns, restaurants and shops.
Greeted by musicians playing Basque folk songs on traditional instruments, crowds of people poured out of the local railroad station from yet other demonstrations in Bilbao, including a silent protest march that blocks the city's principal thoroughfare each Friday.
Basque country in 1999 recalls Prague or Budapest a decade ago, when endless demonstrations and a sense of history-in-the-making brought ordinary life to a giddy standstill.
There are echoes, too, of the violent Kurdish separatist war that has killed thousands in Turkey, and of stubborn ethnic nationalist movements that have troubled other NATO governments during the past few years in Scotland and Wales, Corsica, northern Italy, Flemish Belgium and Quebec.
Basque nationalists follow all of these movements closely, and maintain quasi-diplomatic relations with several, in what amounts to a de facto alliance of ``stateless nations'' inside NATO that stretches from the British Isles to the Aegean Sea.
The new regional government has invited the outlawed Kurdish parliament to convene in Bilbao in July, and it protested the sales of arms manufactured by Spanish firms in Basque country to the Turkish government.
Madrid has officially prohibited the convention, setting the stage for a confrontation over Basque ties to the Kurds.
But the closest kinship is with Ireland, where the very institutions and tactics of separatist rebellion are cut from the same cloth _ and where the connection has a six-decade history, speaks in the lilting brogue of Dublin and has a Basque family name: Gallastegi.
Now an energetic 73, Iker Gallastegi arrived in Ireland in September 1937 at age 10 with his parents and five siblings.
It was the height of the Spanish Civil War, and Basque country was in flames.
Eli Gallastegi, Iker's father, was a leading Basque nationalist, singled out for liquidation by General Francisco Franco's Fascists when the family fled Spain.
Dublin was already his second home.
Inspired by the stubborn Irish fight for independence, the elder Gallastegi had written a history of the 1916 Easter Rising against British rule, and in 1932 founded a trading firm in Bilbao to import eggs, potatoes and pork from the young Irish Free State.
In their Dublin exile, the Gallastegi children were raised on an uncompromising mixture of Basque separatism and Irish republicanism.
Eventually, that education led Iker himself to return to Basque country as a young nationalist organizer in 1952 under an assumed name, and to flee once again just ahead of Franco's police.
``I had to beat the dust in 1952,'' he says.
``It was 17 years before I was able to return home, after Franco was dead''.
The rebellious family tradition has carried into the next generation.
Gallastegi's daughter Usune, 35, has been in a Spanish prison since 1994, sentenced to an eight-year term for ``collaborating with terrorists''.
The exchanges between Ireland and Basque country that began with the Gallastegis continue at a brisk clip today.
``We're not married, but you could surely say that we are living together,'' says Gallastegi.
The result is a set of matched political structures that frame, in tandem, Western Europe's two oldest ethnic nationalist movements.
The relationships between the underground ETA and Herri Batasuna _ and major elements in their strategy, training and recruitment methods _ are mirror images of the relationship between Sinn Fein, the militant but legal Irish political party, and its own armed wing, the Irish Republican Army.
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has made at least half a dozen visits to Bilbao, according to Herri Batasuna officials, and other high-ranking members of the two parties consult regularly on tactics.
During several assignments in and around Belfast in recent years, a Chronicle reporter encountered visiting groups of militants from Jarrai, the Herri Batasuna youth organization, boisterously participating in Republican political demonstrations.
So boisterously, in fact, that republican leaders were obliged to restrain the young Basques, who in one instance tried to lead a headlong charge against police lines.
Spanish police charge that these visits include military field training under IRA supervision, and they allege that Jarrai is behind a spate of firebombings directed at officials of Aznar's conservative People's Party in Basque country.
``Obviously, the ties extend to a working relationship between ETA and IRA on some level.
There's a tremendous amount of traffic back and forth between Bilbao and Belfast,'' acknowledges a Basque leader, speaking off the record.
``But that's not something to be discussed publicly''.
As in Northern Ireland, where the Royal Ulster Constabulary is effectively a Protestant police force, Basques face a law enforcement agency _ Spain's Guardia Civil _ that employs virtually no members of its own community.
In yet another echo of Irish Republican tactics, Herri Batasuna has compiled lengthy lists of unmarked police car license plate numbers and has posted them in popular taverns run by the party in nearly every Basque town and village.
Like its significant other in Ireland, Herri Batasuna ran candidates in regional elections for three decades, only to decline the seats it won in protest against ``foreign rule''.
Then, last year, the IRA declared a permanent cease-fire, and Sinn Fein sat down at the negotiating table with its adversaries.
Within weeks, ETA and Herri Batasuna followed suit.
The result was a dramatic September meeting in the city of Lizarra, 70 miles south of Bilbao, at which all nine nationalist political parties and 14 Basque labor and cultural organizations issued a joint declaration calling for multiparty negotiations toward self-rule.
``Before Lizarra, the football field had always been the Spanish state,'' says Eusebio Lasa, a member of Herri Batasuna's national council.
``What we decided at Lizarra is that the field must be Basque country itself _ that the future should be up to the Basque people and not simply concessions from officials in Madrid''.
Modeled consciously on the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, the Lizarra Declaration set the stage for the election, one month later, that ushered in the unprecedented nationalist-run regional government.
Between them, the moderate PNV, Herri Batasuna and a third nationalist party now hold 41 seats in the regional parliament, against 30 for the People's Party (PP) and the Socialists.
``The situation has changed enormously,'' says Gorka Agirre of the PNV, which leads the new governing coalition, the first in history not to include either the Socialist Party or the PP.
``We agree now (with Herri Batasuna) that there was no great difference between those two parties when it came to Basques.
Neither was interested in talking about a different future here, about any real self-determination,'' he says.
PNV leaders point out that few, if any, regional autonomy measures promised as long ago as the 1970s were implemented when the Socialists or conservatives were part of the regional governing coalition.
According to the Spanish constitution, even a referendum on self-determination in Basque country remains strictly against the law.
This is where the Irish experience no longer fits the Basque reality.
The Good Friday Agreement was reached under the auspices of a British government desperate to extricate itself from the Northern Ireland quagmire, and more than happy to have the end game played in Belfast rather than London.
The problems since in implementing self-rule in Northern Ireland have not come from 10 Downing Street, but from die-hard factions within the unionist and republican camps.
By contrast, there is no war in Basque country between communities, no exchange of atrocities between Bilbao versions of the Catholic and Protestant gunmen who haunt Belfast.
``The enemy isn't the Spanish lad next door,'' says Gallastegi.
``It's the national state,'' in the form of a central government that responded to the historic cease-fire by arresting the very people with whom it must negotiate.
``When I arrived in power, I said, `I will never talk with ETA'.
If there is no peace, ETA and ETA alone will be responsible,'' says Aznar, pointing out that ETA has been responsible for more than 800 killings in the past three decades, mostly of government officials.
``Where there is peace, there is discussion.
Without discussion, there is no place for peace,'' counters the Rev.
Pierre Moleres, bishop of the predominantly Basque city of Bayonne in France.
Moleres' offer to help arrange negotiations was rejected by the Aznar government, which opposes any international mediation in the crisis.
The crackdown began just as Basque nationalists were laying the groundwork for the cease-fire in October 1997, when the entire 23-member leadership council of Herri Batasuna was sentenced to lengthy jail terms for distributing a video that presented ETA's terms for peace.
According to many observers, the imprisoned council members were the most negotiation-minded of the organization's factions to hold sway in years.
They join more than 500 Basque political activists now in prison.
Since then, ETA militants have been found dead, under suspicious circumstances that recall the work of secret assassination squads in the 1980s that were linked to the Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez.
In late April, under pressure from Madrid, French police rounded up six more nationalist leaders in Paris.
Gallastegi's niece Irantzu, a key figure in the ETA bid for peace, was one of those arrested.
``Every effort we've made to search an accord with Aznar, to promote dialogue, has been negative,'' says PNV's Agirre.
``Me, I want peace,'' Aznar insists.
``But they are trying to obtain independence.
That's the difference between us.''
BILBAO, Spain (AP) --Pumping their fists in the air to shouts of ''Long live ETA''! several thousand people paid tribute Saturday to four young Basque separatists who blew themselves up by accident, reportedly while preparing an attack.
A police helicopter hovered in overcast skies as Arnaldo Otegi, leader of the pro-ETA Basque coalition Euskal Herritarrok, pointed to poster-size photographs of the four --two of them just 22 years old -- and praised them as freedom fighters.
Police had feared incidents between the crowd and opponents of ETA, the armed Basque separatist group, but the rally went off peacefully.
Speaking before crowd waving red, white and green Basque flags, Otegi said it was a pity that men so young had to die in the Basque conflict.
He blamed the Spanish government, saying it had to yield to what he called Basques' desire for self-rule.
''We did not choose violence, but there is no other path,'' Otegi said at the rally in the heart of Bilbao, the largest and richest Basque city.
ETA's armed drive for an independent homeland carved out of parts of northern Spain and southern France has claimed nearly 800 lives since it began in 1968.
In the Basque language, ETA stands for Basque Freedom and Homeland.
Police believe the four ETA members who died had intended to launch an attack on Bilbao.
On Wednesday, prosecutors filed a suit against Otegi, accusing him of advocating terrorism after he described the four who died as ''colleagues and patriots''.
Earlier Saturday, suspected supporters of the armed group threw a firebomb at a Civil Guard member's home in the latest in a series of small-scale attacks in the northern Basque region.
Nobody was hurt in the incident in Vitoria, the region's capital.
The house, belonging to a Civil Guard member who was not identified, was damaged by fire as the guardsman's 17-year-old son was inside the building.
During the past three days, assailants have thrown Molotov cocktails at bank offices, burnt some 13 buses and dozens of cars and attacked automatic teller machines in different Basque cities.
They have been protesting the deaths of the four suspected ETA members.
On Friday, ETA claimed responsibility for 12 attacks between early May and late July.
But the armed group did not mention a shooting of an army officer Wednesday or two car bombings that killed a Basque business leader and injured 11 people Tuesday.
Police and politicians have blamed ETA.
MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government has ruled out any discussion of Basque independence in possible peace talks with the armed separatist group ETA, an official said Tuesday.
The government will only negotiate terms for ETA to surrender its weapons and the fate of more than 500 ETA prisoners, government spokesman Josep Pique said.
``In the peace process, this is all there is to talk about,'' Pique told reporters in Barcelona.
ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in its 30-year campaign for an independent Basque nation carved out of parts of northern Spain and southern France.
The group began observing an open-ended cease-fire on Sept.
18. Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said last week his government is willing to hold preliminary talks with ETA.
The purpose of these discussions would be for the group to confirm it really wants peace, the government said.
VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ A former leader of the Basque separatist group ETA urged the government Thursday to transfer ETA prisoners to jails inside the Basque country as a first step towards peace talks.
``When all ETA prisoners are transferred to the Basque region, this will make it easier for us, not just as prisoners but as Basque citizens, to participate in the new process underway,'' Jose Antonio Urrutikoetxea, himself a prisoner, told reporters.
Better known by his nom-de-guerre Josu Tenera, he is serving time in a Madrid prison for belonging to an armed group.
He was let out of a Madrid jail briefly Thursday to register for the seat he won in the Basque regional parliament in elections held Oct.
25. Urrutikoetxea said he was speaking on behalf of 535 ETA members held in prisoners all over Spain, sometimes as far away as the Canary Islands, as a way to keep them from plotting behind bars.
One of ETA's long-standing demands is for the prisoners to be moved to facilities in or at least near the Basque country.
ETA declared an open-ended ceasefire on Sept.
16. The government has responded saying that if ETA renounces violence for good, it is prepared to discuss measures like prisoner transfers or furloughs.
But ETA and moderate Basque nationalist groups insist the government should act first on the prisoners issue to open the way for talks.
In what was seen as a goodwill gesture, the Interior Ministry last month transferred four ill prisoners for treatment in hospitals of their choice. (mr/dw)
MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar is considering paying damages to relatives of people killed by government-backed death squads that targeted Basque separatists in the 1980s when his Socialist predecessors were in power, a spokesman said Wednesday.
``This is a subject that is being analyzed now.
That is all there is to say,'' spokesman Josep Pique told reporters.
The death squads, which called themselves the Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, killed 27 people from 1983 to 1987 in a campaign designed to crush the armed Basque separatist group ETA.
Many of the victims were mistaken targets.
Jose Barrionuevo, interior minister under then-Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, and his deputy for state security, Rafael Vera, are serving 10-year jail terms for their role in organizing a botched 1983 kidnapping that marked the GAL's first act.
Pique also rejected a call Tuesday by ETA's political wing, Herri Batasuna, for a blanket amnesty for more than 500 jailed ETA members as a way to end decades of separatist conflict.
He reiterated the government position that if ETA, which declared a ceasefire Sept.
16, renounces violence for good, officials are willing to consider transferring some ETA prisoners to jails in or near the Basque country in line with a long-standing ETA demand.
Pique also said the government is ``still waiting'' for a response from ETA to Aznar's offer of exploratory talks to discuss whether the group is willing to renounce violence.
The government insists that if full-blown peace talks do get underway, it is prepared to discuss only the prisoner issue and ETA disarmament, not ETA's stated goal of an independent Basque homeland.
ETA is a Basque-language acronym that stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom.
Its bombings and shootings in the Basque country and elsewhere in Spain have left nearly 800 people dead since 1968. (dw)
BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ Thousands of sympathizers of the radical Basque political coalition Herri Batasuna demonstrated Saturday demanding a negotiated solution to the violence in the northern Basque region, news reports said.
Marchers shouted slogans in favor of Basque independence and improved conditions for prisoners from the armed separatist group ETA, a reporter from the El Correo newspaper based in this industrial city said.
Herri Batasuna, considered ETA's political wing, wins about 14 percent in elections held in the northern Basque region.
The demonstration came two days after Manuel Zamarreno, a governing party councilor from the small Basque town of Renteria, was killed by a bomb blamed on ETA.
After Zamarreno's funeral on Friday, thousands demonstrated in silence in the nearby coastal city of San Sebastian to repudiate ETA violence.
While not directly supporting ETA attacks, Herri Batasuna leader Jon Idigoras told Saturday's marchers that ``the repression'' of radical Basque nationalism by the government, ``only lengthens the conflict unnecessarily and causes unnecessary victims,'' the national news agency EFE reported.
ETA, an acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed close to 800 people during its 30-year campaign for an independent Basque state straddling the Spanish-French border.
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has ruled out negotiations with Herri Batasuana unless it distances itself from ETA, or ETA lays down its arms.
The coalition was forced to elect a new leadership in February after its entire 23-member executive board was jailed for using an ETA video calling for peace talks during an election broadcast. (jt)
Armed Basque separatist group ETA announces cease-fire MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA has announced an open-ended cease-fire, a newspaper reported late Wednesday.
The radical Basque daily Euskadi Informacion said it had received a statement from ETA in which the separatist group announced a truce in its 30-year-old battle for an independent Basque homeland in the north of Spain, the state-run news agency EFE reported. (dw)
BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ A gang of hooded youths who support Basque separatism pelted police with Molotov cocktails and other projectiles at a street fair in Bilbao, leaving 17 people injured, authorities said Saturday.
Two of the injured were in serious condition.
The 30-minute melee occurred outside the town hall as an estimated 100 youths set upon members of the Basque regional government's police force.
Police reported two arrests _ a 19-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl.
The latter was one of the two people seriously injured, suffering burns when an incendiary device went off in her hands.
The girl was placed under arrest after she was hospitalized.
The other serious injury was a middle-aged man who was attacked for yelling at the youths who assaulted police.
Overall, 17 people were injured, including five policemen, Europa Press reported.
Similar violence rocked another Basque town, Getxo, last Saturday as youths with Molotov cocktails burned down a three-story apartment building.
Its residents were evacuated in time and no injuries were reported.
After that incident, Herri Batasuna, the political party linked to the armed separatist group ETA, said for the first time that the party opposed street violence as a way to further the Basque separatist cause. dw
MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and the Basque militant group ETA have made direct contact for the first time, taking a step toward new peace talks, a newspaper reported Thursday.
The communication was limited to a recognition that the government and ETA would have future contacts, the daily El Mundo reported, quoting unnamed government sources.
Aznar last week authorized contacts with ETA, and promised to inform the public of all developments related to the Basque peace process But Francisco Martos, a spokesman for Aznar's office refused to comment, saying that the delicacy of the issue requires discretion.
The latest possibility of a negotiated end to ETA's 30-year violent campaign for an independent Basque homeland straddling the Spanish-French border dates to Sept.
18 when ETA announced an indefinite cease-fire.
Spain's government gradually softened its position on the truce, with initial skepticism turning into a promise of dialogue.
The government insists, however, that the agenda will not include the subject of Basque independence.
The government says it is willing to talk about the fate of ETA's 535 prisoners in return for a clear commitment to give up violence forever.
ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom _ has killed nearly 800 people since taking up arms in 1968.
The government last held talks with ETA in 1989 in Algeria when the Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez was in office.
The talks broke down and the violence resumed.
DEBA, Spain (AP) --A bomb damaged a discotheque in Spain's northern Basque region Sunday in an attack claimed by Basque separatists.
Nobody was hurt in the explosion shortly before 11 a.m., but police said the bomb caused extensive damage to the Txitxarro discotheque in the town of Deba, some 15 miles west of coastal city of San Sebastian.
Basque police said a man identifying himself as a member of the Basque armed group ETA warned of an imminent explosion at the disco.
The anonymous caller also said that two people who were cleaning inside the discotheque had been left handcuffed to a tree in the road of Itziar toward Hendaya.
A short time later, a hunter found a man and a woman tied to a tree and reported it to police.
The two confirmed that there were no other people inside the discotheque at the time of the explosion, which mainly damaged the building's roof.
The mayor of Deba, Jesus Maria Aguirrezabala, said that the target of the blast was the owner of the disco, Narciso Korta, who is a brother of a businessmen killed in a car bomb in August.
ETA has claimed responsibility for that bombing.
ETA regularly targets the Basque business community as part of its independence campaign.
A series of attacks by ETA in the last two months are seen as an acceleration of the campaign of the armed group.
It has been blamed for about a dozen killings this year since it ended a 14-month truce last December.
Nearly 800 people have been killed since ETA started its campaign for independence 30 years ago.
ETA, a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, demands the right to self determination for Spain's three Basque provinces in the north.
It envisions an independent state that would also incorporate Basque regions in southwestern France.
Historically, the Basques have maintained a separate cultural identity and language.
For some, ETA's fight is a legitimate battle for sovereignty.
But the majority of Spaniards oppose their goals, pointing out that under Spain's democratic constitution, the Basques enjoy more autonomy than any other region in Europe.
MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA chalked up two more slayings in its violent campaign for an independent homeland straddling the Spanish-French border.
ETA said it killed Tomas Caballero _ a town councilor from the northern city of Pamplona _ on May 6 and retired Civil Guard officer Alfonso Parada two days later some 80 kilometers (50 miles) farther east in the town of Vitoria.
In a communique published in Tuesday's edition of the radical Basque newspaper Elgin, ETA confirmed it was responsible for the slayings and several other recent attacks.
Caballero and Parado were shot dead, the fourth and fifth slayings attributed to ETA this year.
It is common for the separatists to wait several weeks before taking responsibility for attacks via communiques sent to Egin.

BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist movement ETA accused the Spanish government Wednesday of trying to snuff out the Basque language.
The charge came in a statement published in a radical newspaper, Euskadi Informacion.
In the Basque language, known as Euskera, Euskadi is the word for the Basque country, a region straddling the border between Spain and France.
ETA took issue with ``enemies of Euskera who do not have the right to live in Euskadi''.
It said the governments and Spain and France were trying to ``close off the language and force it into a ghetto to be eliminated little by little''.
``France and Spain are maintaining their imperialism,'' the statement said.
Euskadi Informacion is a makeshift publication that surfaced after the daily Egin was shut down in July over its alleged links to ETA.
An estimated 600,000 people speak Euskera in the seven Basque provinces in Spain and France, according to the University of the Basque Country, in San Sebastian.
It was among regional languages that were officially banned under the dictatorship of Gen.
Francisco Franco from 1939 to 1975.

Madrid, June 24 (Xinhua) --Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said that the week-long unilateral cease-fire started today by the militant Basque separatist group Eta is a propaganda stunt.
The cease-fire, said the prime minister, was designed to disrupt a upcoming meeting of Basque parties opposed to Eta, which over the past 27 years has killed more than 750 people.
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Javier Mayor Oreja called on the Eta, which has fought for a separate Basque state made up of four northern Spanish provinces and three southwestern French departments, to release prison officer Jose Ortega Lara it has held for five months.
He urged the parties attending the Tuesday meeting to concentrate on uniting against the Eta and not squabble over the response to the cease-fire.
Carlos Iturgay, the Popular Party spokesman in the Basque country, said talks with the Eta should not be considered.
The opposition Spanish Socialist Workers Party said the week-long cease-fire was insufficient and that the Eta would have to offer more before negotiations could be considered.
The Basque regional government, which is led by the moderate Basque Nationalist Party, said the cease-fire provided a reason for hope but called on the Eta to give up its arms altogether.
The Eta has said it will hold Ortega Lara until the government changes its policy of placing Eta prisoners in jails outside the Basque Country.
Some 30 of the 600 Eta members in Spanish prisons are due to be moved to the Basque country in coming weeks.
MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain said Friday it will move 21 Basque separatist inmates from far-flung prisons to jails closer to their home region, a move seen as a gesture to the armed Basque group ETA.
The announcement by the Interior Ministry came exactly three months after ETA began observing an open-ended ceasefire in its 30-year battle for an independent homeland.
Since then, the government has been under pressure from both hardline and moderate Basque nationalists, and even the mainstream Socialist opposition party, to make a significant gesture to ETA on its long-standing demand that separatist prisoners be transferred to the Basque country, or at least closer to it.
In late October the government moved four ailing ETA prisoners to the Basque country itself.
Officials insisted this was for humanitarian reasons only.
The government keeps more than 500 ETA prisoners scattered around the country to avoid their plotting behind bars.
The interior ministry said 21 will be moved to jails in the south of the mainland from prisons in the Canary Islands off the coast of West Africa, the Balearic islands in the Mediterranean, or from Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish enclaves on the northern coast of Morocco.
The ministry said the transfers would begin immediately.
It named the prisoners but did not list their crimes.
In November, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said he had authorized exploratory talks with parties close to ETA to determine whether the group was prepared to renounce violence for good.
Aznar insists that the peace process cannot advance in earnest without a permanent end to the violence.
And even so, he says the government is only willing to discuss prisoner transfers and other issues involving ETA inmates, ruling out talks on ETA's stated demand of independence.
The group, whose name means Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in its campaign for a separate homeland in the Basque country, an area which straddles parts of northern Spain and southern France. (dw/krt)
MADRID, Spain (AP) _ It's election time in Spain's troubled Basque region, bringing with it a flurry of attempts to end three decades of violence in which nearly 800 people have been killed by ETA rebels fighting for an independent Basque homeland.
Basque nationalists this week urged ETA, one of Europe's few remaining armed political groups, to renounce bloodshed so that a political solution can be found.
Pressure on ETA to declare a unilateral cease-fire has increased since Saturday, when Basque nationalists and other political groups, including radical ETA-linked political party Herri Batasuna, took a joint position on the issue.
Their so-called Lizarra Declaration calls for peace talks and a permanent end to the violence.
But when asked Wednesday about the possibility of an ETA cease-fire, Interior Ministry spokesman Juan Delgado said, ``It would be a trick truce''.
ETA, the initials in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and Freedom, and Basque political parties seek an independent nation carved out of pieces of northern Spain and southern France.
The group has killed 800 people since it took up arms 30 years ago, and was extremely active during the Socialist administration of ex-Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez in the early 1980s, killing dozens of police officers every year.
Most Basque politicians, while supporting ETA's goal, have urged the rebels to stop the killing.
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government insists it will not negotiate with ETA or its political allies until ETA renounces violence.
The Lizarra Declaration came out of a forum promoted by Herri Batasuna and held in the Basque city of Lizarra.
It was signed by representatives of 23 political parties, labor unions and grassroots groups.
but the forum was boycotted by Spain's two most powerful political parties, the ruling Popular Party and the opposition Socialists.
ETA declared a truce for one week in 1996.
It ended with a series of bomb attacks on tourist resorts when the government refused to negotiate unless ETA renounced violence.
MADRID, July 13 (Xinhua) --Three bombs, claimed by the Basque separatist ETA, went off in the southern Spanish city of Malaga early today but nobody was injured.
The explosions, seemed to be designed to cause no casualties and little damage, were the latest of a series of small blasts reported this week in the area.
Local police evacuated an area near the city park after receiving a warning call from someone claiming to be an ETA member.
ETA, or Basque Homeland and Freedom, has been fighting since 1968 for an independent Basque state, leaving 800 people dead.
MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government has ruled out any discussion of Basque independence in expected peace talks with the armed separatist group ETA, a government spokesman said Tuesday.
Spokesman Josep Pique said the government would only negotiate terms for ETA to surrender its weapons and the fate of more than 500 ETA prisoners in jails around Spain.
``In the peace process, this is all there is to talk about,'' Pique told reporters in the northeastern city of Barcelona.
``No one should think there is going to be any kind of political negotiation on the basis of what might arise when the violence ends,'' he added.
Pique was speaking a day after a senior official from the opposition Socialist party warned that ETA, which began observing an open-ended ceasefire on Sept.
18, was attempting to force full-blown talks on the future of the Basque country as its price for renouncing violence for good.
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, flush with a strong showing by his center-right Popular Party in Basque regional elections on Oct.
25, said last Tuesday his government is willing to hold preliminary talks with ETA.
The purpose of these discussions, the government said, would be for ETA to confirm that it really wants peace.
Two days later ETA issued a statement that fell short of promising a permanent end to violence.
The document was dated before Aznar's offer.
In it ETA supported a Basque nationalist peace proposal that calls for a two-track process made up of negotiations between the government and ETA, on issues like weapons and prisoners, and separate all-party talks on the future of the Basque country.
These latter discussions would touch on ETA's stated goal of independence, according to this blueprint signed by a broad range of nationalist Basque parties and known as the Lizarra Declaration after a town in Spain's northern Basque region.
Pique's remarks ruling out talks on independence come as both sides jockey to shape a peace-talks agenda that suits them best, with the government seeking to keep it as narrow as possible, while ETA is trying to push it open.

BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ Former Italian President Francesco Cossiga arrived here Monday for a four-day visit which he said was aimed at getting a firsthand view of the peace process in Spain's Basque region, news reports said.
Skirting questions as to the possibility of him mediating in resolving the Basque problem, Cossiga told reporters he was ``here as a friend'' and had been invited to the northern Spanish region by the governing Basque Nationalist Party.
His visit comes as Spain and the three-province Basque region enjoys its third month of peace following the Sept.
18 cease-fire by the armed separatist group ETA.
On Monday, Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said Cossiga ``could come and go'' in Spain as often as he likes but stressed that no intermediaries were needed to resolve the Basque conflict, the private Europa Press news agency said.
The Italian centrist leader praised center-right Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's decision to begin making contacts to sound out ETA's long-term intentions before full negotiations take place.
Cossiga added that peace in the Basque region would help consolidate the European Union.
During the visit, Cossiga is to hold talks with Basque Nationalist Party leaders and visit the several political and cultural sites.
He did not rule out a meeting with representatives of Herri Batasuna, the political wing of ETA.

SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) --A politician was gunned down Tuesday in the street of a northern town in the latest in a series of slayings blamed on the armed Basque separatist group ETA.
Manuel Indiano, 29, was shot 10 times in the chest and abdomen outside his candy store in Zumarraga, a Basque town, about 250 miles north of Madrid, police said.
Indiano, who authorities said refused police protection normally offered politicians in the Basque region, died in the town's hospital an hour after the attack.
His wife, pregnant with their first child, was admitted to a hospital later in shock.
Although not a member of the governing Popular Party, Indiano became a councilor in Zumarraga for the party six months ago.
The conservative party fiercely opposes Basque separatism and other moves to change Spain's political makeup.
No one took responsibility for the shooting, but Interior Ministry officials immediately blamed ETA, which began its campaign for independence of the three-province northern region in 1968.
The killing brought to 12 the number of slayings --five this month -- attributed to ETA since it ended a 14-month truce last December.
The group, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has been blamed for killing nearly 800 people.
It normally claims responsibility for its attacks several weeks after carrying them out.
Officials believe the latest ETA campaign seeks to push the government to the negotiating table.
A single round of talks during last year's truce ended in stalemate.
The killing was condemned by political parties, labor unions and Amnesty International.
''We are faced once again with the confirmation that the terrorist group ETA has no other aim but to impose its will on others and exterminate all those who don't think like they do,'' said deputy Prime Minister Marian Rajoy.
Indiano's body was to be brought to Madrid, where his parents live, for burial Wednesday, news reports said.
Hundreds of people gathered Tuesday evening in Bilbao, San Sebastian and Vitoria, the capitals of the three Basque provinces, to observe a few minutes of silence.
The quiet was broken by periodic shouts against ETA.
In Zumarraga itself, at a special town meeting called to condemn the killing, one of three councilors who belong to the pro-ETA party Euskal Herritarrok tried to read a communique but was drowned out by shouts of ''murderers''.
While security force members have long been ETA's main target, in recent years the organization has begun killing more politicians, particularly those of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's Popular Party.
Aznar, who was on a visit to Poland on Tuesday, survived a car-bomb attempt on his life in 1995 when he was in the opposition.
BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ The recent cease-fire by Basque gunmen provides a prime opportunity to resolve Spain's Basque conflict and the international community, particularly the United States, has a duty to help bring this about, Irish republican leader Gerry Adams said Monday.
``Powerful nations have a duty to assist, and clearly the United States is the most powerful,'' Adams, who heads the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party, told a press conference shortly after arriving in this northern Basque town.
``We would be calling on the international community to assist in every situation, but especially one like the Basque country where an initiative has been taken,'' said Adams.
Adams was greeted at the start of his half-day stay by some 100 Basque independence supporters waving Irish and Basque flags.
The Irish leader was expected to be handed a proposal for all-party peace talks signed by Basque nationalist parties grouped together in the so-called ``Irish Forum''.
The forum is hopeful Adams will pass its proposal on to President Bill Clinton when the two meet this month.
Adams described Clinton's input into Northern Irish peace process as ``crucial and pivotal''.
A copy of the appeal _ credited with encouraging the armed Basque separatist group ETA to call the truce _ has already been sent to South African President Nelson Mandela and the United Nations.
On Sept 18, ETA began an indefinite and condition-free cease-fire in its campaign for an independent Basque state that it hopes would unite territory in northern Spain and southwestern France.
The organization, whose name is an acronym in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968.
The Spanish government has long ruled out ETA's demand for a self-determination vote for Basques.
The Irish Forum claimed inspiration from the Northern Ireland peace process and its success in opening the door for a political settlement in the troubled British province.
Speaking before some 50 journalists, Adams _ whose Sinn Fein party has long had close connections with the Herri Batasuna party allied to ETA _ called on the Spanish government to put aside its ``distrust'' of ETA and ``grasp this opportunity'' for peace.
Conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has insisted that ETA must provide greater proof of its peaceful intentions before a peace process be set in motion.
During his stay in the Basque country, Adams was also to visit a Herri Batasuna member Karmelo Landa in his prison cell on the outskirts of Bilbao.
Landa was jailed last December along with 22 other party leaders convicted of collaborating with ETA for using television electoral broadcast time to show a video in which the gunmen called for peace talks.
ETA commanded considerable support in the Basque region and elsewhere in Spain during the final years of the 1939-75 dictatorship of Gen.
Francisco Franco.
Today, however, most people believe an armed campaign for independence cannot be justified given the level of self-government the Basque region enjoys since democracy returned in 1978.
Adams was to return to Belfast later Monday. (jt/cg)
VITORIA, Spain (AP) _ Spain's Socialist party has pulled out of the three-party Basque regional government because of links between the coalition's principal member and an outside group allied to the armed separatist organization ETA.
The Socialists, the leading opposition party in Spain's national parliament, announced the split accusing the Basque Nationalist Party of getting too close to Herri Batasuna, the political wing of ETA.
Most parties in Spain have agreed to isolate Herri Batasuna until it condemns ETA's violence.
ETA, whose name stands for Basque Homeland Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for Basque independence.
On Thursday, Basque regional government chief and Basque Nationalist Party member Antonio Ardanza appointed three new councilors to replace the Socialist representatives who resigned a day earlier.
The split came just under four months before fresh regional elections are held on Oct.
25. The Basque Nationalist Party won 22 of the 75-seats in the 1994 ballot, has shared power with the Socialists who won 12 and the Basque Union, which won eight.
In recent months the Basque Nationalist Party have promoted attempts to bring Herri Batasuna into the fold so as to encourage a political solution to the region's conflict.
The Basque region, located close to Spain's border with France, is one of 17 semiautonomous regions in Spain. (cg/jt)
RENTERIA, Spain (AP) _ A governing party town councilor was killed Wednesday by a bomb in an attack believed to be carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA, national Spanish radio reported.
Manuel Zamarreno of the Popular Party in this northern Basque town died after a bomb exploded when it hit his car, the radio said.
According to the report, two other people in the car were also injured in the attack that took place shortly after 11 a.m.
(0900GMT). If the reports prove correct, Samareno will be the sixth victim of ETA so far this year.

PARIS, September 16 (Xinhua) --The chief of the Basque militant group ETA, Ignacio Gracia Arregui, was arrested Friday evening by French security force in southwest France, a media report said Saturday.
Arregui, also known as "Inaki de Renteria", was arrested when he was with his wife in an apartment in the village of Bidart in the French Basque country.
The arrest came as ETA was launching an intensive campaign of attacks against the Spanish authorities.
ETA has killed 12 people in terrorist attacks since the end of its truce with Madrid last December.
Born in 1955 in Renteria, Spanish Basque country, Arregui is the highest leader of ETA and leader of its military wing since 1992, according to the Spanish Interior Ministry.
He was believed to be the mastermind of the abortive assassination plot in 1995 against King Juan Carlos in the island of Palma de Majorque.
MADRID, July 2 (Xinhua) --A group of Spanish political parties will meet here next week to mobilize against the Basque separatist group ETA, Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said today.
The July 10 meeting is aimed at "uniting all democratic forces in the struggle against terrorism," Mayor Oreja said.
Participating in the meeting will be those who adopted in 1987 a common stance in fighting the terrorist war launched by the ETA, and have since formed a political alliance.
The national alliance has been allying with its regional counterpart in Basque, in northern Spain, to quell the ETA, namely the Basque Homeland and Freedom.
The meeting, which came on after the ETA's week-long unilateral truce ended Monday, was expected to strengthen the links between the national and regional anti-terrorism alliances.
The Herri Batasuna party, the ETA's political wing, will be excluded from the meeting.
The ETA has been fighting for a separate Basque state for 27 years.
About 750 people were killed in the pro-independence war.
When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrives in Thailand for this week's ministerial meeting of ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations, she will demonstrate American support for a regional grouping that can boast of many successes and one flagrant failure _ the military dictatorship ruining Burma.
It is becoming harder and harder for ASEAN members to ignore the depredations of the Burmese junta.
No country in ASEAN suffers more directly from the junta's crimes than host Thailand.
For much of the past decade, the Thais have been democratizing a polity long dominated by corrupt military officers.
At the recent AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa, the US ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, rightly praised the Thai government for its success in implementing policies to reduce the spread of HIV.
But the uniformed thugs who rule Burma are undermining those hard-won triumphs.
Whereas Bangkok has achieved exemplary progress in substituting legal cash crops for the poppies used to make heroin, Burma under the junta continues to be a principal source for the heroin that destroys lives from Bangkok to Boston.
And where there is heroin addiction there is an inevitable increase in the rate of HIV infections and cases of AIDS.
Recently, a new evil has come cascading into Thailand from Burma: millions of easily smuggled tablets of the stimulant methamphetamine.
Although noninterference in the internal affairs of member states is a founding principle of ASEAN, the cross-border flow of narcotics, HIV, and refugees into Thailand demonstrates the folly of pretending that Burma's ASEAN neighbors are not affected by the junta's misrule.
``Lack of good governance is at the root of our country's troubles,'' the leader of Burma's democracy movement, Aung San Suu Kyi, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed article.
ASEAN members ought to heed her temperate yet resolute counsel.
They should pressure Burma's military junta to enter a political dialogue with Suu Kyi, Burma's ethnic nationalities, and the National League for Democracy, the party elected overwhelmingly in 1990 but immediately denied its right to govern by the military.
&UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR; &QC; Much of our energy at the State Department is spent encouraging foreign governments to act for what we perceive to be the common good _ dissuading regional rivals from provocative acts, promoting economic reform, blocking destabilizing transfers of arms and technologies, urging the release of political prisoners and advocating the development of democratic practices and institutions.
We do this to prevent conflicts, build prosperity and strengthen the forces of freedom.
But to succeed, we must convince foreign leaders that the common good is good for them as well and that our own agenda is aboveboard.
Obviously, we do not use the same approach with an established modern power that we use with a government whose authority is weak and institutions wobbly.
We consider the domestic pressures that may be affecting a government along with the proclivities and capacities of its leaders.
And in any relationship, we refer constantly back to our basic principles and goals.
For example, there has been much debate about whether we are more likely to influence the actions of ornery foreign governments by using the carrot of engagement or the stick of sanctions.
The answer, of course, is that it depends.
Neither China nor Burma is democratic, and both take a dim view of dissent.
Yet we are engaged in a strategic dialogue with China while maintaining far tougher sanctions, including an investment ban, against Burma.
Some accuse us of having a double standard.
In reality, we have a single standard based on our assessment of the approach most likely to achieve results that serve U.S. interests and ideals.
In Burma's case, a repressive military regime has rebuffed repeated appeals for talks with the democratic opposition led by Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi.
Under the junta, Burma has become, with official connivance, the world's leading source of heroin and, with official neglect, the epicenter of a regional AIDS crisis.
Many of its increasingly desperate people are fleeing to neighboring countries.
The democrats, who overwhelmingly won Burma's last free elections, have called for a halt to foreign investment and many categories of aid.
Political change is essential if Burma is to transform itself into a source of stability in Southeast Asia.
Sanctions may well work.
Having driven the economy into the ground, the regime desperately needs foreign investment, loans and aid.
By denying these benefits _ and encouraging others to do the same _ we may eventually persuade Burmese leaders to rethink where their own best interests lie.
America's stake in China is far deeper and broader than in Burma.
Asian security, nonproliferation and economic health cannot be won without Chinese cooperation.
Our task is to encourage China to become a full and fully constructive participant in the international system.
Our approach is to engage in a dialogue with Chinese leaders while encouraging the broad exchange of information and ideas between American and Chinese citizens.
Unlike Burma, China is changing rapidly.
The government is committed to economic reform.
On proliferation, China has progressed from advocating the spread of nuclear weapons to signing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention while agreeing to tighten controls on sensitive exports.
In the political sphere, China has placed a new emphasis on the rule of law, permitted somewhat more open public discussion of political reform, released several prominent dissidents and ratified one international human-rights convention while promising to sign another this fall.
In contrast to Burma, many Chinese reformers welcome Western political and commercial engagement with their government as a spur to further openness and change.
Moreover, the Dalai Lama, among others, has praised the U.S.-China dialogue as an appropriate way to express American support for preserving the cultural, linguistic and ethnic heritage of Tibet.
Critics are right to say that this progress is not good enough.
That is why President Clinton spent much of his time during the Beijing summit working on the hard issues: urging China to do better on nonproliferation and political prisoners, pushing for more open markets, stressing that our improved relations cannot come at Taiwan's expense and making the case for democracy directly and compellingly to the Chinese people.
It would be presumptuous to suggest that our engagement alone will cause democracy in China to blossom.
China's future will be determined by the Chinese.
But our engagement can contribute to an environment in which the Chinese people have more access to information, more contact with the democratic world and less resistance from their government to outside influences and ideas.
It is too early to draw definitive conclusions about the success of our policy toward China or Burma.
In both cases, we hope for progress; in neither do we expect miracles.
Toward these countries and others where we hope for change, we must be patient and persistent.
And we must design our policies not with a cookie cutter but with the special characteristics of each in mind.
All this argues for flexibility.
There has long been tension between the executive branch and Congress over mandated sanctions, prohibitions, restrictions, earmarks and other restraints on foreign policy.
Having worked in both branches, I know that this tension is inevitable and, at times, constructive.
When I meet with foreign officials, referring to pressure from Congress can help to spur action.
What is not helpful is the growing tendency to view entire relationships through the prism of a single issue or to enact laws that deprive the executive of the leverage needed to bargain effectively.
The true challenge of diplomacy does not reside in the beauty of our goals.
Foreign policy is practical, not aesthetic.
It requires persuading others to agree to new policies and actions based on new understandings.
That may entail simple logic, economic incentives, technical assistance, new commitments, information-sharing, coercion, the threat of coercion, sanctions, the threat of sanctions or any combination of the above _ and it may require a different mix of those elements tomorrow than it does today.
To do his job well, the president must be able to pick and choose.
You would not ask a carpenter to build a house with only a hammer.
We should not expect our chief executive to construct a successful foreign policy without a full box of tools.

YANGON, March 1 (Xinhua) --A high-ranking Myanmar military official said Sunday that the authorities made timely arrest of 40 persons in January, who allegedly attempted to commit terrorist acts in the country.
In a press briefing here Sunday, Colonel Kyaw Thein, head of the Office of Strategic Studies of the Myanmar Defense Ministry, said the terrorist group, led by Ko Thein of the All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF), plotted to launch bomb attacks against some civilian targets.
The ABSDF is an anti-government student organization operating on the Myanmar-Thai border sine November 1988.
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Exiled dissidents from Myanmar urged Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai on Friday to reschedule a trip to Myanmar by his top general because it will coincide with the anniversary of the military government's takeover.
Army Commander in Chief Gen.
Chetta Thanajaro is scheduled to visit Myanmar, also known as Burma, from Sept.
15-18. It will be his final trip to Thailand's western neighbor as he is scheduled to retire this year.
Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in various guises since 1962.
The current military government came to power on Sept.
18, 1988 after brutally crushing a nationwide democracy movement.
The All Burma Students Democratic Front asked Chuan in a letter on Friday to urge the army chief to reschedule his trip.
``Thailand is a democratic country and the military government in Burma killed many people in 1988.
Recently they have arrested nearly a thousand members of opposition parties,'' said Aung Naing Oo, chairman of the ABSDF.
He said Chetta's trip would create a negative image for the Thai government and the Myanmar military would use the visit for propaganda.
&UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR; &QC; Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese Nobel Peace laureate, may be the most spied-on, or surveilled, human being on earth.
The SLORC _ State Law and Order Restoration Council _ which took over Burma in 1988 and changed its name to Myanmar, sees Suu Kyi as a primary threat.
She heads the country's popular opposition movement and, given her personal charisma and extraordinary family history, she has a strong claim on the allegiance of the Burmese people.
Suu Kyi's father, Aung San, led a successful battle against British colonial rule in 1947.
He was assassinated that same year at age 32, when Suu Kyi was only 2.
Aung San remains a legend and a national hero in Burma.
There are statues of him, streets named for him and museums of his life.
His image is featured on Burmese currency, the one-kyat bill, which the SLORC yanked from circulation.
His portrait on this bill greatly resembles his daughter.
Pro-democracy protesters have adopted the note, which is worth less than a penny, as their flag of freedom.
It has come to be known as the ``democracy note''.
``I could not, as my father's daughter, remain indifferent to all that was going on,'' Suu Kyi told an audience of 500,000 at the beginning of her ``revolution-of-the-spirit'' campaign for democracy in 1988.
This was soon after a bloody takeover by the SLORC in which thousands of demonstrators were massacred in the streets.
In the 1990 elections, her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), won a landslide victory _ even though was under house arrest.
The triumph was considered a vindication for Suu Kyi, whose was placed under house arrest.
In her most famous essay, ``Freedom From Fear,'' released in 1991, Aung San Suu Kyi explains the necessity for individual transformation to bring about real change, and writes: ``Among the basic freedoms to which men aspire that their lives might be full and uncramped, freedom from fear stands out as both a means and an end''.
For a while, after being released, Suu Kyi was able to give speeches at her front gate every Saturday and Sunday, answering questions the people submitted to her.
Undaunted by roving military-intelligence video cameras and the imminent risk of arrest, thousands of Burmese would sit on old newspapers and plastic bags on the sidewalk to cheer, laugh and listen to the lady.
But the junta then banned these gatherings and since mid-1995 has kept Suu Kyi under de-facto house arrest.
The authorities have arrested hundreds of her party members and prevented Suu Kyi from meeting with journalists and diplomats.
If they leave her house, her bodyguards and assistants face being hauled off to one of Burma's horrific prisons.
When awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 _ while again under house arrest _ Suu Kyi was cited by the Nobel Committee as ``one of the most extraordinary examples of civil courage in Asia in recent decades''.
The SLORC _ buoyed by billions from Burma's booming drug trade and foreign investment _ shows no intention of turning over power peacefully.
Further repression and major bloodshed loom on the horizon.
Still, Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers remain steadfastly committed to the path of nonviolence.
This interview was conducted by telephone in January 1997, shortly after a violent incident in which Suu Kyi was in her automobile, en route to visit pro-democracy supporters.
A mob of thugs _ some throwing stones, some wielding iron bars _ surrounded the vehicle and smashed the windshield.
It was, the world press noted, in an area controlled by government forces, who did nothing to intervene.
&UR; -0- &QL; Q: The attack on you and your colleagues in your car was a serious threat to your security.
What were your thoughts in that moment when your car was being attacked?
SUU KYI: It was quite interesting.
(She laughs).
I was fairly detached.
I saw it all as an observer.
There were all these faces crowding in toward the car, and there was one man in front with an iron bar in his hand, who I assume was the one who made the big gash in my windscreen.
I just said, ``Keep moving'' _ I made the decision that we were simply going to continue on to meet the crowds that had come to support us.
One of the boys who was in the car with us was a bit angry about the whole thing, so I spent some time calming him down and telling him not to be angry.
But it was clear to us that the attack was a deliberate attempt to harm us badly or even kill us.
It is, of course, very serious.
But we do not consider our own personal safety as any more serious than the safety and security of the people in general.
Q: In the United States, some cities and the state of Massachusetts have chosen not to do business with companies that deal with Burma.
Is this an effective means of supporting democratization in Burma?
SUU KYI: Very much so.
We would like to see more of this.
It's consumer power.
It's good to know that the people of different countries are really concerned and involved in the movement to help Burma.
I think in some ways it's better to have the people of the world on your side than the governments of the world, even if governments can be more effective in certain directions.
Q: In November '96 the SLORC launched a tourism campaign called ``Visit Myanmar Year''.
Are you still calling for tourists to boycott Burma?
SUU KYI: Yes, my mind has not changed in any way.
I still oppose ``Visit Myanmar Year'' and I'd ask tourists to stay away.
Burma is not going to run away.
They should come back to Burma at a time when it is a democratic society _ where there is justice, where there is rule of law.
They'll have a much better time.
And they can travel around Burma with a clear conscience.
Q: In Burma today there is an increasing availability and use of heroin on college campuses.
Why is that?
SUU KYI: The government appears to be more interested in stamping out political activity than drug addiction.
Very few university students on the campus could get away with engaging in political activities, but they seem to be able to get away with taking drugs.
We have heard that it is very easy to obtain drugs on the campuses.
Q: Why do you think the heroin used by students is sometimes nicknamed ``freedom from fear'' _ the same name as your famous essay?
SUU KYI: Perhaps it means that the only way the students can escape from the fear of the repression of the government is by taking drugs.
That would be very sad, wouldn't it?
Q: Burma provides 60 percent of the heroin imported to the United States, and many of the ethnic peoples are financially dependent on the opium crop.
Do you think crop substitution in the areas where poppies are grown would be an effective way to fight addiction?
SUU KYI: Yes, it's one way.
But basically I think that in order to do something like that, you have to win the confidence of the people, and I don't think you can win people's confidence through intimidation and repression.
First we would like to talk to the people concerned and discuss the problem with them.
That is what democracy is all about.
You talk over your problems with the people because the people are involved in the whole process of government.
As for the National League for Democracy, we are of course against the proliferation of drugs because we recognize that they are harmful, not just for our own people but for people all over the world.
Certainly a democratic government would do its best to make sure that the growing of opium is eliminated in this country and that the people who depend on growing opium for their life will find other ways of earning a living.
Q: There is a burgeoning AIDS epidemic in Burma.
Reports describe shooting galleries that service 200 addicts with one needle.
Have you heard about this problem, and do you have plans for dealing with the underlying causes of AIDS?
SUU KYI: We do hear that AIDS is on the increase, and that's partly due to the fact that the authorities never really attack problems at their source.
They seem to think that if they insist the problem does not exist, it will simply go away.
The best way to deal with AIDS is through education.
So we need a really widespread AIDS education program.
In fact, what we need in Burma is education of all kinds _ political, economic and medical.
AIDS education would be just one part of a whole program for education, which is so badly needed in our country.
Q: What do you tell people when they get discouraged?
SUU KYI: We are confident that our cause will prevail because that is what the great majority of the people in Burma want.
We all want justice and human rights.
Since what we want will benefit all the people in Burma, our cause is bound to win.
Q: How much personal danger do you feel?
Have you been threatened that if you leave your compound or try and speak to the people, you will be in trouble or you might be imprisoned?
SUU KYI: I haven't been told anything like that, but of course the official papers are always talking about ``annihilating'' our forces.
(She laughs again).
But we don't think about that too much.
There's no time to be thinking about such things.

YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ While Myanmar's military government continued its arrests of the country's democracy activists, a top general accused Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi of working with terrorists, state-run newspapers reported Thursday.
Gen. Tin Oo, one of the top four generals in the 21-member ruling military council, said Suu Kyi was working ``in collaboration with underground terrorists and some super power countries,'' the New Light of Myanmar reported.
Their goal, he said, was to cause instability and the disintegration of the nation.
Tin Oo is army chief of staff and a leader of what is considered the hard-line faction in the State Peace and Development Council, the official name of the junta.
Suu Kyi and her party follow a doctrine of political change through nonviolence.
She has cited U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King and Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi as her influences.
The military has arrested more than 500 members of Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy, since May, party leaders said Wednesday.
More than 300 of the arrests have taken place since Sunday.
The military began rounding up NLD members this week to prevent the party from convening the parliament elected in 1990.
The NLD said 129 members of parliament were arrested in the latest sweep.
A total of 187 have been arrested since May.
In addition, the All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exiles group, said the junta had arrested more than 300 students since June for campaigning for democracy.
``The ABSDF estimates that more than 900 political arrests have taken place since May, including MPs from all opposition parties, opposition party officials, students, Buddhist monks and other political activists,'' the group said.
The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
The United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and other nations, along with human rights group such as Amnesty International, have condemned the arrests and called on the military to begin a dialogue with the NLD.
On Thursday, the Burma Lawyers Council, composed of exiles, called on the country's lawyers to endorse the convening of parliament.
The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the parliament, but despite promising to hand over power to the winners before the poll took place, the military refused to honor the result.
The party set Aug.
21 as a deadline for the military to call the assembly into session.
When the generals refused, the NLD said it would convene parliament, known as the People's Assembly, on its own.
The military warned the NLD that such a move would be illegal and could result in the party being outlawed.
It claims it has arrested no one, but merely ``invited'' NLD members to military guest houses for an ``exchange of views''.
Suu Kyi, whose movements are severely restricted by the government, has not been seen in pubic since the crackdown began.
BANGKOK, Thailand _ The 10th anniversary of a crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators passed quietly Saturday in Myanmar without the violence many had feared, but also without any sign of a resolution of the country's deepening problems.
Foreign diplomats and a government official said there were no demonstrations, after warnings from the government and a reported call for calm by the opposition party, the National League for Democracy.
``I drove past some key points this morning, including the university and the NLD office and I didn't see any additional riot police or troops or any additional security measures anywhere,'' said a diplomat in the Burmese capital of Yangon, once known as Rangoon.
A statement faxed to The Associated Press said: ``There are no demonstrations in Yangon or anywhere else in the country.
Though the anniversary passed quietly, there could be stepped-up activity in the coming two weeks by the opposition, led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
She has set Aug.
21 as the deadline for convening the National Assembly, which was elected eight years ago in a vote that was annulled by the military after her party won 80 percent of its seats.
Since then the military rulers have systematically harassed and imprisoned the elected opposition members and their supporters, and have choked off any attempts at public protest.
Fearing student unrest, authorities have closed the country's universities for almost eight of the past 10 years.
Kent Wiedemann, the top American diplomat in Myanmar, said the opposition was ``clearly taking the initiative at this moment'' in an effort to force some liberalization.
``There's a principle involved: yes, they want to have the election finally recognized,'' Wiedemann said of the Aug.
21 deadline.
But practically speaking, he said, the immediate goal of the opposition is to bring the country's leaders into talks.
The military leaders have said repeatedly that they are only caretakers and that they want to make a transition to democracy.
But their refusal to honor the results of the 1990 election has raised questions about their intentions.
And they have shown no sign of softening.
``As you can see, looking at the events of the last week, the government, rather than heeding the call for dialogue, is instead adopting a more confrontational attitude,'' Wiedemann said.
He referred to stepped-up harassment of the opposition party's elected members of Parliament, the stifling of public protest and the forced return of Mrs.
Aung San Suu Kyi to her home on Wednesday after she was halted attempting to visit party members outside Yangon, and in a standoff spent six days in her car.
YANGON, Myanmar (AP) --The United States and European countries were rebuked Tuesday for passing up an international heroin conference because it was in Myanmar, one of the world's biggest producers of the drug.
Participants at the 4th International Heroin Conference said the boycott by the world's biggest heroin consuming nations ran counter to the spirit of international cooperation against drug trafficking.
``As two of the largest markets for heroin in the world, the United States and Britain bear a special responsibility to work with the rest of the international community in every way possible,'' Home Affairs Minister Col.
Tin Hlaing said in his opening address.
The four-day conference was organized by Interpol, the Lyon, France-based agency that bolsters links among national police forces.
Other countries boycotting the conference include France, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway.
Representatives of 26 other countries, including Australia and Switzerland, were listed as attending.
Washington and other critics say the military regime in Myanmar, also known as Burma, has failed to seriously crack down on drugs and has such a poor human rights record that it does not deserve the legitimacy conferred by the conference.
``The United States believes that the Burmese regime could use the conference to create the false impression of international approval, both by Interpol and by participating countries, for its counternarcotics and anti-crime performance,'' U.S.
State Department spokesman James Foley said Tuesday in Washington.
``Burma's counternarcotics efforts, while improving, are far from what is necessary.
And Burma, of course, persists in its disregard for political and human rights''.
The New York-based Human Rights Watch likened holding the meeting in Yangon to ``holding a convention on weapons of mass destruction in Baghdad, on women's rights in Kabul or on terrorism in Tripoli''.
Myanmar officials are especially sensitive to criticism on the drug issue because they feel they have made great achievements in the fight against drugs --especially measured by the number of seizures -- with almost no outside aid.
Most foreign aid to the country was cut off a decade ago following the bloody suppression of protests against military rule.
DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Nearly 50 Burmese men, women and children demonstrated in the capital on Friday against military rule in their country.
The protesters, who have fled to neighboring Bangladesh over the years, waved placards that read ``We want restoration of democracy in Burma''.
The demonstration was staged to mark the 10th anniversary of the seizure of power by military generals in Maynmar, formerly Burma.
``We want the military to hand over power to our National League for Democracy which won the elections in 1990,'' Ani Maung, a protest leader said.
In Dhaka the refugees are looked after by the United Nations.
The report says Cambodia, Haiti, Nigeria and Paraguay were not certified for cooperating but were granted a national interest waiver while Afghanistan and Burma were denied certification outright.
The two countries were not certified because they "have been world headquarters for the heroin business" for several years, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a briefing at the State Department.
"In Afghanistan, the opium harvest grew substantially, and the Taliban's full complicity in the drug trade has extended to the point where both the harvesting and trafficking of opium is taxed, " Albright told reporters.
The annual certification report has been attacked by the countries listed in the report as the interference into their domestic affairs.
Latin American countries believe the U.S. administration should focus on efforts in reducing the consumption of drugs in the United States.
YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The British embassy in Yangon denied allegations in Myanmar's state-run press that opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is a British citizen, while military-run newspapers on Friday renewed threats to deport the Nobel laureate.
Since Sunday, the military has arrested more than 300 of members of Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy, to prevent it from convening the parliament elected in 1990.
The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in that assembly.
Nearly 200 elected lawmakers are among those who have been arrested.
Despite promising before the polls to hand over power to the winners, the military refused to honor the result after its rule was overwhelmingly rejected by Myanmar citizens.
Leading generals have also recently stepped up their verbal attacks against the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, who is married to a British academic, calling her a traitor for her attempts to bring democracy to the country.
Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military since 1962.
Earlier in the week, a commentary in the state-run New Light of Myanmar signed ``Supreme Court Justice'' said that Suu Kyi is a British citizen and so the government should deport her.
Suu Kyi is the daughter of Myanmar's late independence hero, Gen.
Aung San.
A 1982 law makes dual citizenship in Myanmar illegal.
On Friday, commentaries in the military-controlled press urged Suu Kyi to go back to Britain before the government takes legal action and deports her.
``In response to recent media speculation, the British government would like to make clear that Aung San Suu Kyi is not, and never has been, a British citizen,'' a statement from the embassy said on Friday.
Earlier this week, the U.S. government issued a statement condemning the threat to deport Suu Kyi and the arrest of her party members.
The governments of Britain, France, West Germany and Japan have also condemned the arrests, as have human rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch Asia.
On Friday, groups representing three of Myanmar's ethnic groups added their condemnations for the arrests and their support for the convening of parliament.
The Wa National Organization, the Palaung State Liberation Front and the Lahu Democratic Front said the arrest were an ``insulting act of shameless, barbaric arrogance against the people of Burma''.
The NLD has said that representatives of the Chin, Rakhine and Mon ethnic groups were among those arrested in the latest crackdown, while the All Burma Students Democratic Front said more than 900 democracy activists have been arrested since May.
Discontent with the regime is widespread because of its handling of the economy.
Military bungling has turned resource-rich Myanmar into one of the world's poorest nations.
Defense spending accounts for more than half the government budget, while inflation is running at more than 60 percent, rice is in short supply, foreign investment has dried up and power blackouts are a daily occurrence in Yangon.
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ On the tenth anniversary of the military takeover in Myanmar, about 60 exiled dissidents protested in front of their country's embassy in Bangkok on Friday calling for the release of political prisoners and arrested students.
``We are calling on the military dictators to release all political prisoners, which include elected members of parliament, students, many of whom were recently arrested,'' said Angelay, the spokesman for the All Burma Students Democratic Front.
Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in various guises since 1962.
The current military government came to power on Sept.
18, 1988 after brutally crushing a nationwide democracy movement.
``Today is the tenth anniversary of the military takeover.
People in Burma have been suffering for 10 years,'' said Angelay.
The protesters were joined by ten Thai university students and one Canadian activist.
``I'm not aware of any law that prohibits me from taking part in the demonstration.
But I have been warned by the Burmese students that I face possible arrest and deportation,'' said Paul Beaulie, a resident of Quebec.
WASHINGTON (AP) --Forced labor, including child labor, are widespread in Myanmar, and the government ignores workers' rights, the U.S.
Labor Department said in a report Monday.
The report, required by Congress, updates a 1998 review of labor conditions in Myanmar, also known as Burma, which reached similar conclusions.
Based on findings of the U.S.
Embassy in Rangoon, the report says forced labor is used to construct roads, dikes, canals and projects to support tourism, military operations and commercial ventures of the military.
''The latest report on labor practices in Burma reinforces our position that the international community must continue to push for a democratic transition in that country,'' Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said in a statement accompanying the report.
YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government has detained another 187 members of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party, bringing the total to 702 arrested since a crackdown began in May, the party said Friday.
If the figure is accurate, it would be the largest number of arrests of opposition members since the nationwide democracy uprising in 1988.
More than half the arrests have taken place since Sunday, in an apparent government effort to stymie the National League for Democracy's announced plans to convene parliament.
The NLD said 194 members of parliament are among the arrested party members.
The military rulers never allowed parliament to meet after the NLD won a landslide victory in elections held in 1990.
The government avoids saying it has detained any NLD members.
It claims instead they were ``invited'' to government guest houses for an exchange of views on convening parliament.
On Thursday night it released four photographs purporting to show ``Invited guests enjoying watching TV'' and other activities.
Most of those photographed looked stiff and unsmiling.
The NLD statement, while announcing the new detentions, also said that nine members of the NLD's organizing committee in the capital had been released on Wednesday after being briefly detained.
On Friday, groups representing three of Myanmar's ethnic groups condemned the arrests and voiced their support for the convening of parliament.
The Wa National Organization, the Palaung State Liberation Front and the Lahu Democratic Front said the arrests were an ``insulting act of shameless, barbaric arrogance against the people of Burma''.
Myanmar is also known as Burma.
The NLD has said that representatives of the Chin, Rakhine and Mon ethnic groups were among those arrested in the latest crackdown, while the All Burma Students Democratic Front said more than 900 democracy activists have been arrested since May.

DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) --Myanmar's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Freedom of the City honor Saturday night in recognition of her activism in her Southeast Asian country.
Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her peaceful struggle for democracy against the military regime in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
The military regime overturned her party's resounding victory in general elections the previous year, and refused to recognize the vote as legitimate.
Hundreds of members of her National League for Democracy have since been jailed.
Suu Kyi herself was under house arrest for six years before being released in 1995.
Her movements and political activities remain heavily restricted.
She did not attend the Dublin ceremony, but her son Kim Aris flew to Ireland to collect the award in her place.
''Aung San Suu Kyi was chosen for this award because of her long courageous stand in support of democracy in Burma,'' said Dublin's Lord Mayor Mary Freehill.
''We will leave the roll of honor unsigned like we did for (South African President) Nelson Mandela, until she is free to travel to Dublin herself to sign it''.
The members of Irish pop band U2 were also given the award.
''We regard this as a very big deal for us, and we are very humbled by it.
It's humbling and it's fantastic,'' lead singer Bono said.
Freehill, a longtime admirer of the band, said: ''In a lot of ways they put Dublin on the map when the city was not as popular as it is now''.
Other figures who have received the Freedom of the City honor include U.S. presidents John F.
Kennedy and Bill Clinton, Pope John Paul II and Mother Teresa.
YANGON, October 5 (Xinhua) --Myanmar Tuesday demanded that the Thai government strictly control refugee camps on the Thai side of the two countries' border.
The demand was made by Colonel Thein Swe, head of the Department of Office of Strategic Studies of the Myanmar Defense Ministry at a press conference here Tuesday afternoon following the peaceful end of the siege of the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok by Myanmar armed men last Saturday.
He said there are 24 refugee camps along the Myanmar-Thai border where members and their families of different anti-Myanmar government armed groups such as the All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF), Kayin National Union (KNU) and Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB) are living and conducting military and "terrorist" training there involving foreigners.
Regarding the seizure of the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok and the taking of hostages by Myanmar armed men, he stressed that the receiving country should take up the responsibility for the security of an embassy stationed there.
He disclosed that five armed men --three from the ABSDF, one from the KNU and the remaining one from the God's Children Army -- were involved in the incident last Friday.
He added that the armed men demanded that the Myanmar government release all political prisoners, recognize the results of the 1990 general election and reshuffle the government.
After a 25-hour tense standoff, the five Myanmar armed men Saturday ended their siege of the Myanmar Embassy and freed all the 38 hostages before they were flown to the Myanmar border in Ratchaburi in the company of Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra.
In the decade since they seized power and renamed the country Myanmar, Burma's military rulers have become increasingly dependent on the use of forced labor and torture to maintain that power, build the country's infrastructure, and carry out its war against stubborn resistance by ethnic minorities.
Now, evidence is increasing that the Burmese army is using another tool of war against minority populations: rape.
The use of rape as a weapon in ethnic conflict is not uncommon; it's been documented in Bosnia, Rwanda, and, most recently, Indonesia.
But such occurrences in Burma on a vast scale have received little attention, in part because the rapes have been perpetrated in inaccessible areas.
The US State Department reported this year that Burmese troops ``continued to impress women for military porterage duties, and there were many reports of rape of ethnic minority women by soldiers''.
According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Myanmar (Burma), government troops have been abducting ``increasing numbers of women, including young girls and the elderly'' and subjecting them to rape and other abuses.
The Burmese Women's Union alleges that ``women have been raped in an organized and systematic way'' by the army.
A civil lawsuit filed on behalf of Burmese citizens in a US federal court in 1996 targeted the Burmese military junta and two oil companies --Unocal Corp.
, then based in Los Angeles, and Total of France --for abuses allegedly committed during construction of a natural gas pipeline in Burma, charging that ``girls and women have been raped in the presence of family members''.
The court, which ruled last year that Unocal and Total could be held liable for rapes committed by their military partner, will hear the case next year; the junta was dropped as a defendent because the court said it had no jurisdiction over a foreign government.
The UN Commission on Human Rights says women most likely to be raped are refugees, internally displaced women, and women belonging to ethnic minorities or the political opposition.
Rapes by the military typically occur during raids on villages; when women are abducted for forced labor; during encounters with victims of forced relocations in the jungle; and in coerced marriages.
Rape is systematically being used by Burma's military as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing, according to interviews with human rights workers and exiled pro-democracy officials.
Bolstering those contentions is a new report by EarthRights International, a legal rights group based in Washington and Thailand, that accuses Burma's military of ``the savage domination of women outside the scope of acceptable wartime conduct''.
The report also says that ``the violent sexual abuse of ethnic Burmese women at the hands of the military occurs in epidemic proportions''.
Activists are urging the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women to investigate the claims of systematic rape.
Thaung Tun, deputy chief of mission at the Burmese embassy in Washington, denies there is anything to investigate.
``It is hardly possible for rape to occur in Myanmar on a policy basis.
Maybe on an individual basis.
But if it happens, there are laws in place, and people would be punished''.
Many of Burma's soldiers are teenagers, often abducted by the army.
According to EarthRights, they are given little food, forbidden contact with their families, and forced to beat each other for punishment.
Abused physically and humiliated every day, the young recruits are then set loose among the ethnic minorities they have been indoctrinated to believe are ``the people's enemy'' and ``internal destructionists''.
Many ethnic leaders and pro-democracy activists claim that the violence against women is directly related to the military's goal of wiping out all ethnic resistance, even if it means genocide against a particular minority.
One widely circulated document --whose origin remains unverified -- appears to lend credence to the claims that rape is a conscious tool of war in Burma.
Marked ``top secret'' and dated only a few weeks after the military takeover in 1988, the document is addressed to ``All Great Ruling Burmans'' and outlines a policy of ``blood mixing'' and ``Burmanization'' of ethnic minorities --a reference to the process by which Burmans, who now represent two-thirds of Burma's population, could become more dominant.
The document says ``the easiest way to implement these ideas is to occupy (marry or impregnate) women who are not Burman,'' for which it offers a financial reward.
``We must deviously attack those who are not Burman in economic as well as social ways,'' the document states.
In Burma, children are considered to bear the ethnicity of the father only.
Burmese opposition leader Sein Win --an elected member of the Burmese parliament who now heads the country's government in exile -- believes the document originated in the defense ministry's department of psychological warfare.
``Regardless of the source or intent of this document, it accurately represents an ethnic cleansing policy of the Burmese military,'' he says.
``There is no doubt that the widespread rapes by troops are fueled by the policies expressed in this document''.
U Bo Hla Tint, a minister of the government in exile, says he was present in Burma when officials in Karen state heard the text of the document during routine monitoring of radio communications between two Burmese military commanders.
Ka Hsaw Wa, a veteran Karen human rights investigator who organizes fact-finding missions for Human Rights Watch, says he encountered the ``Burmanization'' document in the Shan, Karen, and Karenni areas, where his sources retrieved it from Burman soldiers and outposts.
Although it is impossible to gather precise statistics about the incidence of rape as a tool of the Burmese military --geographical, military, and cultural barriers make that impossible, say human rights workers -- anecdotal evidence continues to mount.
In April, Amnesty International reported that a 30-year-old mother, Nang Ing, was raped by three soldiers who accused her of giving rice to the insurgents.
After the assault, they poured boiling water over her.
She died three days later.
In another village, a woman named Naing Mai was raped over five days by military personnel.
She was then burned to death, according to the account that local farmers, who watched from hiding places, later gave Amnesty International.
According to a report last month from the Shan Human Rights Foundation, Aye Nang, another young mother of three, was raped by troops on March 5 in the village of Wan Pek.
She was then stabbed four times in the chest and buried in a shallow grave, uncovered by villagers three days later.
Jennifer Green, staff lawyer with the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, is convinced that the Burmese military is guilty of crimes against humanity as defined by the UN war-crimes tribunal in The Hague.
The tribunal, set up for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, has declared rape a war crime.
``The facts presented in (the EarthRights report) indicate that these acts of violence against women are both widespread and systematic, that there is a pattern of rape, and that civilians are targeted for political reasons or because they are part of a certain ethnic group,'' says Green, who is a cocounsel in the lawsuit against Unocal and Total.
``There is a growing acceptance that rape is not just a form of humiliating treatment but is an extreme form of violence and should be regarded as torture''.

In the spirit of this philosophy, I present today in my capacity as chairman of the billion-dollar multinational Make a Buck at Any Cost Corp.
my special report on American Business Sentiment Toward Burma.
Let's begin with the government's own view of life in this Southeast Asian paradise of more than 47 million people.
In the words of the ruling junta, Burma is one of the most pleasant places created by Mother Nature.
I couldn't agree more.
Of course, anti-business fanatics delight in squawking about the occasional tiffs between the people of Burma and their military rulers.
Yes, Rangoon cracked down on protests in 1988, killing thousands to restore order.
Yes, the government ignored results of an election in 1990 clearly indicating that 90 percent of the people rejected its rule and wanted democracy.
And, yes, it placed the elected victor, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, under house arrest.
Yes, many of Suu Kyi's party members have been killed, jailed, or forced into exile.
Yes, the rulers practice torture, turn a blind eye to slavery, and traffick in drugs.
Is this any concern of ours?
As long as imprisonments, torture, slavery, and political repression don't hinder business, let's not get in a huff about it.
These spats will work themselves out.
I will say just one thing to those who whine about human rights: We will battle all attempts to impose on us a social conscience.
Are we in business to save the world or make a profit?
Lately, I'm pleased to report, we've seen some progress in silencing the wild-eyed whiners.
Right here in Massashusetts, we finally crushed a radical law late last year that bans state contracts with companies doing business with Burma.
We applaud the clever logic of the National Foreign Trade Council, which took the battle into the courts on behalf of its 580 corporate members.
The judge, in his wisdom, agreed with the council that the state law was unconstitutional.
Of course!
What right does Massachusetts, or any state, have to make its own foreign policy?
But no sooner did we lop off the head of this human rights demon than another beast sprung up in its place.
A month after the Massachusetts law was struck down, the Los Angeles city council voted unanimously to enact a similar ban on the municipal level.
If only these were the few isolated attacks on us.
But more than two dozen other states and cities are discussing or have already passed laws that target trade with not only Burma but other promising markets like Nigeria, Indonesia, and Cuba.
Already some companies have retreated from Burma on moral grounds.
It breaks my heart.
If a company must withdraw, it is far better to do it proudly for manly businesslike reasons _ not from any moral squeamishness.
Let us all hail Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications giant.
It ended operations in Burma last year because of threats of a worldwide consumer boycott.
The company stated in unequivocal terms that its decision was not based on ethics _ it was, as it should be, purely a commercial move.

GENEVA (AP) _ A World Trade Organization panel is to rule in a dispute between the United States, Europe and Japan over U.S. legislation that bans trade with the military government of Burma.
A dispute settlement panel was set up by the WTO Wednesday at the request of the Europeans and Japanese, who claim the law deprives them of potential trade benefits.
The legislation, passed in 1996 by the U.S. state of Massachusetts, forbids state agencies from contracting with companies or individuals doing business with the military government of Burma, also known as Myanmar.
An estimated 30 local governments across the United States have passed similar laws.
The legislation is designed to show opposition to Burma's military regime which has been accused of drug trafficking and widespread human rights violations and to encourage it to negotiate a peaceful transition to representative governments.
In a statement to a meeting in Geneva, European Union representatives said the law imposes conditions for suppliers' participation in tendering procedures that violate WTO rules.
In a separate but similar request for a panel to be established, Japanese representatives cited several aspects of the legislation it considers to be inconsistent with WTO regulations.
The United States said in a statement it is disappointed with the decision by the European Union and Japan.
``If this dispute goes to a panel, the U.S. will defend the measure,'' the statement said.

YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi offered Thursday to end her road side standoff with the military government if the government agrees to release jailed members of her political party.
Suu Kyi's health was also ``failing'' according to a statement released Thursday by the National League for Democracy, her political party.
Citing her personal physicians, who have visited her twice in her van outside Yangon, her eyes are turning yellow and she has low blood pressure, the party statement said.
Her doctors took blood samples, fearing she may have contracted jaundice or another disease after spending nine days in her car with three colleagues 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside Yangon.
Suu Kyi is engaged in her fourth confrontation in two months with the military government over her right to travel freely within Myanmar, also known as Burma.
She was stopped outside Yangon last Wednesday by the authorities as she attempted to drive to the city of Bassein to meet with members of parliament from her party.
The NLD said the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner was willing to return to Yangon if the government released jailed members of parliament and other members of her party imprisoned since May.
There are 42 NLD members of parliament in Myanmar's prisons, according to the All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exile group.
The number of NLD members arrested since May is unclear, as Suu Kyi has said in the past that when people are arrested in far flung provinces the party sometimes doesn't hear about it.
There was no immediate response from the military government to Suu Kyi's demand.
In the past, they have never met her calls to release political prisoners or begin a dialogue.
Suu Kyi's offer to end her protest comes one day before her party's deadline for the military to convene parliament.
The military said Thursday it has no intention of meeting the demand.
``The question is how does one call a parliament if there exists no constitution,'' said a government spokesman, on condition of anonymity.
``The demand to convene one sounds like forcing a bald person to dye his hair''.
Several ethnic insurgent groups, exiled democracy activists and Western governments have supported the NLD's call for parliament to be convened.
The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the assembly in a 1990 election, but the military refused to honor the results.
After the NLD victory, it denied the election was for a parliament, but instead for delegates to a convention to write a new constitution.
The constitution is not complete and the draft being worked on gives the military the leading role in politics and bars Suu Kyi from holding public office.
The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
In 1988, the military gunned down thousands of protesters during a nationwide democracy uprising.
YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The vice chairman of Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's political party was threatened with arrest in a commentary in a government-run newspaper Sunday.
The commentary in Sunday's New Light of Myanmar newspaper said that Tin Oo, vice chairman of the National League for Democracy, had violated the terms of his 1995 parole from prison and would have to serve out the remainder of his sentence if he continued to violate Myanmar laws.
The NLD said earlier this week that the military has arrested 702 of its members since May, including 194 elected members of parliament.
More than half the arrests took place this week as the government sought to prevent the NLD from convening parliament.
The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in parliament in a 1990 election the military refused to honor.
Also on Sunday, a student exiles group claimed that 15 military officers, including army colonels, had been arrested by the ruling junta for planning to meet and talk with Suu Kyi.
The report from the All Burma Students Democratic Front could not be independently confirmed and the military government spokesman was not available for comment.
NLD Vice Chairman Tin Oo, 71, who has been imprisoned twice by Myanmar's military leaders, is a former defense minister, army commander in chief, Buddhist monk and lawyer.
He was placed under house arrest the same day as Suu Kyi in 1989 and later sentenced to three years in Insein Prison for violating the 1950 Emergency Provision Act, a sweeping law that allows the military to jail people for as little as allegedly thinking anti-government thoughts.
In 1992, the military extended Tin Oo's sentence by another seven years.
He was released on March 15, 1995 after he appealed to Gen.
Than Shwe, the junta leader, according to the commentary in the New Light of Myanmar.
Myanmar is also known as Burma.
``While serving the prison terms, Tin Oo submitted an appeal to Senior General Than Shwe asking for pardon and promising he will not take part in any political activities or in any activity that would hamper the government's development works,'' the commentary said.
``On humanitarian grounds and due to Tin Oo's previous service in the army, the remaining prison sentence was suspended.
He signed an undertaking saying he would not violate the law,'' it said.
``Tin Oo may have to serve the remaining prison sentence if he does not live up to his promises''.
The commentary also accused Tin Oo of trying to sow discord in the army.
In 1974, Tin Oo ran afoul of former dictator Ne Win when he refused to order his troops to open fire on unarmed student demonstrators.
Ne Win accused him of plotting a coup and had him imprisoned in 1976.
He was amnestied in 1980.
He retains a reputation as having been a heroic commander who was well-liked by his troops, but he inspires a deep animosity from officers in the military government for opposing military rule.
Tin Oo fought alongside Suu Kyi's father, independence hero Aung San, during the campaign to end British colonial rule in the 1940s and was among the first group of officers commissioned in the Burma army.
WASHINGTON _ The Thai government has yet to ask the United States to accept 1,500 new Burmese student refugees, but a State Department official said Thursday that the United States ``would be willing to consider taking more refugees if there is a need''.
The United States has agreed to resettle 600 of these student refugees from Thailand this year, twice the number who were resettled here last year.
The students fled Burma after the military coup in 1988 and have been refugees in Thailand for more than a decade.
The official said the refugees had no connection to the Burmese guerrilla group that stormed a Thai hospital this week.
YANGON, January 15 (Xinhua) --At least 20 more members of various anti-government armed groups in Myanmar surrendered to the government last month, the Mirror newspaper reported Thursday.
These members, who "exchanged arms for peace" in the southern, eastern and south-eastern areas in December 1997, belonged to the Kayin National Union (KNU), All Burma Students' Democratic Front and some other ethnic armed groups.
They brought in some arms and ammunition, the report said.
According to a latest official disclosure, a total of 15 anti-government ethnic armed groups have made peace with the government, leaving only one, the KNU, still in insurgency.
LONDON (AP) _ Myanmar has barred British ministers and officials from the country following British pressure on the military regime to hold talks with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
The Foreign Office announced Tuesday that the military regime in Rangoon said no minister or officials will receive a visa to enter the country, also known as Burma.
Last month, Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett called for a European Union mission, including Britain, to visit Myanmar in an attempt to improve human rights in the country, which has been under military rule since 1962.
Britain also discourages companies from putting new investment into Myanmar.
``I regret this move by the Burmese regime,'' Fatchett said Tuesday.
``It will in no way dissuade us from continuing to work for an improvement in the human rights and the political situation in Burma and bringing pressure on the regime to enter into dialogue with democratic leaders''.
Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has been locked in a battle of wills with the ruling council of generals over demands that a parliament elected in 1990 be convened.
Her National League for Democracy won the elections, but the military never allowed Parliament to meet.
The EU has already placed sanctions on the Myanmar regime including an arms embargo, putting restrictions on visas and suspending non-humanitarian aid.
``The visa ban is an acknowledgment that the U.K. is at the forefront of international action to bring pressure on the Burmese regime to improve the human rights and political situation in Burma,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said anonymously, in keeping with British practice. (acw-er)
YANGON, May 1 (Xinhua) --A total of 26 members of various anti-government armed groups surrendered to the Myanmar government in March, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Saturday.
These armed group members included those from the ethnic Lahu, All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF) and the remnants of the former drug trafficking Mong Tai Army (MTA).
They laid down their arms in different military command areas including the Triangle Region and the Coastal Region.
In armed opposition to the Myanmar government, the Lahu, the ABSDF and the MTA reportedly operate in the Myanmar-Thai border areas.
According to official statistics, more than 500 members from various anti-government armed groups "exchanged arms for peace" with the government last year.
Up to now, 17 anti-government ethnic armed groups as well as the MTA have made peace with the government.
ATHENS, September 3 (Xinhua) --Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said Friday that his country was keen to see neighboring Turkey become a candidate for European Union (EU) membership.
Speaking after meeting with Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos, Papandreou said that Greece wanted to see Turkey as a candidate country but Turkey and Greece's partners could not overlook the fact that the neighboring country had responsibilities and obligations.
If Turkey was ready to undertake these responsibilities, Greece had no objection to helping, he noted.
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem.
Greece has also consistently blocked the more than 1-billion U.S. dollars EU financial aid to Turkey.
Greece has repeatedly said that it supports Turkey in its efforts to join EU but the condition is that Ankara must improve its human rights record and its relations with Athens.
To ease its tense relations with Turkey, Greece will in the near future partially lift its veto on EU funding for Turkey after the devastating earthquake in northwestern Turkey, which has claimed thousands of lives.
BRUSSELS, March 1 (Xinhua) --The European Union and Turkey have met here to discuss the latter's prospect of accession to the 15-nation western bloc, the European Commission said Wednesday.
The bilateral meeting, held Tuesday between EU Economy and Finance Commissioner Pedro Solbes Mira and Turkish Economy Minister Recep Onal, reviewed the fact that Turkey had initiated an economic stability program in order to decrease inflation and increase economic growth.
Both Solbes and Onal expressed their willingness to initiate a dialogue in the economic and monetary fields between the European Union and Turkey that was included in the accession list only last December.
The European Union spoke highly of Turkey's accession-oriented achievements and the emphasis of the meeting was put on the importance of the assistance the EU nations would give Turkey during the pre-accession period.
Turkey had been asking for three decades to join the European Union but its demand was turned away by the European Union in December 1997 that led to a deterioration of bilateral relations.
The heads of state and government of the European Union decided last December in Helsinki to include Turkey in its list of accession that already includes Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia, Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Malta.
The EU has started official accession negotiations with the 12 countries but did not do the same with Turkey.
Some EU member states have been criticizing the human rights record of the country that strides over two continents.
Turkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
ANKARA, January 22 (Xinhua) --The British ambassador to Turkey Thursday indirectly expressed the hope that Turkey could participate in the European Union (EU) meeting scheduled for March in London, according to the Anatolia News Agency.
Turkey can profit from "some substantial profits" provided by the EU, David Logan told a press conference here, which was jointly held with EU representative in Ankara, Michel Lake.
Commenting on the present bitter relations between Turkey and EU, Logan noted that Ankara should not negatively evaluate the Luxembourg summit last December from an overall point of view.
He, however said that he understands Turkey's frustration over the EU decisions.
The EU leaders excluded Turkey from the ranks of the prospective candidates for the EU expansion process during the summit, smashing Turkey's dream of becoming full EU member state in this century.
In retaliation, Turkey announced a halt of political dialog with the European body to protest its "discriminative attitude" toward the country.
Observers here believe that Britain, which holds the term presidency of the EU, hopes it can persuade Turkey to attend the London meeting which deals with the EU accession issues.
In his part, Lake said that maintaining a good relationship is in accordance with the economic interests of both Turkey and the EU.
"The customs union continues to have a positive impact in Turkey and on Turkey's trade relations with the EU," he said, referring to the customs union agreement which took effect in 1996.
Despite its compliant over the Luxembourg decision, Turkey has made it very clear that it would continue to develop economic cooperation with the 15 EU nations.
The EU is the largest trade partner of Turkey with traditional links.
Turkey submitted its formal application for the EU membership in 1987, but so far the goal has not been achieved due to its various differences with the EU, such as on human rights, economic problems as well as the Cyprus issue.
ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey said Wednesday it wants the European Union to make it a formal candidate for membership at its summit later this week.
``Turkey's expectancy is that its candidacy be approved and confirmed legally,'' Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sermet Atacanli told reporters.
He added that Turkish officials were spurning an invitation to a summit dinner because Turkey wasn't a candidate.
Turkey suspended its dialogue with the EU last year after the union decided not to begin membership talks with Ankara because of Turkey's shaky human rights record and territorial disputes with Greece.
An enlargement report for the Dec.
11-12 summit in Vienna includes Turkey among the 11 countries negotiating membership, but the list does not make it a candidate.
Atacanli said the document ``is far from meeting Turkey's expectations''. (sf-cph)
ROME, August 31 (Xinhua) --The European Union (EU) can no longer put off the question of Turkey's possible entrance into the continent-wide union, said Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini Tuesday.
Talking with the financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore, Dini said the EU will have to "recognize Turkey's right to bear the title of candidate of the union" at its December meeting in Helsinki.
The Italian foreign minister added that in the face of the recent devastating earthquake in Turkey, the EU "cannot further delay the choice" for Ankara.
"In light of the recent tragedies, the economy of a great Mediterranean country is at risk," Dini told the newspaper.
"The European Union, without renouncing its principles," will have to decide in December to allow Turkey to become a formal candidate for EU membership.
ATHENS, October 22 (Xinhua) --Greece threatened Thursday to react strongly if the European Commission's decision to release a 155- million-dollar package of economic aid to Turkey was approved by the European Union (EU) Council of Ministers.
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas attributed the commission's decision to "expediencies".
Greece's reaction would be without delay, he added.
The spokesman said that Greece would increase its bilateral contacts in order to promote the country's national interests in the most effective way.
The European Commission's proposal for the release of the EU funds to Turkey, which was raised by External Affairs Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek, was approved Wednesday.
The commission's plan will prevent Greece from exercising its right to veto by introducing a new regulation terming Turkey a developing country, which requires only a special majority for approval by the EU Council of Ministers.
In 1996, Greece blocked an aid package worth 450 million dollars accompanying the EU-Turkey customs union.
Earlier this week, Greece warned that it would refer the European Commission to the European Court of Justice.
Greece has said that it supports Turkey's European vocation but Ankara must improve both its human rights record and its relations with Athens.
ROME, February 16 (Xinhua) --Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Tuesday that Italy expects Ocalan's trial in Turkey will meet standards and guarantees laid down by the Council of Europe, of which Turkey is a member.
He said that those conventions do not envisage the death penalty, and the Ocalan case could test Turkey's ability to meet European standards and may help its bid to join the European Union.
He said Italy would continue to support that bid as long as Turkey moves closer to Europe on human and civil rights and the treatment of minorities, the main stumbling block to its EU ambitions.
Dini added that Italy and the European Union condemned all forms of terrorism and urged Kurds everywhere to refrain from violent protest against Ocalan's capture.
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit announced Tuesday that Ocalan was brought to Turkey from Nairobi.
Ocalan's Italian lawyers confirmed that Tuesday morning that the Greek embassy in Nairobi had turned Ocalan to Kenyan authorities, and then with the permission of Kenya, Turkey took Ocalan back to the country with a special military airplane.
The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Jan.
14: Turkey made the right choice in deferring the execution of Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish rebel leader, until the European Court of Human Rights hears his appeal.
The decision took political courage in a country where passions against Ocalan run high.
But it will help smooth Turkey's path into the European Union, and may permit a solution to the Kurdish conflict, Turkey's most vexing internal problem.
Turkey is not obliged to follow the court's ruling, but has obeyed its decisions in the past.
Ocalan was seized in Kenya last February, brought to Turkey and tried for the murder of the more than 30,000 people killed in the Kurdish insurgency.
He was convicted and sentenced to death last June.
Ocalan has tried to bargain for his life by offering to broker an end to the 15-year-long Kurdish conflict.
He has also ordered his followers to withdraw from battle.
As a result Kurdish violence inside Turkey has sharply diminished.
Others with terrorist pasts, like Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization and Gerry Adams of the Irish Republican Army's political wing, Sinn Fein, have swapped violence for political bargaining and contributed to peacemaking.
Istanbul should give Ocalan a chance to do the same.
Delaying his execution will ease European concerns about Turkey's human rights record and its retention of the death penalty, which all members of the European Union have abolished.
Turkey has not executed anyone since 1984.
Ending that moratorium would be a mistake.
Turkey should not just postpone Ocalan's hanging, but cancel it. &QL;
BRUSSELS, May 11 (Xinhua) --The east and central European countries applying for European Union membership are requested to inform their citizens about their move and the consequence.
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc, requested the applicant countries to improve public knowledge and understanding of the union, to explain the implications of accession into the union, and to explain the link between the pace of preparations for membership and the progress of the negotiations.
The request was put forward in a communication strategy made public here on Thursday by the commission.
"The accession to the European Union of the central and eastern European countries gives rise to expectations as well as fears," said EU education commissioner Viviane Reding.
"The information and communication campaign launched by the commission aims to inform the European citizen, in an objective and reasoned way, of the stakes and the challenges of enlargement".
The commission also urged EU member states to communicate the reasons for enlargement to their citizens as well, to promote dialogue at all levels of society between policy-makers and the public on issues related to enlargement and to provide information about the candidate countries to promote general understanding.
The enlargement awareness campaign will run from 2000 to 2006 with a budget of nearly 150 million euro (139 million U.S. dollars EU enlargement commissioner Gunter Verheugen said on Thursday that the year 2005 is the latest to see the enlargement process complete.
He added that 10 of the 12 applicant countries are preparing for that date while two others are preparing for later dates, though he would not be specific on the dates the applicant countries would be admitted into the union.
ANKARA, February 3 (Xinhua) --The following are major news items in leading Turkish newspapers on Thursday.
Milliyet (National): --The European Union is extending 750 million U.S. dollars in loans to Turkey.
It is the initial fruits for Turkey to be accepted as a candidate of EU membership at Helsinki summit last December.
This move indicated the first step of the financial cooperation between EU and Turkey.
Hurriyet (Freedom): --Turkish parliament Wednesday passed a legislation for "the Convention to Prevent Bribe Given to Foreign Public Servants in International Trade Transactions".
Effectively, this law will make Turkey accept bribe as an international crime.
The country has realized that bribe has spoiled the economic structure of developing countries.
Turkish Daily News: --Turkey's exports increased by 8.37 percent to 1.9 billion dollars in January 2000 in comparison to the same month last year.
The largest growth in exports was experienced by the automotive sector, followed by electronics and leather goods.
ANKARA, March 17 (Xinhua) --Turkey today welcomed a statement by the European Union (EU), which confirmed the perspective of Turkey's full membership to the group.
It is the first time that the EU mentioned the possibility of Turkey's membership in the Union and it would pave the way for Turkey to take up a position, Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said at a news conference here.
She said her country would make new efforts toward full EU membership.
"Our struggle will start from now on," she said.
The EU statement was issued Sunday at the end of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands.
It said that Turkey was recognized as having a European future and it would be treated in the same way as others seeking the EU membership.
The statement came following a March 4 statement by the EU Christian Democrats which called Turkey's membership application unacceptable.
Ciller stressed that Turkey had been a NATO member for 46 years and was the only customs union member among the EU, adding that it was impossible to exclude Turkey, which applied for full membership in the Union in 1987, from the expansion process of the EU.
Turkey currently has a customs union agreement with the EU, which removed some trade barriers.
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has also expressed his satisfaction over the EU message, saying that "Turkey's European horizon has been opened."
ANKARA, February 6 (Xinhua) --NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana today said he is hopeful that Turkey would not veto the planned NATO expansion.
Before his departure from his 24-hour visit to Ankara, Solana told reporters at airport that "I think it has been very positive to understand the position of Turkey".
During his stay here, Turkish leaders reiterated their position to link the expansion of the NATO with Turkey's entry into the European Union.
Turkey has warned that it might block plans for the NATO expansion if its plea for EU accession is stalled.
The European Commission is considering the membership applications by up to 10 possible candidates, but Turkey is not among them.
Solana said "I think we will be able to calm that concern".
In what was regarded as an attempt to allay Turkey's concern, Solana said NATO would include Turkey in military operations by the Western European Union, the EU's military body.
In a press statement issued following his meeting with Solana, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said that Turkey will not support the enlargement of the NATO because the EU does not admit Turkey into the regional alliance.
Demirel said, "Although we are for the enlargement of the NATO in principle, we think that it is important for this issue to be evaluated within the general framework of European new formation".
He said that Turkey should take its place in a European family picture in the EU summit scheduled to be held in Amsterdam in June.
ANKARA, October 25 (Xinhua) --Turkey tonight accused the European Parliament of voting to block European Union's aid to Turkey.
A statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said: "It is impossible for us to accept the contents and the reasons of the decision made by the European Parliament related to the scheduled aid to Turkey".
" Like its decision on September 19, 1996, the European Parliament has pursued its attitude preventing the cooperation between Turkey and the European Union (EU)," the statement said.
It urged the EU member states to show their " necessary reactions to this preventive attitude of the European Parliament".
The European Parliament, angered by Turkey's human rights record, voted Thursday to freeze hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in aid to Turkey for setting up a customs union with the EU.
In addition, the European Parliament voted to review substantial financing for Turkey from the EU's MEDA Program, through which up to 842 million ECUs was envisaged for the bloc's Mediterranean neighbors in 1997.
PARIS, September 19 (Xinhua) --The European Parliament today voted to block a 53 million ECU (70 million U.S. dollars) special aid package to Turkey because of what it called a "deterioration in the human rights situation" in the country.
Members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg voted 319 for, 23 against the resolution with 20 abstentions, according to local media reports.
The European Parliament accused Turkey of "increasing provocation in the Aegean Sea and in Cyprus, and aggressions in the north of Iraq".
The special aid is part of the agreement between the European Union (EU) and Turkey on the establishment of a customs union between the two sides.
The European Parliament also called on the European Commission not to allow Turkey access to EU aid under the "Meda" program for Mediterranean countries, except for projects concerning the "promotion of democracy and human rights".
The resolution condemned "the brutal assassination of two Greek Cypriots by Turkish soldiers supported by para-military forces," during inter-ethnic confrontation last month on the divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
ANKARA, February 27 (Xinhua) --Turkey today welcomed the European Union's attitude toward its dispute with Greece and urged the EU to release financial assistance immediately despite Greek efforts to block it.
The EU foreign ministers' meeting on Monday turned down a Greek proposal to adopt a common condemnation of Turkey concerning the two countries' dispute over an Aegean islet.
The dispute flared up last month when both Turkey and Greece claimed sovereignty over a set of small islands, called Kardak in Turkish and Imia in Greek, in the Aegean Sea.
The United States later intervened, preventing a war between the two NATO members.
According to a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement, the European Union has taken up, during Monday's meeting, the situation between Turkey and Greece.
The statement added that Greece, despite its attempts, was unable to get the support of the other 14 European Union members in getting a statement that would express solidarity with Greece and condemn Turkey.
"Turkey welcomes the reaffirmation of the European Union's 14 members to carry out their obligations toward Turkey within the framework of customs union," the statement said.
Meanwhile, Ankara also urged the EU to release its planned financial assistance, a sum of 375 million ECU (483.75 million U.S. dollars), despite Greek attempt to block it.
"We expect the European Union to take the decision for the implementation of the financial assistance, an indispensable factor...in the customs union, as soon as possible," said the statement.
Reports say Britain and France have urged Greece not to force the EU into a legal battle with Turkey over the financial assistance.
Ankara maintains that the withholding of the assistance would be a violation of the customs union accord, which might go as far as to the European Court of Justice.
ANKARA, June 21 (Xinhua) --Turkey is angry over the European Union (EU)'s decision to exclude it from a European defense mechanism, warning the EU not to take for granted the use of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) facilities in Turkey for EU-led operations.
Turkish Daily News reported on Wednesday that Ankara was "not satisfied with" the EU decision made Tuesday at the EU summit in Portugal to exclude non-EU members from the so-called European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI).
In a statement, Turkish Foreign Ministry called on EU members to reverse its decision at its next summit in Nice, France, in December.
The proposed ESDI envisages the establishment of a decision- making structure over defense under the EU, which would be independent of the United States-led NATO and would exclude non-EU members.
Turkey, a NATO member and EU candidate, has endeavoured to join the European defense mechanism with the support of the U.S., who fears the ESDI will take the place of the NATO and reduce Washington's role in the European security affairs.
Turkish defense officials said Ankara has been an active contributor, within the framework of NATO, to European security since the Cold War and should not be excluded from a European security and defense architecture.
When Javier Solana, commissioner for EU foreign and security affairs, visited Ankara early this month, Turkey voiced objections to the ESDI on the grounds that non-EU members, like itself, would be excluded.
Turkey insisted that it wants to be involved in the decision- making, rather than the decision-implementing, process.
Turkey had also sent a diplomatic note of warning at the end of May to 11 EU countries which are also NATO members over their approach to the ESDI.
Turkey, which did not want to see its role reduced in the European security with the evolving structure of the ESDI, stressed that it was not like other non-EU NATO members and had contributed much to European security both in the Cold War and post-Cold War eras.
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) --The U.S. government said today that the European Union (EU) should accept Turkey as its new member in the future.
"Turkey is a European country," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters.
"We strongly believe that the European Union should allow the possibility of Turkish membership in the future".
The 15-nation EU rejected a membership of Turkey last week.
Some EU members insisted that Turkey is an Asian nation, not European.
"We don't have a vote in the European Union, nor do we seek one," Burns said.
"But we very respectfully think of Turkey as a European country and not send negative signals to Turkey".
Turkey, already a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), signed an agreement on Customs Union with the EU in January 1996 and has been seeking an EU membership.
BRUSSELS, March 4 (Xinhua) --The European Commission, the European Union (EU)'s executive arm, Wednesday proposed a strategy for deepening Turkey's ties with the EU.
The Commission Wednesday made the proposal in a bid to improve its badly soured relations with Turkey over Ankara's frustrated efforts to be accepted as a candidate for EU membership.
It urged the EU members to release a fund of some 375 million ECUs (around 400 million U.S. dollars) to finance the strategy, which includes a broader customs union and cooperation in industry, services and agriculture.
"The European strategy which we proposed for Turkey will lead to a deepening of our relations.
This will be to the benefit of all our citizens," EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek said at a press conference.
He indicated that Turkey's democratic institutions and human rights records must be improved in order to prepare itself for the eventual EU membership.
"I think we have made clear what we expect from Turkey and what we have to offer for Turkey," said the commissioner, who also said that Ankara was now not interested in political dialogue with the EU.
In a second report to the European Parliament, the Commission said the Turkish government's program for improving the human rights situation and democratization "has not yet had sufficient impact on the situation."
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) --The European Union is considering granting a second emergency aid to quake-stricken Turkey as senior officials of the bloc are scheduled to visit the country on Wednesday.
Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen, whose country is serving the rotating presidency of the European Union, and European Union Foreign Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek are to meet in Ankara with Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
They are to assess the damage caused by the August 17 earthquake, which has so far claimed a death toll of more than 12, 000 people in northwestern Turkey, and plans of EU's aid to rehabilitate and reconstruct the devastated region.
Last week, the EU granted a 2-million-euro (2.06 million U.S. dollar) emergency aid to Turkey.
The European Commission is to discuss on Thursday the granting of a second aid package which is said to be similar in amount to the first one.
The European Commission is also to discuss in September a more elaborate action plan to support Turkey, whose relationship with the union went awry after the union stopped short of letting it join the grouping among the first batch of countries.
ANKARA, April 8 (Xinhua) --Jose Cutileiro, Secretary-General of the Western European Union (WEU), will visit Turkey on April 11-14, the Anatolia news agency reported today.
Cutileiro will be received by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and other high-ranking officials, Anatolia quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel as saying.
During the first visit by a WEU secretary-general, Cutileiro is expected to discuss with Turkish officials issues such as the security of Europe, the WEU's role in European defense and Turkey's contributions to the union.
Turkey is not a formal but an associate member of WEU.
ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's foreign minister on Thursday said the European Union's definition of Turkey as a candidate for membership will pave the way to improved relations between Brussels and Ankara.
``Although wrong assessments by the European Union persist, with the definition of Turkey by the European Commission as one of the 12 candidate countries, the road toward developing our relations has opened,'' Minister Ismail Cem said in a statement.
After the decision in December to exclude Turkey from the first wave of enlargement talks, Turkey put its relations with the 15-member union on hold.
Since then, the EU has been trying to patch up the relationship, with several leaders of member countries insisting that Turkey's place is in the union.
The European Commission released Thursday its first set of regular reports assessing the progress towards EU membership of 12 candidate countries, including 10 central and eastern European countries and Cyprus and Turkey.
The EU ambassador to Turkey, Karen Fogg, insisted that the report ``did not signal a new status of Turkey, but the confirmation that Turkey is a candidate country''.
In any case, the report indicated Turkish membership would not come soon.
``The persistent violations of human rights and important deficiencies in the treatment of minorities are causes of concern,'' the report on Turkey stated.
Turkish authorities are frequently accused of systematically violating human rights, especially in the southeast where Kurdish rebels have been fighting for autonomy since 1984.
The Commission also criticized the lack of civilian control over the military, which plays a central role in the country's political life.
The report praised Turkey's economic policy but said it still had a long way to go in the adoption of EU legal and administrative standards. (ht-fd)
BONN, May 25 (Xinhua) --German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said Monday he did not expect that Turkey would be admitted into the European Union "in foreseeable future".
"The decisive factors are not the cultural ones, but the human rights situation, the conflict with the Kurds, the country's economic problems and its relations with Greece," said Kinkel at a conference on the subject of "Islam and Europe" in Berlin.
Despite the EU membership dispute with Turkey, Kinkel stressed Germany wanted to strengthen relations with the country in all areas.
The relations between Turkey and EU have been soured after EU leaders decided last December not to accept Turkey as an official new member candidate, though they did not rule out its candidacy in the future.
Turkey's Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has blamed German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for blocking Turkey's entry into the EU due to its Islamic background.
ATHENS, December 31 (Xinhua) --Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos today called on neighboring Turkey to change its stance towards Greece.
In his new year message, Tsohatzopoulos stressed that aggressiveness did not help Turkey's relations with the European Union (EU), and Turkey should give serious consideration to the problems noted by the 15-nation bloc.
He pointed out that if Turkey realised this in the future, it would greatly help to improve the current climate.
Earlier this month, the EU decided not to include Turkey on the list of nations waiting to join the bloc, on the grounds of Turkey's "poor human rights and bad relations with Greece".
After that, Turkey announced the suspension of its political dialogue with the EU and increased its pressure upon Greece.
Tension between the two neighboring countries intensified recently with the mutual expulsion of diplomats and violations of Greek airspace by Turkish jet fighters.
ANKARA, Turkey (AP) --Turkey's leading human rights activist was released from prison Saturday and said he hoped to be the last person jailed in Turkey under laws curbing freedom of expression.
Akin Birdal, former president of the independent Human Rights Association, served 10 months in prison.
He was convicted of inciting racial hatred for urging an end to Turkey's 16-year war against Kurdish rebels in the largely Kurdish southeast.
''My hope and wish is to be the last person imprisoned because of writing and voicing ideas,'' Birdal said outside an Ankara prison where he was greeted by 100 human rights activists.
Birdal said Turkey had not made concrete steps to improve its human rights record.
''Don't the Turkish people deserve democratization''? he asked.
Turkey is often criticized for its poor human rights record.
Europe and the United States have called on Turkey to crack down on torture in police stations and reform its laws curbing freedom.
Birdal, 51, is still recovering from an assassination attempt in May 1998, when two assailants shot him six times.
Eleven members of a far-right nationalist group were convicted and sentenced in December 1998 to up to 19 months in prison for attempted murder.
He was released for health reasons last year after serving three months, but was jailed again in March.
Both the European Union and the United States criticized Turkey for jailing Birdal.
Scores of activists and writers have been sentenced to prison terms in Turkey for writings and speeches seen as sympathetic to Kurdish rebels.
Some 20 cases are still pending against Birdal for his speeches.
Turkey does not recognize its 12 million Kurds as a minority and has rejected a cease-fire announced by the rebels last year.
The European Union, which Ankara wants to join, is pressing Turkey to find a peaceful solution to the war.
Some 37,000 people, mostly Kurds, have been killed in fighting since 1984.
ISTANBUL, June 8 (Xinhua) --Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said here Monday that Greece has no intention of preventing Turkey from being admitted into the European Union (EU).
Delivering a speech at the Balkan Foreign Ministerial Meeting opening Monday morning in Turkey's largest city of Istanbul, Pangalos said that Turkey is an European nation and its efforts for full EU membership should be encouraged.
"Greece has always supported the European orientation of Turkey.
Greece is opposed to the view that the European Union is limited by historic or religious traditions," Panglos said.
He noted that "Today's reality is different.
Participation of Turkey in the European Conference can be a successful first step".
Turkey has repeatedly accused Greece of undermining Turkey's efforts for EU membership, but the charge is rejected by Athens.
Ankara halted its political dialog with the EU last December when the EU Luxembourg summit excluded Turkey from the ranks of candidates for its enlargement process, saying that the European body made this decision on the basis of "a discriminative attitude " toward the Muslim country.
Greece and Turkey have long been at odds over the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus issue.
Regional security, such as the Kosovo issue, and economic cooperation will be taken up at the two-day foreign ministerial meeting of the Balkan countries.
In northwestern China, which has half of the country's land, arable land has become increasingly desertified and sandstorms have become more frequent because of improper use of water resources.
And in the Southwest and North, karst formations can be an important source of water for many cities, but people have to attach importance to ground subsidence caused by the excessive use of water.
Lin Xueyu, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), told the symposium that saving water can be a more effective and economical way of solving water shortage than water diversion projects, which are expected to compensate for the irregular distribution of water resources.
She said that diverting water from one area to another may benefit some areas for a short period of time, but the ecological damaged will have serious side effects.
The two academics have asked the central government to pay more attention to developing subterranean water instead of surface water, because it is the major water resource in many cities and is less likely to be polluted.
China should try to build a nationwide water monitoring system to provide accurate data for the healthy development of water resources and should increase pollution controls, one Finnish scientist suggested.
NAIROBI, September 7 (Xinhua) - The Rwandan government has launched a big campaign to ease water shortage rocking northeast Rwanda, the Rwandan News Agency reported Tuesday.
The areas mostly affected are Umutara and Kibungo prefectures, known for their aridity and scarce water resources.
According to Bruno Mwanafunzi, Director of Water Resources in the Ministry of Energy, Water and Natural Resources, the situation in Umutara was exacerbated by an unusual drought that hit the disaster area because of a prolonged dry season.
Over three quarters of approximately 480,000 people in Umutara prefecture are faced with severe drought.
Umutara prefecture accommodates more than two thirds of the cattle reared in Rwanda.
DAR ES SALAAM, December 31 (Xinhua) --Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye has urged residents in capital Dar es Salaam to use water sparingly as another water shortage is imminent.
The prime minister was shocked to find that the water level at Ruvu River, the main source of water of the city, is "alarmingly low" when he inspected the Ruvu water works Wednesday.
Accompanied by Minister of Water Mussa Nkhangaa, Sumaye inspected the Ruvu water works at Mlandizi in the eastern Coast Region, local press reported Thursday.
Sumaye ordered the Ministry of Water to make sure that wells dug in the capital city last year are operational as a preventive measure.
He also directed water technicians and engineers to find alternative water sources, saying that "this is not a time for water engineers to sit in their offices".
Below average rains associated to the La Nina weather phenomenon has led to a drought in most parts of the east African country.
The prime minister has called on residents to use water carefully when they wash cars and water flowers and trees.
In 1996, a long spell of dry weather resulted in a low water level of Ruvu River and shortage of supplies to Dar es Salaam.
DHAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) --The Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka is going alarmingly dry because of a serious shortage of water supply with no sign of immediate improvement.
Sources from the city's Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) said its daily water supply at present was about 815 million liters through 205 deep tube-wells, well short of the daily demand of 1.29 billion liters in Dhaka.
Officials concerned noted that the loss of water in the obsolete system and facilities made it even more difficult for WASA to meet the demand.
They said the densely populated old city of Dhaka and its surrounding areas were the worst hit by the water shortage.
The onset of the summer heat has further drained the ground water in Dhaka while adding to the sufferings of some 6 million thirsty residents in the old city.
The officials held no optimism about an easy solution to the problem before a new water treatment plant starts operation.
HANGZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) --East China's Zhejiang province will spend 7.1 billion yuan on building water supply projects to meet the urban needs in the coming five years.
A provincial official said that the water shortage caused the province's industrial output value to decrease by 3.6 billion yuan last year, and people in a number of cities and counties are short of drinking water supply.
The official said that the main reason for the water shortage was inadequate government investment in building water supply projects.
While increasing funds in constructing more water supply facilities, the provincial government has decided to raise funds through different channels including overseas investment for such undertakings.
DHAKA, April 8 (Xinhua) --People living in Bangladesh's capital city of Dhaka are suffering from a shortage of drinking water, media reports Wednesday quoted official sources as saying.
Daily demand for water in the city with a population of over 9 million is around 1.4 billion liters, and there is a shortfall of 640 million liters, according to the sources.
The Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority supplies drinking water to the city dwellers through a total of 97 deep tube wells and a lone water treatment plant.
A shortfall usually rises during the summer season when load sheddings are more frequent than in the winter season.
Besides, the system loss of water is about 50 percent due to mismanagement.
The daily demand for water in the city would rise to 1.8 billion liters a day by the year 2000, the sources said.
The scarcity of water in the city would be partially eased with the completion of the World Bank-aided 175-million-U.S.-dollar Sayedabad water treatment project, the sources added.
ISLAMABAD, June 14 (Xinhua) --Water shortage in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad is expected to deteriorate as water reservoir can meet demand of the consumers just for 12 days.
The water level at Simli dam, the only water supply source of Islamabad, has receded to alarming level and water there will be used up if no major precipitation takes place in the next 12 days, experts said.
The water level at Simli dam has been declining over the past four months due to lack of rainfall, which has caused concern and panic among the residents in the capital who have experienced similar situation in 1994.
Failing to cope with the water shortage, the Capital Development Authority has resorted to further reduction in water supply to the residents who are already complaining of non-availability of the commodity.
Sources in the authority said that they have further reduced water supply in a bid to use the reservoir for as many days as possible.
Meanwhile, the authority has repeatedly called on the people to use water carefully and not to waste it.
Some residents are complaining that those people who installed moter pumps directly on main water pipeline are depriving their neighbors to get ample water supply.
If the crisis is allowed to continue, many residents will prefer to migrate from the capital as they cannot afford to live without water during scorching summer, said one resident.
XI'AN, August 26 (Xinhua) --Chinese geologists have drilled a 700-m high-output, high-quality water well in northern Shaanxi Province in northwest China.
The well will help deal with the severe water shortage problem in Fuping county and help with the search for new water sources in water-short northwest China.
The well can provide 13,300 cu.m. of water a day.
The water is 41 degrees C.
and contains various mineral elements good to people's health.
It can provide enough water for 80,000 people.
HANOI, October 15 (Xinhua) --Drought in Vietnam has caused a serious water shortage affecting about 3 million people in the recent months, Vietnam's English newspaper The Saigon Times Daily reported Thursday.
The daily quoted Le Huy Ngo, Vietnam's minister of agriculture and rural development, as saying at a meeting Wednesday in Hanoi to celebrate the international disaster relief day that "rainfall in the past nine months in most of the country fell sharply".
Ngo said the drought has bad impact on agricultural production not only in this year but also in the next few years.
He said the Mekong river water level is very low now, measured at two meters early this month, the lowest level since 1926.
If the drought persists, a shortage of water for power generation and cultivation will be unavoidable, Ngo added.
This year, the theme of the international disaster relief day is "preventing calamities with information."
NAIROBI, July 4 (Xinhua) --The acute water shortage in the Kenyan capital Nairobi entered its third month Tuesday with water-borne diseases imminent.
The residents in the city warned that an outbreak of water-borne diseases like cholera was impending unless water supply is restored immediately in the city with a population of 2 million.
They also demanded the Nairobi City Council to announce a water rationing program to enable them to know the time to draw water, the East African Standard newspaper said.
They said that the program will save them from being exploited by unscrupulous water vendors, who usually sold a 20 litre container of water at 30 shillings (around 0.4 U.S. dollar).
City residents complained that the vendors had capitalized on the water shortage to make quick profits from people desperate for water.
"People can survive without electricity but they can not survive without water as it is an essential commodity," said Mama Njeri, a resident.
Nairobi City Council recently worked out a rationing plan but the schedule has not been made public.
Due to the current drought in the Horn of Africa, water shortage has reigned throughout the east African country and more than 2.2 million Kenyans are threatened by starvation.
ISLAMABAD, March 1 (Xinhua) --More than 170,000 children under one year of age die every year because of the shortage of potable water in Afghanistan, according to a press report reaching here on Wednesday.
The report said that only 23 percent of the Afghan people benefit form clean water.
Almost 50 percent of the diseases posing a threat to children's lives are caused by the lack of clean water.
"But lack of clean water is not the only problem being faced by the people of Afghanistan," said the report.
"Another problem which has hit the people is drought."
KUALA LUMPUR, March 27 (Xinhua) --Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad Friday called upon the people to save water at a time when the water shortage problem has affected various states including the capital city of Kuala Lumpur.
Mahathir said the water problem was related to the change in the climatic situation in Malaysia and the most effective way was for everyone to save water and be thrifty.
The prime minister was commenting on the on-going drought and the problem of water supply in several states including Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Malacca and Pulau Pinang.
The government is already implementing several programs to overcome the water problem and would take about five months to complete, Mahathir said in Jitra in the northern state of Kedah after a political party function, according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
Mahathir said his deputy Anwar Ibrahim will chair a meeting of representatives of the relevant authorities to find a solution to the water problem which is becoming increasingly critical.
The water problem was more serious in Klang Valley covering Kuala Lumpur and its surrounding areas where, according to reports of the national newspapers, some 300,000 residents have been affected.
JOHANNESBURG, February 3 (Xinhua) --South Africa Could Run Out of Water within 20 or 30 years if the current level of consumption continues unrestricted, Water Affairs and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal warned today.
Addressing a meeting in Bloemfontein, Asmal said South Africa's capacity for social and economic development would be seriously affected by the prospect of water shortage.
Asmal said his ministry is therefore reviewing the country's current legislations on water issues and would soon start to develop a national water management strategy to deal with the issue.
In this regard, a new water pricing policy is expected to be in operation in the near future, said the Minister.
It is reported that irrigation sector of South Africa's commercial farming in some provinces, especially the Free State Province, would be affected by the new measures.
However, Asmal assured that the Free State would not be deprived of its water resources if water is transferred from Orange River to the Vaal Dam, a major water supplier of Gauteng Province.
He said a recent study showed that there is more than enough water available in the Orange River to meet the increasing demand of all towns in the province, which are currently supplied from this River.
Last year, South Africa imposed temporary punitive water tariff on residents in big cities such as Greater Johannesburg owing to a short water supply of the Vaal Dam.
MANILA, November 15 (Xinhua) --Philippine Interior and Local Government Secretary Robert Barbers today called on all local officials to immediately implement contingency measures to cushion the effects of El Nino, specially the shortage of water.
In the wake of President Fidel Ramos' call to respond to El Nino, Barbers said that local government units should lead in the drive to conserve water and take necessary steps to protect the country's water resources.
"We must immediately put into action practical water conservation measures which will reduce our water consumption and allows us to recycle water," he said.
Barbers said local government units can enact ordinances banning the drawing of water from communal waterworks system for watering lawns, gardens, campuses, parks and for pressurized car washes.
He also urged local government units to monitor the use of all public deep wells, fountains, and springs to ensure that the water from these sources are properly utilized, preferably only for cooking and for other basic human needs.
Industrial users should have their own water sources so as not to prejudice the water available to the general public or unduly deplete communal water systems such as rivers and lakes, he added.
In the meantime, Barbers ordered all regional offices under his department to undertake an information campaign to disseminate water conservation measures and to explain the El Nino phenomenon.
It was reported that water shortage brought by the El Nino weather phenomenon will be very serious in the Philippines.
The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System in Metro Manila has announced that it will reduce water supply and the number of hours of water service.
"The lowered levels in our dams and water catchments will worsen even more unless the weather cycle brings us typhoons," Barbers said, adding it is necessary to "do everything possible to alleviate the adverse effects of the El Nino".
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) --Chinese scientists are searching for ways to alleviate China's water shortage problems through new technologies.
The scientists are trying to improve water pollution treatment technologies and increase reuse of water.
Technologies have been applied to treat industrial waste water discharged by paper making, leather, food, dying, and oil-drilling sectors, according to today's China Daily.
Ningyang County Paper Mill, a large plant in east China's Shandong Province, will take the lead early this year in trying a water pollution treatment technology approved by the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC).
The process will be implemented at paper mills across the country in the near future.
Another project which will recycle 99 percent of water used in oil exploration is being used in oil fields, Wen Jianping, deputy-director of the China Research Center for Water Pollution and Water Reuse under the SSTC, was quoted as saying.
The project, developed by Wen's center, can treat 20,000 tons of waste water daily.
Wen and his colleagues are working on recycling discharged water from hotels, office buildings, car washes and public washrooms.
China is one of the many countries in the world facing water shortage, a situation plaguing more than 300 of its 660-odd cities.
XI'AN, April 27 (Xinhua) --A project will be launched this year to solve the water shortage problem for Yan'an, an old revolutionary base in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
The project, involving a total investment of 185 million yuan (about 22 million US dollars), will be built by the Ministry of Water Conservancy and the province, and is scheduled to be completed in 1998.
At present, the water supply capacity there is only 30,000 tons daily, half the amount needed.
In dry seasons the shortage of water is particularly acute.
Shortage of water has long plagued the daily lives of the 180,000 people of Yan'an, not to mention the city's economic development.
The project will divert water from the Wangyao Reservoir, 65 km from the city's urban area.
It includes the construction of a water pipeline, a water purifying plant, and a water supply network in the urban district, and improvement of the Fangta Reservoir.
MEXICO CITY, April 11 (Xinhua) --Mexico, in a bid to raise the awareness of water conservation, has arrested at least 40 people in the capital city this year for water wastage.
The move came against a backdrop of a severe water shortage in the country.
Lack of water has already caused forest fires, poor harvest and desertification.
The police said the arrested will be release after each paying a fine of 500 pesos, or 60 U.S. dollars.
NICOSIA, August 10 (Xinhua) --Cyprus will take measures to tackle the severe warter shortage on this drought-hit eastern Mediterranean island, a government statement said on Monday.
The statement issued by the Minister of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment Costas Themistocleous said the Cypriot cabinet agreed last week to seek tenders for building two mobile desalination plants due to be put into operation before next summer.
Cyprus has one desalination plant in Dhekelia on the eastern coast, and the second is expected to be completed early next century.
The minister warned that water supplies could run out by the end of the year due to the extended drought.
He promised that the government would do everything possible to solve this problem.
"We will also investigate the possibility of importing water from abroad as an alternative," Themistocleous said.
He said the government will study the feasibility of introducing higher charges on water as a step to promote water saving.
Cyprus has also planned to encourage people to use water-saving devices and systems for recycling "grey water" for use in toilets and garden irrigation, the minister said.
Meanwhile, the government will also provide financial support to repair water pipe networks in towns and villages, he added.
ADDIS ABABA, February 11 (Xinhua) --The Addis Ababa Regional Water and Sewerage Authority announced that the shortage of potable water in the capital city of Ethiopia will be solved in the last quarter of this year.
According to a report here today, the announcement was made by Tadesse Kebede, general manager of the authority.
Currently, the authority supplies only 60 percent of the city's potable water demand.
Tadesse said 18 water supply projects are underway at various stages, adding that one of such projects involved the sinking of 25 wells at Akaki, about 20 kilometers from Addis Ababa, which will supply 75,000 cubic meters of water daily to the capital city.
NICOSIA, January 9 (Xinhua) --Cyprus has decided to impose strict measures to save fresh water as the island's water reserves are currently at the lowest level since 1986.
Minister for Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment Costas Petrides today called for urgent water supply cuts to deal with the severe water shortage which followed a dry winter.
"If this situation continues, there will be no drop of water left by 1998 in our reservoirs," the Minister told reporters, noting strict measures are "the only solution".
Petrides classified the measures to ease water shortage in three categories, namely the reduction of water supply, its better saving and the increase of water reserves available.
According to the minister, water supply to households will be cut by 20 percent, which means water will be supplied only three days a week, compared with 10 percent last year.
Water for farming purposes will be cut by up to 70 percent compared with 35 percent the year before.
The measures also include higher fines against people who waste water.
A study would be carried out for recycling of households water for watering gardens.
This can save up to 34 per cent of a household's needs, the minister said.
Petrides called on the public to make "painful saving" of water and said his ministry will launch an intensive campaign to increase public awareness of the problem.
The minister said water shortage will be solved "if we develop an increased awareness on water saving".
This East Mediterranean island relies mainly on rainfall for is water supply.
The first desalination plant is being constructed on the island and will be operational in April.
The government approved Wednesday a plan for setting up a second desalination plant near the southern town of Larnaca, which will be completed by 1998.
A further two similar plants are also envisaged for Limassol and Paphos areas.
It is widely believed here that water shortage would be eased to a great extent once these plants become fully operational.
BEIRUT, December 10 (Xinhua) --A Lebanese official has warned that his country is suffering an annual water shortage of more than 1 billion cubic meters, the Daily Star reported Friday.
Addressing a one-day seminar on environment and water resources here on Thursday, Fadi Qmeir, director-general of the Ministry of Electricity and Water Resources, attributed much of the shortage to wasted water from leaky pipes in the network.
He added that distribution was inefficient, relying too heavily on pumping systems which bring water from the coast to rural communities.
He argued that dams offered the only means to meet the country's water needs.
"These dams would rely on gravity, causing water to flow from the hills into valleys," he said.
The ministry is studying the feasibility of building 15 dams and 16 hill ponds to collect rain water during the winter for use in the dry month of summer.
Qmeir said construction on four dams could begin in 2000.
He promised the ministry annual budget of around 40 million U.S. dollars would cover the cost.
Other scientists argued that while increasing supply will reduce the water deficit, an efficient water management scheme is also needed to help meet the demand.
BANGKOK, March 1 (Xinhua) --A severe water shortage has hit the northern province of Tak in Thailand as reservoirs have dried up, a report available here Monday said.
According to the report from the province's center for assisting drought victims, nearly 150,000 people of 25,000 families have been suffering from water shortage.
Damage has been done to rice, corn and soybean plants in over 100,000 rai (16,000 hectares) of farmland, the report said.
The drought center has dispatched water trucks and supplies to affected villages.
The Agriculture Extension Department has launched a crop substitution program for affected villagers to grow corn, vegetables and roses on some 101,000 rai (16,160 hectares) to which water can still be supplied.
According to the report, Huay Mae Sot reservoir in the province, with a capacity of 5.5 million cubic meters now has only 700,000 cubic meters left.
Ban Huay Luek reservoir with a capacity of 5.8 million cubic meters now has only about 500,000 cubic meters of water.
Another two reservoirs have been dried up.
The water shortage has caused some 6,000 people in the province to move, the report added.
KATHMANDU, April 24 (Xinhua) --Water shortage in Pokhara, a famous city for tourism in Nepal, is so severe that surgical operations on patients can not go on smoothly in the Regional Hospital in the city, according to a report reaching here Monday.
Medical Superintendent of the hospital Dr.
Somat Singh Tulachan said that as the Drinking Water Corporation in the city was not able to supply water regularly, the operations on patients often had to be postponed when water was not available in the hospital.
"Sometimes operations were performed by fetching water in buckets," he added.
Singh admitted that lack of water had caused inconvenience to the patients and the hospital was getting dirty.
Some patients complained that they had to bring water from home for drinking and daily use.
And there is no regular supply of water even in the city, according to the report.
The Regional Hospital in Pokhara is the biggest hospital of the western region in Nepal, with 200 beds and about 500 out-patients daily.
Although Nepal is rich in water resources, water shortage is pervasive in the country because of its inability to tap the resources and the lack of well-managed supply system.
Even in Kathmandu, the capital of the country, regular water supply can not be guaranteed.
LUANDA, March 27 (Xinhua) --The supply of water in the Angolan capital Luanda could not be resumed within at least eight days, the Luanda provincial governor Justino Fernandes said here today.
Fernandes was speaking to the press on the water shortage problem in Luanda.
He said that the government was short of money to buy materials so a period of time was needed to completely get rid of water shortage in the Angolan capital.
It is the 10th day today that water supply in Luanda has suspended.
Such a suspension of water supply resulted from the cut-off of power supply to the water plant in the suburbs as large rain fell down two high-voltage power supply towers.
TEHRAN, June 12 (Xinhua) --Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani today picked the ground for Mamloo reservoir dam near Tehran, a project designed to alleviate the water shortage problem in the capital.
The dam, on the juncture of Damavand and Jajroud rivers, 40 kilometers east of Tehran, has a designed capacity of 250 million cubic meters of water which will irrigate 5,400 hectares of farmland.
It will also operate a 8.5 megawatt hydro-electric power plant.
Speaking at the site of the dam, the president said that the main obstacle in the way of development of Tehran is water shortage.
To solve the water shortage problem for Iran's capital with a population about 10 million, the Iranian president said, all measures must be taken regardless of cost to transfer water to various cities and parts of Tehran province, including Damavand, Varamin, Shahryar, Robat-Karim and Karaj.
Mamloo dam will harness more than 200 million cubic meters of river water and turn it to drinking and irrigation water, he added.
Construction of Mamloo dam and the power plant, which will be completed by the year 2001, will cost 180 billion rials (about 60 million U.S. dollars).
The water shortage problem is serious for Tehran this year though the capital city is supplied with water from two main reservoirs --one in the west and the other in the east of the city.
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.
(AP) --Gwyneth Paltrow of ``Shakespeare In Love'' and Michael Caine were honored Sunday for motion picture acting, and Michael J.
Fox was a funny but poignant winner for TV comedy actor at the Golden Globes.
Ed Harris of ``The Truman Show'' and Lynn Redgrave of ``Gods and Monsters'' won motion picture supporting actor honors.
The Golden Globes honorees lived up to the irreverence for which the show has become known, but Fox's acceptance speech added a touching note.
The ``Spin City'' star, who has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, thanked his doctors, including one he said had opened up his brain.
``We're so lucky to do what we do...
and just take every day and enjoy it,'' Fox said.
Paltrow played the upper-crust lady who becomes the lover and muse of William Shakespeare in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which also won best screenplay.
In ``Little Voice,'' Caine played a sleazy agent who tries to turn a meek woman with powerful musical gift for show tunes into a star.
``Oh, what a shock,'' Caine said as he picked up his honor.
``My career must be slipping.
This is the first time I've been available to pick up an award''.
``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``The Truman Show'' were the leading movie nominees, with six apiece.
``Saving Private Ryan'' followed with five.
``Bulworth,'' ``Elizabeth,'' ``Gods and Monsters'' and ``Little Voice'' had three nominations apiece.
The awards, broadcast from a hotel ballroom by NBC, were plagued by problems with sound cutting out and the picture freezing momentarily.
Harris set the tone for the notoriously freewheeling awards show by coming on stage with a toothpick in his mouth, saying, ``Oh man, I just got through eating dinner''.
Backstage he noted that ``The Truman Show'' came out in the summer, long before studios traditionally roll out their award-worthy product.
``I'm glad that people didn't forget about it,'' he said.
Redgrave, who played the crusty but loving maid to an aging horror director in ``Gods and Monsters,'' said, ``It's been 32 years since I stood one of these on a mantelpiece and it's been crying out for a friend ever since''.
In the television categories, Dylan McDermott of ``The Practice'' and Keri Russel of ``Felicity'' were named best actor and actress, respectively in television dramatic series.
Jenna Elfman won best actress in a TV musical or comedy series for ``Dharma and Greg''.
Tom Hanks, nominated for as best actor in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' picked up an early honor for his ``From the Earth to the Moon,'' which won best miniseries or movie made for TV.
Angelina Jolie won best actress in a miniseries or TV movie for ``Gia,'' which also earned Faye Dunaway an award for supporting actress in a series, miniseries or TV movie.
The latter category was a tie, with Camryn Manheim of ``The Practice'' picking up the other award.
Stanley Tucci of ``Winchell'' won best actor in a miniseries or TV movie.
In another tie, Don Cheadle of ``The Rat Pack'' and veteran actor Gregory Peck of ``Moby Dick'' shared the award for supporting actor in a series, miniseries or TV movie.
``I won one of these in 1947 and it was very encouraging, and it's very encouraging now,'' Peck deadpanned.
The Golden Globes, selected by reporters from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, are awarded for both film and television in a nationally televised ceremony in a hotel ballroom in what can be a much more colorful affair than the stuffy Academy Awards.
Last year alone, Christine Lahti was in the bathroom when she was announced as a winner for ``Chicago Hope''.
This year she showed up as a presenter with toilet paper stuck to a shoe.
The Golden Globes traditionally serve as predictors for the Academy Awards in March.
In the last 16 years, 12 films that won best motion picture honors at the Golden Globes went on to take the same prize at the Oscars.
The awards also provide a valuable promotional tool for studios.
The morning after the ceremony, newspaper advertisements for films trumpet their Golden Globe hauls.
One award was announced before the ceremony: Nicholson was honored with the Cecil B.
DeMille Award for his ``outstanding contribution to the entertainment field''.
Nicholson has been nominated for 14 Globes and won five.
For the fourth straight year, NBC dedicated three hours of prime-time to the awards, reflecting how far the ceremony has come in prestige.
The awards had once been buffeted by controversy over allegations of corrupt voting and long suffered credibility problems, with the lowlight being the 1981 event that awarded Pia Zadora a statue for the bomb ``Butterfly''.
Networks refused to show the program.
The association worked to regain respectability.
In 1996, after a 14-year absence from network exposure, the program was back on the air.
This year, NBC asked Golden Globe voters to sign waivers indicating they did not accept gifts or perks from Hollywood studios, the Washington Post reported Saturday.
Foreign Press Association President Helmut Voss said the waivers indicated ``during our journalistic activities, including out-of-town travel, that we did not accept any gifts other than those that are the customary promotional gifts of the studios.''
NEW YORK (AP) --The woman on the magazine cover isn't Kate or Claudia or another fab supermodel.
Still, she's so famous that the browser almost has to take a second look --and may even buy the magazine.
The cover girl's appeal?
She's a superstar, not a supermodel.
Fashion magazine editors are putting more famous faces from movies and television to music on covers, hoping the box office power of Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore or Mariah Carey will succeed at newsstands.
It seems the obvious solution when they're saying in publishing circles that supermodels are as passe as last season's hemline.
Some critics say models have exhibited less-than-model behavior.
Ot they've become boring.
Or even worse --old.
The megamodels still have cover girl faces, but their star power has dimmed, now that the runways are no longer ruled by the deified six: Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Claudia Schiffer and Kate Moss.
And their heirs aren't apparent.
But no one is yet sure whether entertainers or models sell better.
Last January, a death knell directive from leading fashion editor Linda Wells appeared in The New York Times: ``Nobody cares about models anymore''.
Now Ms.
Wells, the editor of Allure, is not so sure.
``I sounded too harsh.
It is not as dire as that,'' she said.
Still, she added, ``Americans might be slightly less captivated by models' daily habits and...
their latest spats with their boyfriends or agents''.
Allure, which had a cover ratio of 10 models to two stars in 1998, is flip-flopping those figures.
Vogue increased celebrity covers last year from two to seven.
Mademoiselle and Elle also have swung to star power.
``I'm gambling on this, and it's an important gamble,'' said Ms.
Wells, who lined up actresses Angelina Jolie and Julianne Moore for spring covers.
``We are putting a lot more celebrities on the cover because I believe they will sell more.
After all, that's what we're trying to do, sell magazines''.
Choosing a hot cover is not an exact science.
Not every celebrity cover scores.
Sometimes it's timing --fall fashion issues are usually best sellers, for instance.
And according to magazine sales, today's fashion face is Oprah Winfrey.
Her October cover was Vogue's 1998 best seller, with some 810,000 newsstand sales.
The talk-show queen likewise reigned in first place at In Style, with 844,000 newsstand sales for November.
Calista Flockhart of ``Ally McBeal'' was Harper's Bazaar's top seller for 1998.
Public personalities also are stealing the spotlight --a Hillary Rodham Clinton cover on Vogue got excellent grades.
``Some women's magazines are tossing off models because people identify more with celebrities,'' said Lisa Granatstein, senior editor at Mediaweek, a New York-based trade magazine.
She explained the celebrities' appeal: ``You know they've just broken up with their husband, you know their latest movie, you know their every move''.
Eleanor Lambert, who founded the New York designer previews known as Fashion Week, said that the word ``supermodel'' derived from ``a group of young women with slatlike bodies and colorless personalities''.
Still, today's supermodels could flourish by making the transition from model to actress as did Audrey Hepburn, Jane Fonda, Cybill Shepherd, Kim Basinger and Sharon Stone.
Naomi Campbell could be the next escapee to film stardom in the upcoming ``Prisoner of Love''.
``I always say it is my last (modeling) season because I think they're not going to want me anymore,'' she told Vogue.
No wonder she worries --the headline on her profile in the March issue read ``The Last Supermodel''.
Is Ms.
Campbell indeed the end of a breed?
About 10 years have passed since the decade's best-known mannequins revolutionized the genre.
Perhaps they were too hot not to cool down.
Or maybe the supermodel image just got old --literally -- since most of the big names are over 30.
Some style watchers expect another generation of megamodels on the horizon.
``As long as there have been magazines, there have been star models,'' said Eileen Ford, who founded Ford Models in 1947.
Ms. Ford would know.
On her payroll were Cheryl Tiegs, who racked up 24 Glamour covers between 1967 and 1989, and Christie Brinkley, who scored 19, from 1975 to 1989.
``I suspect at some point the celebrity tide will swing back,'' said Elaina Richardson, editor of Elle.
``If you think about a Twiggy or a Jean Shrimpton, there have been very famous models who had more celebrity than most actresses''.
Still, Ms.
Richardson put actress Cate Blanchett on the magazine's cover for May and stockpiled 1998 covers with Sharon Stone, Minnie Driver and Salma Hayek.
It could be, however, that neither celebrities nor models are the biggest draw.
Ms. Ford recalled that McCall's once ran a test to see whether a model or a strawberry shortcake on the cover would draw more readers.
``You know which (sold more), don't you --the strawberry shortcake,'' she said.
''We almost died of horror.''
As a thriller, ``The Bone Collector'' is a bit above average _ creepy enough, but a bit short on logic and believability.
But it does boast two of this year's Oscar nominees in starring roles _ Denzel Washington, who is up in the best actor category for his role of wrongly convicted boxer Rubin Carter in ``Hurricane,'' and Angelina Jolie, who received the best supporting actress nod for her role as the mentally disturbed teen, Lisa, in ``Girl, Interrupted''.
Both already picked up Golden Globe Awards earlier in the year, and Jolie won a Screen Actors Guild statuette on Sunday.
``Collector'' is another serial-killer story, the twist being that Washington's character _ forensic detective Lincoln Rhyme _ is a quadriplegic.
Rhyme had been injured while investigating a crime.
He remains on the force, however _ albeit bedridden and surrounded by an array of high-tech gadgetry _ and continues to help solve crimes.
Jolie plays Amelia Donaghy, a smart beat cop who Rhyme recognizes has potential to be more.
Jolie and Washington make a compelling combination, with both playing variations of roles that they are known for.
Even in action roles, Washington comes across as cerebral, and _ except for flashbacks to when his character wasn't paralyzed _ that's what you see in this film.
But Washington, a former best supporting actor Oscar winner, can do a lot with a little.
And while his Rhyme character is fairly predictably drawn, Washington imbues him with strength and dignity without overreaching, making him far more real than any of the events in the movie.
The characters Jolie plays, on the other hand, always seem dangerous _ either to themselves, others or both.
Donaghy is no exception, carrying around a lot of past baggage.
It's not the character but Jolie's edginess, an animal-on-the-prowl quality, that keeps you watching.
Jolie, the daughter of Academy Award-winning actor Jon Voight, has already picked up a couple of Emmys.
Oscar won't be far behind.
Washington, who is nominated along with another former winner in the best supporting actor category, Kevin Spacey, is a favorite to win the Oscar.
But win or lose, go back and check out some of Washington's previous work, particularly in his films with Spike Lee _ ``Mo Better Blues (1990), ``Malcolm X'' (1992) and ``He Got Game'' (1998) Others include ``Cry Freedom'' (1987), in which he played South African activist Steven Biko; ``Glory,'' for which he won his Oscar; Carl Franklin's `Devil in a Blue Dress'' (1995), which is based on the Walter Mosley novel; and ``Courage Under Fire'' (1996).
Jolie has a much shorter resume, but check out last year's ``Pushing Tin'' and ``Gia,'' the HBO movie where she played outrageous supermodel Gia Carangi, who died of AIDS.
&QL; &QL; &QL; MAKING SENSE Get ready for the force _ the force that will be brewing with the VHS release of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The Phantom Menace,'' on April 4.
That's right, despite all the digital elements in the film, George Lucas' prequel to his three hit films will not be released on DVD.
Go figure.
But last year's surprise hit and this year's Oscar nominee for best picture ``The Sixth Sense'' will come out on DVD March 28.
&QL; _____ ``The Bone Collector'' (Universal) is priced for rental on VHS ($107.37) and is $29.98 on DVD. &QL;

22. &UR; FEATURES &LR; NY-WOJNAROWICZ (New York) _ David Wojnarowicz (1954-1992) was a near-mythic figure in New York a decade ago, and for many people who knew him, he still is.
Artist, writer, filmmaker and performer, he gained fame during the brief East Village art boom of the 1980's.
But he kept himself outside the hype and went his own way.
He stayed in the neighborhood after the galleries had moved out, and died there of AIDS at the age of 38.
But at the moment he's back in New York in full force.
A retrospective titled ``Fever: The Art of David Wojnarowicz'' has opened at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo; several Manhattan galleries are showing his work.
A book of excerpts from his diaries has just appeared.

BOOK-CLUBS (New York) _ Reading is an essentially solitary activity, but talking about books requires at least two people.
Even if you live with another bibliovore, what are the chances that you will both be struck by the desire to read and discuss, say, ``Bleak House'' or ``Ulysses'' at precisely the same moment?
The growing popularity of reading groups and book clubs attests to the desire to talk about books as well as read them.

ELGAR (Undated) _ Americans march to Elgar at commencements as they march to Mendelssohn at weddings, but they probably don't think about him most of the rest of the year.
To a nation with little patience for quaint remnants, he can seem an anomalous holdover of the British Empire, which much of his music appeared to embody in its doughty as in brave/valiant, or dowdy, as in unstylish? staunchness and solemnity.
But Elgar deserves respect for more than just those ``Pomp and Circumstance'' marches; some listeners have found a core of deep humanity in his work, even under the occasional bluster.
And now, for no reason apparent in the stars, a confluence of events has brought the composer to attention.

LOS ANGELES (AP) --The car-heist caper ''Gone in 60 Seconds'' raced to the top of the weekend box office, debuting with $25.5 million and pushing ''Mission: Impossible 2'' back into the pack, according to studio estimates Sunday.
''Gone in 60 Seconds'' overcame generally poor reviews that said the action flick squandered the talents of Oscar-winning stars Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall.
It was produced by action master Jerry Bruckheimer.
''Bad reviews don't matter,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks the box office.
''People are looking for escape in the summer.
The movie's trailers promised some fun, so audiences went out to theaters to escape''.
''Gone in 60 Seconds'' likely will be gone from the top spot next weekend, when Samuel L.
Jackson's update of the 1970s detective franchise ''Shaft'' debuts.
''Mission'' fell to No.
2 after two weekends in first place, grossing $17.1 million to push its total to $157.9 million since opening just before Memorial Day.
It passed ''Gladiator,'' which has taken in $150.2 million, as the top-grossing flick so far this year.
''Big Momma's House'' was third in its second weekend, taking in $16.8 million.
The Martin Lawrence comedy had grossed $52 million in 10 days.
In its fourth weekend, ''Dinosaur'' took in $8.8 million and increased its total gross to $110.5 million, making it the fourth movie released this year to top $100 million.
Two new movies did well in limited release.
''Sunshine,'' starring Ralph Fiennes in a saga that follows three generations of a Hungarian-Jewish family, debuted with $92,583 in seven theaters.
The movie had a strong $13,226 per-cinema average, compared to $8,483 in 3,006 theaters for ''Gone in 60 Seconds''.
''Sunshine'' expands to more theaters in late June.
Kenneth Branagh's latest Shakespeare adaptation, a tuneful version of ''Love's Labour's Lost'' updated as a 1930s Hollywood musical, opened in two theaters with $27,000 for a $13,500 average.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co.
Inc. Final figures are to be released Monday.
1. ''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' $25.5 million.
2. ''Mission: Impossible 2,'' $17.1 million.
3. ''Big Momma's House,'' $16.8 million.
4. ''Dinosaur,'' $8.8 million.
5. ''Gladiator,'' $7.1 million.
6. ''Shanghai Noon,'' $5.8 million.

LOS ANGELES (AP) --''Sling Blade'' Oscar-winner Billy Bob Thornton is recuperating at home after being treated at a hospital for a viral infection.
Thornton, 45, left a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday, according to publicist Michelle Bega, who denied reports that Thornton's ill health was due to an eating disorder.
The actor-writer-director said several years ago that he once suffered from anorexia nervosa.
Thornton was hospitalized last weekend and his wife, ''Girl, Interrupted'' Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie, rushed from shooting a movie in England to be at his side, Bega said.
''He's doing wonderfully,'' Bega said, adding that Thornton intends to join Bruce Willis in a couple of weeks to work on the film ''Bandits''.
Thornton, who won a 1996 Academy Award for the screenplay of ''Sling Blade,'' directed ''Pretty Horses,'' starring Matt Damon and due for release Christmas Day.
NEW YORK _ &UR; Martin Margiela for Men &LR; For men who have hungered after the deconstructed trousers and expert tailoring of Martin Margiela, the designer is about to introduce a men's-wear line.
It will be in stores like Barneys New York in Manhattan and Los Angeles; Ron Herman, Fred Segal and Maxfield's, all in Los Angeles, and Blake in Chicago.
He will present the line, called 10, side by side with his women's wear on Oct.
15 during the women's collections in Paris, said Catherine Jiacomiai, a Margiela spokeswoman.
Unisex clothes have been a hallmark of Margiela's past work.
The emphasis was on pieces like T-shirts, coats and trousers that were the same design but sized differently.
``This is really a complete wardrobe,'' Ms.
Jiacomiai said.
The new line will be designed from scratch for men and is likely to attract those men who wear Margiela's unisex clothes, as well as new customers.
It is consistent with the new attitude in men's wear of sharp but soft lines promoted by designers like Raf Simons and Alessandro Dell'Acqua, said Vincent Ehly, a men's-wear buyer for Barneys.
Margiela's line, a large part of which is prewashed or creased clothing, will cost about $360 for wool trousers, $120 for cotton shirts and $185 for roomy chinos.
As directional as Margiela's designs are, the men's line is expected to appeal also to those in search of classic clothes.
``The women's collection is a major part of the women's store at Barneys,'' Ehly said.
``So many women wear his tops and skirts like basics''.
&UR; Randolph Duke at Emmys &LR; The little problem of not having a business did not stand in the way of Randolph Duke's creating clothing for the Emmy Awards show on Sunday.
Duke was in Los Angeles Monday, basking in the glow reflected from three actresses who wore his dresses: Jane Leeves of ``Frasier,'' in an antique-green gown with paillettes and a boa; Kim Delaney of ``N.Y.P.D.
Blue,'' in a red matte jersey gown with see-through insets, and Angelina Jolie of the movies ``Gia'' and ``George Wallace,'' in a nude-tone double-slip dress.
Duke said that he did not accept a design fee for the dresses and that he paid out of his own pocket to have them made.
He declined to say how much the custom-made gowns cost.
The actresses will not be receiving a bill, he said.
``I decided it was very important for me to keep up the relationship with Hollywood, which has been very supportive,'' said Duke, who, as the creative director of Halston until this summer, dressed several stars, most famously Minnie Driver for this year's Oscars ceremony.
``We have a lot of great relationships,'' said Duke, who is looking for backing and talking with prospective employers.
``We had calls from a lot of stars and stylists, and we called them, too.
I'm going forward.
I have to''.
&UR; Banana Republic Catalog &LR; The beauty of Banana Republic is that it is fashion made simple.
But apparently not so simple that some fashion-challenged customers don't need to have their hands held.
This week, the company introduced a team of style consultants to work with customers of its new catalog.
Reachable by telephone at (888) 906-2800, the consultants advise on everything from fit to accessorizing outfits.
``There are people who do call for figure-type information, body types and fit,'' said Sarah Gallagher, the company's senior vice president of catalogs.
``And some like the fashion element''.
This is the first Banana Republic catalog since 1992, toward the end of its illustrious safari days, when it sold clothing suited to living it up in, well, a banana republic.
Along with the style consultants have come other luxury services, like alterations and the ability to return items to Banana Republic stores. &QL;

JAKARTA (JP): Die-hard fans of action and suspense movies can currently get their eyeful at the city's cinemas.
Below is a synopsis of a few currently playing.
US Marshals.
Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, Wesley Snipes and Robert Downey Jr.
Director: Stuart Baird.
Snipes has replaced Harrison Ford in the role of the fugitive and this time, it is not a bus but a plane he escapes from.
Downey Jr.
is an agent assigned by federal authorities to help Gerard (Jones) catch the person who murdered his colleagues.
Desperate Measures.
Cast: Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia.
Director: Barbet Schroeder.
In this thriller, Garcia is a widowed cop in San Francisco whose son is dying of cancer.
The child's life could be saved with a marrow transplant.
The hitch?
The single match is a murderous sociopath (Keaton) who has spent more than half his life in prison.
Keaton conveniently escapes from the operating room just before surgery starts.
Keaton goes loose in the hospital and Garcia gives chase.
Playing God.
Cast: David Duchovny, Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie.
Director: Andy Wilson.
Eugene Sands (Duchovny), a surgeon who gets hooked on amphetamines and loses a patient on the operating table, witnesses a shooting at a disco and saves a man from death.
The man happens to be a friend of mobster Raymond Blossom (Hutton) who decides to use Sands by getting him to play God.
Great Expectations.
Cast: Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne Bancroft, Robert De Niro.
Director: Alfonso Cuaron.
The only ``different'' movie of the lot, it is a rags-to-riches story telling of society's foolish pretensions.
Finn (Hawke), a poor orphan, has a horrifying encounter with an escaped convict.
Years later, with complements of an anonymous benefactor, Finn goes to New York and becomes an established artist.
He thinks his patron is loony recluse Ms.
Dinsmoor (Bancroft), and he dreams of winning her beautiful, icy ward, Estella (Paltrow).
In Money Talk$, Chris Tucker as the scalper-turned-escaped-con and Charlie Sheen, the TV broadcaster trying hard to save the day are still driving audiences crazy with laughter and nonsense.
During a meeting to discuss Oscar coverage, some Life &AMP; Arts staff members decided that we should do a week-by-week look at the Big Six categories: Best Picture, Best Director and the four acting categories.
We decided to start with the ``lowest'' award, but there was some debate as to which award that might be.
On the official Academy Awards Web site (www.oscar.com), the acting awards take precedence over director.
We decided, however, that Best Director is more important than the supporting-acting awards.
Which is why we're starting with Best Supporting Actress.
The irrational subjectivity of that becomes clear when you realize what a strong field this year's Best Supporting Actress nominees comprise.
Empathy played well in this category.
Toni Collette is supremely empathetic as the troubled mother of a haunted little boy in ``The Sixth Sense''.
It was a pleasant surprise to see the academy recognize this, since she was upstaged by co-star (and co-nominee) Haley Joel Osment and by the movie's twist ending.
Samantha Morton earned a nod for her performance as a sweet, mute woman who puts up with a jazz guitarist who takes her for granted in ``Sweet and Lowdown;'' because she's the only person who can't interrupt his motor-mouthed self-absorption, she's actually able to see through to his pain.
And Chloe Sevigny, the type of actress who always looks as if she's lost in a pleasant daydream, is touching as a woman who falls for an impostor in ``Boys Don't Cry'' _ and, once the ruse is revealed, remains committed because she knows that the emotions remain real.
The other two nominees provide a flip side to the empathy, with Angelina Jolie and Catherine Keener as women who are looking out only for themselves in, respectively, ``Girl, Interrupted'' and ``Being John Malkovich''.
Jolie walks away with ``Girl, Interrupted'' as a sociopath whose charm and mischievous nature belie a cold-hearted cruel streak.
Keener was first among equals in ``Malkovich's'' ensemble as a scheming woman who finds a way to take advantage of just about anything _ including a passageway inside a character actor's head.
Jolie and Keener have shown plenty of range in the past year, each playing more selfless women (Jolie in last spring's ``Playing by Heart,'' Keener in the current ``Simpatico'') who end up benefiting from their selflessness.
And each, having risen up from the ranks of premium-cable TV (Jolie) and independent films (Keener), has more familiarity than the competition.
Collette and Sevigny also have some indie-film cred, but Keener is a busier, more versatile actress.
Morton, despite having a few movies under her belt, is more of an unknown _ but she's in a Woody Allen movie, and Allen's movies have historically done well in this category.
Although it's a wide-open race, Jolie would appear to have the edge, having come off a Golden Globe win for ``Girl, Interrupted''.
Having an Oscar-winning pedigree _ dad Jon Voight won in 1978 for ``Coming Home'' _ can't hurt.
She's my bet for who'll take home the statue, but if I were able to vote, I'd pick Sevigny, who gives a heart to the otherwise dark and mean ``Boys Don't Cry''.

Angelina Jolie lives on the edge.
Forget planning.
Forget the future.
``I am always right in the moment,'' she says.
A few months ago, the moment dictated that the screen beauty would dye her hair a color best described as ``grandmother blue''.
Predictably, her advisors went berserk.
``I was told, `You know, Angelina, people are taking you seriously now.
You've got to take yourself seriously,''' Jolie says, mimicking the voice of a Hollywood agent.
She sighs and says, ``People are suddenly concerned about my hair?
Please. I was like, `I don't think we fooled anyone'''.
Jolie, 25, delights in making waves.
This is a woman who literally jumped in a swimming pool in her ballgown after winning a Golden Globe Award for ``Gia'' (1998).
She isn't adorned with jewels but with tattoos, including a large ``H,'' which stands for Haven, her brother's middle name.
Recently she took a plunge of a different sort and married actor Billy Bob Thornton.
No one even knew the two actors, who met on the set of 1998's ``Pushing Tin,'' were dating.
``Hey, when I'm 90, they will never be able to say, `Oh, she was just another boring starlet,'' Jolie says.
That's an understatement.
Even her clothes are with that Jolie twist.
She isn't wearing DKNY or Ralph Lauren.
``Try Walmart,'' she jokes, allowing those ridiculously puffy lips to burst into a smile.
``Hey, it was the only thing that was clean.
I don't have time to go to the cleaners''.
After all, her career is in overdrive.
Jolie stars opposite Nicolas Cage and Delroy Lindo in ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' opening June 9.
It's the story of two rival car thief gangs who have 24 hours to prove which group can ``collect'' the most merchandise.
``I didn't do the film because it was high art.
It was my summer vacation last year and frankly I wanted to learn about cars,'' Jolie confesses.
She learned a few practical tips from someone who really knows his wheels.
``I do know how to steal a car now, although maybe I shouldn't get that out there,'' she says.
``We actually had a real thief on the set escorted by his prison guard.
I didn't know who they were the first time.
I thought they were two prop guys and then I got the skinny.
I asked the thief a million questions and this guy could rip apart an entire car and tell you every single part of it''.
Forget logic.
Jolie says that after ``The Bone Collector'' (1999) and her Oscar winning turn as mental patient Lisa in ``Girl, Interrupted'' (1999), she was ready for some screen fun.
But Jolie cautions that she's still a serious actress.
In fact, that's why she turned down one of the leads in the upcoming big screen version of ``Charlie's Angels''.
``The `Charlie's Angels' people had a few selling points,'' Jolie says.
``They told me there weren't many good characters for strong women.
But I countered that I've been able to play strong women.
``I was also told that doing `Charlie's Angels' `will make you a big star,' which is frightening and not a plus in my book,'' Jolie says.
``I looked at it as a money job.
Given the fact that I don't really like to get dressed up in high heels, it wasn't worth it to me.
I figured that my fun job was `Gone in 60 Seconds'.
And frankly, I thought car thieves and hanging out with the boys was just so much cooler''.
Hanging out on the A list in Hollywood leaves her cold.
Jolie, who is the daughter of actor Jon Voight and actress Marcheline Bertrand, says she isn't overly impressed with her newfound status.
``Look, I have the same acting abilities.
It's not like I'm suddenly a better actress because I have awards or this box office clout,'' she says.
``It's just that now I'm on more covers of magazines.
It's easier to hire me''.
``Honestly, I don't take my successes personally,'' Jolie says.
``I still think I'm someone who got very lucky.
I'm someone who people took a chance on a few years ago when I was no one in this town.
And now?
I don't think I'm so important.
I'm just an actress for hire''.
Don't think that she has a poor self-image.
``I am secure in the fact that I do have something to offer as an actress,'' Jolie says.
``I've done justice to my roles.
I've always felt that I was the best person to do the roles that I've been offered.
In fact, I still won't take a role unless I think I am the best person to do it''.
Jolie felt that way about her Oscar winning role in ``Girl, Interrupted''.
``I loved that movie.
I got to fling the windows open and just breathe and scream.
It felt so good.
I got to push buttons,'' Jolie says.
It follows that she loves characters facing internal conflict.
``There's a side of me that understands conflicted emotions,'' Jolie says.
``For instance, when I'm intense, I might be crying but a whole other side of me is angry that I'm crying.
You know, if I'm soft I hate myself.
I don't do self-pity.
I want to scream, `I am not weak'''!
She mentions that being so tough isn't easy either.
``I'm one of those people who need to learn to let somebody hug me.
I need to learn to need other people,'' Jolie says.
Enter Billy Bob Thornton.
Jolie shocked the world by marrying Thornton.
Said Jolie recently, ``I'm madly in love with this man and will be until the day I die''.
But Jolie, who's first husband was actor Jonny Lee Miller, mentioned that marriage frightened her somewhat because of the split of her own parents.
``But anything is a possibility,'' Jolie said.
``I know I've become more stable.
I've become more centered.
I feel like I've grown up a lot in the last year''.

LOS ANGELES (AP) --The friendly mouse has given way to the neighborhood bully.
"Next Friday," starring Ice Cube as a man on the run from a vengeful bully, bumped off the reigning box-office champ, the mouse tale "Stuart Little," according to industry estimates Sunday.
The sequel to the 1995 film "Friday" took in $14.5 million Friday through Sunday.
The movie has grossed $19.1 million since opening Wednesday.
"Stuart Little," the No.
1 movie three of the last four weekends, dropped to second place with $9.7 million.
"The Hurricane," which opened in limited release for Academy Award consideration around Christmas, expanded to 1,454 theaters Friday and came in at No.
3 for the weekend with $9.1 million.
The movie stars Denzel Washington in the prison saga of boxer Rubin "Hurricane" Carter.
"Girl, Interrupted," starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie as mental patients, also broke out of limited release and grabbed fourth place with $8.2 million in 1,902 theaters.
"Supernova," a sci-fi adventure featuring James Spader and Angela Bassett, fizzled with $5.7 million in 2,280 theaters, debuting in eighth place.
Playing in just 1,103 theaters, "Next Friday" averaged an impressive $13,146 a screen, compared with $6,259 for "The Hurricane" and $4,311 for "Girl, Interrupted".
The first "Friday" movie did a modest $27 million at theaters but went on to become a video hit.
"Next Friday" already has done about two-thirds of that box-office business and grossed twice its production budget in just five days.
With strong appeal to black movie-goers, the film also benefitted from release during the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
holiday weekend, when movie-going is up because many people have today off work.
"Next Friday" drew well among 18-to-25-year-old white crowds, too, said David Tuckerman, head of distribution for New Line, which released the movie.
Other recent hits with black casts, such as "The Best Man," have had similar crossover appeal.
"The movie played well in white areas.
We were sold out all over the place," Tuckerman said.
"It appeals to all audiences.
It just feels like the country is maturing about that".
In "Next Friday," Ice Cube has another battle with the bully from the first movie, who gets out of prison bent on revenge.
The comedy offered some frivolous fare in a movie market crowded with Oscar contenders.
"All these Oscar films are terrific, but in terms of audience satisfaction and escapist entertainment, this offers people something they've been waiting for," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co.
Inc., which tracks the box office.
"A lot of teens have felt left out of the market the last six weeks or so".
"Stuart Little" crossed the $100 million mark Saturday, grossing $106.8 million in about five weeks.
Also hitting that milestone was Tom Hanks' "The Green Mile," which has taken in $101.6 million.
They were the 18th and 19th films released in 1999 to pass $100 million, breaking the record of 18 movies set in 1998, Dergarabedian said.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co.
Inc. Final figures were to be released today.
1. "Next Friday," $14.5 million.
2. "Stuart Little," $9.7 million.
3. "The Hurricane," $9.1 million.
4. "Girl, Interrupted," $8.2 million.
5. "The Green Mile," $7.5 million.
6. "Galaxy Quest," $6.6 million.
7. "The Talented Mr.
Ripley," $6 million.
8. "Supernova," $5.7 million.
9. "Toy Story 2," $5 million.
10. "Any Given Sunday," $4.8 million.
When a stunning Angelina Jolie announced a few minutes after winning a Golden Globe that she would take a plunge, gown and all, in the hotel swimming pool, she must have seemed insane to anyone who had just watched her wiggle to the stage to claim her award for her part in ``Gia,'' an HBO movie.
The white and silver racer-back gown she wore so closely outlined the best of what Ms.
Jolie has to offer that it seemed she had already been dipped in water.
Awards shows like the Golden Globes, which took place last month, have become a huge influence on fashion, previewing what designers are likely to put on runways and stimulating sales.
Ms. Jolie's dress, by Randolph Duke, turned up in his show last Friday.
The lace-and-sequin gown that Halston's Kevan Hall put on Christine Lahti for the Golden Globes presaged the cobweb and beaded lace gowns he presented last week for fall.
And the black and white outfit designed by Pamela Dennis for Calista Flockhart begot long trumpet skirts on the catwalk, including one in rich ruby sequins.
But on the whole, evening-wear designers showing for fall 1999 are a demure bunch.
There was plenty of beauty worthy of the Oscars, the Golden Globes or even the Grammys, which offer a chance for more fashion-watching tomorrow night, but little to elicit heart palpitations.
This design approach suited the moment well, for with a few exceptions, it was a sexless season.
Not that celibate fashion is bad.
It's just different.
Tommy Hilfiger and Daryl Kerrigan, in her Daryl K collection, ripped with wonderful abandon into both ends of the sexless spectrum.
As American as cornflakes, Hilfiger plays the wide-eyed innocent of fashion who just might have a dirty little secret.
He gives enough edge to his approachable clothes that they are just safely this side of Kmart oblivion.
To the sounds of a live rock band, Sugar Ray, the more to underline the hip Hilfiger-music connection, the designer sent men's and women's clothes rocking down the runway together.
His mix of sports, music and high fashion was a potent brew, especially in long nylon skirts and leather jeans with white stitching.
The collection was further elevated by terrific fur vests, python patchwork pants and an evening gown of leather and wool fit for a biker princess.
Ms. Kerrigan's collection was a pirate's treasure worth of creativity.
There was no guesswork in trying to figure out her inspirational mother lode.
It was war.
She masterfully rolled the concept into her funky street-wear esthetic, with parachute nylon jackets over slim pants, holey sweaters and shorts over trousers.
Menacingly dark colors were intercepted by flashes of reflective utilitarian orange or white in luxuriously ragged shearling coats or nylon hooded jackets that partly hid the models' faces.
That war should be text for a Kerrigan show is not surprising given that Ms.
Kerrigan hails from Ireland, where an awareness of violence is never far from mind.
Whether it was Ireland or the millennium that drove her, the results were masterly.
The pretty, festive clothes of the many designers who showed evening wear in the last days of the shows, which ended Friday, balanced the aggressive message of designers like Ms.
Kerrigan. In his second season as chief designer for Halston, Hall made a short excursion into day wear, and it was most promising: a studded chocolate suede dress with decolletage abounding; a lush vanilla frappe of a wrap jacket over a crisp white Halston shirt.
Beaded tweed gowns and silvery sheaths were tantalizing.
There were, though, unnecessarily mundane gowns, like a black velvet column that made one wonder which member of his front row Hall was playing to.
If you were Lynn Whitfield, a diva who has to make an entrance, it lacked impact.
If you were Dawn Mello, the president of Bergdorf Goodman, looking for something simple and elegant for a conservative customer, you were probably thrilled to bits _ even the oldest women keep lovely backs.
Understatement permeated Vera Wang's collection, as if earthiness precluded sultriness in evening wear.
Ms. Wang offered gauze or tulle dresses decorated with beads in the shape of palm fronds.
Throughout the collections, designers of evening wear have pushed the idea of knits for after 8, and Ms.
Wang handily paired skirts and dresses with turtlenecks and ponchos, infusing the collection with a very American spirit.
A wonderful impact of the American shows' going first on the international calendar (London, Milan and Paris follow in the next few weeks) was that designers plumbed American culture and style rather than European.
This is not to suggest that there were no outside influences.
There were touches of modern and ancient Asia everywhere, at Ms.
Wang's show and at Duke's.
It was uplifting to see Duke back on the runways after his unceremonious exit from Halston last summer.
In the audience were his new backers, Juliana Holt and her husband, Peter, who owns the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association.
Duke used cashmere or fleece in a variety of sweaters _ off-the-shoulder, bateau necklines and hooded sweatshirts _ pairing them with pave gowns, beaded skirts and, prettiest of all, debutante tulle skirts in fondant colors.
But Duke's decision to use all Asian, Eurasian and Afro-Asian models was regrettable.
Making race a part of an esthetic unwittingly paves the way for Asian, Latina or African models to be left out in the cold when their look doesn't work with the mood of the season, as has happened before.
Vivienne Tam and Han Feng managed to invoke an Asian point of view without typecasting.
Fresh and original, Ms.
Tam incorporated futuristic nylon puffed jackets shading the face, luminous sparkly dresses juxtaposed with Chinese brocades, and Chinese spiritual icons embroidered onto T-shirts.
Ms. Tam had her false starts, but she is unquestionably pointed toward the future.
Not so, Ms.
Feng, who in her zeal to make clothes intellectual, turned in an uncharacteristically dank collection.
Turbid colors like brown, gray and loden were used in mandarin jackets over wide-leg trousers.
Yohji Yamamoto makes this awkward asexual proportion look easy.
Ms. Feng shows us that, clearly, it is not.

&QL; &UR; ------------------------------------------------ &QC;
LOS ANGELES (AP) --Angelina Jolie has it all: the awards, her choice of Hollywood roles and the adoration of gossip columnists who have found the motherlode.
After Jolie's gushing words of love for her brother at the Oscars in March, rumor-mongers hinted at incest.
After her whirlwind Vegas marriage to Billy Bob Thornton last month, the gossip mill had Jolie breaking up Thornton's relationship with Laura Dern.
After word leaked out about a steamy scene between Jolie and Antonio Banderas for an upcoming movie, the tabloid talkers speculated they were fooling around for real.
None of it is true, Jolie said in an interview to promote her new movie ''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' which opens Friday.
''It hurts when people just make light of things that are important to you,'' Jolie said.
''Like taking your relationship with your brother, which is a very beautiful thing, and twisting it so your parents are watching the TV, it's a moment they'll remember forever, and now rather than seeing a beautiful moment for their children, they're thinking, 'Oh, my God, the whole world is calling our children perverted publicly'''.
Jolie said she and brother Jamie Haven, the children of actor Jon Voight, are close siblings, nothing more.
''We actually felt like the people who wrote that should be a little embarrassed because they came up with it,'' Jolie said.
''That's what's weird''.
As for her abrupt nuptials to Thornton, Jolie laughs off rumors that he married her only as a friend who felt she needed looking out for.
They met while filming ''Pushing Tin'' two years ago but did not become involved until a few months ago, she said.
''If the rumor is he's with me because he wants to look after me, I think that's beautiful,'' Jolie said.
''He does look after me.
And I wouldn't be half as strong and clear and OK as I am today without him''.
Though Thornton has been married four times before and Jolie once previously, to actor Jonny Lee Miller, she said this marriage will last.
The latest of her 10 tattoos is on her left shoulder, reading ''Billy Bob''.
''I know it will be forever,'' Jolie said.
''If I didn't meet him until I was older, during those years I probably would have been married four times, too.
... This is different.
I know we've found each other now''.
Jolie, who turned 25 on Sunday, already has three Golden Globes, for the title role in the HBO movie ''Gia,'' about a supermodel who died of AIDS; for the TV movie ''George Wallace''; and for last year's theatrical film ''Girl, Interrupted''.
Her supporting-actress Oscar came for that film, in which she played a vampish sociopath in a mental ward.
After that movie, Jolie said, she needed something down to earth.
She took the role of Sway, a former car thief drawn into one last night of robbery to help her ex-lover, played by Nicolas Cage, in ''Gone in 60 Seconds''.
''It was a departure for her and a chance to just have fun,'' said director Dominic Sena.
''It wasn't like she was carrying the picture.
She got to be one of the boys''.
Jolie cops yet another new hairstyle for the movie, a wig with long blond dreadlocks, a sharp contrast to her current brunette color.
As she sits crosslegged on a bed in the Four Seasons hotel for her interview, Jolie's simple white T-shirt and blue jeans also contrast with Sway's flashy style.
Sena and producer Jerry Bruckheimer said Jolie threw herself into the role, even buying an old jalopy that she tore apart to learn about cars and auto theft.
''There's two different lives, your work life and your private life, and she was into her work life,'' Bruckheimer said.
As for Jolie's private life, ''she's beautiful, she's smart, she's interesting,'' Bruckheimer said.
''She doesn't fit a mold that Hollywood would love to put on her.
She's kind of the bad girl, which people love.
So she creates a lot of print''.
Next up, Jolie stars as Lara Croft in ''Tomb Raider,'' based on the video game.
Shooting starts in July, and the movie is due out next year.
It's another choice that may raise eyebrows, given the critical acclaim Jolie has earned.
But Jolie said Lara is a good role model, and the actress doesn't care how her professional and personal choices are perceived.
''I know my responsibility is to my work and what the films say,'' Jolie said.
''My personal life, however it's interpreted, it's not my responsibility to have a personal life that everybody's comfortable with.''
LOS ANGELES (AP) --``Shakespeare in Love'' led movie nominees for the 5th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards, and ``NYPD Blue'' edged ahead of the pack in television nominations announced Tuesday.
Also among the honorees was ``Waking Ned Devine,'' the comedy about a lottery winner in a small Irish town, which was named for supporting actor David Kelly and for its ensemble cast, which included actress Fionnula Flanagan.

LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD: Kirk Douglas.
&LR; LOS ANGELES _ When Angelina Jolie was a little girl, her brother would point a home video camera at her and plead, ``C'mon, Ange, give us a show''!
And Jolie would happily oblige, much to the delight of her actress mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who would provide the kids with costumes for elaborate performances.
Jolie's father, actor Jon Voight, encouraged her as well.
Nobody ever told Jolie to be quiet or stop talking.
Instead, as she was growing up, she was constantly challenged to examine her feelings and question the world around her.
``I was being prepared to respond to other people, to listen to other people, to express what I was feeling, to be bold, to be really honest, to let things hurt if they hurt and not be in denial about what was going on inside me,'' the 23-year-old Jolie says.
``And, yeah, those things have helped me as an actress but they've also helped me live my life.
Because, to me, to prepare to be a good actor is to prepare to live life''.
The preparation has paid handsome dividends since the beautiful Jolie began using her talents for more than family productions.
She has stolen every movie she has appeared in, giving passionate performances in otherwise forgettable fare like ``Hackers'' and the recent ``Playing by Heart''.
Where Jolie has really made her mark is in television, winning back-to-back Golden Globes and Emmy nods for the cable movies ``Gia'' and ``George Wallace''.
In the former, she played a doomed fashion model; in the latter, she was the wife of an American icon.
Together, the two turns displayed an incredible range.
``The world is full of beautiful girls, but they're not Angelina Jolie,'' says director John Frankenheimer, who worked with Jolie on ``Wallace''.
``She's fun, honest, intelligent, gorgeous and divinely talented.
She brings a hell of a lot to the party''.
Audiences should find cause for celebration with Jolie's upcoming trio of movies.
In the current air-traffic controller comedy, ``Pushing Tin,'' Jolie plays an unhappy wife given to consuming vodka by the barrel.
Arriving this fall is ``Girl Interrupted,'' the true story of a young woman wrongly placed in a mental institution.
Winona Ryder stars; Jolie plays her schizophrenic friend.
Still later will be ``The Bone Collector,'' a thriller that has Jolie playing a cop partnered with Denzel Washington.
On that one, Jolie's name will appear above the title for the first time in her young career.
It sounds as though Jolie is always working, and she readily admits as much.
She did take a break once.
Jolie had just finished ``Gia,'' a part so rich and so complex that she figured she'd never see the likes of it again.
She was married, if just temporarily, to actor Jonny Lee Miller, who she met while making ``Hackers''.
And she was achingly unhappy.
``It's like I had all the things I had always wanted in my life and there was still something about me that was very empty,'' Jolie says.
``I didn't know if I was going to be hungry again in my life for certain things.
And I didn't know what more I had to give''.
So Jolie took a break.
Sort of.
She took writing and directing classes at New York University, road the subways a lot and realized _ it didn't take too long _ that she really loved acting and that she had much more of herself to give to her profession.
And now, she's not quite sure how to stop giving.
Jolie has worked constantly for the past 18 months and when she isn't on a set, she's usually reading or writing or acting on the stage.
She's constantly looking for characters to play that will help her evolve as a person.
It's almost as if outside of acting, she can't find the motivation to grow.
At one point, Jolie noticed that her characters were taking trips and going out to dinner while she always sat at home, absorbed in the process of soaking up their fictional lives.
Acting was her professional life !ital!and!off! her personal life.
``She has always had a tremendous amount of energy, and the signals were always there that she might give that to acting,'' says father Voight.
But then, Voight must have always considered the possibility.
He and Bertrand, who divorced when Jolie was 2, purposely gave her a middle name that could double as a surname and thus relieve her of an unwanted burden should she choose a show-business career.
Jolie doesn't go into too many specifics about her early years with Voight, only to say that they had a ``stormy relationship'' because they are so much alike.
On this subject, like so many others, she's straightforward and yet a bit mysterious.
Jolie often obliquely refers to ``things'' she has gone through and endured in her life with the unspoken understanding that these are things you don't get to know about.
She reveals herself through her acting.
And that's enough.
That's all she's willing to give.
``For me, acting is a real experience,'' Jolie says.
``I choose roles that fit where I am in my life and open up to them because that's the way I'm opening up.
I make them real and I get close to people.
I know there's a false reality to acting, but the way I do it, it's my life and it's not fake.
It's not just a movie.
It's a real experience that I remember forever''.
Says Voight: ``She has a very strong, specific presence on screen.
There's a certain honesty there that I think is pretty rare, pretty special''.
Jolie would like to keep building on that but realizes that challenging roles for young actresses are few and far between.
She also knows the situation doesn't improve when actresses mature and lose their status as the Next Big Thing.
``I'll never work in this business just to work,'' Jolie says.
`It would kill me to feel like I wasn't really doing anything.
I'm hoping to keep growing and changing so that I'll have more to offer and be able to express it through my work.
And if Hollywood doesn't want to accept that or is critical of me for growing up and aging, then that's their loss because I know there's a need for it''.
``In fact,'' Jolie continues, ``it might make me more aggressive to go through that transition because it's such an important one to express.
It's what life is all about''.
And for Angelina Jolie, acting and life are entirely interwoven, tangled up in a beautiful tapestry that keeps growing. &QL;
NEW YORK (AP) --The director and producer of the serial-killer thriller ``The Bone Collector,'' due out Friday, readily admit Universal Studios executives didn't want Angelina Jolie.
The 24-year-old daughter of actor John Voigt, known for her Barbie-doll figure, tattoos and knives, had quit acting and was attending film school.
``They wanted an 'established' actress,'' director Phillip Noyce tells Entertainment Weekly in its Nov.
5 edition.
It took some heated arguments --with Noyce and producer Martin Bregman both fighting for Jolie -- and a serious slash to the film's budget to get Universal to agree, adds Bregman.
Bregman says he faced similar problems getting then-unknown Michelle Pfeiffer into ``Scarface''.
``Nobody knew who she was,'' he says.
``Angie's enormously gifted, and I usually get what I want''.
Jolie, who appeared in the TNT miniseries ``George Wallace'' and the HBO film ``Gia,'' plays a stuntwoman in ``The Bone Collector'' who tracks a serial killer for a quadriplegic cop played by Denzel Washington.
LOS ANGELES _ Agent 007 and a massive restructuring effort helped drive Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.
to its strongest quarter in a dozen years, studio officials said Tuesday.
MGM recorded its second consecutive profitable quarter during the final three months of 1999, thanks to the impact of a new James Bond flick, ``The World is Not Enough,'' improved video results and a corporate overhaul.
For the quarter ended Dec.
31, Santa Monica-based MGM earned $15.2 million, 8 cents per share, on revenues of $372.2 million.
This compares with a loss of $43.7 million, or 41cents, on revenue of $383.4 million in the 1998 fourth quarter.
Still, the company ended up in the red for all of 1999.
For the year MGM lost $530.9 million, $3.36 a share, on revenue of $1.142 billion.
In 1998 the company lost $157.65 million, $2.08 a share, on sales of $1.24 billion.
The 1999 loss reflects a pretax charge of $440 million to cover restructuring costs.
Dan Taylor, the studio's senior executive vice president and chief financial officer, credited the improved quarterly performance to a variety of factors.
One was the success of MGM films on digital video disc, a format with fatter margins than VHS tapes; cutbacks in staffing and overhead; and the resecuring of video and television rights previously tied up in long-term deals to outside companies.
The rights were resecured without a cash outlay.
``If you exclude the performance of `The World is Not Enough' in the fourth quarter, we still far more than doubled our...
performance,'' Taylor said about earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Matthew Harrigan, senior vice president at Denver-based investment firm Hanifren, Imhoff Inc.
, said the actions of new management seem to be putting MGM back on track.
``The results moderately exceeded expectations, by about $10 million.
But more importantly, there's good momentum on the deal side,'' Harrigan said.
``It looks like they've cobbled together a nice film slate for 2001 ...
and gone a long, long way toward changing the limited talent relationships they've had over the last two years''.
This year started inauspiciously for MGM, with ``Supernova'' opening to bad reviews and sparse box office.
On the television side, MGM's syndicated ``National Enquirer TV'' has just been picked up for a second season, and two new shows are being launched: ``Sexwars'' and ``Chatroom America''.
The latest Bond film is one of the most profitable of the decades-long franchise, collecting more than $320 million so far at the worldwide box office.
It is expected to continue to fill MGM's coffers this year, as it is released to pay-TV and video.
Three other MGM releases _ ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' ``Stigmata'' and ``Tea With Mussolini'' _ also performed above expectations, Taylor said.
MGM outlined a slate of 14 films for 2001.
Among them are a remake of ``Rollerball'' directed by John McTiernan, a sequel to ``Silence of the Lambs'' titled ``Hannibal'' and the sequel ``Basic Instinct 2''.
Studio executives have high hopes for such star-studded upcoming theatrical releases as ``Autumn in New York,'' starring Richard Gere and Winona Ryder; ``Dancing in the Dark,'' with Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie; and ``Heartbreakers,'' featuring Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt.

LAS VEGAS (AP) --Oscar winners Billy Bob Thornton and Angelina Jolie were married here in a no-frills, quickie ceremony.
The actors married about 3:30 p.m.
Friday at the Little Church of the West on the Las Vegas Strip, chapel owner Greg Smith said Saturday.
The bride and groom both wore jeans for the 20-minute ceremony, he said.
The Clark County Marriage License Bureau confirmed Saturday that Thornton, 44, and Jolie, 24, received a marriage license Friday.
This is the fifth marriage for Thornton and the second for Jolie.
Thornton won a 1996 Academy Award for the screenplay of ''Sling Blade'' and was also nominated for best supporting actor last year for ''A Simple Plan''.
Jolie, the daughter of actor Jon Voight, won an Oscar this year for her role as a hospitalized sociopath in ''Girl, Interrupted''.
The pair appeared together in ''Pushing Tin,'' a comedy about frenzied air traffic controllers.
They played husband and wife.
LOS ANGELES (AP) --Angelina Jolie, the disruptive mental patient in ''Girl, Interrupted,'' won the Academy Award for best supporting actress Sunday night, a generation after her father took home an Oscar.
''I'm surprised nobody's ever fainted up here,'' the 24-year-old actress said, thanking numerous people including her father, Jon Voight, a best actor winner for ''Coming Home'' and nominee for ''Midnight Cowboy''.
''Dad, you're a great actor, but a better father,'' Jolie said.
Jolie's honor was the night's first major award of the evening.
''Topsy-Turvy'' won two early awards, for makeup and costume design, while ''The Matrix'' won for sound.
''American Beauty'' topped most critic lists going into the ceremony, and it was named best picture in Friday's controversial Wall Street Journal poll of 356 of the 5,607 voting Academy members.
Scientific or not, the survey was ''American Beauty's'' clincher for best buzz going into the Oscar show, broadcast on ABC with Billy Crystal as host.
The poll's other favorites also seemed to reflect pre-Oscar conventional wisdom: Denzel Washington for leading actor in ''The Hurricane,'' Hilary Swank for leading actress in ''Boys Don't Cry,'' Michael Caine for supporting actor in ''The Cider House Rules,'' and Jolie for supporting actress.
When nominations were announced, ''American Beauty'' and ''The Cider House Rules'' were leading contenders for best picture.
The standing of ''The Cider House Rules'' heightened as Miramax put on an ad blitz.
DreamWorks countered with a campaign for ''American Beauty''.
The awards show capped one of the most bizarre Oscar seasons.
First, academy voters complained that they hadn't received their ballots for the final vote.
By the time a large supply of the ballots was found in a post office, the academy had printed new ballots.
The academy also extended the voting deadline a few days to last Thursday, meaning the accountants had to work overtime on awards weekend.
Then came The Mystery of the Missing Oscars.
A shipment of 55 shiny new Oscar statuettes from the Chicago manufacturer disappeared from a loading dock at Roadway Express on March 8.
Salvage man Willie Fulgear stumbled across 52 of the missing awards while rummaging through a trash container.
Three Oscars remain missing.
Fulgear, 61, became an instant celebrity.
He was given a $50,000 reward by the shipping company and two tickets to Sunday's show.
''Willie got $50,000 for finding the 52 Oscars.
That's not a lot of money when you realize that Miramax and DreamWorks are spending millions of dollars just to get one,'' Crystal quipped as he pointed out the Oscar hero during the program's opening number.
A Roadway trucker was charged with stealing the statuettes.
Weeks before the awards presentations, the academy announced the evening's special awards: Warren Beatty was named for the Irving Thalberg Award for a high level of producing.
Among his producer credits: ''Bonnie and Clyde,'' ''Shampoo,'' ''Reds'' and ''Dick Tracy''.
Andrzej Wajda, premier director of Poland, won an honorary award ''for showing both the loftiest heights and the darkest depths of the European soul''.
His films include ''Landscape after Battle,'' ''Man of Marble'' and ''Man of Steel''.

JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) --The following are major news items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
The Jerusalem Post: --Prime Minister Ehud Barak hinted on Thursday night that the defense budget of Israel may be cut.
In a speech in northern Israel, Barak said that Israel needs strength and confidence to make the difficult decisions for peace.
But he said a secure Israel as a center for the Jewish people is the supreme goal.
Haaretz: --Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday urged Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to seize a "historic opportunity" to make peace with Israel.
Barak also said he believes that peace with Syria is a prerequisite for a stable Middle East.
Ma'ariv: --Six people, including a mother and her two children, were killed Thursday night when the car they were driving collided head-on with a bus in the northern Israel.
Forty-two passengers on the bus suffered light injuries in the accident.
Yediot Aharonot: --Two agents of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency were released by Cyprus on Thursday.
The two men had been sentenced five months ago to a three-year jail term.
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides said the suspension of the jail terms followed a recommendation of clemency by his attorney-general and as a goodwill gesture to the new Israeli government.
JERUSALEM (AP) _ A senior official in Israel's Mossad intelligence agency has reportedly resigned following the arrest of two agents in Cyprus _ the third botched spy mission in a year.
The Mossad operations chief, known publicly only as ``Y,'' offered to step down after Cypriot police arrested the two Israelis and seized electronic monitoring equipment, the daily Haaretz newspaper reported Tuesday.
Mossad chief Ephraim Halevy accepted ``Y's'' resignation, the paper said.
An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the report.
The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is responsible for overseeing intelligence agencies, declined comment.
The suspects were caught with tapes of police conversations and surveillance devices near an army base on the Mediterranean island earlier this month.
Cyprus has accused them of operating with ``a specific intelligence institute whose headquarters is in Tel Aviv''.
Police on the island said the two were spying on behalf of Turkey, which has a defense pact with Israel.
The Israeli government has not acknowledged publicly that the two are Mossad agents, saying only that they did not spy on behalf of Turkey and were not trying to hurt Cypriot interests.
``Y'' also had offered his resignation earlier this year after Swiss police arrested five Mossad agents for allegedly spying in a residential area of Bern, Israel radio said.
Former Mossad chief Danny Yatom resigned in February following a failed attempt to assassinate a leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas in Jordan.
Haaretz said ``Y'' was not involved in that operation.
JERUSALEM (AP) - A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office Wednesday regarding two Israelis accused of spying in Cyprus was interpreted by Israeli media as a confirmation the two worked for Israel's Mossad.
Netanyahu's office said the premier met with the Cypriot ambassador to Israel after reviewing an internal investigation regarding the spy charges.
Netanyahu has not confirmed or denied reports that the two men in custody in Nicosia, Cyprus are Mossad agents.
``The prime minister said that from this inquiry he could confirm that Israel did not act against Cyprus and did not act on Cypriot soil on behalf of or at the request of Turkey''.
There was no indication from the statement that the two men could have worked independently of the government.
The two Israelis, who enter Cyprus on false passports, were arrested Nov.
6 in the coastal fishing village of Ziyi.
Police found surveillance equipment and recording devices in the apartment the two men had rented.
Cypriot prosecutor Andreas Naum said that shortly before their arrest, the two had been telephoning ``a specific intelligence institute whose headquarters is in Tel Aviv''.
Police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the two men were believed to be spying on behalf of Turkey, which has close relations with Israel but not with Cyprus.
Both Israel and Turkey, which occupies the northern third of the island, are interested in gaining information on the planned deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
Cypriot officials have said that if the two men turn out to be Mossad agents, it would deeply affect relations between the two countries.
In September 1997, Israeli Mossad agents were caught in Jordan trying to assassinate a political figure in the militant Hamas group.
The incident strained Israeli-Jordanian relations.

NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Israel on Monday tried to repair any damage done to relations with Cyprus after the weekend arrest of two Israelis on suspicion of spying for the Greek Cypriot government's enemy, Turkey.
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who visited Cyprus three days before the Israelis' arrest Saturday, sent his Cypriot counterpart a ``message of friendship,'' Israeli Ambassador Shemi Tzur told reporters.
``We do hope that this cloud which appeared this last weekend will leave us and we will continue our good relations,'' Tzur said The Justice Ministry said Sunday evening that the men have not been linked to Israel's government, but an investigation continues.
Police officials have said privately that the Israelis probably were gathering information for Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops in the Turkish-occupied northern third of the Mediterranean island.
Israel has not denied the men worked for its Mossad intelligence agency.
Asked Sunday if they were Israeli agents, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, ``Every Israeli citizen is important to us.
We'll clarify this, and of course we'll bring them home''.
The two Israelis were seized in an apartment in the fishing village of Ziyi, halfway between the coastal cities of Larnaca and Limassol.
They appeared in court and were ordered held for eight days for a police investigation.
A police statement said that the two were suspected of spying on the Cypriot National Guard and that cameras, recordings of police radio messages, radio scanners and maps were found in the apartment.
Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974, following an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Wednesday he supports the establishment of a Palestinian state but urged that no step be taken unilaterally.
``I am for a Palestinian state for the alternative to a Palestinian state is a poor one,'' he said.
But he suggested that such a move should be negotiated.
Peres said his visit had helped dispel bad feelings between Cyprus and Israel following last month's arrest on the island of two Israelis on suspicion of spying.
Peres said he had ``very, very friendly talks'' with President Glafcos Clerides, ``and I think all the problems were clarified''.
He added that the mission of the two Israelis who have been described as Mossad agents ``was basically a mistake''.
The two Israelis were arrested on Nov.
6 and are to go on trial for spying and gathering military information on Dec.
21. Peres avoided revealing the nature of the two Israelis' mission but indicated it was linked to anti-terrorism.
``It wasn't bad intentions or any attempt to spy on Cyprus or against Cyprus.
This is nonsense.
It is a local accident which we regret very much,'' he added.

LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Two Israelis held on this Mediterranean island on suspicion of espionage were formally charged Friday with spying on Cyprus for a foreign country and will go on trial next month.
A defense request for bail was turned down.
The two were also charged with the illegal possession of wireless equipment for espionage use and conspiring with each other to commit a crime in a case that has caused tension between Cyprus and Israel.
The two, Udi Hargov, 27, and Igal Damary, 47, were charged during a brief court hearing in the southern coastal town of Larnaca.
Judge Tefkros Economou, after retiring to consider the evidence against them, returned to the court to announce that their trial will begin Dec.
8 as the prosecution requested.
Adjourning the proceedings for a second time to look into a defense request for bail, Economou later decided that the two must continue to be held by Cypriot authorities given the gravity of the charges they faced.
Defense lawyer Antis Triantafyllides earlier said the Israeli Embassy in Cyprus would keep the two men inside its premises in the capital Nicosia, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Larnaca, until the trial begins.
Hergov and Damary have been held in the Nisosia Central Prisons since their arrest Nov.
6. Prosecutor George Papaioannou objected to the bail request, arguing that the two faced ``serious spying charges''.
The two Israelis were arrested in the coastal fishing village of Ziyi.
Police found surveillance equipment and recording devices in the apartment the two men had rented.
The two deny they are spies, but their arrest soured relations between Cyprus and Israel and came only days after President Ezer Weizman ended the first ever official visit to the island by an Israeli head of state.
Unshaven and in the same clothes they wore on the day of their arrest two weeks ago, the two were brought to Larnaca from Nicosia in two separate cars.
Their hands cuffed behind their backs, they were guarded by armed members of the police anti-terrorist squad.
Both men bowed their heads as they were escorted into the courthouse to avoid the waiting photographers.
The spying charge states that the two men collected information linked to the defense of Cyprus and transmitted this to a ``foreign state'' through a computer between Oct.
15 and Nov.
6. The appearance of the two Israelis in court came two days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement that was interpreted by the Israeli media as a confirmation the two worked for Israel's Mossad.
``The prime minister said that from this inquiry he could confirm that Israel did not act against Cyprus and did not act on Cypriot soil on behalf of or at the request of Turkey,'' it said.
Turkey has occupied the northern third of Cyprus since 1974, when it invaded the island following a coup by supporters of union with Greece.
It maintains about 30,000 troops in the north, where a a breakaway state was declared in 1983.
Both Israel and Turkey are known to be interested in gaining information on the planned arrival in Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
Ankara has repeatedly threatened to prevent their deployment on the island, by military means if necessary.
The fishing village where the two Israelis have been arrested is the site of a proposed naval base and the area nearby served as a main theater of large Greek-Greek Cypriot war games last month.

JERUSALEM, February 2 (Xinhua) --The following are major news items in leading Israeli newspapers on Tuesday.
The Jerusalem Post --Shimon Peres, former Israeli prime minister, said on Monday that no matter who wins the coming elections, the next Israeli government will be a unity government.
Peres also said that the unity government will be a coalition for peace and will advance the peace process.
Haaretz --A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel would do everything it could to bring about the repatriation of the two Mossad agents who were sentenced to three years in prison in Cyprus.
Israel has maintained that the two men were civil servants who were engaged in thwarting international terrorism and not in any activity detrimental to Cyprus.
Yediot Aharonot --A Palestinian security officer was shot and killed in Gaza by three members of the Islamic militant group Hamas on Monday.
A Palestinian girl was also killed when the three men tried to escape in a car and ran over her.
JERUSALEM, August 12 (Xinhua) --Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday expressed his appreciation on Cyprus for its pardoning of two Israelis who had been given jail terms on spy charges.
In a statement issued by Barak's office, the prime minister said that the act, carried out by Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides at the recommendation of the Cypriot general prosecutor, is greatly appreciated by the Israeli public.
Barak said that the act will promote the good neighborly relations between the two countries.
The two Israelis were arrested near a military camp in southern Cyprus last November at a time when Cyprus was to deploy a battery of Russian S-300 missiles in the region.
They had pleaded guilty to a charge of approaching the prohibited military area and were sentenced to three years in prison.
They were also given a concurrent jail term of six months for possessing wireless scanning equipment without a license.
Israel has admitted the two were agents from its Mossad intelligence agency.
Their pardons approved by Clerides were "based on the national interest of Cyprus.
The continuing detention of the two men would no longer serve the national interest," a statement issued by Cypriot government said.
The Cypriot government also called it a friendly gesture to Israeli Barak assuming office last month.
JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel was officially silent Sunday on the subject of two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of spying, but a government official said Israeli diplomats would likely visit them in prison.
Israeli foreign ministry spokeman Effii Ben-Matityahu had no comment on the arrests other than to note that officials from the Israeli consulate were expected to go to the Nicosia prison where the two were being held.
Cypriot police said the two would be brought before a remand hearing Nov.
16. In Israel, some former officials and analysts expressed doubts that the two _ arrested Saturday in the community of Ziyi near the southern coastal resort of Larnaca for allegedly spying on a nearby army base _ were working for the Mossad secret service.
A Cypriot police source said the Israelis were suspected of spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
Turkey has significantly increased military cooperation with Israel in the past two years.
Israeli military analyst Ron Ben Yishai, writing in the Yediot Ahronoth newspaper, suggested the arrests were meant as a warning to Israel not to cooperate with Turkey in any spy operation.
Some Israeli press reports speculated about whether the pair's presence had anything to do with Cyprus' recent purchase of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
Cyprus fears Israel is training Turkish pilots on how to bomb the missile batteries once they are installed.
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides reaffirmed Saturday that his government would go ahead and deploy the anti-aircraft missiles.
Senior intelligence sources told the Maariv newspaper that the Mossad would not take such risks to gather intelligence on Turkey's behalf.
Israeli military commentator Oded Granot wrote in Maariv newspaper that the two might have been caught in a training exercise that went wrong.
Rafi Eitan, a former Mossad operator, said methods and devices used by the two were not typical of the Mossad.
He speculated that the two might have been hired by a private Turkish outfit.
Cypriot police officials said Saturday they found cameras, wireless instruments, tapes of conversations between police, radio scanners and maps in the apartment the two were renting.
Relations between Cyprus and Israel have chilled in recent months as Israel conducted joint military maneuvers with Turkey as part of their 1996 defense pact.
Israel has repeatedly insisted that its ties with Turkey are not directed against any other countries in the region.
Israeli President Ezer Weizman had almost succeeded in patching up relations with Cyprus with a three-day visit to the island last week.
During the 1970s and 1980s, Cyprus was widely used as a regional listening post by intelligence agents from various regional powers.

NICOSIA, March 24 (Xinhua) --Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides will start a four-day state visit to Israel next Tuesday, local reports said Friday.
The coming visit, the first ever to Israel by a Cyprus head of state, is a return visit to Israeli President Ezer Weizman's trip to Cyprus in November 1998.
During his stay, Clerides will hold talks with Weizman, Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister David Levy.
Political observers here believed that the visit is a bridge- building act aimed to cement the Israeli-Cyprus ties shaken by an espionage scandal.
Cyprus arrested two alleged Israeli Mossad agents less than 48 hours after Weizman's departure from Nicosia during his first visit to the island country in 1998.
They were caught spying on a secret military shipment near Larnaca, Cyprus' southern coast and were sentenced to three years in prison for trespassing on a prohibited military area in February last year.
The two were released six months later.
Clerides will also visit the West Bank city of Ramallah for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Two Israelis arrested on suspicion of spying had been telephoning an intelligence institute in Tel Aviv just before being seized, a police prosecutor said in court Sunday.
The court ordered the two held for another five days after the prosecutor, Andreas Naum, said he needed the time to complete investigating ``a very serious case of spying''.
He added that investigations have already established that shortly before their arrest just after midnight on Nov.
6 the two men had been telephoning ``a specific intelligence institute whose headquarters is in Tel Aviv''.
The Israeli daily Haaretz reported Thursday that the two men are agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and that they were part of an intelligence operation near the small fishing port of Ziyi.
Israel has not denied that the two are Mossad agents.
Israel's Foreign Ministry said only that rumors that the two were spying on behalf of Turkey, Israel's military ally, were not true.
A ministry statement added that the two were not acting against Cyprus, but gave no further explanation.
Naum said the two men had been placed under surveillance Nov.
6 a few hours after their arrival from Israel, ``following reports of suspicious movements by Israelis in the Ziyi area''.
``On the night of their arrest there was a very important military operation in the area which had to be kept secret,'' he added.
Naum added that the two men had refused to answer any questions or otherwise cooperate with the investigation.
Lawyer Andis Triantafyllides said his clients, Udi Hargov, 27, and Igal Damary, 47, deny they are spies.
Both Israel and Turkey, which occupies the northern third of the island, are interested in gaining information on the planned deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ More than 20 people, including a woman, have been arrested on suspicion of spying for Israel, a Beirut newspaper reported Sunday.
Ad Diyar newspaper said the arrests followed a security sweep carried out by the Lebanese army in the neighborhood of Chiyeh in Beirut's southern suburbs in the past few days.
The suspects were providing a Cyprus-based branch of the Israeli intelligence service, Mossad, with information, the paper said, quoting unidentified ``informed sources''.
It did not say what kind of information the suspects allegedly gave to Mossad.
The network was uncovered based on information from a Lebanese suspected of being a spy for Israel and of helping Israeli troops in the assassination of a guerrilla leader in south Lebanon last month, the paper said.
Hossam al-Amin, a commander of the Syrian-backed Shiite Amal guerrilla movement, was killed when a missile fired from an Israeli attack helicopter struck his car in south Lebanon.
The paper's report could not immediately be confirmed by security officials.
The latest arrests were believed to be separate from a spy ring that the government said it uncovered on July 8.
Then, Lebanon accused 77 people of passing information to Israel on Lebanese and Syrian troop movements and the activities of Lebanese guerrillas.
At the time, officials said 17 of the suspects were under arrest and the remaining 60 were at large.
Government Prosecutor Nasri Lahoud said the 77 faced charges for ``the crimes of contacting the Israeli enemy and its agents'' and passing information to them.
If convicted, the suspects could face the death penalty.
Lebanon, which is technically at war with Israel, forbids contacts with the Jewish state.

JERUSALEM _ The arrest of two Israelis on suspicion of spying on a military installation in Cyprus had a comic caper element that immediately raised questions here about whether it was the latest in a series of bungles by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.
On a more serious level the arrest of two Israeli men in a small fishing village near Larnaca, Cyprus, spotlighted increased regional tensions about the growing security cooperation between Israel and Turkey.
The two men, Udi Hargov, 27, and Yigal Damary, 49, who claimed to be teachers, were held on suspicion of espionage after the Cypriots said they had been found with a complement of electronic equipment while recording police or military conversations off a sophisticated scanner.
According to the Cypriots, the men had visited the coastal village, Zygi, which abuts a military camp, twice before in the previous month.
The proprietor of a local taverna, Panikos Cristoldo, had been alerted to notify the authorities if they returned.
When they did, Cristoldo turned them in.
``Something in my heart told me these were spies who had come to hurt my country,'' Cristoldo told the Israeli daily Maariv.
``Since my intuition never disappoints me, I knew that when the police turned up, they would not go away empty-handed.
Everyone in our small village suspected them''.
Israel's president, Ezer Weizman, traveled to Nicosia just last week to smooth tensions with Cyprus, where the government is wary of the growing closeness between Israel and Turkey.
Cyprus has been in a tense dispute with Turkey since 1974, when Turkish forces seized control of the northern third of the island.
Tensions have been aggravated by the Greek Cypriots' recent purchase of Russian anti-aircraft missiles.
``Naturally we are not happy that holders of Israeli passports were involved in something like this,'' said Euripides Euriviades, the Cypriot ambassador to Israel.
``There is a lot of anxiety back home with what is happening with the ongoing strategic, military relationship between Israel and Turkey.
We had the assurances of President Weizman last week that no harm could come to us from this relationship.
So the timing of the incident is not great, although we have due process back home and everyone is innocent until proved guilty''.
Through the 1990s, Turkey and Israel have forged a close strategic relationship.
The Israelis have sold military equipment and provided training to the Turks, and the Turks have allowed Israeli military planes to fly over Turkish air space.
Before the Turkish prime minister visited Israel in early September, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel created a political storm by saying the relationship constituted a ``new axis'' in the Middle East.
He later retracted this description, saying he had not expressed himself well.
Writing for the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, Ron Ben Yishai, a security expert, said the highly publicized arrests were meant to send ``a warning to Israel lest it decide to provide Turkey with any intelligence or military assistance in its fight against Greek Cyprus''.
Euriviades said the Cypriots would probably charge the two with espionage within the week.
Spying is punishable by a maximum sentence of 10 years.
But it remained unclear Sunday whom _ if anyone _ the two Israelis represented.
Some intelligence experts theorized that they were working directly for the Turks, who have vowed to block the imminent delivery of the new surface-to-air missiles.
The Cypriots fear that the Israelis have trained Turkish pilots in sophisticated interception techniques.
The Mossad has been known to use Cyprus for training missions, and Gad Shomron, a former Mossad agent, conjectured that the two Israelis, who had previously visited Cyprus, were on such a mission.
The previous visit had coincided with a Greek-Cypriot military exercise off the coast, the Cypriot authorities said.
The Israelis' activities raised suspicions, and when they returned, Cypriot officials obtained a search warrant for their temporary apartment, and said they had found cameras, maps, two scanners and tapes of Greek conversations between police or military officials.
``There is no doubt that based on the information that we have, they came for the purpose of spying on the Republic of Cyprus and specifically the National Guard,'' Sgt.
Kyriakos Kyriacou, the police lawyer for the Larnaca district, told a court.
The Israeli press Sunday used the occasion to recount all Mossad's most recent blunders.
They included an incident earlier this year, when five Mossad agents were caught trying to bug a house in Bern, Switzerland.
That same week, the Mossad director resigned over a bungled attempt to assassinate a Hamas official in Jordan last fall.
NICOSIA, November 19 (Xinhua) --Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted that the two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of espionage against Cyprus are Mossad agents, Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Thursday.
Netanyahu made the admission during his meeting with Cypriot Ambassador to Israel Euripedes Evriviades on Wednesday, CNA quoted well-informed sources as saying.
However, Netanyahu said that the two were not acting against Cyprus or on behalf of Turkey.
Netanyahu also said he was sorry that his words to the press last week were misunderstood in Cyprus.
Last week, local media slammed Netanyahu's statement that he would bring back the two Israelis.
The two Israelis, Udi Hargov and Igal Damary, were arrested here on November 7 after police raided their apartment and found hi-tech equipment tuned into the police radio frequency.
They were allegedly operating in a sensitive military area at a time of increased military activities in the vicinity.
Larnaca District Court issued a remand order to the two suspects on November 7 for eight-day pending investigations.
The two Israelis will appear again before the court Friday morning after they were remanded for another five days.
CNA Thursday also quoted Moshe Fogel, director of the Israeli government press office, as saying that "the prime minister said he would try to resolve the problem".
There is ongoing contacts between the two countries, said the director, refusing to comment any further on the matter.
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) --Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel wants to clarify the issue about the two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on charge of spying, with the aim of bringing them back home.
Speaking to Israeli TV Channel 2 Sunday night, Netanyahu said that "every Israeli citizen is important to us.
We will clarify this, and of course we will bring them home".
Uzi Landu, Chairman of Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, has also said that they should be brought back immediately.
Diplomatic activities are widely said to be underway between the two sides, because they want the affair to end quietly.
The Cypriot Justice Ministry issued a brief statement Sunday, saying the two men were not working for Israel.
It did not mention the word "Mossad," Israel's intelligence organization.
Officials in Jerusalem have declined to comment till now, except confirming that the two are Israelis.
Suspects Udi Hargov, 37, and Igal Damary, 49, have been remanded for eight days and were transferred Sunday to Nicosia for further investigation at an unspecified location, reports from Cyprus said, adding that the two are being held separately.
Cyprus has expressed concern over the military alliance between Turkey and Israel, but is also keen on maintaining good relations with Israel.
This is not the first time this year that Israel has been embarrassed by a "security mishap" in Cyprus.
In April, two Israeli planes were caught flying over a planned missile base in the northwest of the Island.
NICOSIA, September 15 (Xinhua) --Israel Tuesday assured Cyprus that its military alliance with Turkey will not harm Cyprus and urged Arab diplomats to promote the peace process with Israel.
Speaking after his meeting Tuesday with Cyprus' House of Representatives President Spyros Kyprianou, Israeli Ambassador to Nicosia Shemi Tzur said his country wants stability in the Eastern Mediterranean and would like to see a solution to the Cyprus problem.
Tzur made the remarks just one day after Arab ambassadors accredited to Cyprus expressed concern about Israeli-Turkish military alliance following their meeting with Kyprianou.
Commenting on statements made Monday by Arab ambassadors to Cyprus that they are worried over the Turkish-Israeli military alliance, Tzur said that "Arab countries should be more worried how to proceed with the peace process with Israel and to leave this sort of things aside".
He said their worries have nothing to do with Cyprus and urged Arab diplomats to help "promote peace process with Israel, to convince Palestinians... to come forward to proceed with the peace".
Tzur said that during his meeting with Kyprianou, the Cypriot House president received again the assurances that Israel's cooperation with Turkey has nothing in it to harm Cyprus.
"Israel is a close friend of Cyprus, Israel won't harm Cyprus, there is nothing in that agreement to harm Cyprus," Tzur said.
Turkey and Israel have enjoyed close military ties since 1996 when they signed a military cooperation agreement.
Tzur said his country "is looking for stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, we want to see stability, we want to see the Cyprus problem being solved".
On his part, Kyprianou said that during his discussions with the Israeli ambassador, he raised the issue of the military cooperation between Israel and Turkey because "it creates an atmosphere of concern to both Cyprus and Greece and to other countries in the region".
He said Tzur told him that the alliance is of a technical and commercial nature and has nothing to do with Cyprus, nor should it affect the very good relations between the two countries or the relations between Israel and Greece.
Kyprianou said Cyprus does not oppose alliances between countries in the region, but stressed that these should not affect issues which seriously concern Cyprus.
Cyprus' relations with Israel have been enhanced since the opening of its embassy in Tel Aviv five years ago and through the exchange of visits by high-ranking officials.
NICOSIA, August 13 (Xinhua) --Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides has received personal thanks from Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Ehud Barak for freeing two Israelis jailed in Cyprus.
The two Israelis, Igar Damary, 49 and Udi Hargov, 37, were sentenced in February to three years in jail for approaching a restricted area and possessing banned listening devices without the permission of the Cyprus authorities.
Cyprus government said Thursday that President Clerides decided to grant pardon to the two Israelis and suspend their prison terms as their continuing imprisonment "no longer served the national interest".
"President Weizman had a long and very warm and friendly conversation with President Clerides on Thursday evening during which he thanked the President of Cyprus for suspending the sentence," the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Friday.
Later Thursday, Barak also called Clerides to thank him personally for his move.
Clerides has accepted an invitation from his Israeli counterpart to pay an official visit to Israel.
Weizman paid an official visit to Cyprus last November.
LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) --Two Israelis found with radio scanners, maps and sophisticated equipment near an army commando training camp were sentenced today to three years in prison -- half the maximum allowed under Cypriot law.
The case has strained relations with Israel, whose growing military cooperation with Turkey has become a source of serious concern to Cyprus, more than one-third of which is occupied by Turkish troops.
The Israelis, arrested Nov.
6 at a fishing village on the southern coast of Cyprus, pleaded guilty last week to approaching a prohibited military area.
Today, they also received concurrent jail terms of six months for possessing wireless scanning equipment without a license.
Last Friday, Udi Hargov and Igal Damary pleaded guilty to the lesser charges after the prosecution dropped charges of conspiracy and espionage in an apparent plea bargain deal.
Conspiracy and espionage carried maximum 10-year jail penalties.
The Israelis arrested at the village of Zigi were found to have radio scanners, a laptop computer, cellular phones and eight maps of the island.
The village is near military installations, including an army commando training camp.
Newspapers reported that the Israelis had made calls to a number in Tel Aviv that was believed to be Israel's Mossad spy agency.
The three-year sentence was half the maximum allowed under Cypriot law.
George Aresti, head of the three-member judicial panel of the Larnaca Assize Court, said that although the spying charge had been withdrawn, the court could not ignore that the two approached the military area ``at a time when a very serious military operation was under way''.
There were reports at the time that the operation involved the delivery of tanks and other military equipment for the Cypriot army.
Turkey has maintained troops in northern Cyprus since 1974, when it invaded in support of Turkish Cypriots after a failed coup by Greek Cypriots who sought union with Greece.
The defense had claimed that the Israelis were here in connection with an Israeli anti-terrorist operation that was not aimed at Cyprus.
But the court said no evidence was produced to back up the claim.
After reducing the charges last week, Attorney-General Alecos Markides told a news conference that Cyprus had not been pressured to drop the spying and conspiracy charges.
Markides acknowledged, however, that his Israeli counterpart, Elyakim Rubinstein, had come to see him twice about the case.
The trial began Jan. 20.
LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greek Cypriot police arrested two Israeli men Saturday on suspicion of spying, and a court ordered them detained pending investigation.
A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two men were suspected of spying for Israel on behalf of Turkey.
The two countries have a military alliance.
Justice Minister Nikos Koshis was also quoted by Cyprus state radio as saying that it should not be assumed they were spying for Israel.
This was seen as an inference that spying, if any, might be for Turkey, which has occupied the northern third of the island of Cyprus since a 1974 invasion in the wake of an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
In the 1970s and 1980s, Cyprus was a listening post for the intelligence agents of Israel as well as the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was based in Lebanon, a half-hour flight from the Mediterranean island.
The suspects appeared in Larnaca District Court hours after police raided and searched their apartment in the village of Ziyi shortly after midnight.
Ziyi is near an army camp and the southern coastal town of Larnaca.
Sgt. Kyriakos Kyriacou, the police lawyer for the district, told the court that an investigation is being conducted of whether the two spied on the Cypriot army.
Kyriacou said the pair arrived in Cyprus on Friday.
They also visited Cyprus and stayed in Ziyi between Oct.
15 and Oct.
22, when the army was conducting its annual exercise nearby.
The two men were under surveillance, he said.
The men were identified as Udi Hargov, 27 and Igal Damary, 49.
They will appear in court again on Nov.
16 when formal charges could be filed or the prosecution might ask for further remand.
The arrest came three days after Israeli President Ezer Weizman ended a three-day visit to the island.
The visit, the first by an Israeli president, was hailed as ushering in a new era in the lukewarm relations between the two countries.
JERUSALEM (AP) _ The two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of spying were not working for Israel, the Cypriot government said Sunday.
``From the investigations to date, nothing has transpired to link this issue with the government of Israel,'' the Cypriot Justice Ministry said Sunday.
There were no other details.
A Cypriot police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Israelis were suspected of spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
Cypriot police said the two men would be brought before a remand hearing Nov.
16. The two Israelis were arrested Saturday in a small community of Ziyi near the southern coastal resort of Larnaca.
Cypriot police said they found cameras, wireless instruments, tapes of conversations between police, radio scanners and maps in the apartment the two were renting.
The two Israelis were visited Saturday and Sunday by Israeli consulate officials.
Turkey has significantly increased military cooperation with Israel in the past two years.
Israeli military analyst Ron Ben Yishai, writing in the Yediot Ahronoth newspaper, suggested the arrests were meant as a warning to Israel not to cooperate with Turkey in any spy operation.
Some Israeli press reports speculated about whether the pair's presence had anything to do with Cyprus' recent purchase of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
Cyprus fears Israel is training Turkish pilots on how to bomb the missile batteries once they are installed.
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides reaffirmed Saturday that his government would go ahead and deploy the anti-aircraft missiles.
Rafi Eitan, a former Mossad operator, speculated that the two suspects might have been hired by a private Turkish outfit.
Israel TV said the two men arrived three weeks ago during a military training exercise in the area.
Relations between Cyprus and Israel have chilled in recent months as Israel conducted joint military maneuvers with Turkey as part of their 1996 defense pact.
Israel has repeatedly insisted that its ties with Turkey are not directed against any other countries in the region.
Israeli President Ezer Weizman had almost succeeded in patching up relations with Cyprus with a three-day visit to the island last week.
Cypriot ambassador to Israel Euripides Evriades told Israel's Channel Two TV that he hoped the incident would not harm relations between the two countries.
``We want to look at this through the prism of the good relations we have with Israel because...
we treasure these relations,'' Evriades said.
During the 1970s and 1980s, Cyprus was widely used as a regional listening post by intelligence agents from various regional powers.

JERUSALEM --Israeli cabinet gave its final go-ahead Thursday to the long-delayed troop withdrawal from the West Bank agreed upon in the recent land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians.
The approval paved the way for Israeli troops to begin withdrawing from 2 percent of the West Bank in the first of the three phases of further redeployment, in which Israel will hand over a total of 13 percent of the areas.
Israeli officials said the withdrawal would begin as early as Thursday night.
Besides turning the 2 percent into shared control, Israel will turn over 7 percent of the West Bank now under joint control to exclusive Palestinian control.
(Israel-Withdrawal 1st Ld Writethru) - - - - JERUSALEM --Israeli Agricultural Minister Rafael Eitan said he was considering leaving the government and might do so later Thursday, Israel Radio reported.
Before Thursday's cabinet voting on the scheduled first stage of Israeli withdrawal from the West Band, the hawkish minister told Israel Radio that he might resign if the cabinet approved the pullback, agreed upon in the latest land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians.
The minister said he felt that he was reaching the end of his period in the government, which came to power in June 1996.
He called for new elections and a reassessment of the current situation.
(Israel-Cabinet 1st Ld Writethru) - - - - CAIRO --Egypt on Thursday welcomed Israel's decision to start troop pullback from the West Bank under a recent peace accord with the Palestinians.
Speaking to reporters, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa termed the Israeli decision as "definitely positive".
Moussa, meanwhile, cautioned that "no strings would be attached to" the troop withdrawal, which he hoped "would be followed through in all good faith".
(Egypt-Israel-Troop Pullback) - - - - NICOSIA --Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted that the two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of espionage against Cyprus are Mossad agents, Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Thursday.
Netanyahu made the admission during his meeting with Cypriot Ambassador to Israel Euripedes Evriviades on Wednesday, CNA quoted well-informed sources as saying.
However, Netanyahu said that the two were not acting against Cyprus or on behalf of Turkey.
(Cyprus-Israel-Spying Case) - - - - ANKARA --Turkish Parliament Thursday accepted three no-confidence motions aimed at toppling Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's government.

JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to dispel persistent rumors, Israel's Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday that two Israelis arrested in Cyprus last week as suspected spies were not working for Turkey.
The statement did not say who had employed the two.
``The two Israelis that were arrested in Cyprus didn't act against Cyprus and didn't act on Turkey's behalf,'' the statement said.
The arrests have strained relations between Israel and Cyprus, which has grown increasingly suspicious of Israel's military pact with Turkey.
Cypriot police had said they suspected the Israelis were spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
But the Foreign Ministry said it would work to maintain good relations with the island country.
``The friendly relations between the two countries, expressed recently by the Israeli president's visit to Cyprus, will continue and will be tightened,'' the statement said.
The Foreign Ministry said it would continue to clarify the issue.

JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Cypriot restaurant owner who tipped police to the activities of two Israelis suspected of spying is actually a Cypriot security agent, the daily Haaretz reported Friday.
Haaretz, citing a Cypriot source, said the two Israelis now in police custody in Nicosia were under surveillance during a previous visit to Cyprus in mid-October, but were allowed to leave because of a lack of incriminating evidence.
On their next trip in early November, Cyprus monitored the two Israelis as soon as they arrived at Larnaca airport on forged passports, the paper said.
The surveillance led to their Nov.
6 arrest in the coastal fishing village of Ziyi.
Police found surveillance equipment and recording devices in their rented apartment.
Cypriot prosecutor Andreas Naum said the two had been telephoning ``a specific intelligence institute whose headquarters is in Tel Aviv'' shortly before the arrest, Haaretz said.
Cypriot police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Haaretz the two men were believed to be spying on behalf of Turkey, a military ally of Israel.
Haaretz has reported that the two men are agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and that they were part of an intelligence operation near Ziyi.
A statement released this week by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office was interpreted by Israeli media as a confirmation that two worked for Israel's Mossad.
There was no indication from the statement that the two men could have worked independently of the government.
Netanyahu has not confirmed or denied reports that the two men in custody are Mossad agents.
Israel's Foreign Ministry has said only that reports that the two were spying on behalf of Turkey were not true.
A ministry statement added that the two were not acting against Cyprus, but gave no further explanation.
The source cited by Haaretz said that the two men refuse to cooperate with interrogators.
Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded the island in 1974, following an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.

NICOSIA, February 2 (Xinhua) --Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides on Tuesday indicated that he is not considering release of two Israeli agents jailed on Monday for three years.
The president also told reporters that there is no agreement between the two countries so that Igal Damary, 49, and Udi Hargov, 37, can serve their sentence in Israel.
The two Israelis were arrested in early November last year at the small fishing village of Zigi on the Cypriot southern coast and were found carrying radio scanners, a lat-top computer, cell phones and eight maps of the island.
They had pleaded guilty to charges of approaching a restricted military zone and possessing banned listening equipment.
Spying charges pressed against the two Israelis were dropped by the prosecution for lack of evidence.
Clerides said that pardon cannot be granted unless some of the sentence is served, the Prisons Director submits a good report on their conduct and the Attorney General agrees that reasons for pardon exist.
Clerides dismissed press reports that the spying charges were dropped because of pressure.
JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two Israelis who were arrested in Cyprus last week on suspicion of spying are agents of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, an Israeli newspaper said Thursday.
Israel's government has not acknowledged that the two are Israeli agents.
Earlier this week, the Israeli Foreign Ministry would only say that rumors that the two were spying on behalf of Turkey, Israel's military ally, were not true.
Turkey has occupied the northern third of Cyprus since an invasion in 1974.
The statement also said the two men were not acting against Cyprus.
Cypriot police arrested the Israelis in the coastal fishing town of Ziyi on Saturday and accused them of spying on a nearby army base.
The Haaretz daily said Thursday that the two men were part of an Israeli intelligence operation held near Ziyi last Friday and Saturday.
The newspaper said it learned from a senior source in Cyprus that the two men had been guarding a meeting of Mossad agents.
They were listening to police scanners to make sure no one approached the meeting place, the newspaper said.
The Mossad told the authorities in Cyprus that it was not interested in damaging Nicosia's sovereignty and that it was simply going about its business.
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who visited Cyprus for three days last week, sent an envoy to the island on Sunday in efforts to ease tensions over the case.
The source in Cyprus said comments by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week that ``of course we'll bring them home'' had damaged chances the two would be quickly released.

WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) --The Justice Department has renewed its scrutiny of alleged antitrust violations by the software giant Microsoft Corp.
, U.S. newspapers reported today.
A Justice Department spokesman confirmed Thursday that "we have an ongoing investigation and it's continuing".
Netscape Communication Corp.
, Microsoft's major rival in the U.S. market for software, wrote to the Justice Department last month asking regulators to examine possible antitrust violations in the marketing and distribution of Microsoft's Internet Explorer software.
It said that Microsoft was unfairly offering computer makers financial "inducements" for giving Microsoft's Internet software an exclusive place on their computers, or for making Netscape's product "far less accessible to users".
But Microsoft dismissed those claims as "wide and untrue".
Microsoft Senior Vice President William H.
Neukom said Thursday that "the facts will show that Microsoft is competing vigorously and legally".
Microsoft, based in Redmond of Washington, has been the focus of antitrust investigations in the past years.
Last year, the Justice Department opposed Microsoft's planned 2-billion-dollar purchase of Intuit Inc.
, maker of Quicken personal finance software, and Microsoft had to pay Intuit 46.2 million dollars for the trouble.
The U.S. government has strengthened its antitrust efforts in recent years as the market competitions are more and more fierce and complicated.
WASHINGTON (AP) --The Justice Department's landmark antitrust trial and earlier legal actions against the Microsoft Corp.
have cost $13.3 million over the past decade, the department said Wednesday in its first public accounting.
The figure includes about $7 million investigating and suing Microsoft in the trial pending before U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, described as among the most significant business lawsuits in decades.
The first phase of a two-part verdict could come this month.
Experts described the $7 million as paltry compared with the expense of other major antitrust cases, where costs easily can run $750,000 each month.
Justice opened the current case in June 1995.
``That's really rather modest for a case that has been as hard fought as this one has, with the caliber of lawyers and economists they've put on,'' said Tyler Baker, a Dallas antitrust lawyer.
Staples Inc.
and Office Depot Inc.
, for example, spent $20 million over 10 months unsuccessfully fighting antitrust enforcers to allow its merger in 1997.
The Justice Department last year asked Jackson to force Microsoft to reimburse its legal costs, but the agency typically doesn't request attorneys' fees.
``If they succeed on the merits...
it wouldn't be uncommon for the judge to order Microsoft to reimburse the costs,'' said Joe Sims, a Washington antitrust lawyer and former senior Justice official.
The agency acknowledged it has paid outside experts for advice on how to punish Microsoft if the company lost the case, but refused to identify them or their pay.
It included the pay among $2.2 million spent in the current trial on such experts.
The department also revealed it has spent $194,140 for public relations, including $147,381 for publishing court documents and other information about the case on its Internet site.
The government disclosures came in response to a written demand from Sen.
Slade Gorton, a Republican from Microsoft's home state of Washington.
The figures did not include money spent by the 19 states suing the company along with Justice; attorneys general in those states have denied requests for such information.
Microsoft, the world's largest software company with $19.7 billion in sales this year, hasn't disclosed its own legal fees.
It declined comment Wednesday.
But the company's financial records showed ``general and administrative expenses,'' including lawyers' fees, of $689 million for this business year, ended June 30.
That's up 59 percent from last year's $433 million.
The company is also involved in high-profile litigation against Sun Microsystems Inc.
in California and against Caldera Inc.
in Utah.
In the federal antitrust case, Microsoft is using both in-house lawyers and attorneys from New York-based Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell.
In financial papers, Microsoft blamed its increases in administrative expenses partly on ``higher legal fees, litigation costs''.
The fees for Justice attorneys are significantly lower.
Lead lawyer David Boies, hired from private practice, initially agreed to half his $250 hourly rate, then agreed to a $104,000 salary.
``I'm sure (the government's bill) is a small fraction of what Microsoft paid its lawyers in that period,'' said Kevin Arquit, a New York antitrust lawyer.
Sims agreed: ``If you're defending the antitrust equivalent of a capital murder case, you're not likely to be pinching pennies''.
Jonathan Zuck, director of the Association for Competitive Technology, a trade group that includes Microsoft, said the government's spending bodes ill for the nation's high-tech industry: ``If ...
it's this cheap to do it, we could be awash in lawsuits and really grind the industry to a halt''.
The government opposed Microsoft's merger with Intuit Inc.
early in the 1990s and negotiated a consent decree with the software giant in a related antitrust lawsuit in 1995 .
Legal experts gave the judge in the Microsoft case high marks Thursday for his handling of the case, saying he took some risks but grounded his ruling in fundamental principles governing fair competition.
They said the actions of the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, had made it more difficult for Microsoft to suggest that the computer industry ought to be given more leeway than traditional businesses under antitrust law.
``It reminds people that there are antitrust laws out there,'' said George A.
Hay, a professor of antitrust law at Cornell Law School.
``It is a useful reminder that there are rules and just because you are big you can't do whatever you want''.
The risks for Jackson in the ruling, the legal experts said, included his decision to deny Microsoft new hearings on whether to break up the company or impose some lesser remedy after he had decided it abused its monopoly power.
Some experts said appeals courts might overturn that decision and could order new hearings.
But several antitrust experts said the judge made efforts throughout the case to tie his decisions to traditional views of antitrust law, which is based on the principle that aggressive competition is encouraged, but not when it crosses the line into efforts to hamper competitors' abilities to make new products or market existing ones.
The judge said in an earlier ruling that Microsoft had maintained its dominance by keeping ``an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune''.
Some of the experts said the judge's emphasis on traditional antitrust principles, like rules against intimidation by monopolies, could blunt Microsoft's public efforts to suggest that the Justice Department was overstepping the appropriate bounds of antitrust enforcement.
The company has suggested that the suit was an anti-capitalist attack that would be harmful not just to Microsoft.
The company's chairman, Bill Gates, said it was an ``unwarranted intrusion'' into ``a marketplace that has been an engine of economic growth for America''.
Microsoft used the rapid change of the new software industry as an argument to suggest that Jackson should view the case differently than he might have viewed a case against a smokestack company, said Charles J.
Goetz, an expert on antitrust law at the University of Virginia School of Law.
Goetz praised Jackson for refusing to be drawn into that approach and focusing on Microsoft's competitive style.
``There has been an attempt by Microsoft, to a large extent successful with the public,'' Goetz said, ``to distinguish this case from traditional antitrust cases because it is in the high-tech field''.
``But mere fast change is not the issue,'' Goetz continued.
``What this case was about was that other companies appeared to be coming up with a `better mousetrap,' and Microsoft was charged with engaging in very costly attempts to try to prevent competition from those products''.
Einer Elhauge, a professor of antitrust law at Harvard Law School, said Jackson's decision on Wednesday had to be viewed in the context of his earlier findings, like holding that Microsoft intimidated competitors and made efforts at collusion.
``It is very hard to second-guess him,'' Elhauge said, ``and it is going to be very hard for an appeals court to second-guess him'' on his factual findings.
If those findings are accepted, Elhauge said, the conclusion to order a breakup appears ``entirely sensible'' under legal precedents.
Lesser remedies like orders to monopoly companies to cease abusive tactics have proved difficult to police, he said.
Several experts said one of Jackson's legally risky decisions was his treatment of Microsoft's Windows operating system and its Web browser as two separate products that it had illegally tied together.
Under antitrust rules, a company that has a dominant product, like a salt packing machine in an early case, cannot take advantage of its dominance by requiring customers to buy another product, like raw salt, to get the popular product.
But if, as Microsoft urged, its Web browser should more correctly have been viewed as an innovation that enhanced Windows, portions of Jackson's ruling might be vulnerable on appeal.
It was on that issue that the federal appeals court in Washington overruled Jackson in an earlier phase of the company's battle with the government.
Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School, said the decision that Windows and the browser were two products illegally tied together could be vulnerable in an appeal.
But even on that subject, Moglen said, Jackson made extensive efforts to portray his approach as consistent with the law.
``He was as orthodox on antitrust issues as he could possibly be,'' Moglen said, adding that he thought Jackson had worked to try to protect the decisions from being overturned.
Several of the legal experts said Thursday that they saw little support for Microsoft's suggestion that the judge was relying on antitrust concepts that are out of step with the fast-moving computer business.
They said that the computer age might require adjustments to some antitrust concepts, like the question of whether an operating system and a Web browser are really separate products.
But, some of them said, evidence of intimidation or efforts at collusion are the heart of the legal system's effort to keep commercial markets competitive.
Elhauge of Harvard said the company's sense that it was the victim of an injustice was a familiar defense.
``Every industry, as it is growing,'' he said, ``seems surprised that the antitrust law applies to it.''
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) --The trial of Caldera Inc.'s antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp.
has been postponed from June until next January.
U.S. District Judge Dee Benson on Thursday postponed the trial until Jan.
17 after Microsoft said its key attorneys were enmeshed in the federal antitrust action against Microsoft in Washington, D.C.
Meanwhile, Microsoft has launched a new attack, arguing Caldera has not uncovered evidence to support its claims that Microsoft has used illegal marketing and licensing tactics.
Caldera, a small firm based in Orem, contends Microsoft deliberately destroyed the public's demand for DR-DOS, a program that enables computers to perform basic functions.
One of Caldera's expert witnesses calculated the company's damages at $1.6 billion.
New Microsoft filings allege internal memos show DR-DOS's own developers knew they had a flawed product and poor technical support for frustrated consumers.
``Right now we are Microsoft's biggest endorser,'' a DR-DOS adviser wrote in 1992.
``(The) majority of all the irate individuals I speak with say that they are going back to Microsoft because at least they provide support''.
The filings are aimed at sharply limiting Caldera's claims at trial.
Caldera President Bryan Sparks said Caldera's response to Microsoft's arguments will be filed next month.
``We feel we have evidence to refute every one of them,'' he said.
In court Thursday, Caldera attorney Stephen J.
Hill asked Benson to go forward with the trial in June, or postpone it only until August.
For Caldera to sue Microsoft is ``a David vs.
Goliath situation,'' Hill said.
``The longer (the litigation) goes, the more it costs''.
Microsoft attorney James Jardine says key Microsoft lawyers will need time to prepare for the Caldera trial once the federal antitrust case concludes.
Rulings on Microsoft's new filings likely will require written opinions and will determine the scope of the trial, Benson said.
Those decisions will not be completed until May, only weeks before the scheduled trial, he noted.
DR-DOS was created by Digital Research Inc.
and later purchased by Novell Inc.
, which halted the program's development in 1994.
Caldera acquired DR-DOS in 1996, along with the right to sue over Microsoft's alleged efforts to quash it.
DR-DOS competed with Microsoft's MS-DOS.
WASHINGTON _ Justice Department lawyers savored a resounding victory Friday evening in their case against Microsoft, a victory that one official attributed not to any brilliant strategy but to the simple truth.
``This is a great day for American consumers,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said, declaring herself pleased that the court had agreed with the government.
``This case is about the protection of innovation, competition and the consumers' right to choose the products they want,'' Reno said.
``Facts are stubborn things,'' said Joel Klein, head of the antitrust division, exulting in a 207-page decision that found for the government on virtually every important point.
Asked if he thought Microsoft had made any strategic errors during the trial, Klein responded that ``theatrics are always interesting, and there were some fun moments in this trial.
I think this case was about the evidence''.
Klein's comments notwithstanding, the Justice Department's lead lawyer in the Microsoft case, David Boies, is one of the most highly regarded litigators in the country.
At first, Boies shied away from the microphone.
``I had my shot in the courtroom,'' Boies said, smiling broadly.
But Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general for Connecticut who worked closely with the Justice Department, encouraged Boies to say something.
``You're the man,'' Blumenthal said.
``Go ahead''.
Then Boies indicated that he, too, thought the outcome had less to do with strategy and more to do with facts.
``In some senses, this is not a surprise,'' he said.
``In a lot of ways, this is exactly what the evidence showed''.
Pronouncing himself ``enormously pleased'' with the decision, Klein said it showed that ``in America, no person and no company is above the law''.
Blumenthal had some of the harshest words for Microsoft, asserting that the opinion by federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had portrayed ``a predator that has misused its monopolistic power''.
Some of the most damning evidence against Microsoft was furnished by Microsoft itself, Blumenthal said, in its internal e-mail and other records that proved the company is a monopoly determined to remain a monopoly.
Blumenthal recalled that, early on, he had likened the suit to D-Day in its complexity and far-reaching implications.
``Today, we have established a solid beachhead,'' he said.
Like Klein, Blumenthal said he would not rule out any remedy to break up Microsoft's hold on the software industry.
But Klein deflected a question to compare the case against Microsoft to another landmark antitrust case, the one that reconfigured the nationwide telephone system.
Blumenthal of Connecticut called antitrust law ``the Magna Carta of consumer protection''.
``I would wager that these findings of fact will be used in law school classes around the country to demonstrate what happens when the antitrust laws are flagrantly violated,'' Blumenthal went on.
Klein saw another reason to hold up the Microsoft case as an example.
Only about a year and a half elapsed from the start of the case to Friday's decision _ lightning speed for such a complex case, by the usual standards of the law.
California's attorney general, Bill Lockyer, said he expected the decision to ``unleash powerful engines of innovation and consumer benefit''.
``California is so impacted by the colossus of Microsoft, and so many businesses were impacted and felt that their competitive opportunities were smothered,'' Lockyer said.
``Silicon Valley is cautiously cheering,'' Lockyer said.
There was good reason for his use of ``cautiously''.
Appeals lie ahead.
Microsoft is a powerful adversary with deep pockets _ not as deep as the government's, but deep enough to wage a long fight, if it chooses.
And Microsoft didn't get to be Microsoft by shrinking from the battlefield.
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) --A U.S. federal judge ordered Wednesday Microsoft Corp.
to be split in two separate companies to correct antitrust violations.
District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has gone along with the government recommendation that the software giant be split in two, one that would sell operating systems, and another that would develop and market Microsoft's popular Office software and Internet properties.
If the judgment is upheld, it would be the harshest antitrust penalty leveled against a U.S. corporation since AT&AMP;T agreed to spin off the "baby bell" regional phone companies in 1982.
"Microsoft, as it is presently organized and led, is unwilling to accept the notion that it broke the law or accede to an order amending its conduct," Jackson said in his 23-page remedy order.
"Microsoft has proved untrustworthy in the past," Jackson said, citing its failure to comply with a court ruling earlier in the 1990s that preceded the antitrust case.
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said immediately after the ruling that, as expected, the company would appeal.
"We have a very strong appeal," Gates said.
Since its 1975 founding, Microsoft has grown to become the world's most valuable software company with annual revenues of over 20 billion U.S. dollars a year.
With 60 foreign offices and its software used around the world, a breakup would eventually affect computer users worldwide.
The U.S.
Justice Department and 17 of the states that sued Microsoft proposed the split after Jackson concluded on April 3 that the firm violated U.S. antitrust law.
The government says that splitting Microsoft would prevent the Windows system, that runs on over 80 percent of personal computers, from being used to force companies and consumers to use other Microsoft products.
Breakup of the company could also encourage development of alternative operating systems and prompt versions of programs like Microsoft Office to run on those systems, the government says.
Microsoft, which expects to win on appeal, says a breakup would harm consumers by preventing it from developing integrated products.
The company's appeal could bypass the normal appeals court process and go straight to the Supreme Court under a mechanism available in major antitrust cases.
But several legal experts said they believed the high court would decline to receive the case on an expedited basis.
Microsoft Corp.'s massive defeat in its federal antitrust suit leaves the company facing perhaps the most severe crisis in its 25-year history.
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's holding that Microsoft is a monopoly that abused its power and harmed consumers raises the possibility that the US Justice Department might demand the corporate equivalent of the death penalty _ the dismantling of Microsoft _ after the manner of Standard Oil Co.'s 1911 breakup.
Joel Klein, antitrust chief at the Justice Department, Friday would not rule out this Draconian penalty.
But even if Microsoft avoids action of this magnitude, years of tough legal battles lie ahead, with a potential to sap the firm's ability to keep up with its competitors.
And those competitors can use Friday's ruling to make life even tougher for Microsoft.
Antitrust experts say the findings of fact can be used by dozens of Microsoft's competitors as the basis of their own private antitrust actions against the company.
``It's really a disaster for Microsoft,'' said Thane Scott, head of the antitrust practice at Boston law firm Palmer &AMP; Dodge.
``Based on these documents alone, anybody who feels he's been harmed by Microsoft can walk into a court and get a jury trial.
.. . If you're a company like Microsoft, the last place you want to be is in front of a jury''.
Lisa Wood, of Boston law firm Nutter McClennen &AMP; Fish, said the danger of private suits based on Friday's ruling is so severe that it practically ensures Microsoft will fight to the bitter end, rather than settle.
``To stop now and not finish could leave Microsoft exposed to private litigation,'' said Wood, who chairs a committee on antitrust law for the American Bar Association.
Wood predicted that Microsoft will soldier on, taking up the next phase of the case in an effort to recoup its loss.
In the next phase, the findings of law, Jackson will apply antitrust law to the facts he has settled upon.
Microsoft will have to argue that even if the facts are accepted as true, they don't constitute a violation of law.
Scott says the government's nearly total victory on findings of fact bodes ill for Microsoft in the next phase of the trial, and even reduces the likelihood of a successful appeal.
Microsoft has had some success before federal appellate courts.
An attempt last year to have the company held in contempt of court for violating an earlier consent decree was rejected by an appeals court, which ruled that Microsoft had a right to add Internet browsing capabilities to its operating system _ one of the key issues in dispute in the antitrust case.
But Scott says the sweeping rejection of Microsoft's view of the case will bear weight with the appeals court.
``They have an uphill battle on appeal,'' he said.
``The facts have been decided against them rather severely''.
Still, it seems unlikely Microsoft can now simply settle the case, not only because of the threat of private lawsuits but because the government is now in a position to make very tough demands.
Besides, 19 state attorneys general are involved in the suit, as well as the federal government.
Microsoft would have to satisfy them all.
``It's difficult to settle a case when there's blood in the water,'' said Scott, ``and this result does that''.
Charles Ferguson, who sold Vermeer Technologies in Cambridge, Mass.
to Microsoft in 1997, is a harsh critic of the company.
``I think they're going to fight to the death,'' Ferguson said.
``It's their whole culture''.
Meanwhile, Jackson's ruling could have an impact on other cases already pending against Microsoft.
The firm is still fighting against rival Sun Microsystems Inc.
in federal court.
At issue is whether Microsoft violated Sun's copyright to the Java computing system, which allows programmers to write programs that can run on many different types of computers.
An appeals court in August overturned an injunction against Microsoft, but Sun is seeking to have that injunction reinstated.
If this weren't enough for Microsoft, the company faces another antitrust shootout in a case that has attracted far less attention but could be equally devastating to Microsoft's future.
Caldera Systems Inc.
, an Orem, Utah, maker of Linux software, filed an antitrust case against Microsoft in 1996.
The case involves DR-DOS, an operating system once sold by Novell Inc.
as an alternative to an early Microsoft product, MS-DOS.
Caldera chief executive Ray Noorda formerly ran Novell, and he bought DR-DOS from Novell in order to pursue a court case against Microsoft.
Noorda believes that during the early 1990s, Microsoft used its market power to stamp out DR-DOS and keep it from gaining a foothold in the operating systems market.
If Caldera wins, it could obtain damages running into the billions of dollars.
On Thursday, a federal judge in Salt Lake City threw out an effort by Microsoft to have key charges in the case dismissed.
The judge ruled that the Caldera-Microsoft case will go to trial in January.
Unlike the Justice Department case, the Caldera matter will be decided by a jury chosen from Caldera's back yard _ a daunting prospect for Microsoft .
A Harvard legal scholar told the judge in the Microsoft antitrust case Tuesday that the company's decision to bundle its Web browser into the Windows operating system had ``obvious benefits'' to computer programmers and consumers.
But he then proceeded to provide a legally innovative road map for determining that the bundling strategy violated the law.
The court filing, written by Laurence Lessig, a legal scholar and software expert, came at the request of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
It offers a 45-page analysis of one issue: how antitrust law on product ``tying'' should apply to the case.
The intellectually wide-ranging document, antitrust experts say, will probably provide each side with some legal ammunition.
The Lessig brief had been eagerly awaited by the government, Microsoft and antitrust experts.
Unlike other filings, it is not an advocate's brief, amplifying the arguments of one side or the other, though Microsoft protested his participation in the case.
Lessig, a professor at Harvard law school and a fellow of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, did not come to a single conclusion in his friend-of-the-court brief.
Instead, he stated that if a 1998 appeals court ruling in a related case applies in this suit as well, then Microsoft did not engage in illegal tying.
But Lessig said that if the 1998 case did not apply _ and he raises doubts that it does _ Microsoft might well have violated the law.
A company is guilty of illegal tying if it makes consumers accept a second product as a condition of buying a market-leading product.
The Justice Department and 19 states assert that Microsoft did precisely that by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system.
Microsoft asserts that the browser is not a separate product but an ``integrated feature'' of Windows.
In 1998, a federal appeals court ruled that Microsoft was free to bundle its browser with Windows as long as it could make a ``plausible claim'' that bundling had some benefit to consumers.
But Lessig noted that the court was ruling on a ``consent decree,'' essentially a contractual agreement between the federal prosecutor and a potential defendant, so there was ``no reason to read an opinion interpreting a consent decree as interpreting the contours of antitrust law''.
At one point, he observed that how tying law applies to software was ``unsettled'' and added that the 1998 ruling was ``just one, if prominent, manifestation of this uncertainty''.
Later, Lessig suggested that tying doctrine had a hard time dealing with software, since the relevant case law tended to deal with physical products like cars and tires.
If given a chance at a software tying case, Lessig added, ``it is my view that there is a significant probability that the Supreme Court will modify current doctrine''.
``Both sides'' in the Microsoft case, he wrote, ``are too quick, however, to minimize the difficulty of how tying law properly applies to software products''.
Lessig then suggests a different antitrust test for software _ that government or courts should not worry about bundling unless a dominant company engages in what he calls ``strategic bundling''.
``The aim of any antitrust inquiry,'' he wrote, ``should be whether the particular bundle is a strategic bundle, aiming at anticompetitive ends, not whether the bundle achieves its interlinkage through contract or software''.
Some antitrust experts say the Lessig brief may give Jackson the legal blueprint he needs for concluding that Microsoft did violate tying law.
``Lessig's brief supplies the judge with a sensible rationale for finding there were two products and a tying violation,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school.
``But that is not to say that Judge Jackson will do that or, if his ruling is appealed, that the appeals court will buy it.''
Microsoft Corp.
quit the nation's oldest and largest software industry trade association Tuesday after a long-running dispute over the group's support for the government in the Microsoft antitrust case.
The Software and Information Industry Association, formerly known as the Software Publishers Association, filed a friend-of-the-court brief in February on behalf of the Justice Department, arguing that Microsoft had a monopoly in personal computer operating systems and used it to expand its market power.
In a letter to the trade group Tuesday, Robert Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating officer, said he was resigning because the company believed that the software trade association had become totally focused on the antitrust issue and that its efforts on other policy issues have ``regrettably withered away''.
Herbold noted that the ``SPA and SIIA management have worked directly against Microsoft on competition issues''.
But, he said, ``As long as the organization was also accomplishing at least some other useful goals for the industry as a whole, we thought it made sense for Microsoft to remain a member, despite this area of disagreement''.
Herbold, a member of the association's board, added that Microsoft had come to believe that was no longer true.
In a fiery reply, Ken Wasch, the group's president, said that by quitting, ``Microsoft has again proven that their tactics resemble that of a schoolyard bully''.
Since the trade group's board voted two years ago to support the government in the antitrust case, Wasch said its relationship with Microsoft had been ``a difficult one, much like the U.S. relationship with China''.
In his letter of resignation, Herbold said the group was increasingly ineffective and that its membership was ``sagging''.
Wasch replied that the Software and Information Industry Association was ``thriving''.
Microsoft paid membership fees of $125,000 a year.
The trade group's annual budget is about $8 million.
Microsoft's stock jumped more than 5 percent at one point Tuesday after a Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
analyst, Rick Sherlund, released a research memo suggesting that settlement talks with the government in the antitrust case ``may be heating up''.
The stock price fell back to $92.875, an increase of 2.48 percent, by the close of the regular trading day.
The shadow of the antitrust suit has pushed Microsoft's share price down 25 percent from its 52-week high in recent weeks despite the introduction of its Windows 2000 operating system in February.
WASHINGTON _ Microsoft filed an unexpected brief with a federal judge on Monday that quoted from a 5-year-old government legal document in which the Justice Department argued that breaking up Microsoft would be ``against the public interest'' and ``dangerous to the economy's welfare''.
The document was part of the public record from an older antitrust case against Microsoft, the Justice Department's first suit against the company.
The nine-page brief gives Microsoft the final word before a hearing on Wednesday but risks irritating the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, who did not ask for another filing from Microsoft when he laid out the schedule for the remedy phase of the case.
Under the schedule set by Jackson in April, the Justice Department and 17 states filed a brief with the court on April 28 asking the judge to break Microsoft into two companies as the remedy for the illegal behavior found in the long antitrust trial.
Then, 12 days later, Microsoft responded with its own proposal, a short list of narrow restrictions on its behavior, while denouncing the government's plan.
Last Wednesday, the Justice Department filed a reply to Microsoft's brief, saying the company's proposal was ``a cosmetic remedy'' of no real worth.
That was to have been the last filing.
But a Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, said the company ``believes it is appropriate for the company to have a reply to focus on a few issues raised in the government's last brief''.
While citing the old Justice Department documents, Microsoft also repeated several legal arguments it had made previously.
Among them, the company stated that the courts have never broken up a company for antitrust violations; all of the previous breakups have been a result of settlements of antitrust suits.
``For all its sophistry in discussing the case law, the government fails to identify a single precedent for its radical breakup proposal,'' Microsoft wrote.
The Justice Department did not respond to Microsoft's filing, but a lawyer who is close to the government's current case said it ``relies on statements made before Microsoft had engaged in the numerous illegal acts found in the current case''.
The legal document quoted in the Microsoft brief was taken from the court record of the Justice Department's first antitrust suit against Microsoft, which was resolved in 1995.
That case was settled when Microsoft accepted several behavioral restrictions.
Under a law known as the Tunney Act, any settlement of an antitrust suit must be put up for public comment before the judge can decide whether to approve it.
And much of the industry comment then was disparaging; executives called the proposed settlement inadequate and argued that Microsoft ought to be broken up instead.
Responding to those public comments, the Justice Department filed the brief Microsoft quoted Monday.
In it the government's economist then, Kenneth J.
Arrow of Stanford University, wrote that breakup remedies ``designed to return the market to equilibrium'' are ``likely to be of the form of penalizing whatever firm happens to be leading, Microsoft in this case''.
On Monday, the lawyer who is close to the government's case said, ``That Microsoft repeatedly violated the law after the previous proceeding demonstrates why structural relief is necessary now.''
WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp.
violated the nation's antitrust laws through predatory and anticompetitive behavior and kept ``an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune,'' a federal judge ruled Monday.
The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S.
District Court, sided with the government on the most important points in its exhaustive antitrust suit, though he surprised lawyers on both sides by ruling for Microsoft in one area.
The Justice Department and the 19 states pressing the suit contended that Microsoft had hurt consumers by stifling competition in the software marketplace, particularly at the expense of the Netscape browser.
Jackson's findings of fact in the case, issued in November, overwhelmingly supported that view.
Several experts said that Monday's ruling, applying the antitrust laws to those findings, laid the foundation for a powerful remedy.
That will be decided in a separate proceeding to begin within a few weeks.
Options range from imposing restrictions on Microsoft's conduct to breaking up the company.
Senior government officials familiar with the views of the state and federal officers who are pursuing the case said that many were interested in requesting a breakup, though no decision had been made.
The ruling came just 48 hours after settlement talks collapsed.
On Saturday a court-appointed mediator announced that despite four months of mediation and after consideration of almost 20 drafts of a settlement offer, the gulf between the two sides remained unbridgeable.
Jackson issued his judgment at 5 p.m., after the stock markets had closed.
But reacting to the failure of the settlement talks and in anticipation of the judgment, Microsoft's stock plunged Monday, losing almost 14 percent of its value.
That helped fuel a broad decline in the Nasdaq composite index, which fell 8 percent.
In his 43-page conclusions of law, Jackson's final judgment on the evidence, the judge wrote that ``the court concludes that Microsoft maintained its monopoly power by anticompetitive means and attempted to monopolize the Web browser market,'' as well as ``unlawfully tying its Web browser to its operating system'' _ all in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
At the same time, the judge ruled that Microsoft's marketing arrangements with other companies to promote its Web browser at Netscape's expense did not have sufficient effect to violate the law.
Microsoft seemed to take little solace from prevailing on that point.
Bill Gates, the company's chairman, did not even refer to the one judgment in the company's favor when he announced that Microsoft would appeal.
``This ruling turns on its head the reality that consumers know _ that our software has helped make PCs more accessible and more affordable to millions,'' Gates said.
``We believe we have a strong case on appeal.''
WASHINGTON _ The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case agreed Thursday morning to delay his final ruling for about a week, giving the Justice Department time to reply to Microsoft's proposal, filed Wednesday, to revise the government's break up plan.
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had planned to issue his final ruling, widely expected to call for a breakup of the company, Thursday or Friday.
But the Justice Department asked him Thursday for an opportunity to reply to Microsoft's comments on the government's remedy proposal.
Jackson gave the government until Monday to respond, and Microsoft until Wednesday to file a counter response.
In court on May 24, John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, said the company wanted an opportunity to ``comment on the form of the proposed decree prior to its entry''.
Lawyers interpreted that to mean that Microsoft did not intend to make substantive changes.
But in fact, the company's response heavily revised the government proposal _ gutting it, in the view of some government officials.
The Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general proposed to break Microsoft into two companies.
One would hold the Windows operating systems, the other everything else, including the Office suite of programs like Word for word processing and Excel for spreadsheet calculations.
The proposal would also put in place almost immediately a wide range of remedies intended to modify Microsoft's conduct while the breakup is being carried out.
Microsoft's comments would delay all of the remedies and heavily modify most of them.
In its antitrust trial, the Microsoft Corp.
is expected to introduce documents this week intended to contradict testimony by an IBM executive who said Microsoft would offer the computer maker a favorable price on its Windows operating system only if IBM agreed to ``eliminate or drop'' its competing operating system, OS/2.
The allegation was made last month by Garry Norris, a manager who negotiated with Microsoft for IBM's personal computer business, is scheduled to take the stand Monday as witness for the government.
In a pretrial deposition in May, Norris testified that Microsoft managers repeatedly made a proposal linking the price of Windows paid by IBM's personal computer division and its agreement to drop OS/2 from its machines.
He specifically mentioned the proposal being made by Mark Baber, who oversaw Microsoft's relationship with IBM's P.C. business.
But Baber, who has since retired from Microsoft, said Sunday that it was ``absolutely not the case'' that Microsoft proposed a lower Windows price in return for an agreement by IBM to drop OS/2 from its PC's.
In addition, Baber said he worked on the Microsoft effort in 1994 and 1995 to try to repair the strained relationship between the two companies.
That effort, he said, included drafting a document in 1994 called the ``IBM-Microsoft Alliance Proposal''.
That document, he said, called for IBM to promote Microsoft's software on IBM personal computers, but specifically included language that noted any Microsoft-IBM agreement did not exclude IBM from also offering and promoting ``products offered by other divisions of IBM''.
Microsoft declined to comment on documents it may introduce in court during the cross-examination of Norris.
But Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said, ``We believe that we will be able to show convincingly in court that the Microsoft-IBM discussions leading up to the introduction of Windows 95 were normal, though complicated, business negotiations, and that Microsoft did not try to get IBM to drop or eliminate OS/2.
Yes, we have documents that we believe show that''.
The effort to forge a closer relationship with IBM, which would have included a more favorable price for Windows, foundered mainly because IBM balked at close cooperation with Microsoft, according to Baber.
The testimony and cross-examination of Norris will focus on a crucial allegation in the antitrust suit against Microsoft by the Justice Department and 19 states _ that Microsoft uses the price it charges PC makers for its industry-standard Windows operating system to insure that they promote Microsoft software over competing software.
Microsoft fiercely denies the allegation.
IBM was the last major PC maker to sign a Windows 95 license agreement with Microsoft and, Norris said in his deposition that IBM did pay significantly more for Windows 95 than did a major IBM rival in the PC business, the Compaq Computer Corp.
He also testified that its Windows price rose very sharply, with IBM paying $9 a copy for the earlier version, Windows 3.1, and more than $45 for Windows 95.
Baber said IBM's price for Windows 3.1 was unusually low because, dating back to their days of close cooperation in software, IBM had shared in the development costs.
Compaq's price for Windows 3.1, he noted, was about $20 a copy.
The Windows 95 price paid by Compaq, Baber said, was several dollars lower than IBM's price.
But that, he insisted, was mainly because Compaq had made a broad agreement with Microsoft, which included providing customer support for Windows and writing software to make printers and other hardware work well with Windows.
WASHINGTON _ After reviewing a last-ditch settlement proposal offered by Microsoft Friday night, lawyers for the government concluded that it was inadequate to settle the landmark antitrust case against the software giant, officials said Saturday afternoon.
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has told both sides that, barring a settlement, he will issue a verdict in the case as soon as Tuesday, and no one doubts that he will find Microsoft in broad violation of antitrust law.
Jackson met with lawyers for both sides Tuesday and gave them a week to settle the case before he issued a verdict.
The two sides had been talking for almost four months.
As a result, on Friday evening Microsoft faxed a several-page settlement offer to the Justice Department and the 19 state attorneys general who are suing Microsoft.
It included so much technical detail that it took lawyers hours to decipher it.
But in the end, one official said, ``it wasn't nearly enough''.
If government officials had concluded that the proposal was, in their view, serious and comprehensive, they would have met over the weekend in Chicago with Microsoft lawyers and the mediator in the case, Richard A.
Posner, chief judge of the U.S.
Court of Appeals there.
But two officials said no new talks had been scheduled.
It remains possible that Microsoft will offer a new or modified proposal in the next two days.
But short of that, the ongoing settlement talks, which started Nov.
30, are likely to collapse.
None of the state or federal officials involved with the suit would discuss the settlement proposal, and Microsoft declined to comment.
If, as expected, Jackson rules in favor of the government this week, he will also set out the procedures and schedule for remedy hearings.
In those hearings, the federal and state governments will propose the remedies, or penalties, they want to impose.
Between now and then, they face one of the most difficult tasks in the case: forging agreement between the federal government and 19 state attorneys general on an appropriate remedy.
Microsoft Corp.
, whose business practices are being challenged by the government in a major antitrust case, suffered a legal setback on another front Tuesday when a federal judge in California ordered the company to stop shipping Internet software that violates its contract with a rival, Sun Microsystems Inc.
The impact that the order, a preliminary injunction in a private law suit in California, will have on the government's case is uncertain.
But the allegations in the government's antitrust suit do include the practices that are at the heart of the breach-of-contract case Sun filed against Microsoft last October _ namely, that Microsoft is trying to ``pollute'' Sun's Internet programming language, called Java, by modifying it.
The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft in the antitrust case say that this is part of a pattern of illegal practices by the software giant intended to protect and extend its tight grip on the market for personal computer software.
If Sun's Java became an industry-standard, the government asserts, it could pose a serious challenge to Microsoft.
And in the California case, Sun had argued that by altering the Java programming language, Microsoft had violated a contract the two companies had signed.
Judge Ronald Whyte in the U.S.
District Court in San Jose ordered Microsoft to stop the practice and gave it 90 days to make its Internet software entirely compatible with Sun's Java, as it had agreed to do when it signed a technology licensing agreement with Sun.
The California ruling is badly timed for Microsoft, but the spillover, if any, to the antitrust case in Washington is difficult to determine.
``The Justice Department will argue that a breach of contract is part of the pattern of bad acts by Microsoft and of its intent to monopolize,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division.
``It helps the atmospherics of the government's case, but it's not clear beyond that what the effect will be''.
The ruling Tuesday is a preliminary injuction, noted Litan, and the Sun-Microsoft trial is not scheduled to begin until next year.
Meanwhile, the antitrust trial is already well under way, and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is expected to rule early next year.
``If there was a final ruling in the contract case, it would have far more direct impact on the antitrust case,'' said Litan, who is now at the Brookings Institution.
The California ruling, industry analysts say, is not likely to have a significant impact on Microsoft's business anytime soon _ though it does raise questions about the company's strategy of trying to influence the industry to accept Microsoft's version of Internet software standards.
``Because the judge gave it 90 days to comply, there is no business interruption for Microsoft,'' said Richard Sherlund, an analyst for Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.
``Microsoft does not have to pull products out of distribution''.
But, Sherlund noted, the ruling does ``rein Microsoft in, and it clearly comes at an awkward time for the company, given the antitrust case.''
WASHINGTON _ Ebullient over their legal victory against Microsoft, Justice Department antitrust officials said Monday that they would examine possible remedies to put an end what a federal judge described as the company's monopolistic practices.
In his ruling, Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson wrote that Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.
His decision will provide the basis for further court hearings _ and possibly settlement negotiations _ to determine what remedies to impose on Microsoft.
The company said it would appeal.
At a news conference, Joel Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, offered little indication of what specific steps government lawyers would recommend to Jackson, who must decide on any enforcement sanctions against the company.
``While no final decision has been made,'' Klein said, ``the department is committed to finding a remedy that will protect consumers, innovation and competition by putting an end to Microsoft's widespread and persistent abuse of its monopoly power and to rectifying its unlawful attempt to monopolize the Internet browser market''.
At the news conference, Attorney General Janet Reno expressed satisfaction over the ruling.
``We are pleased that the court agreed with the department that Microsoft abused its monopoly power, that it violated the antitrust laws, and that it harmed consumers,'' she said.
``Microsoft has been held accountable for its illegal conduct by a court of law''.
The decision culminated the Clinton administration's most ambitious antitrust effort.
A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic presidential candidate, said that Gore had no comment on the ruling.
Gore received an icy reception when he visited the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash.
, last November.
Gore did not explicitly embrace the antitrust action, but said then that ``the values that are inherent in the antitrust laws are ones that are sound''.
Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, the likely Republican candidate, said that as president he would ``fully enforce antitrust laws,'' but would not discuss specifics of the case because it remained in litigation and would be appealed by Microsoft.
Klein said the ruling would bring positive change.
``It will benefit America's consumers by opening the door to competition, increased innovation and increased consumer choice in the software industry''.
He said the ruling showed how no company is above the law.
``It demonstrates once again that no company, no matter how powerful or how successful, can refuse to play by the rules, and thwart competition for America's consumers,'' Klein said.
``Competition has been at the heart of America's economy, and protecting competition at the heart of antitrust enforcement for a long time''.
Attorneys general for some of the states that joined in the government's case said they favored strict sanctions, which might include the breakup of the Microsoft.
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal urged Jackson to ``adopt remedies that are as far-reaching and fundamental as Microsoft's abuses of its monopoly''. &QL;
The government and Microsoft have been summoned to Chicago on Tuesday for their first round of settlement talks under Richard Posner, the federal appeals court judge who has been selected as a mediator, according to a person close to the antitrust case.
The mediation talks themselves, under court rules, are secret deliberations.
Besides Posner, who is chief judge of the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, the meeting will include lawyers representing Microsoft and the Justice Department and 19 states suing the company.
Posner, regarded as both an antitrust expert and a brilliant jurist, is expected to quickly assess the chances of any settlement between the two sharply divided sides.
In a meeting last Thursday, Thomas Penfield Jackson, the trial judge for the Microsoft case, told lawyers for the two sides that he had asked Posner to mediate.
At the time, Jackson noted, ``I don't think he is going to be prepared to waste a whole lot of time if it looks from the outset that it's not promising''.
If a settlement is reached, it will most likely happen in the next two months or not at all, according to another person close to the case.
``By the end of January, or it won't happen,'' he said.
Posner is serving as a mediator, not an arbiter, for the settlement talks.
There have been sporadic settlement talks between Microsoft and the government stretching back to before the suit was filed in May 1998.
Yet the previous efforts stalled.
Antitrust experts expect that Posner will try to deliver a sobering helping of reality to both sides.
They predict he will tell the government and states that their hand is as strong as it will ever be, while telling Microsoft to settle before it is hit with a final ruling that it violated the law, which could sharply increase its vulnerability to class-action lawsuits.
Final oral arguments in the case are scheduled for Feb.
22 before Jackson at U.S.
District Court in Washington.
LOS ANGELES, October 19 (Xinhua) --Business seemed as usual at Microsoft headquarters on the first day of the U.S. government's antitrust trial against this software giant.
On Monday in Washington D.C., the federal government and 20 states kicked off the trial that accused Microsoft of illegal activities, including bullying competitors.
Back in Seattle, Washington state, where Microsoft is based, the company fired off five upbeat, product-oriented press releases and other announcements.
Its Web site on Monday carried two articles in favor of Microsoft.
One of them is entitled "Economist experts challenge underlying assumptions in government's case," quoting them as saying that the government antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft is depending on theories that are not supported by the realities of the marketplace or current economic research.
The other which was carried by Los Angeles Times said that Microsoft is wrongly targeted and consumers would be losers if the government wins.
On Tuesday, Microsoft is scheduled to release its quarterly financial results, as analysts predicted another solid, high-profit quarter.
Computer Reseller News on Monday quoted a Microsoft employee as saying that "we are all concentrating on our individual jobs and only a small number of attorneys and executives are focused on the trial."
NEW YORK, May 14 (Xinhua) --Microsoft Corp.
has agreed to hold back on the shipment of Windows 98 while settlement talks with the U.S.
Department of Justice and state attorneys generals are still under way.
Sources who reached the public Thursday morning said that the parties held the 11th negotiations earlier Thursday concerning a major Sherman Antitrust case that was about to be launched against the software giant.
Microsoft Corp.
is making a last minute offer to settle the charges.
However, it is said, that a suit could still be filed unless Microsoft is willing to make "serious concessions" and changes in its business practices.
NBC News reported Wednesday that the Justice Department and at least 19 states plan to file historic antitrust cases Thursday against Microsoft.
If they proceed, the suits could be among the biggest corporate challenges in history, according to analysts.
Microsoft originally planned to ship its new Windows 98 operating system in PC to retailers Friday, and put it on shelves of computer stores on June 25.
Its critics would like to see a court block the planned public release.
To them, the company purposely embedded a Web brower into the new software which they claim is designed to enslave the entire Internet-using public to Microsoft's will.
WASHINGTON (AP) _ Microsoft won a court appeal Tuesday today in part of the U.S. government l monopoly case against the computer giant, winning the right to tie its Internet software to its popular computer operating system.
The U.S.
Court of Appeals agreed that a lower court's injunction against Microsoft was improper, and sent the matter back to the federal trial judge overseeing the antitrust case.
&UR; MORE
WASHINGTON _ In its closing argument in the Microsoft trial, the government said Tuesday that it is ``simply impossible to imagine'' that the company will not be found to have violated the nation's antitrust laws, based on the mountains of courtroom evidence.
The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft Corp.
, antitrust experts say, were playing a stong hand after Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued findings of fact last November that supported the government's version of the case in nearly every respect.
Yet Jackson has not yet issued his conclusions of law, which are expected sometime in the next few months.
Tuesday's presentations were the final attempt by both sides to try to influence Jackson's thinking.
Settlement talks, mediated by Richard Posner, chief judge of the federal appeals court in Chicago, are continuing, but the two sides remain divided.
Tuesday's courtroom statements _ uncompromising attacks from each side _ only seemed to underline the gap between the government and Microsoft.
At one point, David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer, said Microsoft's business strategy was based on trying to ``bribe and coerce'' other companies in the computer industry.
His counterpart, John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, dismissed one of Boies' arguments as ``entirely wrong''.
The government, according to most antitrust experts, is sitting on a big lead, while Microsoft is trying to limit its losses in Jackson's court and planning to fare better on appeal.
In its courtroom presentation Tuesday, Microsoft seemed to have elements of a loss-limitation strategy.
Warden began by saying that Microsoft ``respectfully disagreed'' with a large part of the judge's findings of fact.
He then went on to tell Jackson that his ruling might well shape the ground rules for competition in the high-tech economy.
The Microsoft case, Warden noted, focuses on the company's ``fights with competitors in a highly competitive, fast-moving industry''.
And antitrust doctrine, he observed, encourages competition even when that rough-and-tumble competition hurts a company's rivals.
``The law should not be rewritten to prevent Microsoft, or any other company, from competing aggressively,'' Warden said.
In the government's view, Microsoft is trying to change the subject with such arguments.
Fierce competition is one thing, the government says, but the voluminous record including volumes of e-mail, internal Microsoft documents and witness testimony show Microsoft to have been an arm-twisting monopolist, whose corporate behavior stifled competition and harmed consumers.
Boies opened his remarks by stressing that the Supreme Court has long recognized that antitrust cases are ``especially fact-based cases''.
And throughout his presentation, he repeatedly made reference to the judge's findings of fact, which sided so emphatically with the government, using phrases like ``the court has found,'' ``the evidence shows'' and ``Microsoft's own witnesses and documents show''.
And what that evidence showed, said Kevin O'Connor, an assistant attorney general for Wisconsin, who represented the states, was that ``Microsoft has used virtually every tool of the monopolist's trade _ attempted collusion, exclusionary contracts, tying, predation _ in a coordinated scheme to eliminate threats to its monopoly.''
The testimony last week of Garry Norris of IBM supplied some of the most absorbing moments so far in the Microsoft trial.
His litany of accusations was lengthy and specific _ threats and enticements to not compete against the Microsoft Corp.
delivered at meeting after meeting.
His charges were fleshed out with the dates, places and names, and backed up by his handwritten notes.
Norris, who negotiated with Microsoft on behalf of IBM's personal computer business from 1995 to 1997, was the first representative of a PC maker to testify for the government.
David Boies, the lead trial lawyer for the Justice Department, said the Norris testimony put a ``vivid human face'' on what he called ``some of the most important evidence in the case''.
Yet antitrust experts say that the Norris testimony was not a knockout punch on its own and that its legal power may hinge on earlier testimony, in closed sessions, on the prices Microsoft charges PC makers for its Windows operating system.
Big, powerful and itself long a target of government antitrust suits, IBM was an imperfect object of sympathy as the representative witness for PC makers.
Ever since IBM selected Microsoft to supply the operating system for the first IBM PC in 1981, IBM has been out-hustled and outsmarted by Microsoft in the PC business _ not the sort of behavior the nation's antitrust laws were meant to prohibit.
The government, of course, had recognized that IBM's size, reach and complicated history with Microsoft could be used by Microsoft's lawyers to try to undercut its contentions.
For months, the Justice Department had urged other major computer makers to take the stand _ and it pushed particularly hard for Ted Waitt, the chairman of Gateway Inc.
, who ultimately decided against it.
Microsoft's defense, antitrust experts say, may be that IBM was told it would pay a higher price for Windows unless it agreed to ``reduce, drop or eliminate'' shipments of OS/2, IBM's competing operating system.
On its face, such an invitation to a competitor to reduce competition would be an antitrust violation, even if the offer were rejected.
But the legal standard in such cases, established in a 1984 ruling involving American Airlines, is that the evidence be ``uniquely unequivocal'' _ in the airline case, the evidence was a tape-recorded offer to jointly raise fares.
With Microsoft, there is no such clear-cut evidence.
The contract proposals presented in court were a series of suggested discounts on the price of Windows if IBM agreed to certain promotion and marketing efforts on behalf of Windows.
No Microsoft contract offer, Norris conceded, stated specifically that IBM must ``drop or eliminate'' OS/2.
But he insisted that the overall effect of the Microsoft terms would be to ``kill OS/2 in the markeplace''.
Still, antitrust experts note, it is certainly legal for Microsoft to offer a distributor _ as the IBM PC business was _ incentives to aggressively distribute its product.
If accepting those incentives means featuring Microsoft's Windows over OS/2 _ made by another unit of IBM _ that is mainly a business decision for IBM to make, they say.
IBM turned down the Microsoft proposal.
A shrewdly devised offer by Microsoft perhaps, but antitrust experts say it was probably not a violation.
``It will be very difficult for the government to prevail on the OS/2 allegations,'' said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University.
The Norris testimony, however, went well beyond the OS/2 charge.
He asserted that Microsoft repeatedly offered IBM better terms and prices for Windows if it favored Microsoft products ranging from so-called office productivity applications to its Internet browsing software.
When IBM rejected those proposals, Norris said, Microsoft charged IBM more for Windows than it charged other major PC makers.
``The strongest Norris testimony was when he recounted the incidents of IBM not using other Microsoft software and then getting punished on the price of Windows,'' said Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, who is a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division.
Microsoft insists there is no evidence that IBM paid a higher price for Windows than its competitors.
The exception was the Compaq Computer Corp.
, which received a significantly lower price, Microsoft says, because it shared in the costs of developing Windows 95 _ a straightforward business rationale for different terms, says Microsoft, not punishment meted out by a monopolist.
But the government introduced an IBM document that cast doubt on Microsoft's statement.
The document, an internal memo, said IBM believed it paid $5 to $15 more for each copy of Windows it loaded on its machines than did Compaq, Hewlett-Packard or Dell Computer.
``IBM,'' the May 1997 document stated, ``currently pays a higher royalty than our leading competitors''.
Much of the detailed, company-by-company information on the prices to makers for Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system was submitted in previous testimony.
To protect confidential commercial information, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson took that testimony in closed sessions.
If the industry pricing information shows that IBM was paying more than comparable PC makers, the Norris testimony may add more legal ammunition to the government's case.
``To the extent the Norris testimony fits into the pattern of Microsoft threats and punishment, it is another piece in the puzzle,'' Litan, the former Justice Department official, said.
After a yearlong antitrust investigation, Japan's Fair Trade Commission told Microsoft Corp.
Friday to change permanently one of its marketing practices and pointedly warned the company to watch its step in the Internet browser market.
But despite the reprimand, the Japanese antitrust agency also stated that Microsoft's business practices ``cannot be immediately found to have tended to impede fair competition'' in the market for browser software in Japan.
Microsoft focused on that finding Friday as evidence that a major industrial nation had investigated many of the same practices as those in dispute in the Microsoft trial in Washington and had not found an anticompetitive effect.
``The finding in Japan is potentially quite interesting from an American standpoint because the Japanese investigators looked at the same kinds of things that are at issue in Washington,'' said Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel for international affairs.
Microsoft also announced Friday that the South Korean Fair Trade Commission had informed the company two months ago that its investigation of Microsoft, begun in November 1997, was concluded and that no further review was expected.
There is no direct link between the several overseas investigations of Microsoft and the antitrust case being heard in Washington, where the Justice Department and 20 states have sued Microsoft.
Antitrust experts said that most countries still investigating Microsoft's practices were taking a wait-and-see stance toward the company, pending the outcome of the major U.S. antitrust case.
Karel van Miert, the European commissioner in charge of competition policy, said recently that the European Commission was ``closely watching'' the trial in Washington, so for the present, there was no reason to devote more resources to the European investigation.
``Waiting itself is a kind of helpful coordination among nations,'' said Eleanor M.
Fox, a professor at the New York University Law School.
``And I certainly wouldn't draw the inference from the Japanese Fair Trade Commission's statement that Microsoft is off the hook in Japan at all''.
The Japanese investigation of Microsoft began in October 1997, but accelerated sharply on the morning of Jan.
13 when 20 uniformed police officers swept into Microsoft's offices in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo.
The investigation was stepped up after Joel I.
Klein, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, visited Japan in December.
But in response to a Senate question on the matter, the Justice Department said that Klein had not encouraged Japan ``to take action of any kind against Microsoft''.
The Japanese antitrust agency did find that Microsoft had been engaging in an unfair trade practice by bundling its Excel spreadsheet and Word text program in sales to personal computer makers.
Microsoft began bundling the two products for sales to PC makers three years ago, after a Japanese rival, Justsystem Corp.
, did the same thing.
Microsoft said it began making it easier for PC makers in Japan to load the two products separately in April, though most PC companies still preferred the bundled offering.
Microsoft says it has no plans to challenge the Japanese agency's order, which the fair trade commission terms a ``recommendation.''
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) --Antitrust lawyers from the U.S.
Justice Department were summoned to the White House Tuesday to brief President Bill Clinton's legal and economic advisers about a range of options for dealing with Microsoft Corp.
, including splitting up the software giant.
Local press reports said that attorneys for the Justice Department and the 19 states that successfully sued Microsoft for antitrust violations are considering ways to break up the company as a method to curb anticompetitive practices.
One reported option would be to split the company into two or three parts, each selling separate products, such as the Windows operating system and Internet content.
Another alternative would be for Microsoft to divest its popular Office software.
The government and the states have the option of filing separate recommendations, but both sides hope to turn in a single proposal.
Each has until Friday to submit proposed remedies to U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who ruled on April 3 that Microsoft illegally used its dominance in the operating systems market to hurt competition.
The ruling came after a 78-day trial that began in October 1998.
Microsoft officials have said they will appeal Judge Jackson's ruling and expect to prevail.
They have rejected a breakup, saying that such a remedy reaches far beyond the evidence presented in the trail.
"There is nothing in the trial record or in this case that would justify such an extreme and radical remedy," Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said Monday.
"This would be bad for Microsoft, consumers and the entire industry".
A court hearing to consider remedies has been scheduled for May 24.
Microsoft has until May 10 to respond to the government's proposal, but it may ask for an extension depending on the remedies requested.
If the Justice Department calls for breaking up Microsoft, it would be the agency's first such action since the 1974 antitrust suit against AT&AMP;T Corp.
that led to the breakup of the telephone giant.
Microsoft has already made clear that it will appeal the ruling against it.
The case is considered likely to end up before the Supreme Court.
WASHINGTON _ Here are the milestones in Microsoft's antitrust dealings with the government: 1990: May 30 _ The Federal Trade Commission staff opens an antitrust probe of Microsoft Corp.
The agency ponders charges that Microsoft illegally thwarted competition while adding hidden codes to its operating system software in a bid to hinder competing applications vendors.

Within a month, Microsoft abandons its proposed takeover.
June 9 _ Microsoft reveals the Justice Department is investigating Microsoft Network, its newly launched online service.
June 16 _ A federal appeals court upholds the 1994 settlement, reversing Sporkin and removing him from the case.
Aug. 21 _ U.S.

1996: Sept.
19 _ Microsoft reveals that the Justice Department is probing the bundling of its Internet Explorer browser with Windows 95.
1997: Oct.
20 - The Justice Department sues Microsoft, charging the company with having violated the 1994 court-approved settlement by requiring computer makers to install Internet Explorer in order to license Windows.
Dec. 11 - Jackson issues a preliminary injunction that bars Microsoft from requiring computer makers to install its online browser.
Dec. 15 - Microsoft says it will comply with Jackson's order by offering computer makers two new options, both of which the company claims would undermine computer performance.
Dec. 17 - The Justice Department asks Jackson to hold Microsoft in contempt, alleging that the proposed changes fail to meet the terms of Jackson's preliminary injunction.
1998: Jan.
22 - The Justice Department and Microsoft reach a settlement on the pending contempt charge.
May 14 - Microsoft and the Justice Department reveal that they are conducting settlement talks aimed at heading off a wide-ranging antitrust action.
May 18 - After the settlement negotiations fail, the Justice Department and 20 states file a broad antitrust suit against Microsoft.
The case is assigned to Jackson, who seeks to expedite the proceedings by setting an early trial date.
June 23 - A federal appeals court rules that Microsoft did not violate a previous agreement with the government when it combined Windows 95 and Internet Explorer.
Oct. 19 - The federal antitrust trial opens in Washington, with Jackson presiding without a jury.
After showing videotaped testimony from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, the government alleges that the company systematically used its dominance over the operating system market for personal computers to illegally thwart competition.
1999: Jan.
10 - The government rests its case after calling 12 witnesses.
The prosecution repeatedly seeks to portray Microsoft as a bullying monopolist.
Feb. 29 - The defense rests its case after also calling 12 witnesses.
Microsoft denies all charges of wrongdoing.
June 2 - After a three-month recess and unsuccessful secrecy-cloaked efforts to reach a settlement, the trial's rebuttal phase opens.
June 25 - The last rebuttal witness leaves the stand, eight months after the antitrust trial began.
William Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, says: ``The government has put on a great performance, ``but it does not add up to a solid antitrust case''.
Aug. 10 - Each side offers the court book-sized documents detailing what each it believes are the real facts in the case.
Microsoft's take: The government proved no wrongdoing in the eight-month trial.
The government's: Microsoft clearly engaged in a ``broad pattern of unlawful conduct''.
Sept. 10 - Each side files another stack of voluminous rebuttal briefs that largely review their prior arguments while disparaging the opponents' case.
Sept. 21 - Nearly a year after the trial began, the courtroom phase comes to a close with oral arguments from the opposing lawyers.
Once again, the government casts Microsoft as a monopolist that squelches competition while the company's lawyers accuse the plaintiffs of unwarranted meddling in the rough-and-tumble software industry.
Nov. 5 - Jackson issues his own findings of fact, to be followed, probably early next year, by his conclusions of law.
Taken together, they will constitute a verdict in the trial _ one that, barring a settlement, is virtually sure to be appealed.
ENDIT Story Filed By Cox Newspapers For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service
LONDON (AP) --Author Salman Rushdie has contributed lyrics to a new song by the Irish rock band U2, The Guardian newspaper reported Friday.
Rushdie, who has lived in hiding for nearly a decade since being condemned to death by Iran's supreme leader for his 1989 book ``The Satanic Verses,'' gave U2 lead singer Bono the lyrics taken from his new novel, ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' the newspaper said.
The romantic ballad, also to be called ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' will be on U2's next album, the report said.
``Bono and I have been friends for several years, and I sent him the novel when I'd finished it, and he responded by coming up with this beautiful melody,'' the newspaper quoted Rushdie as saying.
``Simple as that, but of course very pleasurable''.
Rushdie's literary agency declined to comment on The Guardian's report.
The newspaper said U2 hopes to release the single to coincide with the April 13 release of Rushdie's novel.
The lyrics for the song are included in the novel, which tells the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice against a rock 'n' roll background, it said.
The author's collaboration with U2 would not be his first: He appeared on stage with the band in London in 1993.
Rushdie was condemned to death in 1989 after the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding spiritual leader of the Islamic republic, ruled ``The Satanic Verses'' was blasphemous to Islam.
In October, the Iranian government said it was distancing itself from the edict, but hard-liners insist there's still a price on the author's head.
TEHRAN, February 12 (Xinhua) --A private Iranian foundation has raised its reward for killing British author Salman Rushdie from 2 million U.S. dollars to 2.5 million dollars.
However, President Hashemi Rafsanjani declared in a press conference held here today that the reward has nothing to do with the government, claiming, "The government policy still remains the same".
The Persian Daily Jumhuri Islami reported today that Ayatollah Sheikh Jassan Sanai'e, representative of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and head of the Khordad Foundation, has announced the decision for raising the reward.
The report said that the clergyman made the announcement on the occasion of the 8th anniversary of the issuance of the decree on the Indian-born author of the book of "Satanic Verses".
Muslim fundamentalists, who consider the book blasphemous for its irreverent treatment of the Prophet Mohammed, Islam's founder, reacted very strongly after the book was published in 1989.
Sanai'e said that the interests on the reward money would also be paid to the executor of the decree right from the beginning, adding, "There is nothing more (important) to the foundation than seeing Imam Khomeini's decree executed".
On February 14, 1989, the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, announcing the death sentence of Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the publication of his novel, and exhorting all Muslims to carry out the sentence.
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and European countries.
However, Iran, given tremendous pressures from the European Union (EU) after the death of Khomeini, has promised not to dispatch any commandos to kill Rushdie.
Iranian authorities reportedly face tremendous pressure and opposition from the religious extremists inside the country on the issue.
TEHRAN, March 13 (Xinhua) --Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is the only person who has the authority to cancel the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a high-ranking official at presidential office said here today.
"The decree [death sentence] has not been cancelled.
No one, except for Ayatollah Khamenei, can revise the decree," the official at presidential office told Xinhua today.
The official at presidential office who spoke on condition of anonymity said that since the decree was issued by a religious scholar of the high stature of Khomeini it could not be changed by officials.
"Only Ayatollah Khamenei, as the Supreme Jurisprudent, can revise decrees issued by the late Imam," he stressed.
On February 14, 1989, the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of death on the British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the publication of Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses", and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and European countries.
However, Iranian authorities have given into tremendous pressures from the European Union after the death of Khomeini, promising not to dispatch any commandos to kill Rushdie.
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told a press conference here last week that Iran would not send anyone to kill Rushdie.
Similar assurances have been given to European Union by President Rafsanjani and Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said at a press conference here Monday that the sentence on Salman Rushdie was an issue of Islamic law and that "it was not essentially an Executive issue".
The official at presidential office said that Rafsanjani wanted to draw the attention to the religious importance of the decree.
"The president wanted to make a distinction between a religious, jurisprudential decree and an executive, administrative one," the official said.
"The British with their hue and cry wanted to make it sound that the decree was an executive one," he added.
"In fact it was the British themselves who did not want to have this issue resolved and even now their actions show they do not seek an end to it," he said.
Rafsanjani's Monday statement on Rushdie has drawn criticism from a national newspaper Jomhuri Eslami.
The paper issued an editorial Tuesday, saying that Rushdie still has to face death sentence because "no one has the right to change the divine command".
"It is the responsibility of all Moslems to kill anyone who would insult the Blessed Progeny of Prophet Muhammad, the Holy Koran and Islamic sanctities," the daily said.
"This punishment has to be done regardless of time, place and individuals involved.
The decree is not a governmental or personal decree and hence cannot be changed to adjust to new political conditions," it warned.
Observers here said that the indirect talks on Salman Rushdie between EU and Tehran is producing some understanding.
The two sides have agreed the case be regarded merely as a religious and theoretical issue.
They said that with U.S. pressures mounting on Iran, Iranian authorities have decided to solve the Rushdie issue to gain the cooperation of the European Union.
"The question is not whether, but how, to withdraw from previous position, in such a way that Iran will not lose face both at home and abroad," a political analyst here said.
Iranian authorities also face tremendous pressure and opposition from the religious extremists inside the country on the issue of Rushdie.
Iranian officials have stated recently that they want to adopt a protective stance with regard to issues such as Rushdie affair.
Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, said at a press conference held last week that Iran will take the case of insulting religious sanctities like the Rushdie affair to the United Nations.
He said that Iran will ask the United Nations to effectively put a ban on insulting religious sanctities in a bid to prevent disputes such as Rushdie affairs.
LONDON (AP) _ British author Salman Rushdie, speaking after Iran distanced itself from an Islamic death sentence against him, said Thursday that it appeared his nearly 10-year ordeal had ended.
``This looks like its over,'' Rushdie said.
``It means everything''.
Speaking outside the Foreign Office where he was briefed on the development that came out British talks with Iran in New York, Rushdie said: ``It seems that this has been done in Iran with consensus''.
Rushdie said that some organizations would be upset by the decision, but said there didn't seem to be much mainstream opposition within Iran.
``An extraordinary thing has been achieved,'' Rushdie said.
Publication of Salman Rushdie's '' Satanic Verses'' in 1988 caused an uproar among Muslims around the world, who contended that it insulted Islam.
The novel brought an Iranian ``fatwa,'' or death sentence from Iran's Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini in February 1989.
Islamic militants put a 1.2 million pound (dlrs 2 million) bounty on the Indian-born British writer's head.
At the United Nations in New York, Iran's foreign minister said his government was distancing itself from the reward for killing Rushdie, and was ready to exchange ambassadors with Britain.
Britain's Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who met Kharrazi on the sidelines of the U.N.
General Assembly session, said he was delighted with Iran's decision.
``These assurances should make possible a much more constructive relationship between the United Kingdom, and I believe the European Union, with Iran, and the opening of a new chapter in our relations,'' Cook said after the meeting. (rs)
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Thousands of Iranian clerics and theological students have pledged a month's salary toward a bounty for the killing of British author Salman Rushdie, an Iranian newspaper reported Saturday.
The pledge shows the continuing division over Rushdie, who was condemned to death in 1989 after the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding spiritual leader of the Islamic republic, ruled that his book ``The Satanic Verses'' was blasphemous.
In September, Britain restored full diplomatic relations with Iran after Tehran distanced itself from the bounty.
But the move has been fiercely opposed by hard-line critics of the government of President Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate.
In a pledge sent to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, students and teachers in the holy city of Qom, northwest Iran, said they were ``ready to carry out the edict against Salman Rushdie,'' the newspaper Kayhan reported.
``Thousands have also signed up to give a month's wages to any person who carries out the historical edict against Salman Rushdie,'' the Farsi-language newspaper added.
Seminary students in Qom receive monthly stipends of about 200,000 rials (dlrs 66) and teachers earn about 300,000 rials (dlrs 100).
Last month a semi-government foundation in Iran raised the bounty on Rushdie's head from dlrs 2.5 million to dlrs 2.8 million.
The move followed the government's distancing itself from the reward.
Last month residents of a north Iranian village offered land and carpets to anyone who kills Rushdie.
&UR; av-af-jbm
The students had earlier delivered a letter of protest to the Foreign Ministry, the paper said.
``Your issuing of a joint statement with the British foreign minister about Salman Rushdie and the historical edict of Imam Khomeini...
caused deep regret and sorrow among Iranians and all over the Muslim world,'' the paper quoted the letter as saying.
Powerful government hard-liners, dismayed over Khatami's efforts to improve ties with the West since he took office last year, were not happy with the government position on Rushdie.
Last week, more half the members of Iran's hard-line parliament signed a letter saying the death edict against Rushdie still stands.
Rushdie had spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini issued the edict.
He recently voiced relief the ordeal was over.

TEHRAN, March 11 (Xinhua) --Iran announced here today that it drops the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a British writer accused of defaming Islam in his novel, under tremendous pressure from European countries.
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said at a press conference this morning that "the death sentence was never meant to be carried out".
Rafsanjani attacked Europe, especially Britain, for their lack of resolve to solve the issue.
He said: "The Europeans, especially the British, made hue and cry over it.
Even now they do not allow it to be solved".
"The fatwa issued by Imam Khomeini can be found in all the books on Islamic law for the past 1,000 years.
He only said something which existed in these books," Rafsanjani added.
"We really do not think it is prudent that we would dwell on this issue so much," he added.
Observers here said that the indirect Tehran-EU talks on Salman Rushdie is producing some understanding.
The two sides have agreed that the case should be regarded merely as a religious and theoretical issue.
On February 14, 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a death sentence on the Indian-born British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest against the publication of Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses," which was believed by Moslems as defaming Islam, and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
In 1993, Rafsanjani told prominent Egyptian journalist Muhammad Hassanein Haykal that there was a difference between a fatwa (ruling) and hokm (command).
He said that Khomeini did not mean the death sentence to be a command.
An observer here said that with U.S. pressure mounting on Iran, Iranian authorities have decided to solve the Rushdie issue to gain cooperation of the European Union.
"The Iranians no longer want any of the troubles they went through over the Rushdie issue," one observer said.
"The question is not whether but how to withdraw from previous position, in such a way that Iran will not lose face both at home and abroad," he said.
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati reiterated here last week that Iran would not send anyone to kill the author.
Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, said at a press conference held last week that Iran will take the case of insulting religious sanctities like the Rushdie affair to the United Nations.
He said that Iran will ask the United Nations to effectively put a ban on insulting religious sanctities in a bid to prevent disputes such as the Rushdie affair.
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Residents of a village in northern Iran have offered land and carpets to anyone who kills British author Salman Rushdie, a newspaper reported Sunday.
The people of Kiapey will give 10 carpets, 4,500 sq.
meters (5,400 sq.
yards) of agricultural land and a house with a 1500 sq.
meter (1,800 sq.
yard) garden in their Caspian Sea coastal village to Rushdie's assassin, the Farsi-language paper Kayhan said.
The move follows the Iranian government's distancing itself last month from bounties offered for the death of Rushdie and a strong reaction by hard-liners who support the killing of the Booker Prize-winning author.
The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding spiritual leader of the Islamic republic, condemned Rushdie to death in 1989, ruling that his book, ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam.
The villagers have also invited the parents of Mustapha Mazeh, who blew himself up while working on a home-made bomb in a London hotel in 1989, to live in Kiapey, which has a population of 2,000 and is near Sari, the capital of Mazandaran province.
Iranians believe Mazeh, a French citizen of Moroccan origin, intended to kill Rushdie, but British police have dismissed this theory.
Last week, a semi-government foundation in Iran raised the bounty on Rushdie's head from dlrs 2.5 million to dlrs 2.8 million.
And hard-liners staged two demonstrations in Tehran in support of the death sentence.
The government said last month it did not support the bounty and, after a meeting between their foreign ministers in New York on Sept.
24, Britain and Iran decided to upgrade their relations to ambassadorial level.

LIEGE, Belgium (AP) --Salman Rushdie says his life has improved since Iran distanced itself last year from a death sentence against him.
``It is not 100 percent normal, but compared to what the last 10 years have been like, it is better,'' the ``Satanic Verses'' author said at a news conference Friday.
He said the lifting of the death sentence would allow him to focus on being a novelist rather than the center of a political debate.
The writer was in Liege to receive an honorary doctorate in literature from Liege University.
NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Author Salman Rushdie is welcome to visit India, but the government is not ready to lift the ban on his book, The Satanic Verses, India's minister for internal security said in an interview published Saturday.
``He is an outstanding writer and is welcome to return home,'' The Times of India quoted Lal Krishna Advani as saying.
Advani's statement came nearly two weeks after Rushdie complained in an interview that he was banned from entering India.
He was born in Bombay.
Rushdie has spent nearly a decade in hiding since Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death in 1989, claiming ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam.
Last month, the Iranian government distanced itself from offers by Iranian groups to pay money to execute the edict.
But a foundation that initially offered dlrs 2.5 million to anyone who kills Rushdie raised the reward to dlrs 2.8 million.
India was the first country in the world to ban ``The Satanic Verses'' after it provoked angry protests from the Muslim community in 1988.
In 1996, Rushdie's book ``The Moor's Last Sigh'' was withdrawn from bookshelves within weeks of its release in India after directions from Indian customs.
LONDON (AP) --Iranian hard-liners said Sunday that the 1989 death sentence ordered against British novelist Salman Rushdie remained in effect, despite the Iranian government's statements more than a year ago that appeared to lift it, an Iranian radio report said.
The decree by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini remains in force, ``and nothing will change that,'' the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps said, according to the radio report monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.
on the eve of the anniversary of the ``fatwa,'' or religious edict.
``Based on divine principles,...
the ruling against the apostate Salman Rushdie is still valid and nothing can change this,'' the statement reportedly said.
After Khomeini announced the sentence on Feb.
14, claiming Rushdie had blasphemed Islam in ``The Satanic Verses,'' the 52-year-old Rushdie spent nearly a decade in hiding under police protection.
He emerged from his shadowy existence in September 1998 when Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi announced the country was distancing itself from a $2.5 million reward promised for Rushdie's death.
Iran had been trying to change its foreign policy since Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric, took over as president in August 1997.
He underscored the need to replace confrontation with dialogue in Iran's relations with the West.
The Rushdie affair was the main hurdle in Iran's efforts to improve ties with the European Union.
Britain and Iran agreed to upgrade their diplomatic relations in May 1999.
Muslims have said before that the fatwa cannot be lifted formally, but the Iranian government's decision did ease the threat to Rushdie.
Powerful hard-liners inside the Islamic regime have always supported the death sentence and are likely to continue to do so .
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ British writer Salman Rushdie sees new safety for himself in Iran's distancing itself from the Islamic edict calling for his murder, but many in Iran are debating whether anything has really changed.
On Sunday, both newspapers and ordinary Iranians debated the announcement made in New York Thursday by Iran's foreign minister distancing his government from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for Rushdie's death.
The hard-line Jomhuri Eslami said in an editorial that the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's ``fatwa,'' or Islamic edict, calling for Rushdie's death was still applicable.
``Any promise in this regard... is a personal interpretation and has nothing to do with the Islamic Republic.
There is no room for optimism by Rushdie and his supporters,'' the paper said.
The Iran News, a moderate daily close to the foreign ministry, said there was nothing new in Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi's statement that his ``government disassociates itself from any reward...
and does not support it''.
It pointed out that the government's position has for several years been not to seek Rushdie's death.

LONDON _ British Airways said Friday that it would not permit the writer Salman Rushdie to fly on its planes, despite Iran's assurances that it would not carry out its death sentence against Rushdie.
``While we have every sympathy with Rushdie's difficulties with overseas travel,'' said Bruce Tobin, a spokesman for the airline, ``our ultimate responsibility is the safety of our passengers and staff''.
Rushdie has made many overseas trips since 1989, when the death sentence, in the form of a religious edict, was issued against him.
But not once has he flown on British Airways.
``We maintain close contact with the relevant authorities in all matters that might affect the safety and security of our passengers,'' Tobin said.
``Mr. Rushdie is not a British Airways customer.''
TEHRAN, March 29 (Xinhua) --Iran warned on Sunday it's ties with Norway might further worsen if Oslo continues support for Salman Rushdie, a British writer condemned to death by Iran for his "blasphemous" novel.
"The continuation of the offensive policies by Norway might force Iran to further limit its ties with the country," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said, quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
Rushdie was condemned to death in 1989 by Iran's late Spiritual Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei for his novel "the Satanic Verses," which was regarded as an insult to the Islamic Prophet Muhammad.
Reacting to a recent meeting between Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik and Rushdie, Mohammadi said "the meeting constituted a support for Rushdie's desecration of Islamic sanctities".
He said Norway's move defied the new international consensus which views understanding among nations and dialogue among cultures and civilizations necessary for peaceful coexistence in the world.
Iran and Norway recalled their ambassadors in December 1994 over Norway's support for Rushdie and their ties have since been kept at the level of charge d'affaires.
Mohammadi said the restrictions Iran imposed on its commercial and political relations with Norway would continue "unabatedly."
LONDON _ The British government said Wednesday that it would continue to press Iran to lift the death sentence against the author Salman Rushdie when its foreign secretary, Robin Cook, meets the Iranian foreign minister in New York on Thursday.
``We're working to achieve a resolution to the problem that is going to be acceptable to both sides,'' said a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
``We've always taken the opportunity to press for assurances of Salman Rushdie's safety, and that is what Robin Cook will be doing when he meets Kamal Kharazi tomorrow''.
Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, seemed to signal a softening of Iran's position on Tuesday, when he told reporters in New York that ``we should consider the Salman Rushdie affair as completely finished''.
But Britain has always insisted that nothing short of a complete lifting of the death sentence, as well as the revocation of the $2.5 million bounty on Rushdie's head pledged by a revolutionary foundation in Tehran, would be an acceptable solution.
After he wrote the novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' Rushdie was accused of blasphemy against Islam and condemned to death in a religious decree by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989.
Since then, he has lived in safe houses around London, guarded around the clock by British agents.
Rushdie and several representatives from the International Rushdie Defense Committee met with members of the Foreign Office on Wednesday and the committee issued a statement saying that it remained ``cautiously optimistic'' about Thursday's meeting.
Although the Iranian government has said in the past that it would not actively encourage anyone to kill Rushdie, it has never explicitly revoked the death sentence, nor canceled the bounty.
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ About 1,000 hard-liners, many of them militia volunteers, demonstrated outside Tehran University on Tuesday, shouting that the religious edict against writer Salman Rushdie remained in force.
The demonstration occurred as Abdollah Nouri, a deputy to moderate President Mohammad Khatami, delivered a speech at the university on civil liberties.
One of the hard-liners tried to hit Nouri as he was leaving the campus, but four body guards protected him and whisked him away in his car.
Nouri, who is a close ally of President Mohammad Khatami, was attacked along with Ataollah Mohajerani, the minister of culture and Islamic guidance, on Sept.
4 by militants.
The demonstrators called for the death of Rushdie.
``The edict is irrevocable, and we emphasize the implementation of this edict against apostate Salman Rushdie independent of any diplomatic negotiations conducted by Iran's government,'' said a statement distributed by the Basij Resistance Forces, a militia that assists the army in wartime.
A ``fatwa,'' or religious edict, was issued by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini against Rushdie in 1989 on grounds his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' was blasphemous.
Khatami's government has tried to distance itself from offers by Iranian groups to pay money to anyone implementing the fatwa.
On Monday, a foundation that initially offered dlrs 2.5 million to anyone who kills Rushdie raised the reward to dlrs 2.8 million.
Last Saturday, a hard-line student group offered its own reward of dlrs 333,000.
The edict has strained ties between Iran and the West, especially Britain.
Britain restored diplomatic relations last month after Khatami's government distanced itself from the reward offering.
Rushdie, who spent nearly a decade in hiding after Khomeini issued the edict, expressed relief that the ordeal was over.

VIENNA, Austria (AP) --The European Union on Monday welcomed a move by the Iranian government to distance itself from an Islamic edict calling for British author Salman Rushdie's death even as two senior Iranian clerics said the ruling was irrevocable.
In a statement issued here, the EU said the Iranian decision opens the way for closer cooperation between Europe and the Tehran government.
The statement was issued here because Austria holds the rotating EU presidency.
The Rushdie affair has been the main hurdle in Iran's efforts to improve ties with the European Union.
Britain also has sought better ties in order to benefit from lucrative projects in Iran, which have gone to France and other European countries.
On Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi distanced his government from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for Rushdie's death.
He did not, however, say that the government was rescinding the edict.
Rushdie has spent nearly a decade in hiding since the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death on Feb.
14, 1989, claiming his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam.
In Tehran, however, two influential clerics --Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Fazel Lankarani and Grand Ayatollah Nouri Hamedani -- were quoted as saying the edict, or fatwa, must be enforced and no one can reverse it. rr
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) --Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati will start his two-day official visit Tuesday to Italy in a bid improve the bilateral relations.
However, the Iranian foreign minister today declined to comment on whether the thorny issue of the Salman Rushdie affairs will be dealt with during his forthcoming trip to Italy.
On February 14, 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a death sentence on British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, which was accused of insulting Muslims, and exhorting all Muslims to carry out the sentence.
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and European countries.
Velayati said "the main purpose of this trip is to pay an official visit to Rome and talk to the high-ranking officials of that country about bilateral, regional and international cooperation between Iran and Italy".
An Iranian source from the Foreign Ministry said that Velayati will also call on Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
Ludovico Ortona, Italian Ambassador to Iran, has already left for Rome to make preparations for the high-level bilateral talks.
The source said that Iran-Italian economic relations will be on the top of agenda between Velayati and his Italian counterpart Lamberto Dini.
Italy and Iran signed an agreement in November for several industrial projects totalling 561 million U.S. dollars, which will be financed by the Italian Bank Medtocredito along with a number of other banks from England, France, Japan, Netherlands and Germany.
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian foundation has added dlrs 300,000 to the reward for Salman Rushdie's death, just weeks after the Iranian government tried to distance itself from the bounty.
``I, as the head of the Khordad Foundation, add dlrs 300,000 to the reward for implementing the edict,'' Ayatollah Hassan Saneii was quoted as saying by Jomhuri Islami newspaper Monday.

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A hard-line Iranian student group has offered 1 billion riyals (dlrs 333,333) to anyone who kills Salman Rushdie, the second bounty on the British author's head.
The move came just weeks after the relatively moderate government of President Mohammad Khatami distanced itself from the death edict and an earlier reward of dlrs 2.5 million.
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who made the announcement in New York, and his British counterpart, Robin Cook, had portrayed the move as a way to improve ties that have remained strained over the issue and agreed to exchange ambassadors.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa, or religious edict, on Rushdie in 1989, claiming his book ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam.
The semiofficial Khordad Foundation later offered the initial reward to anyone who killed Rushdie.
The Association of Hezbollah University students said despite Kharrazi's pledge, they were still ready to carry out the death sentence against Rushdie and were willing to pay the dlrs 333,333 to any person who killed him, Kayhan newspaper reported Saturday.
It did not say where the students would obtain the funds.
The students had earlier delivered a letter of protest to the Foreign Ministry, the paper said.
``Your issuing of a joint statement with the British foreign minister about Salman Rushdie and the historical edict of Imam Khomeini...
caused deep regret and sorrow among Iranians and all over the Muslim world,'' the paper quoted the letter as saying.
Powerful government hard-liners, dismayed over Khatami's efforts to improve ties with the West since he took office last year, were not happy with the government position on Rushdie.
Last week, more than half the members of Iran's hard-line parliament signed a letter saying the death sentence stands.
Rushdie had spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini issued the edict.
He recently voiced relief the ordeal was over.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iran's foreign minister said Thursday that his government was distancing itself from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for killing British novelist Salman Rushdie, paving the way for upgrading strained ties with the United Kingdom.
The Iranian ``government disassociates itself from any reward which has been offered in this regard and does not support it,'' Kamal Kharrazi said after a meeting with his British counterpart, Robin Cook.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani Islamic groups said Saturday that they were outraged that Iran had softened its stand toward British writer Salman Rushdie.
While stopping short of revoking a death sentence against Rushdie, Iran says it won't adopt any measures that threaten his life, or anyone connected to his book --The Satanic Verses.
Nor will Iran encourage or help anyone to do so.

NEW DELHI, October 10 (Xinhua) --Controversial British author Salman Rushdie says he has been hurt and humiliated by the country of his birth, India, which treated him as a persona non grata and his next novel is about saying good-bye to the country, Press Trust of India reported Saturday.
"The biggest loss to me is that my relationship with India has been thoroughly damaged.
India prevented me from going to India," Rushdie said in a recent interview published in the latest issue of Sunday, a weekly magazine.
Bocker prize winner Rushdie had been living a furtive life since 1989 under police protection in Britain following a death sentence issued by the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini for blaspheming Islam in his book the Satanic Verses.
Iran announced a lifting of the death sentence on September 24 this year.
"They (India) won't give me a visa, despite the fact that I have a right to go there, that I have a status of non-resident Indians by virtue of being born there, and despite the fact that I have my property there," Rushdie said.
LONDON (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met Salman Rushdie for private discussions Friday.
The Foreign Office declined to say anything about the meeting, stressing that it was private.
Rushdie has been protected by the government since 1989, when the Iranian religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed that the author of ``The Satanic Verses'' should be killed.
Last month, Cook met Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi in New York, and Kharrazi said his government was distancing itself from rewards offered for Rushdie's death.
However, on Monday a foundation that initially offered dlrs 2.5 million to anyone who kills Rushdie raised the reward to dlrs 2.8 million.
Last Saturday, a hard-line student group offered its own reward of dlrs 333,000. (rb)
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) --Iran declared here today that it will take the case of insulting religious sanctities like the Rushdie affair to the United Nations.
Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, said at a press conference here that Iran will ask the United Nations to effectively put a ban on insulting religious sanctities in a bid to prevent disputes such as Rushdie affairs.
"We think there is room for such an action at different international forums including the U.N.," he said.
Speaking through an interpreter to an international corps of reporters here to report on March 8th parliamentary elections, he stressed that the concept of freedom in the West led to violations of the rights of others.
While answering the question by Xinhua, Mirsalim said "Iran is planning to take the issue of insulting religious sanctities, which has resulted in the Rushdie issue, to the international bodies, including to the U.N"..
"We believe that there is a deviation inherent in the concept of freedom in some of the Western societies that tramples the rights of the most people in the world," he said.
"If the cultural community and the authors in the West had been committed to respecting the religious beliefs of the people, a problem such as Salman Rushdie would have never emerged," he added.
He added that his ministry was committed to defend Islamic culture and rejected allegations by critics that his ministry took sides with the religious conservatives.
"Being neutral does not mean anything.
We have to defend the Islamic culture," he said.
However, the Iranian culture minister did not say whether Iran intends to drop late religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Salman Rushdie.
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said during his recent trip to central Asian states that Iran will resume talks with the European Union (EU) on the Rushdie issue.
On 14 February 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of death on British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest against the publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
Liberal weekly Bahman reported in February that former deputy guidance minister, Ahmad Masjed Jame'ie, resigned over differences pertaining the new restrictions imposed on authors.
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance came under heavy attacks in 1995 by the religious conservatives that took the ministry for allowing the publication of romantic novels.
In a sudden about-face in its publication policy, the ministry declared that authors have to receive permission prior to publication of their books.
ISLAMABAD, May 20 (Xinhua) --Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad on Wednesday described China's stance on the nuclear issue as "mature and highly responsible".
He said it was "in sharp contrast to the irresponsible stance of India".
"As you know, China is the only nuclear weapon state which has repeatedly and authoritatively stated that it will never under any circumstances be the first to use nuclear weapons," Shamshad told reporters upon his arrival at the Islamabad airport after concluding a two-day visit to Beijing.
"This mature and highly responsible approach to issues of international peace and security by China stands in sharp contrast to the irresponsible statements emanating from the Indian leadership, threatening the use of nuclear weapons," he said.
He said China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and signatory to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has always advocated international peace and security and nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There was a complete identity of views between Pakistan and China on the gravity of the situation which had resulted from India's reckless actions and fictitious threat from China, invented by India as a pretext to promote its own hegemonic designs and aggressive agenda in South Asia," he said.
"The Chinese government has already condemned in the strongest terms the outrageous actions of the Indian government to introduce nuclear weapons in South Asia which has destabilized the strategic balance in our region".
"Our consultations with China are indeed an important facet of our wider consultations with all major powers as well as friendly countries to seek ways and means to effectively defuse tension and reduce the factors that have threatened peace and stability in our region," he said.
ISLAMABAD, February 16 (Xinhua) --Japan Tuesday urged Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) before India, saying it would boost the image of Pakistan in the international community.
"We urged Pakistan to ensure progress in the nuclear field and ink the CTBT before India," a senior Japanese official said after talks held here between officials from the two countries.
"Tokyo will appreciate Pakistan if it takes the initiative to show adherence to the non-proliferation treaty," Director in the Japanese Foreign Ministry Kazauya Ogawa said.
He said the Japanese delegation, led by Deputy Foreign Minister Minoru Tamba, stressed the need for legislation to tighten control over the export of nuclear technology to third country.
"We conveyed our concern over the cooperation between Pakistan and North Korea in the nuclear field and told the Pakistani side that it would affect ties between Pakistan and Japan," Ogawa said.
However, Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed, who led the Pakistani side at the talks, rejected reports that Islamabad is receiving any assistance from third country in the nuclear field.
"We also asked Pakistan to refrain from further test of missile and stop the production of fissile materials," Ogawa said.
Pakistani officials, he said, told the Japanese side that Pakistan is participating in the talks on Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT) in Geneva.
Japan agreed that Kashmir is the root cause of tension in South Asia and hoped the tension would reduce through bilateral talks between Pakistan and India, said Ogawa.
Japan is ready to facilitate Pakistan and India to hold talks in Tokyo if the two countries agree, he said.
Asked whether Japan would lift sanctions if Pakistan signs the CTBT, Ogawa said Tokyo could partially restore aid to Pakistan after its signing and ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Japan, the largest donor to Pakistan, slapped economic sanctions after the country's nuclear tests last May.
Japan had extended 500 million U.S. dollars to Pakistan annually.
Pakistan has been for several months under tremendous pressure by the Western countries to ink the CTBT before the sanctions are lifted.
The main purpose of the Japanese deputy foreign minister's visit is to convince Pakistan to sign the CTBT.
In the wake of nuclear tests last May, the Japanese government stopped granting aids and loans to Pakistan and decided not to support Pakistan in getting loans from international financial institutions like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank.
During Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz's visit to Japan late last year, the Japanese government removed its opposition to Pakistan's getting loans from international institutions, but refused to lift sanctions before Pakistan signs the CTBT.
ANKARA, May 29 (Xinhua) --Turkey and Iran have expressed concern over the underground nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan to match India's five explosions two week ago.
A statement issued by Turkish Foreign Ministry Friday said that the nuclear tests conducted by both India and Pakistan were of concern for regional and global stability and security.
The statement said that the two neighboring countries should refrain from a reciprocal show of power and should solve their disputes peacefully.
"Turkey wishes that this alarming development recorded in the recent weeks will not pave the way for a new nuclear arms race," it added.
Pakistan detonated five underground nuclear devices Thursday, widely viewed as a response to India's five nuclear tests on May 11 and 13.
India has so far refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, calling them discriminatory.
Iran has called on Pakistan and India to cease nuclear tests and rivalry and join the comprehensive test ban treaty.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said on Thursday that Iran follows with deep concern the ongoing chain of events concerning nuclear tests, the official news agency IRNA said in a delayed report on Friday.
Mohammadi said that the current nuclear race poses a serious threat and danger to regional peace and stability, a race which is first and foremost the consequence of lack of political will on the part of the nuclear powers to heed the call of international community for a comprehensive nuclear disarmament.
The spokesman warned that in the absence of an all-encompassing program for comprehensive nuclear disarmament, the status and future of Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty would face great uncertainty.
NEW YORK, May 28 (Xinhua) --More countries have come out to condemn Pakistan's nuclear tests.
The French Foreign Ministry issued a communique Thursday to deplore and condemn the nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan on the same day.
France calls on both India and Pakistan not to conduct any more nuclear tests but to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and join talks on the banning of production of fissile materials that can be used to produce nuclear arms, said the communique.
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement released Thursday, "We continue to urge Pakistan and India to renounce their nuclear weapons programs and to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty".
He also announced a series of sanctions against Pakistan, which he said are consistent with those imposed on India after its nuclear tests.
NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's prime minister said Friday he looks forward to meeting with his Pakistani counterpart later this month to discuss the issues over which they fought two wars and launched a nuclear arms race.
``India and Pakistan have to live together.
We can't change the geography and will have to live like good neighbors,'' United News of India news agency quoted Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as telling Parliament.
Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will meet in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, during a regular summit of a seven-nation regional group.
Vajpayee said India is prepared for talks with Pakistan _ without the involvement of any other nation _ in resolving their disputes, chiefly their competing claims to the Himalayan state of Kashmir.
He repeated his call on Pakistan to enter into a no-first-use nuclear weapons agreement with India.
Vajpayee also said India wants to resolve a border dispute with China that has chilled relations between both nations.
India detonated a series of underground nuclear tests in May, saying it needed a nuclear deterrent due to threats from China and Pakistan.
Pakistan responded with its own tests.
Following the tests, the United States, Britain, Japan and other industrialized nations imposed economic and military sanctions on both India and Pakistan.
They also urged both of them to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which they have refused to do for years.
India says the treaties are flawed because they allow nations with sophisticated nuclear weapons to keep their arsenals.
On Friday, Vajpayee said India is prepared to discuss the test ban treaty.
``However, nobody should feel that we are ready to participate because we are weak,'' he said.
On Thursday, the U.S.
Senate voted unanimously to exempt agriculture credits from nuclear sanctions imposed on Pakistan and India.
The move will help U.S. farmers who are desperate for markets sell wheat and other products in South Asia.
UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Pakistan's prime minister said Wednesday his country would unilaterally adhere to the nuclear test ban treaty, but called on international pressure to force rival India to do the same.
Nawaz Sharif said Pakistan was ready for adherance before a nuclear conference in September 1999 if international sanctions were speedily lifted.

GENEVA (AP) _ The five longstanding nuclear states refused Thursday to admit India or Pakistan into the nuclear club and called on them to refrain from further nuclear tests and resolve their differences with direct talks.
Top diplomats from the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, at an emergency meeting to deal with the South Asian arms race, also promised to assist in cooling tension between India and Pakistan and called upon them to ``avoid threatening military movements, cross-border violations or other provocative acts''.
``We are prepared to help India and pakistan maintain peace if they are prepared to do the right thing,'' said U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
``It is a strong message from the permanent members of the Security Council and they'd better stop, look, and listen,'' she said.
``The ministers condemned these tests, expressed their deep concern about the danger to peace and stability in the region, and pledged to cooperate closely in urgent efforts to prevent a nuclear and missile arms race in the subcontinent,'' the powers stated in a joint communique.
In rejecting the South Asian nations' bid to join the ranks of nuclear powers, the five nations said after a two-hour meeting: ``India and Pakistan do not have the status of nuclear weapons states in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty''.
India and Pakistan should also confirm their policies not to export equipment, materials or technology that could contribute to weapons of mass destruction or missiles capable of delivering them, the communique said.
The leaders underscored the urgency of India and Pakistan rejoining the global arms-control movement they sent staggering last month when India and then Pakistan conducted nuclear weapons tests.
Specifically, they urged both nations to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty unconditionally _ meaning without any ``rewards'' such as permanent status on the U.N.
Security Council or any changes in the obligations the treaty imposes on nuclear powers.
Conspicuously missing from the communique was any mention of either sanctions or incentives designed to persuade India and Pakistan to step back from their nuclear standoff.
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said the communique from the major nuclear powers would not instantly change the behavior of India or Pakistan.
He quoted a Chinese proverb: ``It is up to the one who tied the knot to untie it''.
Tang opened the meeting by saying the nations are united in calling on India and Pakistan to refrain from further nuclear testing and pull back from an incipient arms race.
``Tension in the region is mounting,'' Tang said.
``The permanent members of the (U.N).
Security Council bear important responsibility toward world peace and stability''.
He said the purpose of the meeting was ``to channel our joint efforts to arrest the nuclear arms race in South Asia''.
Albright, who called the meeting at U.N. offices here, met separately with Tang and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov before diplomats from the five powers convened to approve the joint communique on the India-Pakistan crisis.
U.S. officials said a key concern of Albright was making sure the traditional Russian tilt toward India and Chinese support for Pakistan do not prevent the five powers from producing a strong joint statement.
Tang hinted at the Chinese inclination toward Pakistan in his description of the events of the past month.
``In May this year, India, in defiance of world opinion, went ahead with its nuclear tests,'' Tang said.
``After the peace and stability in the South Asian region had been undermined, Pakistan also carried out nuclear tests''.
Despite differing perspectives, the five nations adopted a united stance.
``Pakistan is...
prepared to adhere to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty before this conference,'' Sharif told world leaders at the U.N.
General Assembly session.
``In this regard, we expect that the arbitrary restrictions imposed on Pakistan by multilateral institutions will be speedily removed,'' Sharif said.
``We also expect that discriminatory sanctions against Pakistan will be lifted,'' he said.
But Sharif warned that Pakistan would comply with a ban on nuclear tests only so long as India did the same.
``If India were to resume nuclear testing, Pakistan will review its position,'' Sharif said.
Both India and Pakistan carried out nuclear tests last May, drawing international sanctions and calls to sign the test ban treaty .
ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) --Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif made it clear on Saturday that his country will not give up its nuclear option despite the mounting pressure from some big powers in this regard in the wake of India's nuclear tests.
"We are not seeking any bargains," Sharif said in a written statement issued at a press conference here.
It is the first press conference given by the prime minister since India conducted a series of nuclear tests on May 11 and 13.
"Overt Indian nuclear weaponization has seriously upset the strategic balance in the region and emboldened India to make a naked assertion of her hostile intentions towards Pakistan," the prime minister noted.
"Can the Pakistani nation afford to barter its independence, security and sovereignty?
What is the price for liberty and freedom, dignity and honor"? he asked.
"The talk of sanctions is not only familiar to us but it also does not rattle us.
We have learnt to live with these punitive measures," he said.
"Our legitimate need for security is still being ignored," he said, regretting that discriminatory policies were pursued by the Western world on the nuclear issue towards Pakistan.
"Indian defiance (in nuclear tests) on the other hand has even now attracted some sanctions but more understanding.
Some have even offered endorsement," he said.
"No amount of condemnation or sanctions have changed the immediacy or magnitude of the threat to us.
Practically sanctions mean little and change nothing," he said.
"We believe that the Indian actions have rendered the non-proliferation regime and instruments such as Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty irrelevant," he said.
"What did we earn in exchange of the restraint?
Discriminatory and punitive measures were imposed on us.
In a manifestly unjust and unfair approach Pakistan was penalized for every Indian escalatory step on the nuclear and ballistic ladder," he said.
"The Indian record of aggression and irresponsible behavior is a stark reality for Pakistan.
Our compulsions are not hidden.
The balance of power in the region has been violently tilted," Sharif said.
"Under these circumstances our undivided focus must be on the preservation of our national security interests," he said.
BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland will slash its development aid to India and Pakistan because of the two countries' nuclear tests, the Swiss government said Monday.
Officials in the capital Bern said the aid would be cut by 4-5 million Swiss francs (dlrs 2.6-3.3 million) for the 1998/99 financial year.
The government is to review its development programs in India and Pakistan and won't approve any new projects or credit in the meantime, officials said.
In view of the ``tension which reigns in the Indian sub-continent,'' arms exports to the two countries will also be halted for the time being, officials added.
The Swiss authorities have already condemned the two countries' tests and urged their governments to refrain from further nuclear testing and adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

ISLAMABAD, March 7 (Xinhua) --"Pakistan has nuclear capability, but has decided at the highest level not to use it for non-peaceful purposes," a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman said here today.
Addressing a press conference at the Foreign Office this afternoon, he strongly refuted the report that Pakistan was preparing for a nuclear test.
The Washington Post daily quoted some US officials as saying Wednesday that Pakistan was preparing to conduct its first underground nuclear explosion in Pakistan's Baluchistan province.
"The government of Pakistan has issued a statement on such issue, and I will not add any more to the statement, except to say that Pakistan will take appropriate steps to safeguard its security," said the spokesman.
The statement described the Washington Post's story as "speculative and based on faulty leaked intelligence reports".
"Pakistan has been in the vanguard locally and regionally to advance the cause of nuclear non-proliferation," said the spokesman.
"Our many proposals, including the simultaneous signing of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by India and Pakistan as well as the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia, have fumbled because of India's negativism," he added.
The US government has also criticized India recently for preparing for its second nuclear test.
CARACAS, June 3 (Xinhua) --Members of the Organization of American States (OAS) Wednesday urged India and Pakistan to conduct no more nuclear tests similar to those they carried out last month.
In a resolution passed at the 28th OAS annual meeting, foreign ministers or their representatives from the 34 member states unanimously condemned the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan last month.
The resolution said that the tests not only violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) but also threatened peace and stability in South Asia.
It urged India and Pakistan to sign immediately and unconditionally the NPT and seek peaceful means to settle their differences.
The resolution called for utmost restraint and renouncement of any new nuclear testing plan on the part of the South Asian countries in question.
It also stressed the importance for all countries in the world to sign the NPT and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, as the two pacts are basic factors in preventing nuclear proliferation and promoting nuclear disarmament.
MOSCOW, July 2 (Xinhua) --Russia on Thursday repeated its call to India and Pakistan to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Vladimir Rakhmanin, a spokesman for Russian Foreign Ministry said "Russia insists on immediate and unconditional accession" of India and Pakistan to the treaty, and the revision of their nuclear policies.
Nearly 190 countries have joined the treaty, which took effect in 1970 and was extended indefinitely in 1995, he said.
Russia wanted the pact to be universal.
In a move that sparked global shock and concern, India launched underground nuclear tests on May 11 and 13, and triggered Pakistan to follow suit late that month, despite the risk of bringing about a nuclear arms race in the region.
Despite opposition to the nuclear tests, Russia did not favor sanctions against India and wanted to carry out military cooperation with India if it respected Moscow's line on nuclear disarmament.
"Russia has developed and will continue to develop its military cooperation with India within the framework of international norms and national legislation," Rakhmanin said.
"However, Moscow would obviously watch Delhi's response to Russia's line towards nuclear disarmament," he said.
But Alexei Yablokov, a well known Russian environmental expert, told Interfax the NPT was, in effect, violated by Russia's plan to supply India with nuclear technology.
Russia and India, on June 21, signed a deal supplementing the Soviet-Indian agreement of 1988 on cooperation in construction of a nuclear power station in Kudankulam, said Yablokov.
CAIRO, May 28 (Xinhua) --In reaction to Pakistan's nuclear tests, Egypt Thursday underscored the need to make the Middle East a nuclear-free region and urged Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Meanwhile, Israel said it would be more dangerous if Iran has nuclear weapons.
"If this kind of weapons get into hands of regimes like Iran, the danger of distablization will be ever greater," Israel Radio quoted David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as making a brief reaction to the nuclear tests.
Pakistan detonated five nuclear devices Thursday, which is widely viewed as a response to India's five nuclear tests two weeks ago.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said "This (nuclear test) places the region of South Asia in a special position in view of the presence of two nuclear powers in it".
He said Israel, believed to be the only Mideast country with nuclear capabilities, should join the NPT and otherwise the treaty will become insignificant for the Middle East states.
"Rendering the Middle East a region free from nuclear weapons is now a must for maintaining regional security," he said, stressing that all the states in the region should abide by the treaty.
KUWAIT CITY, August 9 (Xinhua) --Saudi Arabia on Monday renewed its support to efforts in eliminating weapons of mass destruction, especially in the Middle East region, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
Riyadh is "looking forward to seeing the Middle East region free of all kinds of mass destruction weapons," said Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz during a weekly cabinet session he chaired in the country's western city of Jeddah.
He voiced concern at the possession by many countries of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, urging all nations to join the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and open their nuclear facilities to international inspection.
Abdullah's remarks came after Saudi Second Prime Minister and Defense and Aviation Minister Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz denied any Saudi attempts to acquire nuclear weapons from Pakistan or any other country.
In response to a question over his visit to a uranium enrichment plant and a missile factory in Pakistan, Sultan said it did not "exceed the entrances of the sites and did not include secret facilities as reported".
Earlier reports said that British officials were worried that Riyadh might have sought to buy nuclear weapons from Pakistan.
NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An international meeting Thursday on India's nuclear rivalry with neighboring Pakistan likely means that the world's five original nuclear powers will address the main dispute between the two countries: Kashmir.
The meeting of the foreign ministers' of Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States in Geneva is focused on finding ways to stop the escalating South Asian nuclear arms race.
India and Pakistan claimed a total of 11 nuclear tests last month, and both are perfecting missiles to deliver their bombs.
No discussion of the rivalry that has flared into war three times in the last 50 years would be complete without addressing Kashmir, said Athar Hussain, director of the London School of Economics' Asia Research Center.
One-third of the largely Muslim Himalayan territory is held by officially Islamic Pakistan, the rest by predominately Hindu India.
Two of the Indo-Pakistani wars were over Kashmir, which both countries claim.
``If you ask what is the root cause of the current antagonism, I think both sides know that Kashmir is the root cause,'' Hussain said.
Pakistan has long pressed for the Kashmiri dispute to be addressed in an international forum, while India adamantly insists it remain a bilateral issue.
Now, Hussain said, India fears the Geneva talks will focus on Kashmir.
India is worried about being pushed to make concessions, while Pakistan, which is much smaller than India, thinks it's at a disadvantage in one-on-one talks.
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, during a meeting Wednesday with visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, rejected the possibility of international mediation.
Vajpayee repeated calls for bilateral talks with Pakistan.
On Thursday, Vajpayee told Parliament that India would welcome any international initiative on global disarmament, but said focusing on South Asia alone was unfair.
Vajpayee also said India and Pakistan were under ``unwarranted'' pressure to sign a global test ban treaty.
India has long spurned both the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying they are discriminatory because they do not force Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States to give up their nuclear arsenals.
The five foreign secretaries, meeting in Geneva as the permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, were expected to call on India to sign the NPT and the CTBT.
Groups opposed to Indian rule of their Himalayan territory shut down shops and cleared streets of traffic with a general strike in the capital of India's Jammu-Kashmir state Thursday, saying they believe the world was now paying attention to their protests.
``Unless the issue (of Kashmir) is resolved as per the wishes of the people under international principles, peace will not return to the Indian subcontinent,'' said Syed Ali Shah Geelani, whose All Parties Hurriet Conference called the strike in Srinagar city.
The conference is a coalition of parties who want Indian-held Kashmir to break away either to form an independent country or join Pakistan.
India repeatedly accuses Pakistan of arming and training anti-Indian groups in Kashmir, but Pakistan says it lends only moral support.
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) --Politicians from Europe and South America continue to criticize India and Pakistan for conducting nuclear tests, urging the two South Asian countries to abandon plans for future tests.
At a cabinet meeting on Friday, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Italy deplores the 10 nuclear tests India and Pakistan have conducted, asking the two neighbors not to test any more nuclear devices.
Summoning Pakistani Ambassador Arif Ayub on Friday, the Italian Foreign Ministry voiced concerns over the Pakistani tests, adding that India and Pakistan should start talks now and solve conflicts with the help of the international communities.
India set off five underground nuclear devices two weeks ago, igniting global anger.
Pakistan, in response, also exploded five nuclear devices on Thursday, claiming the tests were done for the sake of national security.
The recent nuclear tests in the two countries have caused worldwide concern over the possibility of a new arms race, which could result in dangerous consequences on the South Asian subcontinent.
"The nuclear tests have a direct relationship with the development of nuclear weapons," the Peruvian foreign ministry said in a press release.
"And in consequence, they are a real danger to the stability of the region and to international security".
The press release said it is urgent to stop nuclear testing and create nuclear-free zones.
The Peruvian government noted that universal adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the complete ban on nuclear tests is a guarantee against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and Argentine President Carlos Menem, who is visiting Finland, held a joint press conference Friday.
They expressed firm opposition to the Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests, which have resulted in international sanctions against both New Delhi and Islamabad.
However, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who is also visiting Helsinki, said Moscow does not support sanctions.
Believing that sanctions achieve nothing, Moscow did admit that the nuclear tests have made situations in South Asia explosive.
ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) --Pakistan said Tuesday that it will maintain credible nuclear deterrence to prevent any aggression against it.
"We will act according to our best national security and national interest," Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesman Iftikhar Murshid said at a press conference here while answering a question about reported possible further nuclear tests by India.
"Our nuclear policy is to maintain credible nuclear deterrence, " he added.
In a statement he made on behalf of Pakistan's Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar, the spokesman regretted the position taken by the Sixth Review Conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT) toward the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan in May 1998.
"We did not initiate the induction of weapons capability into the region.
Nor was Pakistan the first to conduct nuclear explosive tests," the statement said.
It accused India's nuclear tests of destabilizing the security environment in South Asia, saying Pakistan's tests "restored the strategic balance".
"Therefore, the distinction between the nuclear ambitions of India and the compulsions of Pakistan must be acknowledged and preserved," it said.
The sixth NPT review conference, which Pakistan "decided not to attend because of the changed nuclear realities in South Asia," ended in New York on May 20.
Pakistan expressed its appreciation of the conference's call for the observance of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), describing it as "a positive contribution to the strengthening of the no-test norm".
"Having voted for the CTBT in 1996 and declared a unilateral moratorium on further tests in 1998, Pakistan will maintain its policy of responsibility and restraint," said the statement.
Neither Pakistan nor India has so far signed the CTBT, which will not gain effect until all the 44 countries concerned sign and ratify it.

Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has slammed the five permanent members of the UN Security Council for their double standards on the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), saying the world body has been sued as an instrument for achieving narrow strategic objectives of some countries.
Describing the NPT as discriminatory, Sharif, in an interview to Emirates News, said some nuclear weapon states have sought to justify their retention of nuclear weapons on the basis of the doctrine of nuclear deterrence, when none of them is threatened, directly or indirectly, in the post cold-war era.
Sharif's comments came a day after the security council condemned the nuclear tests by both India and Pakistan last month asking them to stop testing and sign NPT and CTBT.
Sharif, who is presently in the UAE, also said despite confessing commitment to non-proliferation, the major powers have failed to honour these obligations under the NPT.
Sharif reiterated his offer for the resumption of dialogue process with India and said it is upto India...to agree to a serious, substantive and meaningful dialogue on all outstanding issues, including Kashmir, in accordance with the UN resolutions.
When asked about the possible agenda for such a dialogue, he said agenda has already been finalised while referring to an agreement between India and Pakistan in June last year when eight outstanding issues had been identified.
AFP Adds: Pakistan yesterday rejected the United Nations call to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), saying the security council approach had been ``unjust and unrealistic''.
It also regretted that the security council failed to deal ``adequately'' with its dispute with India over Kashmir which has endangered peace and security in the region.
'The council has ignored the reality on the ground'' a foreign office spokesman here said, after an overnight UN resolution urged India and Pakistan to sign the NPT and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) as non-nuclear states.
'Treaty provisions cannot be enforced on non-parties,'' the spokesman said in a statement, adding that treaty provisions could only be assumed only on a ``voluntary basis''.
'Any attempts at imposition of treaty obligations is by its very nature unequal and unsustainable,'' he added.
Pakistan exploded six nuclear devices last month ``to correct (the) strategic imbalance'' triggered by five underground nuclear tests by its rival India on May 11 and 13.
Pakistan said the explosions were imperative to ensure its security which had been threatened by the Indian action.
The two south Asian neighbours, who have squared off in three wars since independence 50 years ago, with two of them fought over the festering Kashmir problem, earlier refused to join the NPT.
The foreign office spokesman also 'regretted'' that the council resolution did not deal ``adequately and effectively with the urgent and core issues that have endangered peace and security in South Asia.''
CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) --Saudi Arabia called on India and Pakistan to show great self-restraint, saying that nuclear tests conducted by both countries do not serve security and stability in the region, Kuwait News Agency reported Monday.
Saudi Information Minister Fuad Al-Faresi was quoted as saying that his country understood the viewpoint of Pakistani government as to safeguarding its security, but "we still calls on both Pakistan and India to practice self-restraint and resume negotiations to ensure security and stability in South Asia".
Al-Faresi made the remarks in a statement after the weekly cabinet meeting.
He also said his country hopes the international community to avoid double-standard policy which turns a blind eye to Israel's nuclear facilities.
Saudi Arabia supports a full ban of nuclear proliferation and seeks to make the Middle East a region free of mass-destruction weapons, he said.
Pakistan, in response to India's nuclear tests on May 11 and May 13, carried out six nuclear tests last week.
Meanwhile, Iran's Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said on Monday that Tehran is against any nuclear test intended for weapon purposes, but favors civilian use of nuclear energy.
With Russian assistance, Iran is building a nuclear power plant in Bushehr in the south.
This has raised doubt that Tehran may be seeking access to nuclear weapons.
"Iran wants the Middle East and the Persian Gulf to be free from non-conventional weapons," Shamkhani said.
He said Iran supports compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and Comprehensive Test Bank Treaty, but holds that elimination of non-conventional weapons and disarmament of Israel are prerequisites for banning proliferation of nuclear arms.
ISLAMABAD, September 14 (Xinhua) --Pakistan's scientists Dr.
Abdul Qadeer Khan and Dr.
Ishfaq Ahmed said here Monday that no clause of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) will affect Pakistan's nuclear capability.
In a briefing for the members of the two houses of Parliament, the two renowned scientists said there is no need to further nuclear tests at present as Pakistan has achieved its objectives from the tests conducted on May 28 and 30.
"The CTBT cannot take away anything of us that we have achieved as a result of nuclear blasts.
WE can maintain our nuclear capability without conducting more tests," Qadeer said.
He, however, said there would be no cut in the present stock material.
Qadeer said Pakistan maintained its nuclear capability for a long time without conducting test.
"We conducted nuclear tests on May 28 and 30 to convey the message to the world that Pakistan has become a nuclear power," he said.
Asked as to whether Pakistan would open its nuclear installations for inspection after signing the CTBT, Qadeer said, "there is no clause in the Treaty which allows inspection.
The Treaty only bars new tests".
He also said that Pakistan has already announced moratorium on nuclear tests.
VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ India and Pakistan joined the ranks Monday of traditional targets Iraq and North Korea for flaunting nuclear weapons conventions, as the U.N. atomic agency opened its annual conference.
This spring, India and Pakistan conducted a series of nuclear weapons tests that drew international condemnation.
``Japan finds the nuclear tests totally unacceptable as they pose a grave challenge to the international non-proliferation regime and seriously undermines stability in South Asia,'' Yukata Takeyama, chairman of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission, told delegates at the International Atomic Energy Agency conference.
India claimed to have detonated five nuclear devices in May, and Pakistan said it had detonated six devices in response.
The tests triggered fears that the two countries would use nuclear weapons in their dispute over the Himalayan region of Kashmir.
Several governments, including the United States, Japan and the European Union, urged the two to refrain from nuclear weapons testing and to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
As in previous years, Iraq and North Korea also drew criticism for their nuclear policies at the start of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency's weeklong meeting.
Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the IAEA, said his agency's inspection and verification operations have given it insight into Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons programs, but ``a degree of uncertainty remains as to the completeness of this picture''.
In August, Iraq limited IAEA access to declared nuclear sites, preventing the agency from inspecting new sites or investigating the lingering questions about the country's program, ElBaradei said.
U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told a press conference ``Iraq is still in substantial violation of numerous (U.N).
Security Council resolutions.
``The United States, for one, is keeping all options on the table to ensure that Iraq complies,'' with the resolutions, Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, added.
North Korea also was criticized by ElBaradei for failing to cooperate with the IAEA.
In particular, North Korea has not preserved material the IAEA needs to verify the accuracy of information the country has provided on its nuclear program. (scl/rr)
UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to curb the nuclear arms race in South Asia, the Security Council considered a Japanese resolution urging India and Pakistan to halt nuclear weapons programs and denying nuclear status to the two rivals.
India accused the council of overstepping its authority and questioned why the members were tolerating ``the continued retention of nuclear weapons by the nuclear weapons states,'' who are all permanent members of the council.
In a letter to council President Antonio Monteiro, India's U.N. ambassador, Kamalesh Sharma, said the resolution involved ``sovereign decisions taken by member states, not matters in which the council has any role''.
Sharma asked whether the Security Council can ``continue to ignore the overwhelming demand'' of the rest of the world ``for elimination of nuclear weapons'' when the most important council members refuse to dismantle their own arsenals.
The draft resolution urges both countries to halt the development of missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads and calls on them to sign nuclear arms control treaties.
It also asks India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and find ``mutually acceptable solutions'' to the ``root causes of those tensions, including Kashmir''.
Japan pushed for quick council action on the resolution as a followup to Thursday's meeting in Geneva of foreign ministers of the five longtime nuclear states _ the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China.
Following the Geneva meeting, the five _ also permanent members of the council _ condemned Indian and Pakistani tests and pledged to cooperate closely ``to prevent a ``nuclear and missile arms race in the subcontinent''.
Council diplomats continued closed-door consultations late Friday trying to work out language acceptable to all 15 members _ especially the 10 non-permanent members who were not represented at the Geneva meeting.
It was unclear whether the resolution, co-sponsored by Sweden and Costa Rica, would be put to a vote Friday night or possibly Saturday.
The draft resolution repeated the position of the five that although India and Pakistan have exploded nuclear devices, they would not be accorded status as nuclear states.
Under the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the five countries were the only ones allowed to maintain nuclear arsenals.
India and Pakistan have refused to sign the treaty, pointing to that exemption as unfair.
The Japanese resolution also welcomed an offer by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to encourage India and Pakistan to resume a high-level dialogue which broke down last year because of differences over Kashmir.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 _ two of them Kashmir which is divided between them.
The resolution also ``encourages'' member states to prevent the export of materials, equipment and technology ``that could in any way assist programs in India or Pakistan for nuclear weapons.''
MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) --Russia does not see India and Pakistan as nuclear club members though they conducted a series of nuclear tests, Russian Foreign Ministry stated on Wednesday.
The Interfax news agency quoted the Ministry's spokesman Valery Nesterushkin as saying that "Despite the series of nuclear tests conducted by India and pakistan, Russia views them as states that do not possess nuclear weapons".
The spokesman said, "It is precisely in this capacity that we urge these countries to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty".
In accordance with the treaty, a country is considered a nuclear state if it had produced and tested a nuclear weapon or another nuclear device by January 1, 1967, Nesterushkin said.
Meanwhile, in experts' opinion, neither Pakistan nor India has done everything necessary to convert nuclear devices to warheads and place them on delivery vehicles.
On the meeting of foreign ministers of the five nuclear powers (Russia, the United States, France, Britain, and China) in Geneva on Thursday, the spokesman said, "the basic goal of the meeting is to coordinate positions and find approaches that would conduce Delhi and Islamabad to stop further development of their nuclear programs and join the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) --Some countries or international organizations expressed concerns after Pakistan exploded five nuclear devices on Thursday in response to the nuclear tests carried out by India on May 11 and 13.
The United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Thursday he deplores both the Indian and the Pakistani nuclear tests.
"They (India and Pakistan) exacerbate tension in an already difficult relations," he said in a statement.
Annan's statement came after Pakistan announced it has conducted five nuclear explosions at 3:30 pm.
local time (1030 GMT) Thursday in Chagai area in the southwestern province of Baluchistan.
Annan called on both Indian and Pakistani governments to freeze their nuclear weapons development programs and sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and a no-first-use pledge with each other.
In Luxembourg, Javier Solana, secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), said the alliance would urge India and Pakistan to exercise maximum restraint and to respect the international non-proliferation norms and the CTBT.
Solana said the NATO does not consider sanctions against the nuclear testers.
The NATO chief said the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan would not "dramatically" affect the thinking of the new strategic concept of the alliance.
The United States President Bill Clinton announced in a televised statement Thursday that the United States would impose sanctions on Pakistan as it did on India.
Clinton expressed the fear that Pakistan's nuclear tests might lead to escalation of tension in South Asia.
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien called on Pakistan and India to renounce their nuclear weapons programs and to sign on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the CTBT.
He also urged the two arch-rivals to renew regional dialogue and work towards a peaceful resolution of differences.
Chretien announced his country's relations with Pakistan would now be placed on hold and that further measures would be announced in light of the development in both India and Pakistan.
My late father often entertained cops at his secondhand store on the west side of Chicago.
They popped in to make sure he wasn't peddling stolen goods.
When they left, Daddy didn't go with them, so I assume he was clean, or at least very clever.
If he'd been busted, I somehow doubt that any major corporations would have come to his defense.
But some purveyors of stolen goods have friends in high places.
Just look at who's going to bat for Napster, the Internet music-swapping company.
At the behest of the recording industry, US District Judge Marilyn Patel last month issued a sweeping injunction against Napster, where millions of music lovers swap digital copies of their favorite tunes without paying for them.
Essentially, Patel agreed with music industry executives _ and me _ that Napster's primary business is the facilitation of thievery.
She ordered Napster to stop its users from trafficking in copyrighted music.
An Appeals Court stayed Patel's order, giving Napster's stunned legal team an opportunity to recoup.
Meanwhile, an extraordinary group of Napster sympathizers has begun to rally around the company.
The Association of American Physicians &AMP; Surgeons has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, along with Eagle Forum, a conservative group best known for its successful campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment.
Both groups say the Napster injunction menaces the free exchange of ideas over the Internet.
They warn that corporations may use the Napster ruling to limit online criticism of their products.
``What if the owner of (the drug) Ritalin asserted its intellectual property rights, and demanded that Yahoo only provide authorized links on Ritalin''? this brief thunders.
``The outcome would be that criticism of the use of Ritalin would be effectively silenced''.
But the record companies aren't complaining about people who post scathing reviews of the new Metallica album.
They're upset about people stealing it, with the help of a company founded to facilitate such theft.
Consider the following quote from a Napster official: ``We are not just making pirated music available, but pushing demand''.
A rather more serious objection to Patel's ruling comes from a powerful coalition of technology firms _ the Consumer Electronics Association, the Digital Future Coalition, and the Computer &AMP; Communications Industry Association.
Among them, these three groups represent most of the world's biggest providers of computer hardware and software, home electronics gear, and Internet services.
Peter Jaszi, a law professor at American University, helped write this amicus brief.
It doesn't exactly amount to a ringing defense of Napster _ ``The brief certainly doesn't say that Napster should win or Napster should lose,'' Jaszi insists.
Still, their argument takes aim at the heart of Patel's ruling, by making a point with a good deal of merit.
``When there are technologies that have multiple uses, some obviously good and some perhaps bad, copyright law ought not to be a means for stamping out those technologies,'' Jaszi argues.
Imagine what would have happened in the early 1980s if the movie studios had succeeded in halting the sale of video cassette recorders?
In 1981, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios sued Sony Corp.
for mass producing its Betamax home video recorders.
The Betamax machines were a license to steal, the movie moguls alleged.
People would launch a trade in illegally copied movie and TV programs that would cost the studios billions.
There was only one solution _ ban Betamax.
Believe it or not, a federal Appeals Court agreed.
Fortunately, the US Supreme Court stepped in.
In 1984, the court ruled that even if VCRs could be used to steal the studios' intellectual property, the devices also had many legitimate uses.
It would therefore be foolish to ban the technology altogether, merely to prevent its abuse.
It's a telling argument that suffers from a single flaw _ Patel didn't try to ban Napster.
Her ruling leaves the company free to offer its service to those who trade in legal copies of digital music.
The fact that this restriction threatens the company's doom tells you all you need to know.
It's a tacit admission of the obvious _ the Napster business model is all about trading in stolen goods.
Yes, I know that Napster alternatives like Gnutella and Freenet ensure that the music thefts will continue.
But that doesn't change the fact that Napster has been well and truly busted, for forgetting something I learned at my father's knee _ dealers in hot merchandise generally get burned.

SAN FRANCISCO _ The battle over music in cyberspace spilled onto the streets of San Mateo, Calif.
, Wednesday as Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich jawed with fans of Napster, the popular and controversial music-sharing software.
The leader of the well-known heavy metal band showed up at the Fourth Street headquarters of Napster Inc.
to deliver the names of 335,435 Napster users who made 1.45 million Metallica songs available for free downloads last weekend.
But while Ulrich spoke to the assembled throng of reporters and photographers about Metallica's request to have Napster cut off those users, he was constantly heckled by irked Metallica fans who shouted ``Long live Napster'' and ``We just want to hear the music''.
At one point during the media event orchestrated by Metallica, Ulrich debated with a Napster fan.
And after Ulrich left, a longtime Metallica fan named Tony smashed his collection of Metallica CDs and tossed the plastic slivers on the ground in protest.
``Why can't we listen to their music on the Internet''? asked the 36-year-old San Francisco resident, who didn't want his last name used for fear of being hounded by Metallica's lawyers.
Metallica, which is suing Napster for copyright infringement, is seeking $10 million in damages.
On one side of the controversy are artists like Metallica, who believe that upstarts like Napster are robbing them of royalties and their livelihoods.
On the other side are fans, who say the greedy artists and record companies are trying to rob them of their ability to enjoy a new way of listening to music.
Meanwhile, Napster, which portrays itself as being in the middle, issued a statement after the event, saying the company will review the 13 boxes of paper printouts delivered on handcarts by Ulrich and attorney Howard E.
King. ``If the claims are submitted properly, the company will take the appropriate actions to disable the users Metallica has identified,'' Napster attorney Laurence Pulgram said in a statement.
``Of course, if the band would provide the names in computerized form rather than in tens of thousands of pages of paper intended to create a photo opp, that would expedite the process,'' Pulgram said.
Pulgram also noted that Napster has no way to block specific artists or titles from being traded, so ``the upshot of Metallica's notice may be to prevent its fans from using Napster at all'' for any music.
Napster's only product is a free computer program that allows fans to freely swap via the Internet copies of songs converted into the MP3 compression format.
Metallica and rap artist Dr.
Dre have filed separate civil suits claiming the software violates copyright laws, but Napster says it is legally protected under a provision of the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act because it has no control over its users' actions.
A British online consulting company hired by Metallica monitored Napster use from April 28 to April 30 and identified the 335,435 Napster users, along with the group's songs available for free download.
The song ``Nothing Else Matters'' topped the Metallica hit list with 116,574 copies posted by 73,772 users.
The Napster members were identified by their user names, which they gave Napster when they registered to download the program, along with the location of the song on their hard drives and their numerical Internet Protocol address.
Napster users noted that even if they were denied access by Napster, they could easily reregister under a new user name.
Metallica lawyers said it would be up to Napster to stop offenders from reregistering.
But Ulrich stressed that the band had no intention of hunting down and prosecuting any individual Napster users.
``This is not between Metallica and its fans,'' Ulrich said.
``This is between Metallica and Napster, let there be no question about that''.
And, he said, ``If we lose a bunch of fans over this, and we will, that doesn't discourage us from doing what we feel is right''.
Still, Ulrich, who has never visited Napster's Web site and admitted he ``can barely get on AOL,'' criticized the actions of Napster users as immoral.
``If they want to steal Metallica's music, instead of hiding behind their computers in their bedrooms and dorm rooms, then just go down to Tower Records and grab them off the shelves,'' Ulrich said.
Ulrich said he isn't opposed to online music, but said, ``We want online music to be on our conditions''.
That didn't sit well with Roman Dzindzichashvili, a 54-year-old Napster user who drove from his Sausalito, Calif.
, home to give Ulrich a piece of his mind.
``This is ridiculous, this is very obnoxious and this is very selfish,'' said Dzindzichashvili, who said Napster has not stopped him from buying CDs.
Metallica's suit has ired other fans around the country.
Randy Grant, a Napster user from UCLA, said he doesn't understand why Metallica seems bent on angering his fellow ``Napsterians''.
``This whole issue reeks of greed and fear to me, but I am not so sure who are the greedy and scared ones _ Metallica, or the huge and powerful industry which they are a part of,'' Grant wrote in an e-mail.
Local copyright law expert Eric Doney believes Napster will ultimately lose in court because the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was not designed to allow the type of music sharing promoted by Napster.
``I don't think they have a prayer,'' said Doney, an attorney with Donahue, Gallagher, Woods &AMP; Wood in Oakland, Calif.
He also said the fact that Metallica was able to compile a list of alleged offenders means individual Napster users could have something to worry about.
``If Metallica or anyone else who is being infringed wanted to start picking people off to make an example of them, they could,'' Doney said.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --Thousands of Metallica fans booted by online music sharing software company Napster Inc.
for allegedly swapping the heavy metal band's music want their access reinstated.
Napster said Tuesday it received notice from more than 30,000 MusicShare software users claiming they were misidentified as persons illegally trading Metallica's copyrighted songs in the popular MP3 digital format.
If Metallica does not take legal action against individual users within 10 days of Tuesday's notice, Napster will restore those blocked accounts, citing federal copyright law.
Napster has begun forwarding those petitions to Metallica's attorney, who disputed their claims.
''They're (the users) absolutely lying.
There's no question that they're lying,'' said attorney Howard King.
''Each and every one of them was offering Metallica MP3s for uploads''.
Metallica sued the company last month for copyright infringement and racketeering, alleging that Napster's software encouraged users to freely trade the band's songs without permission.
Metallica compiled 317,377 Napster usernames they allege were trading the band's tunes.
The band's drummer, Lars Ulrich, hand-delivered the list of usernames to Napster headquarters in San Mateo two weeks ago.
Napster responded by blocking access to those listed, but it also posted information on its Web site telling users how to file a counter notification if they felt they had been misidentified.
''The fact that so many people have come forward and disputed Metallica's accusation that they did not break the law demonstrates that this is not a black and white issue,'' Napster's 19-year-old founder Shawn Fanning said in a statement.
Meanwhile, Metallica's attorney said he expects another client, rap artist Dr.
Dre, to notify Napster on Wednesday of more than 200,000 users who illegally traded his music.
----- On the Net: http://www.napster.com http://www.elektra.com/retro/metallica/index.html
WASHINGTON _ Celebrity and politics collided Tuesday on Capitol Hill, as a rock musician joined online music executives and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss the effects on the recording industry of downloading music from the Internet.
Lars Ulrich, the drummer for the heavy-metal band Metallica, found what may have been an unexpected ally in Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and chairman of the committee.
``Fair and reasonable licensing needs to take place; that is what I'm hearing,'' Hatch said at the conclusion of a three-hour hearing.
The meeting room was packed with young spectators, spilling into the hallway of the Hart Senate Building.
Hundreds lined up to get a view of Ulrich, or perhaps to gain some insight into the clash between the recording industry and online music outlets.
The Recording Industry Association of America, which represents major record labels, and several music groups have argued that software created by the online music start-up Napster permits individuals to steal copyrighted material.
Officials for the service, and their fans, contend that it simply allows for easy sharing and sampling of music.
To use the Napster service, which is free, users download software over the Internet that allows them to store and catalog their music on their own computers.
Napster posts those catalogs, and then enables users of the service to visit one another's computers over the Internet and share and download one another's music.
Ulrich said that ``if music is free for downloading, the music industry is not viable''.
Napster, he said, had ``hijacked'' his music.
``Like a carpenter who crafts a table gets to decide whether to keep it, sell it or give it away, shouldn't we have the same options''? he asked.
In April, Metallica and the rapper Dr.
Dre sued Napster for copyright infringement.
A federal judge in Manhattan ruled this spring that another online music database, MP3.com, had violated copyright laws; the company has since settled with two labels.
But Congress has been reluctant to interfere in the private marketplace.
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
, the ranking minority member of the committee, said the intellectual property generated in the United States was ``the envy of the world''.
Leahy, who kept an open laptop computer in front of him throughout the hearing, noted that millions of young voters are paying close attention to the debate on intellectual property and the need for certain safeguards.
``History has shown that when new technologies emerge, they may initially seem to threaten to trump intellectual property protection,'' Leahy said.
``In the end, things get sorted out''.
But Leahy said that it is important both to ``protect the legitimate right'' of artists and to reward them for their work.
Hank Barry, the chief executive of Napster, based in San Mateo, Calif.
, said the company's Web site had attracted nearly 20 million users.
And he said that Napster was helping, not hurting the recording industry.
People are buying more records, he said, because they are able to sample and preview music before buying.
``Companies that hold copyrights on behalf of creators, and which control distribution of creative works, have a strong inclination to change copyright law from a balanced vehicle for public enrichment to an unbalanced engine of control,'' he said.
Barry said copyright holders were often reluctant to allow new technologies to emerge.
But, he said, innovations like radio, television, the cassette player and the videocassette recorder have ``proved to be a financial boon to these same concerned copyright holders''.
Rather than legislation from Congress, Barry called for a ``market-based solution that will benefit consumers''.
Others who testified Tuesday agreed.
Fred Ehrlich, president of new technology for Sony Music Entertainment, a unit of Sony Corp.
, said the ``private market will set itself right''.
Gene Hoffman Jr.
, president of Emusic.com, which charges and pays royalties to artists for recordings on the Internet, said that the government should strive to be more effective in enforcing current copyright laws.
And Roger McGuinn, of the folk-rock group the Byrds, said the issue was ``a lot of worrying about nothing''.
Ulrich, however, remained steadfast on legislative intervention.
``I think we're dreaming if you think we can work this out ourselves,'' he said.
``The differences are too deep on too many levels''.
As the debate entered the Senate, a group called Artists Against Piracy ran full-page advertisements Tuesday in several major newspapers.
The coalition supports the stance taken by Ulrich and members of Metallica in favor of protecting intellectual property rights.
Corporate donors to the group include the National Association of Recording Merchandisers, the Recording Industry Association of America and Walt Disney Co.
In February, when Texas Christian University administrators decided to block their Web-surfing students from entering a site called Napster, they did so because the site was causing the campus' computers to slow down.
So many students were logging onto Napster to download MP3 files _ electronic versions of songs _ that the computer's server kept crashing.
Upgraded hardware was eventually installed, lessening the problem, but the Napster music-community site remains off-limits to students.
``If we were to turn Napster back on, it wouldn't be a (computer) problem,'' says Dave Edmondson, assistant provost for the school's information service department.
``Now it's a copyright problem''.
And, apparently, a very big one.
For the past several months, the controversy swirling around the San Mateo, Calif.-based Napster and whether it infringes on copyright laws has been the hot topic in the music industry.
Bands, record labels and music lovers are divided on the subject.
Napster supporters, such as Public Enemy singer Chuck D, champion the site for offering artists without major-label deals or radio play a chance to get heard.
``This is the radio of the new millennium,'' the vocalist said during an interview this year at the South by Southwest music and media conference in Austin.
``So many artists don't get a chance to be on the radio or MTV, or be on a major label.
This is how they get heard.
Why would you wanna deny them that''?
For young people like Jennifer Cooper, an 18-year-old TCU freshman, it's a dream come true.
``I've stopped buying CDs now because of Napster and MP3s,'' she says.
``Who wants to pay for music when you can get it for free''?
Napster critics say, however, that the site breaks copyright laws.
When users download songs onto either their hard drive or a CD, they get the song, but the artist doesn't get any money.
Critics liken it to walking into a music store and stealing a record.
That's why artists such as Metallica, which sued Napster in April, and rap star Dr.
Dre have started a campaign against Napster.
Metallica's suit has gone to extremes: The group members recently delivered to the court the names of 335,000 people whom the band accuses of illegally obtaining its songs through the site.
Band drummer Lars Ulrich personally wheeled in the 60,000 pages of text.
The group released a statement saying the alleged violations of its music were logged by a computer consulting firm, NetPD.
Through various chat rooms and message boards, an ever-growing circle of Metallica fans has trashed the band's legal actions.
On Napster's Web site, one fan wrote that the name of one of the band's CDs, Master of Puppets, perfectly epitomized the metal group.
``This is not about Metallica versus the Internet,'' Ulrich said in a statement on the band's Web site.
``We know that the Internet is the future in terms of spreading your music to your fans, and we're excited about that.
But we want to control how that's done, just like we've always controlled what we make''.
Napster officials say the company isn't breaking the law because it does not directly provide the copyrighted music, just a way to get it.
``I'm a huge Metallica fan and therefore really sorry that they're going in this direction,'' Napster's founder, 19-year-old Shawn Fanning, said in a statement.
``If we got the opportunity to explain to the band why Napster exists and why fans enjoy Napster, perhaps we could bring all of this to a peaceful conclusion''.
Napster spokeswoman Deborah Orr estimates the number of people using Napster totals in the millions.
Users simply log onto Napster's site, do a search for a particular song and, when they find another user who has it, trade one of their tracks for the one they want.
With the click of a mouse, the songs are either stored on the computer's hard drives or transferred to CD via CD burners.
Something else that's troubling the music industry: Sometimes, Napster users get hold of material that hasn't been released.
``I was talking to a friend and said, `Hey, you wanna copy of our new record'''?
Matchbox Twenty singer Rob Thomas said in a recent phone interview.
``And he was like, `Well, I've already heard half of it'.
He got it all off the Internet''.
Thomas is ambivalent about Napster.
``If you're in a band that hasn't been as fortunate as us, that's who it's good for.
It gives them a chance to get heard,'' Thomas says.
``But for bands like us, it's like people are hearing our stuff but we're not getting paid''.
Fred Durst of the immensely popular rap-metal act Limp Bizkit, whose upcoming tour is being sponsored by Napster, says Napster's the wave of the future, and his band's gonna ride it.
``We could (not) care less about the older generation's need to keep doing business as usual,'' he said at a news conference announcing the launch of the tour, which will roll into the Bronco Bowl in Dallas on July 22-23.
``We care more about what our fans want, and our fans want music on the Internet''.
The battle will rage for months, until it is decided in the courts.
In the meantime, Napster is still up and running _ although TCU has banned it _ and Cooper says she will keep downloading songs wherever she can.
``Yeah, sure, it's not fair that they're (the artists) not making any money off of it,'' she says.
``But it's not like the music industry is morally right in the first place.
I'm sorry, but I don't agree with having to pay $18 for a new CD''.

SAN FRANCISCO _ Napster Inc.
appointed a new chief executive and received key financial backing Monday even as a political think tank recommended tighter copyright laws to combat illegal swapping of online music.
The San Mateo, Calif.
, startup plans to expand its workforce and office space now that it has closed a $15 million round of venture funding led by noted San Francisco investment firm Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, along with money from Angel Investors LP.
Hummer Winblad partner Hank Barry, a onetime legal counsel for major media companies like Disney Online and A&AMP;M Records, will become Napster's interim CEO.
He replaces Eileen Richardson, a Boston area investor who became Napster's interim CEO when the company started nine months ago.
She only intended to stay long enough to find a permanent boss.
Both Barry, a former partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif.
, and Hummer Winblad partner John Hummer also joined Napster's board of directors.
Barry was unavailable for immediate comment.
But in a news release, he cited a poll released last week that showed more than 70 percent of college students already use Napster, and nearly 20 percent use it daily, even though the company has yet to release a final version of the program.
``With over 10 million registered users within its first nine months, Napster's file-sharing application has become the most rapidly adopted technology in the history of the Internet,'' Barry said.
Napster's software allows music fans to easily share their MP3 music files through the Internet.
According to online and software ratings firm Media Metrix Inc.
, Napster was ``virtually nonexistent'' in February, but by March had 2.5 million unique users.
Napster's loyal fans say the program helps promote new music and new artists, but the recording industry and two artists, Metallica and Dr.
Dre, sued Napster, claiming the program is nothing but a tool for music piracy.
Earlier this month, Napster blocked more than 300,000 users identified by Metallica as people who were offering illegal copies of the heavy metal band's songs.
More than 30,000 have applied for reinstatement.
Last week, Metallica quietly delivered a new list of 332,293 Napster members that the band wants blocked.
Napster spokesman Dan Wool said the company has not made a decision on blocking members on the newest Metallica hit list or another list from Dr.
Dre naming 239,612 Napster members.
The Napster debate has also entered the political arena.
The moderate Democratic party think tank Progressive Policy Institute issued a report Monday calling for Congress to tighten the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act to hold Napster and similar technology companies more accountable for copyright infringement.
``We think Napster is an innovative technology, but we should use that technology in legal ways,'' said Robert Atkinson, co-author of the report ``Napster and Online Piracy''.
The report recommends that Congress change the DMCA to require Internet-based services like Napster to obtain ``identifiable and verifiable'' information about their users to help track down copyright violators.
Napster members can sign on anonymously.
The report also said the DMCA needs to have more specific timetables for taking down copyright violators because it now gives Napster and similar services ``no incentive to act in a timely fashion''.
The report suggests that judges be allowed more flexibility to grant injunctions.
``It may be impossible to write a law that accounts for all future technological innovation, but a judge will know a pirate's den when he or she sees it,'' the report said.
The institute will present the paper at a House Small-Business Committee hearing scheduled for tomorrow to examine Internet music technologies, but Atkinson admitted he does not expect Congress to act anytime in the next several months.

NEW YORK (AP) --The music industry has some fresh ammunition in its effort to prove that Internet swapping of free music files has cut into music sales.
A study released Wednesday showed that sales of recorded music near college campuses declined by 4 percent between the first three months of 1998 and the same period this year.
Sales at all stores went up 12 percent during the same time.
''The findings come as no surprise and confirm our worst fears,'' said Amy Weiss, spokeswoman for the Recording Industry Association of America.
''This demonstrates the importance of protecting artists' rights on the Internet''.
Dozens of colleges have banned the use of Napster, the leading service that allows people to download music files for free from the Internet, after heavy use clogged their computer systems.
The RIAA and the rock band Metallica have both sued Napster, alleging the company's software allows computer users to trade copyrighted music online without permission.
The study was commissioned by Reciprocal Inc.
, a digital rights management company, and uses figures from Soundscan, the company that measures music purchases.
It is the most extensive attempt to try to document whether downloading affects sales.
''I think it's clear that it has had an impact,'' said Michael Fine, Soundscan's chief executive.
He said it's hard to quantify how much potential revenue music companies may have lost because of downloading.
Representatives from Napster and Scour.net, another company that locates audio files on the Web, had no immediate comment on the study.
Other factors may have cut into music sales near college campuses, including the growing popularity of devices that make CD copies, Fine said.
The music business has been dominated in the past two years by Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, artists who appeal to a younger audience.
Yet Reciprocal found that the sales decline was even steeper --more than 7 percent -- when it studied outlets within five miles of the 67 colleges that had banned Napster by late February.
Sales at stores near colleges jumped by 12 percent between 1997 and 1998, before beginning a slide that coincided with the booming popularity of Napster, Reciprocal said.

NEW HAVEN, Conn.
(AP) --The heavy metal band Metallica on Wednesday dropped legal action against Yale University after the school agreed to block access from their computer network to an Internet site that allows people to trade copyrighted music.
Yale blocked access to the Napster site last week after Metallica filed a lawsuit against the school, two other universities and California-based Napster, which makes the popular Internet music sharing software.
In a written statement Wednesday, the band said it would drop Yale as a defendant.
''We appreciate the prompt and responsible reaction by Yale University in dealing with the gross violations of copyright laws and the protection of intellectual property,'' the band said in a written statement.
''We thank them for their quick response to the matter''.
Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said that some months ago Yale blocked access to the Napster Web site during business hours in an effort to relieve congestion on the school's network.
In February, the school ''alerted'' students to federal copyright laws as they applied to Napster, he said.
''Then, at the time of the lawsuit, we notified students that we were blocking access to Napster continuously, until we could clarify the legal issues surrounding Napster,'' he said.
The Napster software program allows Internet users to search for and download music directly from each others' computer hard drives.
The music is stored in a digital format known as MP3.
In their lawsuit, Metallica alleged Yale, the University of Southern California and Indiana University allowed free trade of copyrighted songs to flourish by failing to block access to the Napster sharing program, thereby violating the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
The band filed the lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in Los Angeles on April 13.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --Heavy metal rock band Metallica has accused three universities and the makers of a popular Internet music sharing software of copyright infringement and racketeering.
The federal lawsuit contends San Mateo, Calif.-based Napster Inc.
, the University of Southern California, Yale University and Indiana University encouraged users of Napster software to trade copyrighted material without the band's permission.
''We take our craft --whether it be the music, the lyrics, or the photos and artwork very seriously, as do most artists,'' Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich said in a statement on the Elektra Records Web site.
''It is therefore sickening to know that our art is being traded like a commodity rather than the art that it is''.
The Napster software program allows Internet users to search for and download music directly from each others' computer hard drives.
The music is stored in a digital format known as MP3.
Metallica alleges the universities allowed free trade of copyrighted songs to flourish by failing to block access to the Napster sharing program, thereby violating the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
The San Francisco-based band filed the lawsuit in U.S.
District Court in Los Angeles on Thursday.
''We regret that the band's management saw fit to issue a press release --and to file a lawsuit -- without even attempting to contact Napster,'' said Eileen Richardson, the company's chief executive officer.
''But if these people insist on turning it over to lawyers, we'll defend the case on that turf''.
Napster also has been sued by the Recording Industry Association of America in federal court in San Francisco.
The trade group, which represents major recording labels, alleged copyright infringement by Napster and is seeking $100,000 for each song traded using Napster software.
Calls to Yale and USC were not immediately returned.
A spokesman for Indiana University said lawyers for the university had not seen the lawsuit.
At least seven universities are known to have blocked access to Napster because its use by students downloading audio files have slowed their computer networks to a crawl.

SAN MATEO, Calif.
_ Unable to party, unable to date, unable to do much of anything but work and then work out in the wee hours, Shawn Fanning contemplated the pickup line for a full five seconds.
``Hi, I'm Napster''.
``Nah, ya think''? he asked, blushing although no girls were in the room.
He considered the line some more.
The blush deepened.
Suddenly seeming all of 19, which he is, the confidence that led Fanning to take on the entire music industry crumpled along with the square of paper in his hand on which the line was written.
``You know, it's funny, but I would never say it because everything is Napster right now,'' Fanning said.
``I can't go back home or go out without hearing about it.
It's neat but. . . ``OK, maybe I would use it,'' he relented at last.
``But I have a pretty shy personality.
I don't know.
It's hard to say''.
Fanning may have trouble invoking his middle-school nickname to his advantage, but it's on the lips of teenagers, college students, and record industry executives everywhere.
Napster is what Fanning dubbed the music file-sharing software he developed in his first semester at Northeastern University.
He never had a second.
Instead, he opted to become that high-tech hybrid: not quite man, not quite boy, out to make his mark and his millions before he is old enough to drink legally at one of the raves he wishes he had time to attend.
So far, despite $15 million in venture-capital funding, what he's earned mostly is adulation and notoriety in the combative arena of online music distribution.
Napster _ the computer application, not the admittedly lousy guitarist _ makes it easy to copy music files stored on the hard drives of other users.
More than 10 million people have signed up for it since its launched last August.
Just type in the name of just about any song and there it is, available for downloading in the digital-file format known as MP3.
For now, the most popular of the music-swapping services is free.
No money changes hands, not between user and Napster Inc.
, and not between the site and the major record labels that are panicked about a distribution system they didn't see coming and are suing to stop.
On Friday, the labels appeared to be coming to terms with online music, with two companies settling their lawsuits against digital music service MP3.com.
Fanning hasn't profited yet, either.
He figures he'd likely earn more, at least in the short term, as a programmer at any established computer company.
Nights _ well past midnight, actually _ he returns to the spartan $1,800-a-month, two-bedroom apartment he shares with Napster cofounder Sean Parker, 20; three other programmers crash on the floor.
Fanning said he has no plans to live large, not yet.
His one indulgence was a second, souped-up Mazda, and that feels so extravagant he may sell it.
``No one gave me $15 million personally,'' Fanning said.
``I try not to even think about it.
Things are so volatile right now, so many things going on, so many fires to fight every day, not just technically but in other ways''.
He was alluding to Napster Inc.'s battle to be the middleman between music fans and music makers, a subject his team of attorneys has warned him to keep quiet about in the midst of all the lawsuits.
Some bands, such as the Smashing Pumpkins and Hole, say the Napster program is democratizing the music business and are cheering Fanning on.
Others, such as rapper Dr.
Dre and the heavy-metal rockers Metallica, liken what it does to piracy.
The controversy was dramatized to great effect last month, when a van pulled up to the bland building Napster occupies in downtown San Mateo and dumped a dozen or so boxes of paperwork on the doorstep.
Inside: the names of 300,000 people the band Metallica wanted booted from the service for copyright infringement.
Upstairs, Fanning was dismayed at the ultimatum, even as he longed to meet Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich, one of his musical heroes.
Still, he complied immediately.
Almost as fast, many users figured out how to get back on the server.
For its part, Napster says it's not responsible if people use its service to steal music and violate copyright law.
``I don't know Shawn Fanning, but he seems to be a pretty good kid who came up with a sensational program,'' said Howard King, the Los Angeles lawyer suing Napster on behalf of Metallica and Dr.
Dre. ``But the sensational program has allowed people to take music without paying.
. . . Shawn probably had no idea of the legal ramifications of what he created.
I'm sure the thought never crossed his mind''.
&QL; &QL; Bored at Northeastern &QL; &QL; Back in his dorm room at Northeastern, Fanning was bored.
He'd barely been online for three years, but already he considered the introductory computer science classes he was taking beneath his skill level.
As he put it, ``I was partying all the time.
I was having a lot of fun.
But I wasn't really learning anything''.
After all, the self-taught programmer had already had several computer-related jobs, helping a company develop software, starting a computer-security service he described as ``kind of a joke,'' interning summers at his uncle's Internet games company.
The latter job earned him a dark blue BMW Z3 as partial payment for his services _ his first car and one that both elated and embarrassed a boy who had never had any extras.
Fanning grew up in Brockton, Mass and assorted Cape Cod towns before settling in HarwichPort, the son of a nurse's aide who got pregnant when she was younger than he is now and the stepson of a truck driver.
His biological father came from a wealthy Massachusetts family, and the two have recently established a relationship that Fanning would prefer to keep private.
His own family, including four younger stepbrothers and stepsisters, spent time on welfare, a subject that still makes Fanning visibly uncomfortable.
So do the months he spent in a foster home when his parents had no money and lost their home.
Despite the expectations others have of him, and that he has for himself, Fanning still tastes the sting of where he came from more than the sweetness of where he might be headed.
``When Shawn had to go into a foster home, I told him that I had talked to my wife and we only had a small apartment, but he could come live with us,'' said his uncle, John Fanning.
``He was just a kid, 12 or 13, but he said, `I guess I've always known that was an option for me, but to tell you the truth there's no way I can leave my brothers or sisters'.
Right then, it showed you the sort of responsibility he feels.
I think a lot of his drive comes from wanting to be someone who can improve the conditions for his family''.
But what drove him to dream up Napster in the fall of 1998 _ with the help of his uncle's advice and later his seed money _ was more immediate.
His roommate was into downloading digital music and was constantly complaining about the inconsistent quality and the inadequacy of the search engines available.
Fanning decided he was the teenager to do something about it.
So he bought a Windows programming book, and went to work, seeking feedback on Internet Relay Chat, an online hangout popular with computerphiles of all ages.
That's where he met Parker and Jordan Ritter, who worked for a Boston security firm before becoming another Napster cofounder.
For the self-described obsessive personality, classes soon took a back seat to building what would become Napster, a nickname that childhood friends said the closely cropped Fanning earned one day on the basketball court when another player commented on his sweaty head.
As news of the Napster application spread by word of mouth _ and across the Net _ it quickly became the hot program on college campuses nationwide.
&UR; MORE &LR; &QC;
SAN FRANCISCO _ The lawyer representing Metallica and Dr.
Dre in lawsuits against Napster Inc.
has asked Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley and more than two-dozen other colleges to ``promptly ban'' the popular file sharing program.
Los Angeles attorney Howard E.
King sent letters to the universities this week after reading a San Francisco Chronicle story that said most colleges were not restricting student use of Napster, which he said allows ``piracy on a massive scale''.
``I expect some universities will take this opportunity to have a discussion of the issue,'' King said Friday.
``There's been a lot of public discussion about the morality and the legality of Napster.
I think colleges, being the hotbed of Napster activity, are the appropriate place to have that discussion''.
King gave the universities about two weeks to respond but said he is not threatening legal action.
``Even without the threat of litigation from artists and other copyright owners, I believe that you can easily recognize the irony of encouraging your students to matriculate in the creative arts while engaging in behavior which, if unchecked, will make it impossible for those students to earn an income from their future creative efforts,'' King wrote in a letter to Harvard University President Neil L.
Rudenstine. Still, the pending copyright infringement lawsuits Metallica and Dr.
Dre filed against the San Mateo, Calif.
, startup in April named three colleges as defendants and left room for others to be added.
The three colleges named, the University of Southern California, Yale University and Indiana University, were dropped as defendants after they banned Napster.
Representatives of several colleges notified this week by King, including the University of Virginia, UCLA, UC Berkeley and Stanford, said they will discuss the request before deciding whether to take action.
UC Berkeley ``does take seriously any notification we get of copyright infringement,'' said Mike Smith, assistant chancellor for legal affairs.
Both Smith and Stanford legal counsel Debra Zumwalt said their universities have received complaints of copyright violations in the past, usually involving incidents like music, text or photos posted without permission on student Web sites.
``Our policy to date has been if there is evidence of copyright infringement brought to us, we act on that,'' Zumwalt said.
However, she said, the school so far has not banned ``access to any particular site of any kind''.
Whether Napster fans are violating copyright law is also a central part of Napster's defense in a federal copyright infringement suit filed by the country's biggest record labels.
The U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco will hear the case Oct.
2. ``These letters are a heavy-handed attempt by Metallica's lawyers to increase university bans as part of their effort to shut down Napster,'' company Chief Executive Officer Hank Barry said in a news release.
``Students who engage in person-to-person file sharing are not copyright infringers, and we hope that, while the litigation is pending, schools would not be intimidated by Metallica and limit the freedom of students to participate in the Napster community''.
Students who use Napster or similar programs like Scour said they shouldn't, and likely wouldn't, be denied.
``If Napster were illegal, the school would have the right to ban access to it,'' said UC Berkeley student Jim Wu.
``But until it is illegal, I don't think the school has a right to ban access''.
``I personally don't think that restricting access to Napster is going to restrict people's way of getting free music off the Internet.
It might be a little harder, but people will still find ways to do it,'' he said.
UCLA student James Papasin says Napster promotes CD sales.
``They probably don't have a right to restrict access, but of course they can do whatever they want,'' Papasin said.
``We're college students; we should have access to everything''.
Meanwhile, lawyers for the record companies filed a brief with the U.S.
Court of Appeals in San Francisco supporting a lower court's preliminary injunction that could shut Napster completely.
And the Motion Picture Association of America and 19 other organizations filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the injunction against Napster.
``With one voice, we band together to send a simple and clear message: It is wrong to build a business that relies on the theft of copyrighted materials, and we oppose Napster's business model for doing just that,'' MPAA President Jack Valenti said in a news release.

SAN FRANCISCO _ Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich plans to visit Napster Inc.
on Wednesday to deliver a gift: a list of 335,435 Napster users who the heavy metal band claims has offered illegal copies of Metallica songs on the Internet.
Metallica, which last month filed a civil suit to stop the San Mateo, Calif.
, startup, wants Napster to block further access to all of the users on the 60,000-page list, a request Napster says it might honor.
``We're trying to put Napster out of business, or at least out of the copyright infringement business,'' Metallica attorney Howard E.
King said Tuesday.
Napster created software that allows people to share and swap MP3-formatted songs over the Internet without paying for the music.
The suit, filed by the band and its own production companies E/M Ventures and Creeping Death Music, seeks at least $10 million in damages.
The suit claims Napster violated federal copyright and racketeering laws by allowing its users to share and swap Metallica songs on the Internet without charge.
Napster is also fighting copyright infringement suits filed by rap artists Dr.
Dre and the Recording Industry Association of America trade group.
The Metallica suit originally named three colleges, the University of Southern California, Yale University and Indiana University, that the band said were allowing use of Napster by their students.
But each institution was dropped from the suit after blocking Napster permanently.
Napster lawyers have denied the claims and vowed to fight the suit.
However, King said Napster officials said they would block any users who violated copyright laws if Metallica could identify them.
So Metallica hired British online consulting firm NetPD to monitor Napster from Friday, April 28, to Sunday, April 30.
The firm found 335,435 distinct Napster users who offered an average of five Metallica songs for other Napster members.
The list includes the screen names used by the Napster members and enough information to identify the users' computers.
It's not clear how many Metallica songs were actually downloaded during that period, but King said the band contends any song offered by Napster users is illegal.
In an event staged for the media, Ulrich plans to show up at noon today at Napster headquarters on Fourth Avenue with the 60,000-page list contained in 30 cardboard boxes.
Metallica sent invitations to media organizations saying that ``all coverage is welcome and questions will be taken''.
``Part of what this litigation is about is a public education process, too,'' King said.
But King said the band does not intend to sue each of the Napster users on the hit list.
``It's not the band's intention to kick the rear ends of people who have a few files here and there,'' King said.
``The goal here is not to intimidate the fans.
The goal is to stop Napster''.
Napster spokesman Dan Wool said the company would accept Ulrich's list and review it to determine if any users needed to be booted off the service.

The surge in sharing and trading music over the Internet has brought online music sites into conflict with record labels, which say copyrighted songs are being pirated.
Wednesday the dispute is expected to take a significant turn that will pit musicians directly against their fans.
The heavy-metal band Metallica will seek to prevent 335,000 fans from using Napster, a service for sharing music collections over the Internet.
A lawyer for the band said the users, identified by their online handles, were making Metallica recordings available for others to copy.
Napster officials said Tuesday that under the law they would be obliged to bar anyone shown to have infringed copyright from using the service, though it was not clear what might prevent such users from reregistering.
In any case, the move is a potential blow to the explosively popular but embattled Napster, which was created last year and already faces several lawsuits.
The Metallica lawyer said that if the tactic succeeded, he would encourage similar moves by other musicians, thus potentially depriving Napster of thousands of users.
And with the musicians moving directly into the fray, the dispute is no longer between faceless record labels and Internet companies.
Already, tempers are flaring, with fans of Metallica, one of the most popular heavy metal bands of the last two decades, asserting the move may cause them to abandon a band they have followed with dogged loyalty.
``There are going to be Metallica CD burnings if they try this,'' said Rob Jones, founder of KNAC.com, a Web site catering to heavy-metal fans.
But Metallica sees the issue very differently, said its lawyer, Howard King.
He said Metallica spent millions of dollars to create and market an album and did not want to have the music traded freely online, depriving the band of the fruits of its investment.
``The band would like to sell some albums,'' King said.
He added that ``it is a lousy position to be in'' for Metallica to be at odds with its fans.
But he said that Napster has put Metallica in the position and forced the band to ``take a stand''.
That stand entailed hiring a company to visit Napster to compile a log of the online handles of Napster users who say they have Metallica music to offer.
King said he planned to hand over the list of names to Napster, which is based in San Mateo, Calif.
, in a collection of documents filling 30 cardboard boxes.
His plans were reported Tuesday by Cnet.com, an Internet news site.
Computer users who download the Napster software can then use the Napster site to list the music stored on their computers.
By so doing, they offer that music to the other Napster users, who in effect visit one another's computers over the Internet and listen to or download music.
Napster officials assert they are not involved in music piracy because the music is not kept on the company's computers.
Further, they say their users must comply with copyright law.
Elizabeth Brooks, vice president for marketing at Napster, said the company would expel users found to be ``legitimate infringers'' of copyright.
She said the company was obliged to take the step under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which stipulates that an online service is liable for copyright infringement if it is warned that a user is infringing a copyright and fails to act.
Brooks said the 335,000 fans represented less than 10 percent of Napster's ``several million'' users.
She declined to say how much music is available for trading through the service.
Until last week, when Metallica and the rapper Dr.
Dre sued Napster for copyright infringement, the battle had been waged primarily by the music companies' trade group, the Recording Industry Association of America.
On another front in the digital music struggle, the industry won at least an initial victory last week when a federal judge ruled that another online music database, MP3.com, had violated copyright law.
Cliff Burnstein, one of Metallica's managers, said the band decided it needed to join the fight to make it clear that the dispute is not just about the interests of the record companies, but about the bands themselves.
``Even though the RIAA sued, they did it in a legalistic manner that didn't bring a lot of coverage,'' he said.
``We though this would bring the issue out more if we did it''.
Any rift between Metallica and its fans over Napster would be particularly striking, since the band's initial popularity in the early 1980s grew in part from a cassette demo tape, ``No Life Til Leather,'' that the band sent out free and encouraged fans to bootleg.
It is said to be among the most-traded cassette demo tapes in rock.
Burnstein said the band had a right to distribute music free then, but also had the right to ask for payment from fans for its current CDs.
It now records for Elektra Records, a division of Time Warner.
Jones of KNAC.com said music fans did not feel they were costing the bands money by sharing music online.
Rather, he said, those who have routinely copied music for each other on cassette tapes, or made illegal bootleg recordings at concerts, are merely taking the practice to a new medium.
He said Metallica had lost touch with its fans.
``They're the No.
1 fan of George Washington,'' he said, referring to the the $1 bill.
``They're just being the man,'' he said.
SAN FRANCISCO _ The crackdown on Napster has reached the corporate workplace.
Public relations firm Golon/Harris International has blocked employees from using the popular but controversial music swapping program because Napster was starting to sap the company's computer resources.
Numerous universities have already blocked or restricted use of Napster for various reasons, including copyright and bandwidth problems.
But Napster officials said there have been only a few scattered reports by Napster members or ``through the grapevine'' of the program causing similar problems in the workplace.
The latest came when Golon/Harris, which is based in Chicago and has offices in the United States, Britain and Japan, sent notice Tuesday to the more than 500 computer users in 13 company offices, including one in San Francisco.
The message: Napster is officially off-limits at work.
Barrett Buss, Golon/Harris vice president for information systems, said his first inkling that there might be a problem came when he noticed that 80 percent of the Internet traffic from one office was going to just one location _ Napster Inc.
in San Mateo, Calif.
``At that point, I got concerned that if 80 percent was going to Napster, how much of the bandwidth was left for e-mail'' and other business uses of the Internet, Buss said.
At the same time, Buss said the company was having problems backing up e-mail files in another office because a server no longer had the 4 gigabytes of hard-disk space needed to perform the operation.
Buss investigated and found employees had downloaded about 4.5 gigabytes worth of MP3 files.
``It's like potato chips, you can't download just one,'' Buss said.
The Napster software, created by founder Shawn Fanning, allows music fans to share their MP3-formatted songs directly with other Napster members without cost.
But the major record companies along with rock band Metallica and rap star Dr.
Dre have sued Napster claiming the program promotes music piracy and cheats artists out of royalties.
About 100 universities have enacted highly publicized bans or restrictions on Napster because student file-swapping was clogging the institutions' high-speed Internet connections.
Three colleges, Yale University, Indiana University and the University of Southern California, blocked Napster to avoid getting drawn into Metallica's copyright infringement lawsuit against Napster.
MP3s have flourished at universities because they afford students free access to high-speed Internet connections.
A survey this week by Greenfield Online showed 75 percent of college students have downloaded music from the Internet.
But businesses also have those same high-speed connections.
``It would make sense that people are using Napster at work,'' said David Gould, who operates an independent Web site called NapsterMP3.com, which offers Napster fans forums and news, but not MP3s.
Gould of Charlotte, N.C., said he has heard of no other company bans of Napster.
However, he said that about 20 percent of the visitors logged on to his site yesterday morning were from business-related Internet addresses, and that percentage seems to go up on Mondays when workers return after the weekend off.
Gould said visitors to his 3-week-old site yesterday included users from financial services companies, the military, media outlets and the U.S.
Senate. Napster spokesman Dan Wool had no specific information of other companies that cracked down on Napster use.
However, he said the bans had more to do with workers slacking off than computer resource problems.

The US Constitution gives Congress the power to establish copyright protections ``to promote the progress of science and the useful arts''.
This principle is as valid today as when the Constitution was written in 1787.
Congress and the courts need to adapt it to the Internet, which offers access to an extraordinary amount of information even as it provides opportunity to limit what people see, hear, and read.
Intense legal battles are being waged today over the use of MP3 technology, which allows the transmission of high-fidelity music in a compressed form.
Computer-users are able to amass collections of hundreds of songs on their PCs.
The recording industry might have embraced this technology as a new, more convenient way of getting music to its customers, but it has been slow to allow the release of material by well-known performers.
Several Internet companies, notably MP3.com and Napster, have stepped into this vacuum.
The Recording Industry Association of America accuses them of copyright infringement and has tried to shut them down or curtail their use of popular material.
The association has a point about Napster.
This program, available at no cost on the Internet, allows anyone who signs up to share MP3 files with any other Napster members.
Thursday afternoon, 5,423 Napsterites were on line with 621,881 songs (many of them duplicates).
Some of the music came from aspiring artists eager to be heard, but most was by famous acts, who would much rather have fans buy their compact discs so they could collect royalties.
Needless to say, most famous performers have not given Napster or Napster members permission to run a song-sharing service.
MP3.com had a better idea.
It wanted to create a database of 80,000 popular CDs and allow access only to people who could prove electronically that they owned, or at least had physical possession of, the actual CD.
The Napster case is pending, but Judge Jed S.
Rakoff in New York federal court ruled last month that the MP3.com plan violated the recording industry's many copyright protections.
Both companies have since taken steps to reduce their legal exposure, but the larger issues remain.
Owners of CDs are not without rights.
Under the legal doctrine of ``fair use,'' first promulgated in 1840 and upheld repeatedly since then, people can make many uses of copyright material: using a portion in a book review, sampling a bit of a song for a musical parody, and making a recording for their own, noncommercial use.
This week heavy metal group Metallica forced Napster to ban 317,377 users from the service on the ground they had illegally copied Metallica songs.
But suppose someone owned the entire Metallica CD and just wanted to use Napster to make MP3 copies of a few tunes?
That ought to be considered ``fair use,'' and the MP3.com approach would have allowed this copying.
Even if the recording industry wins all its battles in court, new programs are being developed to allow the sharing of MP3 files.
Gnutella and other programs eliminate the key legal vulnerability of Napster _ its dependence on central computers to facilitate file-sharing.
The recording industry is pinning its hopes for protecting its wares on encryption.
The Sony Corp.
, which pioneered the Walkman technology that revolutionized music listening, has devised the Music Clip, a new kind of portable music player that forces users to convert MP3 files into a coded format.
When Sony invented the Walkman, which played unencrypted tape cassettes, it had not yet bought the CBS recording company.
Encryption denies the buyer an opportunity to move the music into different formats, to combine selected cuts off CDs or to use bits for parody or other legal purposes.
It would seem to violate the ``fair use'' doctrine.
Congress and the courts need to refine copyright protection in a way that benefits consumers as well as giant industries.
Meanwhile, major record companies ought to go beyond legal stratagems to define a marketing program that fully utilizes the MP3 format.
The songs of Metallica and other famous artists ought to be available for a small fee, and the work of those popular acts ought to be featured on the same site as those of emerging artists, as MP3.com had planned.
The great promise of Internet technology is that it will make ``science and the useful arts'' widely available at the touch of a computer mouse.
The recording industry should not let Draconian interpretations of the copyright laws inhibit the growth of this powerful medium.
The battle lines are drawn.
The target is Napster, the software company that allows computer users to swap music files with other users for free, whether the music is by unknown bands or superstars.
Either way, the artists don't get royalties _ and this issue has ignited a firestorm of debate among musicians, record labels, and increasingly, the courts, which have been asked to rule on copyright questions regarding online piracy.
In one corner stands Metallica and Dr.
Dre _ the heavy metal and rap titans, respectively, who recently filed separate suits against Napster for copyright infringement.
Other artists from Don Henley to Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails are defending their position, with Henley saying that Napster is engaged in outright ``stealing'' from songwriters.
In the other corner is Limp Bizkit, the rap-rock act that has become Napster's lobbying arm and is taking $1.7 million in Napster sponsorship to tour this summer.
The Offspring and Chuck D of Public Enemy are among the acts standing beside Bizkit in support of Napster, saying that Napster helps expose new music and anyone who thinks otherwise is old school.
All of which comes just a week after the Recording Industry Association of America (on behalf of major labels such as Sony and Arista) won a lawsuit against MP3.com _ a music database service.
MP3.com was found guilty of copyright infringement for its my.mp3.com branch, which allows users to create a digital locker from MP3's database of 80,000 CDs.
The RIAA is now asking for damages that could run in the billions of dollars.
The subplots to the digital battle are many, and are being played out in light of increased sales of compact discs.
For one, Metallica has been pitted against some of its fans, one of whom went on Napster's Web site this week to write that Metallica was a bunch of ``sellouts''.
He added: ``The (Metallica) song `Master of Puppets' is fitting, only this time, Metallica is on the wrong end of the strings''.
Metallica's response was to hire a British firm, NetPD, to monitor three days of Napster activity earlier this week, which turned up 333,082 screen names of users who traded 1.4 million Metallica songs _ an average of nearly five songs per person _ during that time, said Gayle Fine of the band's management company, Q Prime.
Metallica has asked that Napster drop those names from its files.
As of Thursday, Napster had not removed the names.
One fan posted an angry parody site, www.paylars.com, which asks fans to send money to the band to pay for songs they downloaded on Napster.
Another subplot features Limp Bizkit's singer-rapper, Fred Durst, who also is a senior vice president of Interscope Records, whose parent label, Universal Music, joined the RIAA in a separate lawsuit against Napster.
Interscope has not commented on what it thinks of Durst's actions.
But the larger issue has nothing to do with opposing rock personalities.
It has to do with whether 200 years of copyright law will be thrown out the window by the digital revolution.
``The recording industry is not anti-Napster,'' says Jayson Maloni, a spokesman for the RIAA.
``Nobody is trying to keep an unsigned band from getting its music heard.
But the RIAA is concerned with signed artists who record for labels that do not want to give away their music for free''.
``It's not just the artist.
You're messing with the record companies now and they don't want to lose that money,'' adds J.C.
Chasez of the band 'N Sync.
The record labels have remained quiet and are letting the RIAA fight its battles, though more and more artists are speaking out.
The lesser-known ones tend to defend Napster, for as Bill Janovitz of Buffalo Tom says, ``For artists that nobody has heard of, Napster may help them''.
But the bigger the act, the more likely it is to bash Napster.
``I create my music; it's mine,'' said Reznor of Nine Inch Nails in a recent phone interview.
``It's not your right to give it away or exchange it with your friends, just as it's not right to copy software or photocopy books to give away.
It represents the artist's work.
Just because a technology exists where you can duplicate something, that doesn't give you the right to steal.
There's nothing wrong with giving some tracks away, or bits of stuff, that's fine.
But it's not everybody's right.
Once I record something, it's not public domain to give it away freely.
So I stand behind Dr.
Dre and Metallica and support them.
And that's not trying to be the outdated musician who is trying to stop technology.
I love technology.
Technology is here to stay and I'm the first one downloading the newest update to software that I don't need and that makes my machine not work''.
As for Bizkit's Durst, Reznor blasted him by saying, ``Durst is the brain trust of all that is wrong with music.
He supports (Napster) because they gave him $2 million to tour.
He forgot to mention that in his press release''.
(Bizkit was unavailable for comment since he's in the studio, said publicist Jenny Bodi).
Singer Don Henley is equally outspoken.
``The bottom line is this: The works of recording artists are being stolen and disseminated over the Internet without fair and just compensation for those artists,'' he said.
``This is the way songwriters and singers make their living, and stealing that music and giving it away for free is not right.
``Then there's the absurd argument that `Well, rock stars are wealthy, and therefore, it's all right to steal from them,' '' said Henley.
``But the majority of singers and songwriters and recording artists in this business are not wealthy.
They're struggling hand to mouth, day to day, and they need fair and just compensation for their work.
I'm deeply concerned, as are all artists about these issues, particularly Napster''.
Napster was founded last year by Shawn Fanning, a 19-year-old then-Northeastern University student who dropped out after his freshman year to move to San Mateo, Calif.
, where the company is based.
Napster is growing dramatically _ spokeswoman Deborah Orr won't put a figure on the number of users, but cites ``millions, with a 5 to 25 percent increase every day''.
The firm refers to itself as the ``embattled MP3 file-swapping software company''.
Clearly, there's a martyrdom complex here, though Fanning and other Napster executives weren't available to discuss it for this article.
Orr said, ``they can't comment on anything touching on the lawsuits''.
Many observers say that the major record labels have been slow in climbing aboard the digital revolution, hence the fill-the-breach mentality of services like Napster and my.mp3.com.
Earlier this week Sony and Universal Music announced plans to launch a joint music download subscription service.
Meanwhile, a new company, myplay.com, has been working with labels on a ``totally legal basis,'' says founder David Pakman, who worked with Apple computer and is also a rock drummer.
His company enables users to have a digital locker of songs, but royalties are paid on them and other listeners can listen to them for two weeks but can't copy them.
Myplay will launch a partnership with aol.com in two weeks, so the timing is perfect for this new startup, now that Napster and my.mp3.com have been scarred by lawsuits.
While most artists have chosen sides in the Napster dispute, some artists are still sitting on the fence.
``I can argue on both sides, but not hard enough to do anything about it,'' said solo and Throwing Muses singer Kristin Hersh.
``I want music to get to more ears than just through MTV, Top 40 radio, and Rolling Stone.
So something that opens things up and makes people more musically educated can be a good thing''.
A wait-and-see policy was voiced by Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins.
``It's a waste of time to go after (Napster) because you're not going to be able to stop free trade on the Internet.
Everybody should stop wringing their hands about it.
``It's going to take two or three years to sort itself out,'' said Corgan.
``It's going to be the future, but we'll eventually have to figure out a system that gives the artist some copyright payment.
I believe it's hurting record sales, but it's also doing what it's supposed to do _ building new fans.''
PALM BEACH, Fla.
_ Juan Uribe wasn't caught napping.
He was online, of course, when he electronically got the news from cnn.com that a federal judge was ordering Napster Inc.
to shut down its Web site that has spawned millions of music trades on the Internet.
Deadline: midnight today.
The next address Uribe typed in was ``www.napster.com'' _ and there he stayed for about the next five hours, getting a steady stream of complimentary music.
``We found out immediately and we said, 'We've got to get on, we've got to get on, we've got to get all that we can right now,''' said Uribe.
In all, Uribe said he downloaded about 75 songs, from hip-hop artist Jay-Z to Colombian musician Carlos Vives, in anticipation of a possible Napster shutdown.
Not bad, said Uribe, who was at work as a computer systems engineer in Fort Lauderdale at the time.
``It allowed us to get a lot of stuff for free,'' he said of the site.
A judge hearing a lawsuit filed by the recording industry granted an injunction Wednesday that would effectively shut down Napster Friday night for infringing on copyrights.
Napster's lawyers asked the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals to stay the order, arguing that the decision would bring down the company and force it to lay off its 40 employees within days.
Local punk-rockers, folk-lovers, classic-rock buffs _ they all sounded off about the judge's ruling and the future of music, and they got in some last-minute downloading as Napster's hours quickly dwindled Thursday.
Napster allows Internet users to store their music on the site and to download their own tunes _ for nothing.
Users can also share music tastes with each other in chat rooms.
The site had increased traffic Thursday, but no specific numbers were available and no system problems were reported, said Tracy Mlakar, spokeswoman for San Mateo, Calif.-based Napster.
Noting that 70 million people were expected to be using Napster by year's end unless the service is halted, U.S.
District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel said the San Mateo, Calif.-based company was encouraging ``wholesale infringing'' against industry copyrights and would likely lose at trial.
The Recording Industry Association of America sued Napster in December, accusing it of creating a musical black market online.
The association estimates that song-swapping via Napster by an estimated 20 million people worldwide has cost the music industry more than $300 million in lost sales.
The heavy metal band Metallica also sued.
``We're elated,'' Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich said.
``Sharing is such a warm, cuddly, friendly word. . . this is not sharing, it's duplicating''.
Founder Shawn Fanning, who started Napster (his nickname in high school, a reference to his ``nappy'' frizzy hair) last year while a student at Northeastern University in Boston, said in a short Webcast, ``We will keep fighting for Napster and for your right to share music over the Internet''.
All of this is a real drag to 15-year-old Jamie Warren.
Now, he said, how's he going to promote his band, Benjamin Distasteful and the Wumberlogs?
He'd hoped some free samples on Napster, a high-profile venue, could give the band a boost.
``Metallica started this whole stupid thing and complaining, but they have millions of dollars so I don't know why they have to complain about it,'' Warren said.
He said he'd downloaded several songs by Thursday afternoon since hearing the news, and he planned on getting a few more before it was too late.
Napster gives him access to hard-to-find songs you can't get from the radio or many record stores.
Like music from The Misfits and Discharge.
Maybe he'll use other sites that offer downloads, but he said he'd gotten used to Napster and was hesitant to turn elsewhere.
People familiar with the music industry locally said it was fruitless to try to stop the downloading of music, pointing to other sites like gnutella.wego.com and scour.com, which offer similar services.
``The genie was already out of the bottle anyway,'' said Steve Rullman, 32, who runs a locally based Web site _ thehoneycomb.com _ that lets users to listen to new bands of all types.
Thursday evening, Gnutella's file-sharing was down because of ``unprecedented traffic volume following the Napster decision,'' according to the Web site.
The Napster site was especially susceptible to a court ruling because the songs are listed on the site, unlike some other sites.
Area record vendors said the online downloading could actually help business by exposing listeners to music they otherwise wouldn't be interested in.
A recent study of more than 2,200 online music fans by New York-based Jupiter Communications suggests that users of music-sharing programs are 45 percent more likely to increase their music purchasing than fans who aren't trading digital bootlegs online.
``It helps promote the band,'' said a manager at Downtown Books and CDs in Lake Worth, who goes by the name Kenny 5.
``They like the song (after hearing it online), they go out and buy the CD''.
But Michael Pruszynski, 32, who owns Music-X-Change in Jupiter, said that may be true for the near future only.
``If I have to look ahead, say, another five to ten years,'' he said, ``I would say the smart bet would be to get out of this business''.

Putting a crimp in the recording industry's war against Napster.com, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and other top schools have refused a request to filter the music-swapping site from their computer networks.
Harvard University officials are expected to announce next week that they, too, will not block access to Napster.
A lawyer for the rock band Metallica and rap artist Dr.
Dre asked several elite colleges this month to ban Napster, which allows visitors to its Web site to obtain copyrighted music for free.
Not doing so, argued the lawyer, Howard E.
King, would make a college ``an enabler of the theft of intellectual property''.
But campuses that turned down King's request said the need for free use of the Internet and the principle of academic freedom are more important than the threat of copyright infringement.
``MIT has a long history of providing its faculty, staff, and students with uncensored access to the Internet,'' said James D.
Bruce, MIT's vice president for information systems, in a letter to King.
Several small institutions, including Amherst and Smith colleges, are blocking Napster on their computer networks this fall because so many people on campus were clogging up the Internet systems as they downloaded music from Napster's huge catalog of recordings.
Napster is slated to go before a federal appeals court next month in a case brought by representatives of the entertainment industry.
The lawsuit charges Napster with violating the rights of recording artists whose songs are traded freely on the site.
Opponents of Napster had hoped to recruit more high-profile schools to lead a nationwide boycott against the site.
But Debra Zumwalt, Stanford's general counsel, said the university resisted because Napster in some instances can be used legally and for academic purposes, such as in a class focused on copyright issues.
``It's a slippery slope _ once you start banning access to Web sites because people can potentially violate copyright laws, where do you stop''?
Zumwalt said.
SAN FRANCISCO _ Handing the recording industry a resounding victory, a San Francisco judge slapped Napster Inc.
with a preliminary injunction Wednesday and ordered the Internet service to halt all illegal song swapping by midnight Friday.
U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Hall Patel rejected all of Napster's legal arguments and ruled that the program is primarily a conduit for ``wholesale infringing'' of copyright laws.
The ruling is likely to disappoint millions of Napster fans who use the Internet program to trade free music with each other.
And officials with the San Mateo startup claim the ruling could be a death blow to its fledgling business because, it said, its program cannot distinguish legal from illegal songs.
Napster executives said they will appeal as early as Thursday to keep Napster online.
The company's high-powered defense attorney David Boies said Napster will have to shut down the service if a higher court does not grant a stay of the injunction.
``We are surprised and disappointed,'' Napster's interim CEO Hank Barry said moments after the verdict.
``We understand the ruling and the basis for it, but we disagree with it.
We do not believe Napster users are acting illegally''.
Patel issued her much-anticipated ruling at the end of a 21/2 hour hearing.
The judge's small courtroom was packed, and more than 150 lawyers, journalists, online music company executives and Napster fans had to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television in an adjoining courtroom.
Patel's ruling is historic because it sets the tone for how the established entertainment industries deal with the increasing problem of Internet users using file-sharing programs like Napster.
Already, other programs like Gnutella, Freenet and Scour have extended the Napster ``peer-to-peer'' file-sharing concept to digital pictures and first-run movies.
The same idea could be used to swap electronic books and computer software.
``This decision will pave the way for the future of online music,'' said Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording Industry Association of America, the trade group representing the top five record labels that sued Napster for copyright infringement in December.
The quick rise of the Napster program, originally written by a 19-year-old college student, Shawn Fanning, alarmed the $40 billion U.S. recording industry.
Napster estimates there are 20 million users of the program, first released in August 1999.
Once considered a fad among teens and college students, Napster has now also become popular with people of all ages.
Napster user Hidehiro Beppu, 21, studying math at the University of California at Berkeley, was also disappointed.
``This is bogus.
Napster doesn't do anything.
It's like people copying music on tapes and giving it to friends''.
The Napster software links users to various servers run by Napster Inc.
People can easily search for any MP3-formated song stored on the computer hard drives of other Napster users.
When selected, the songs are copied from one computer to another.
This vast ``peer-to-peer'' file sharing network has the ability to find almost any recorded song in the world, from the latest Britney Spears top-10 pop hit to an obscure 19th century folk song.
The recording industry complained that the ability to download free songs threatens to undermine the very core of the sales and distribution mechanism that sustains the creative juices of the musical world.
The Recording Industry Association of America estimates that Napster has already cost more than $300 million in lost sales.
A new study released Wednesday by online research firm Jupiter Communications Inc.
called Napster ``the definitive killer application for the online music industry''.
Los Angeles attorney Russell Frackman, representing the recording companies, said Napster would grow to 75 million users downloading billions of songs by the end of the year if left unchecked.
``This is the most egregious case of mass copyright infringement that has ever existed,'' Frackman said.
``The longer this goes on, the more impossible it will be for us and, we believe, for the court, to do anything realistic''.
Napster's defense team headed by Boies, who led the U.S. government's recent successful antitrust prosecution of Microsoft, relied on legal precedents set by previous court decisions that allowed VCR owners to copy movies.
Napster also said it is protected by provisions of the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.
Patel, however, flatly rejected those arguments, saying e-mail messages by Napster's own founders admit the program was designed to share ``pirated'' versions of copyright-protected songs.
She also shot down Napster's contention that the program, even if used for illegal purposes, could be spared because there were some legal ``fair use'' applications such as a promotional vehicle for unknown new artists.
That argument appeared ``late, after the beginning of this litigation,'' Patel said.
Patel's injunction, intended to prevent any more damage to the recording industry until after the suit goes to trial, orders Napster to prevent members from swapping songs controlled by the record companies that filed the suit.
Boies argued that the injunction is unfair to Napster because technicians have not devised a way to separate which songs are legal.
Patel said the injunction will force them to come up with a method.
``They created the monster; I guess that's the consequences they face,'' Patel said.
Lars Ulrich, drummer for the rock band Metallica, was especially pleased by the ruling.
Metallica drew the ire of its fans by filing its own suit against Napster for allowing the band's songs to be freely swapped.
With Napster, ``the right of what happens to my music was taken away from me,'' Ulrich said in a telephone interview from New York.
Now, he said, the challenge ``is to make people in this country understand that because technology make it available and because the Internet gives you access to it, that doesn't mean you have a right to it'' Legal experts said the ruling gives the recording industry a clear copyright enforcement victory.
But other file sharing programs like Gnutella that are not controlled by any one company are going to be harder to control.
``The liability issue against Napster was very clear,'' said Brian Mudge, partner at Kenyon &AMP; Kenyon in Wash.
DC, specializing in intellectual property cases.
``That's going to be a whole different ballgame to enforce and police.
The record industry will have to embrace this technology before it loses total control over it''.
With the possibility of a court-ordered Napster shutdown looming, Napster fans had already started moving to other file-sharing programs such as Gnutella, iMesh and Scour, which is also the subject of another copyright infringement suit by the motion picture industry.
Web sites like &UR; www.angrycoffee.com &LR; offer more alternatives, while &UR; http://opennap.sourceforge.net &LR; offers links through outside servers in case Napster is forced to shut down its own servers.
WASHINGTON _ The Senate indicated Tuesday that it wants no part of the hottest controversy in the music business, ensuring that the youth-driven trend to download music from the Internet will continue to reshape the industry, at least for now.
After listening to Metallica rocker Lars Ulrich square off with the Byrds folksinger Roger McGuinn over the evils and joys of Internet music downloads, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said, ``I think the courts can handle it''.
Hatch said the Senate will keep ``a close eye'' on the raging copyright fight between the recording industry and Internet music distributors, such as San Mateo-based Napster, but will take no action now.
The committee's ranking Democrat, Patrick Leahy of Vermont agreed, adding that movie studios were once ``terrified'' of videotapes, which later turned into a major revenue stream for Hollywood.
``In the end, things get sorted out and new (technologies) offer new opportunities for artists and more choices for consumers,'' Leahy said.
``Let's not strangle the baby in the cradle''.
The copyright dispute has drawn intense lobbying in Washington from the software industry, recording companies, Hollywood studios and even book publishers as Internet distribution undermines ownership of ``intellectual property'' across the spectrum of copyrighted material.
Industry leaders liken unauthorized free Internet distribution of copyrighted work to theft, saying it robs artists of their livelihoods, strangles artistic creation and, ultimately, will harm consumers as the sources of creativity dry up.
Internet distributors contend that established industries are trying to stifle a hugely &LR; popular technology that will bring untold convenience and flexibility to consumers.
They say they want to preserve copyright protections but that recording studios have been reluctant to work with Web sites the studios view as competitors.
The distributors say the recording industry has hit them with huge lawsuits on the scale of those filed against tobacco companies, and that the suits could put them out of business.
In any event, some argued Tuesday that technologies such as Napster and a more sophisticated program called ``Gnutella'' _ a free software that allows users to download music from each other's computers rather than a central server _ are inherently uncontrollable.
Hatch even quoted Intel Chairman Andy Grove's prediction that ``the whole Internet could be rearchitected by Napster-like technology''.
Hatch, whose high-profile hearings on technology issues often indicate where Washington is headed, did not disappoint Tuesday, lining up the chief combatants of the music wars and packing Capitol Hill's most cavernous hearing room.
Metallica's Ulrich opened by accusing Napster of hijacking, piracy and theft of artistic property.
Describing Metallica's rise from rags to riches as ``the classic American dream come true,'' Ulrich compared a musician's right to own his music to a carpenter's right to own a table he crafts.
Ulrich recounted how his band was working earlier this year on a song for the movie ``Mission Impossible-2'' when members heard that radio stations were already playing versions of the work in progress.
The band traced the ``leaks'' to Napster and filed a lawsuit.
``My band authored the music which is Napster's lifeblood,'' Ulrich said.
``We should decide what happens to it, not Napster _ a company with no rights in our recordings, which never invested a penny in Metallica's music or had anything to do with its creation''.
Napster chief executive Hank Barry countered that the Web site's 20 million users have a right to ``share'' music under copyright law.
Barry argued that Internet distribution ``is helping, not hurting'' the music industry by allowing people to sample music before buying it, leading to more store sales.
And he said Internet distribution gives music lovers and artists unprecedented access to each other.
The Byrds co-ounder McGuinn agreed, charging that recording studios actually undercut artists rather than protect them.
Despite recording more than 25 records and such 1960s megahits as ``Mr.
Tambourine Man'' and ``Turn, Turn, Turn,'' McGuinn said he ``never saw any royalties'' from most of his work other than meager advances.
``The recording companies have ways of not paying,'' he said.
In 1994, McGuinn said he began recording traditional folk songs to preserve the genre and was led eventually to Internet distributor MP3.com, which paid him ``an unheard of'' 50 percent non-exclusive royalty and helped fuel a resurgence in folk music that he said the big recording companies had abandoned.
But such arguments had little sway with California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who took a much harder line than her colleagues on copyright infringement.
``To my way of thinking, Napster has found a method which entirely defeats copyright protection,'' Feinstein said.
Barry sharply countered, ``Sales are up, Senator,'' but Feinstein was undeterred.
``You could do the same thing with a book,'' she said.
``You could do the same thing with a movie.
You are essentially defeating any intellectual property copyright with your technology, all driven under the cloak of anonymity at the other end of a server''.
Barry replied that such charges have been levelled against every technological advance, ``from the piano roll to radio to cassettes to VCRs.
These horrible prophecies have not come true.
In every case it's been a financial boon'' to copyright holders and content producers.
Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of America, drew a sharp distinction between Napster and Gnutella, which pay no royalties, and such companies as MP3.com and Emusic.com of Redwood City, which do.
But Gene Kan, a University of California at Berkeley graduate in electrical engineering who helped develop Gnutella, said the ``toothpaste is already out of the tube'' and that Napster's 20 million users of today ``will be 100 million tomorrow''.
Attempts to ``lock up'' copyrighted material will be defeated eventually, Kan predicted.
Gene Hoffman, founder and CEO of Emusic.com of Redwood City, agreed that the convenience, flexibility and infinite availability of music on the Internet will upend the music industry's reliance on physical distribution.
But Hoffman said that while Emusic offers lower costs _ 99 cents for a single track and $8.99 for an album _ it still pays artists and cannot compete with free music.
``The reason my stock declined 70 percent is because Napster will invalidate the concept of paying for music,'' Hoffman said.
Although Hatch said Congress will take no action now, he warned that Washington will ``be watching very closely'' to see that ``fair and reasonable licensing'' takes place between recording studios and Internet distributors to make sure that artists are compensated _ and that Web sites get access to recordings.
Representatives of the heavy-metal band Metallica went Wednesday to the headquarters of Napster Inc.
with 13 boxes of papers said to list more than 300,000 computer users who, without the band's permission, had recently downloaded Metallica music from other users listed on Napster's Internet site.
Repeating statements made by band members Tuesday during an interview broadcast over the Internet, Howard King, the band's lawyer, said the band did not intend to bring any of the computer users into its previously filed lawsuit against Napster for copyright infringement.
He said that the names had been gathered and submitted to Napster after the company said it could not do anything to stop the free trade in Metallica songs without specific information about which Napster Web site users were involved.
Napster, through a lawyer, said Tuesday that it would review the papers and take steps to disable those users Metallica identified if the claims had been properly submitted.
The statement, issued by Laurence Pulgram, a San Francisco lawyer, went on to say that the result might be to force it to knock the users off its site.
Napster, which is based in San Mateo, Calif.
, functions as a meeting place for computer users willing to share their music files over the Net.
SAN FRANCISCO _ In a major victory for the recording industry, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Napster online music service to stop permitting the exchange of copyrighted music owned by the major music labels.
Napster's lawyer said the decision could effectively shut down the service.
In granting the industry's request for a preliminary injunction, Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of U.S.
District Court in San Francisco ruled that the explosively popular Napster service was used primarily to trade copyrighted material, a behavior that Patel said Napster knew about.
``A majority of Napster users use the service to download and upload copyrighted music,'' the judge said.
The injunction is scheduled to take effect at midnight Friday and will continue pending trial.
The case has become the rallying point for competing interests in the unresolved copyright issues on the Internet, with lawyers, consumers, policy-makers and entrepreneurs watching closely.
And legal experts have said the implications for the case extend beyond music, to the sharing of other media like movies, and may set a tone for how intellectual property law is defined on the Internet.
David Boies, the lead lawyer for Napster, said the company would immediately appeal.
He said that Napster did not have the ability to sift out which of the millions of songs on Napster represented copyrighted works owned by the plaintiffs and which did not.
This injunction ``does not give us any fair ability to comply and still operate,'' Boies said.
Hank Barry, interim chief executive of Napster, held an Internet Webcast to address the ruling to Napster's users; the company says 20 million people have downloaded its software.
The recording industry declared the decision a major and complete victory.
``This sends the message to others who are building businesses based on other people's copyrighted works without permission,'' said Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording Industry Association of America.
``From the judge's language, this was not a close call,'' said Howard King, who represents the rock group Metallica and the artist Dr.
Dre in separate lawsuits against Napster.
King called the decision a ``huge win''.
The recording association said it would post a $5 million bond requested by the judge against any financial losses Napster could suffer from being shut down pending the trial.
Napster had asked for a bond of at least $800 million.
Napster, a year-old company based in San Mateo, Calif.
, makes software that allows computer users to download free software that in turn lets them post the lists of music files they store on their own computers.
Other Napster users then can listen to or download music kept on others' computers.
It is not alone; other services that permit file sharing, like Gnutella, have grown, too.
Last week, the recording industry and the movie industry filed a lawsuit seeking to shut down Scour Exchange, a Los Angeles-based Internet service that lets users download music and video files.
The legal battle over Napster began in December when Time Warner Inc.
, the Sony Corp.
, Bertelsmann and other record companies, represented by the recording association, sued the service for copyright infringement.
From a technical legal standpoint, the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents major record labels, asserts Napster is guilty of contributory copyright infringement.
The industry contends that Napster has built a business by encouraging individual users to share files of music they do not own.
But Napster says its users are doing nothing wrong, and therefore it is doing nothing wrong.
Rather, the company says, they are engaging en masse in a practice that has been permitted all along _ the copying of music and other media for personal use.
Patel concluded that Napster users were engaged in ``wholesale infringing,'' and that the users were not engaged in ``typical personal use of music copies, as Napster lawyers asserted''.
Moreover, she said the users reaped economic advantage from making copies on the Napster service by getting music free they might ordinarily pay for.
In seeking the preliminary injunction, lawyers for the recording industry said Napster was on pace to have 70 million users within six months.
The lawyers said Napster users already downloaded 14,000 songs a minute.
``This is the most egregious case of massive copyright infringement that has ever existed,'' Russell Frackman, a record label lawyer, told the judge.
Boies, who represented the government in its antitrust case against Microsoft, said that an injunction should not be granted because it would have the side effect of impinging on Napster's uses that do not infringe on copyrights, like sharing works that do not have copyrights.
Boies cited the U.S.
Supreme Court's 1984 decision that Sony was not guilty of contributory copyright violation with its Betamax videocassette recorder, in part because the device was ``capable of substantial noninfringing uses''.
But Patel did not accept the argument.
``While Napster may be capable of some other things, they seem to pale in comparison to what Napster was created for,'' she said.
The two sides wielded competing studies to show Napster's impact, or lack thereof, on music sales.
One study, commissioned by Napster and prepared by Peter S.
Fader, associate professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, found that ``over 91 percent of Napster users buy as much or more music than before they used Napster, with 28 percent purchasing more''.
Meanwhile, according to a survey the recording association commissioned from the Field Research Corp.
, a San Francisco-based research firm, 22 percent of Napster users said that because of Napster, they did not buy CDs any more or they bought fewer CDs.
Patel suggested that by the time of the trial, more work on the effect of Napster would have to be done, noting that none of the studies presented were ``without flaws.''
Embattled software startup Napster Inc.
said Wednesday that it has blocked access to more than 300,000 Napster users who the rock group Metallica said were swapping illegal copies of their songs.
But in an attempt to shift blame to the heavy-metal band, the San Mateo company said it would reinstate anyone who lodged a formal protest that they were mistakenly named by Metallica.
Reactivation of the account would take 10 to 14 business days as long as the band doesn't sue the individual first.
In fact, the formal online reinstatement request form asks the banned members to give ``your consent to be sued by Metallica in the federal court where you reside''.
In a press release titled ```Heavy Metal Heavyweights K.O.
Fans,'' Napster attorney Laurence F.
Pulgram said the company ``has taken extraordinary steps to comply with Metallica's demands to block hundreds of thousands of its fans from using the Napster system''.
Metallica attorney Howard K.
King said the band still had no intention of suing individual fans and that it was ``outrageous'' Napster was trying to shift blame to Metallica.
``What this has done is let Napster fly its true colors,'' King said.
``They don't have any intention of protecting copyrighted material''.
The mass takedown of Napster users is the latest twist in the short but controversial history of the startup, which makes a popular software program that allows users to freely share and trade downloadable music compressed into the MP3 format.
Metallica filed a $10 million civil suit against the company on April 13 for copyright infringement and racketeering.
Napster is also fighting similar suits by rap artist Dr.
Dre and the Recording Industry Association of America.
On May 3, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich hand-delivered 13 cardboard boxes filled with the screen names of more than 335,000 Napster users the band said claims &LR; were offering illegal copies of Metallica songs during the last weekend of April.
The band demanded Napster terminate access for those users.
The event became a media circus outside Napster's downtown San Mateo offices.
The next day, without fanfare, Metallica's lawyers transmitted an electronic version of the list to Napster.
The list was culled to 317,377 when Metallica agreed not to go after Napster fans who had copies of bootleg music that were authorized by the band.
Napster began blocking members on Metallica's list last weekend.
``I was in shock last night when I saw I was blocked,'' said Jay Arnold of Tulsa, Okla.
, who added that he also felt ``betrayed by Napster''.
Arnold said he has purchased CDs after hearing songs he sampled using Napster.
But now, he won't buy the latest ``Mission Impossible'' soundtrack because it contains a Metallica song.
``They want to have this image of being rock and roll rebels and they do crap like this,'' Arnold said.
Banned Napster users seeking reinstatement have to sign an online form requiring their real names, addresses and a sworn statement they believe they were mistakenly blocked.
Napster will forward the forms to Metallica.
A Napster spokesman did not know how many users had filed forms but said it was running into the ``thousands''.
Internet message boards were filled with posts from banned users who got back online simply by deleting Napster and any references to Metallica on their hard drives.
They then reinstalled Napster and signed on using another name.
Although the newest version of Napster keeps track of anyone who has been banned in the past, Napster users said they simply reinstalled older Napster versions that didn't have that function.
Ironically, the Napster controversy has made a team of Santa Clara University students $1,000 richer.
The four sophomore business majors, Kelly Walsh, Laura Erickson, Joseph Rushmer and Blaze Smallwood, recently won first place in a nationwide business ethics competition by suggesting a compromise to the recording industry's beefs with Napster.
The solution called for the Recording Industry Association of America to drop its civil suit against Napster in exchange for a cooperative agreement with the software company that included Napster supplying demographic data on its users to the RIAA.
The Center for Ethics and Business at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles awarded first prize to the Santa Clara students.
Walsh said the students picked the Napster issue because it is particularly popular among college students, so popular that the program has been banned or restricted on about 100 campuses because of bandwidth or copyright problems.
``The Napster Web site could actually facilitate the sale of merchandise or concert tickets,'' she said.
``There's so much more than record sales''.
Also, with the proliferation of Napster-style file-sharing software, the team sought to devise an all-encompassing solution.
``It's a huge issue,'' Walsh said.
``I might not go to Tower Records to steal a CD, but don't have a problem downloading an MP3 into my computer''.
Napster suffered a legal setback in its case with the RIAA when a judge ruled it has not proven the company is protected by one provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

WASHINGTON _ The law meant to protect intellectual property on the Internet needs to be updated, a Democratic research center says in a report to be released on Monday.
The report proposes outlawing technologies like the controversial Napster software that enables Internet users to trade music files with little regard to copyrights.
The Progressive Policy Institute, which is affiliated with the Democratic Leadership Council, is releasing its policy brief, ``Napster and Online Piracy: The Need to Revisit the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,'' ahead of a House Small Business Committee hearing scheduled for Wednesday to examine Internet music technologies.
The hearing is expected to focus on how small recording labels and lesser-known musical acts are using the Internet and downloadable music to gain market share.
Scheduled witnesses include Chuck D, founder of Rapstation.com, who has become a vocal proponent of Napster, which uses a file format called MP3.
At Rapstation.com, music fans can download MP3 files of lesser-known artists and those who have not yet signed recording contracts.
But the Progressive Policy Institute hopes the hearing, and its report, will also focus attention on what it says are needed updates to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
That law, passed in 1998 to extend traditional copyright protections to digital works, specifically exempted providers of Internet access services and search services from liability when their users transmit pirated works.
Napster, a company in San Mateo, Calif.
, that operates an online service, has cited those exemptions as a defense against lawsuits from major record companies, the heavy metal band Metallica and the rap artist Dr.
Dre, who have accused it of engaging in vicarious copyright infringement.
The groups are seeking damages that could add up to billions of dollars.
Napster's software works like a co-op.
It enables users to swap songs by trading files in the MP3 format _ a data-compression formula that turns a CD's music tracks into computer files.
Record companies call it a haven for piracy because it enables distribution of music without any copyright protection.
``To say that Napster should qualify as an ISP is not what the law intended, although it is possible the law could be interpreted that way,'' said Robert D.
Atkinson, director of the institute and a co-author of the report.
``So we just say, let's tighten the law''.
``ISP'' is industry shorthand for ``Internet service provider''.
The report recommends that the digital copyright law be amended ``to hold Napster, its users, and similar services accountable for copyright violations while maintaining protections from liability for service providers that are innocent bystanders to digital piracy''.
The report proposes that services like Napster be required to collect identifiable and verifiable information from its users, such as addresses and credit-card information.
And it recommends that the services be required to remove infringing users within a specific period, perhaps a week, once they are identified.
Napster has argued that it should not be held accountable if its users illegally trade copyrighted music over the Internet, because it does not itself store the music on its computers or engage in trading copyrighted music.
Recently, however, Napster did bar 300,000 fans of the rock group Metallica, after the band said the fans had infringed its copyrights using the service.
Atkinson said no legislation had yet been drafted to address the recommendations in his report.
But he said he hoped that Wednesday's hearing would raise awareness in Washington for the need to update the digital copyright law to address new technologies.
(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Any such proposals would likely be met with resistance from the civil libertarian community, which opposed the original law as potentially limiting access to works that belong in the public domain.
``To say you are going to take a whole new category of software and strangle it in its infancy because one of its first uses resulted in piracy _ that's a bad idea,'' said John Gilmore, president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online liberties group based in San Francisco.
Other likely opponents are telecommunications companies and Internet companies that worked for years to reach the compromise that was passed into law.
``It could open a Pandora's box,'' said Peter Harter, a lobbyist for a company called eMusic, who worked for Netscape when the digital copyright law was passed.
Harter is among the witnesses scheduled to testify Wednesday.
MAPUTO, May 3 (Xinhua) --The First Meeting of States Parties (FMSP) to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction (the "Ottawa Treaty") opened here Monday with over 1,000 participants from 72 countries and international organizations.
Opening the meeting here in Maputo, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano said the meeting offered a good opportunity for mapping out strategies to eliminate anti-personnel land mines to rid peoples of the world of their danger.
He expressed the hope that all parties will coordinate and reach consensus at the meeting to achieve the goal of rooting out land mines in ten years time.
Surveys showed that a total of two million mines have been planted all over Mozambique during the country's civil war.
Therefore, said the president, it will take about 160 years to clear all the mines at the current rate of removing 11,000 mines per year.
The Ottawa Treaty was signed in December 1997 by 135 countries, 74 of which have ratified it.
Its ambitious goal is to clear all the mines on the earth, which is estimated to be over 300 million, before the year 2009.
Chissano called on joint efforts by all countries and the international community to implement the Treaty, which was effective in September, 1998.
The issue of anti-personnel mines has topped the political itinerary of southern Africa.
The 1997 Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit in Malawi issued a declaration asking all SADC members to prohibit anti-personnel mines, treating it as a national policy.
The president revealed that a SADC de-mining committee has been set up to coordinate efforts in this regard.
He appealed to all signatories to the Treaty to ratify it as soon as possible, and those who have not signed the Treaty to do it.
Present at the opening were also Louise Frechette, assistant secretary- general of the United Nations, and Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary -general of the Organization of African Unity.
The meeting is scheduled to end on May 7.
UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ France and Germany on Thursday gave U.N. officials paperwork showing they have ratified a treaty banning anti-personnel land mines.
French Ambassador Alain Dejammet and the deputy German representative, Gerhard Walter Henze, turned in the so-called instruments of ratification, said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but it needs to be ratified by 40 countries to take effect.
So far 25 countries have ratified it.
``Nevertheless, the goal remains to ban anti-personnel mines at a global level,'' the German foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel said in a statement.
``I therefore call once more on those states who have not yet acceded to the convention to do so as soon as possible''.
In a related matter, Malaysia became the 150th country to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, Eckhard said.
JOHANNESBURG, December 2 (Xinhua) --South Africa is to join more than 100 countries in Canada this week to sign a treaty banning the use or possession of anti-personnel mines.
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo is expected to sign the treaty on Wednesday in Ottawa, according to an official statement issued in Pretoria today.
Richard Sherman, spokesman for the South African campaign to ban landmines, said his organization welcomed his country's involvement in a treaty against the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines.
He said the organization also wanted to extend programs for mine clearance and victim assistance.
GENEVA (AP) --An international treaty to ban land mines that kill and maim some 25,000 people each year entered into force today, hailed by ceremonies, choirs, and bells of peace.
The treaty, concluded in Ottawa in 1997, has been signed by 133 countries and ratified by 65 of them.
About 12 countries have destroyed their entire stocks of land mines.
Major users and producers --including the United States, Russia and China -- have refused to join in.
And even with the treaty, it will take still take decades to clear the tens of millions of mines scattered in more than 60 countries.
``The battle ahead is to make this treaty full effective not just in law but also in implementation,'' U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a message to the ceremony in Geneva.
``Not just in the capitals of the signatories but also in the fields and forests where mines still exist; not just in principle but in practice,'' he said.
Underlining the problems, two children were killed and six others seriously wounded when a land mine exploded in northern Rwanda, Rwandan radio reported today.
The treaty, agreed to after a campaign by charities working with victims, commits signatories to ban production, use, stocks and exports of land mines.
President Clinton has set 2006 as a target for joining the accord --saying the United States needs to use mines until then along the tense border between North and South Korea.
Seats for the U.S. delegation were conspicuously empty at the start of a ceremony marking the land mines accord at U.N. headquarters in Geneva.
The sounds of a ``peace bell'' and a children's choir floated through U.N. offices in Vienna, Austria, to mark the accord coming into force.
Susan Walker, coordinator of the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines --which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize -- said her group would this year focus its campaign on the Middle East and former Soviet Union to try to persuade them to go along with the accord.
The cause also was supported by Princess Diana.
Diana drew attention to the issue by making a highly publicized walk through a minefield in Angola in February 1997.
She died in a car crash in Paris on Aug.
31 of that year.
UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ World leaders and international organizations on Thursday praised the quick ratification of a treaty aimed at eliminating anti-personnel land mines which now goes into effect in six months.
At a press conference, ambassadors from Canada, Austria, Norway, South Africa and Burkina Faso _ countries that either drafted the treaty or hosted negotiations on it _ congratulated one another for their work.
The treaty will take effect March 1, 1999.
The United Nations made the announcement Wednesday after the West African nation of Burkina Faso became the 40th country to ratify the pact.
The treaty required ratification by 40 nations and their legislatures to go into effect in those countries.
``It is important...
that the 40th ratification comes from Africa, which is now in so much suffering as a result of anti-personnel mine infestation,'' Canadian Ambassador Robert Fowler said.
Nations that ratify the treaty pledge to destroy all stockpiles of mines within four years and clear all mines from their territory within 10 years.
``It is common knowledge that Africa is the continent afflicted most by the scourge of anti-personnel land mines.
Practically more then one-third of all land mines can be found on the continent,'' said Pieter Vermeulen, a deputy ambassador from South Africa.
In London, British Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd said the success in ratifying the treaty ``reflects the international community's determination to rid the world of anti-personnel mines, and sends a clear signal to those who have not signed.
```Our task now is to persuade those countries to sign without further delay, and to remove the millions of mines already laid across the world''.
The United States has refused to sign or ratify the treaty, maintaining such weapons are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea from invading South Korea.
Russia and China are also holding out, contending they need land mines for defensive purposes.
Tens of millions of land mines are scattered in more than 60 countries, and they kill or injure an estimated 20,000 people each year, mostly innocent civilians.
The mines have also rendered huge swaths of productive land unusable.
Last December, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and its American coordinator, Jody Williams, won the Nobel Peace Prize for its six years of worldwide campaigning that resulted in 122 countries signing the treaty in Ottawa last year.
U.S. President Bill Clinton wants the United States to approve the treaty by 2006, but only if the armed forces are able to come up with an alternative weapon by then.
The Pentagon has requested dlrs 4.7 million in the fiscal 1999 budget for the program.
One possibility is a weapon that would temporarily disable an approaching enemy, but not kill.
Another involves sensors that warn of a foe's approach and then trigger weapons.
In a statement, the ICBL expressed ``grave concern about reports of the continued laying of mines in a number of countries that have signed but not ratified the treaty, such as Angola, Cambodia, Senegal and Sudan.
The ICBL also condemned the use of mines in non-signatory states such as Yugoslavia, where Serb forces have reportedly planted mines along the border of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and Albania to discourage arms smuggling.
In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross issued a statement saying ``real success will be measured in terms of fewer victims, the replanting of fertile farmland and the resumption of normal life in communities plagued by landmines.''
ZAWTAR SHARQIYEH, Lebanon (AP) --Boyish curiosity drew Ammar Serhal to an abandoned Israeli position near his village, one of scores of bases and checkpoints hastily vacated as Israel ended its occupation of south Lebanon.
There, the 12-year-old discovered that though the shooting and shelling of the volatile occupation years was over, Lebanon had not seen the end of the heartache.
On the very day Israel pulled out --May 24 -- he stepped on an antipersonnel mine that chopped off his left leg above the knee and badly damaged his right leg.
International anti-mine campaigners said Thursday that a global treaty against the use of mines has made a difference in the first year and a half of its life, but problems remain.
Countries that have ratified the treaty were to meet in Switzerland next week.
Neither Israel nor Lebanon has signed the treaty.
According to police, nine people have died and 62 others injured in explosions of land mines and unexploded shells since the Israeli withdrawal from the border zone it held in Lebanon for 18 years as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attack.
U.N. officers estimate at least 50,000 mines were planted, most by Israel and its Lebanese militia allies in their fight against elusive guerrillas.
Guerrillas also planted mines.
Lebanese authorities had planned an awareness campaign to warn people of the danger of mines and unexploded shells.
The Israelis' withdrawal six weeks ahead of their self-declared deadline of July 7 lent urgency to the brochures, posters and warnings on radio and television, which began just as the first casualties started coming in.
Thousands of people flooded south Lebanon after Israeli troops left to return home or to celebrate.
On May 24, Ammar ventured to the vacated hilltop Israeli position of Ali Taher, from where his Shiite Muslim village of Zawtar Sharqiyeh, 47 miles southeast of Beirut, had been targeted by gunfire and shelling almost every day during the Israeli occupation.
Ammar said the mine that maimed him did not kill his dreams.
''I think I will still be able to become a history teacher and draw paintings as I always wanted.
But I don't think I will be able to play soccer anymore,'' he said.
The Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers are clearing mines in the southern region which, counting the former Israeli-occupied zone and the front line, amounts to more than 10 percent of Lebanese territory.
The effort is hindered by the difficult terrain, lack of maps and limited funding.
The government has said $8.6 million was needed to clear the south of land mines.
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) --The South African Campaign Against Landmines has called on President Bill Clinton of the United States to sign a treaty banning landmines.
The call coincides with Clinton's 11-day tour of six African countries, namely Ghana, Uganda, Senegal, South Africa, Botswana and Rwanda.
In a statement issued here Wednesday, the group said it is ironic the American leader is visiting Africa to discuss economic recovery support.
But it said one of the most critical impending recovery on the continent is the millions of hectares of land that cannot be developed as a result of millions of explosive devices.
The group said Africa is a continent solidly behind a treaty prohibiting production, stockpiling, transfer and use of anti-personnel mines.
A total of 38 African countries, including the 14 members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), have signed the treaty.
But the U.S. government refuses to approve it.
However, the anti-landmine campaign said all the countries Clinton is touring have played major roles in global efforts to create a mine-free world.
The South African lobby group said while Clinton travels through Africa, it is collecting signatures protesting against U.S. policy on the explosive devices.
South Africa, a former producer,destroyed more than three million of its anti-personnel landmine stockpiles before it signed the international convention last year.
KIEV, December 2 (Xinhua) --Ukraine will not be among the first batch to sign the Convention to Ban Anti-Personnel Mines, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry announced today.
A ministry spokesman told a news briefing that Ukraine rejected the signing because the destruction of anti-personnel weapons needed a large amount of money and Ukraine could not afford the financial burden.
The spokesman did not rule out a possible signing in the future.
A three-day conference on the land mines ban is being held in Ottawa, Canada, and most of the participating countries are expected to sign the treaty.
Under the pact, signatories will be required to destroy their reserves of land mines within four years.
The spokesman said Ukraine stopped manufacturing mines and had suspended mine exports since 1995.
AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan signed a global land mine treaty Saturday, joining 127 other countries that have endorsed the pact, which prohibits the use, production and stockpiling of the weapon.
The announcement was made by Queen Noor, King Hussein's American-born wife.
``I would like to begin by announcing with great pride and hope that, as of this morning, the Jordanian Cabinet approved the signing of the Ottawa convention,'' Noor told more than 250 people from more than 20 countries at a conference on land mines.
Delegates at the two-day meeting are discussing ways of assisting mine victims in the Middle East.
It is hosted by the Landmine Survivors Network, a private organization based in Washington, D.C.
The Ottawa convention, which was reached in Canada last December, has been signed by 127 nations.
Twenty-three nations have so far ratified the treaty, which must be ratified by 40 states to take effect.
It prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transferring of anti-personnel land mines.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Burkino Faso became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines Wednesday, meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months, the United Nations announced.
Carol Bellamy, director of the United Nations Children's Fund, was to travel to Bosnia on Thursday to mark the occasion.
The treaty was signed by more than 120 countries at a landmark meeting in Ottawa last December.
Nations that ratify the treaty pledged to destroy all stockpiles of mines within four years and clear away all mines from their territory within 10 years.
Forty countries needed to ratify the treaty for it to take effect.
With Burkina Faso's ratification, the treaty will go into force in March, after a preparatory period of six months, U.N. officials said.
``Today, the world has taken a step toward becoming a safer and more humane place,'' Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a statement.
The treaty ``will have far-reaching implications for both mine-affected and mine-producing countries''.
Carol Bellamy, director of the U.N.
International Children's Fund, congratulated the countries that ratified the treaty.
``We stand at an historic moment in the struggle to end the anguish that these weapons have already inflicted on tens of thousands of the world's children, their families and their communities,'' she said in a statement.
The United States has refused to ratify the treaty, arguing that such weapons are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter an invasion by North Korea of South Korea.
Tens of millions of land mines are scattered in more than 60 countries, and an estimated 20,000 people are killed or injured each year, mostly innocent civilians.
Last December, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and its American coordinator, Jody Williams, won the Nobel Peace Prize for its six years of worldwide campaigning that resulted in 122 countries signing the treaty in Ottawa.
With Williams as campaign coordinator, the ICBL grew into a global movement, backed by more than 1,000 organizations and millions of people, including Britain's late Princess Diana.
WASHINGTON _ It has been two years since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, gave a last, emotional boost to an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines, then being feverishly negotiated in Oslo.
Many say her efforts to draw attention to the fiendish effects of mines before her death may be one of her greatest legacies.
But what kind of legacy is it?
Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use, production and stockpiling, anti-personnel land mines appear to be as popular as ever in fighting wars these days.
Yugoslav troops planted thousands of them during 18 months of civil war in Kosovo.
So did the ethnic Albanian rebels they were fighting.
Russia has acknowledged using them in recent weeks against Islamic insurgents in the southern province of Dagestan (and apologized to neighboring Georgia for accidentally dropping some of them from aircraft into Georgian territory).
Their use has been reported in the recent flareups between India and Pakistan and between Eritrea and Ethiopia, as well as in civil wars in Turkey, Colombia, Congo, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.
In a survey completed last April, the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, reported that governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines in the 15 months after the treaty was signed, though before it officially went into force.
Among those were three that signed the treaty banning them: Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Angola, the country Diana made the focus of her own anti-mine crusade.
What's more, despite the campaign's publicity, several major countries still refuse to adopt the treaty, including the United States, Russia and China, mostof the nations in the Middle East and many in Asia.
``It is a little disheartening,'' said Marissa Vitagliano, the coordinator of the U.S.
Campaign to Ban Land Mines.
She and other supporters of a ban say it is far too soon to write off the treaty as a failure.
On the contrary, they point to progress that has been made, especially in reducing the worldwide production of mines and their availability in the international arms market, according to arms control monitors.
Mary Fowler, the deputy chief of the U.N.'s Mine Action Service in New York, noted that the countries that have signed on to a ban have destroyed 14 million mines that had been stockpiled when the treaty was written two years ago.
Even countries that have so far refused to sign the treaty _ including the United States and Russia _ have pledged to stop exporting mines and to stop making certain kinds altogether.
Perhaps the treaty's greatest impact has been on public perception.
Reports of mines now evoke images of legless veterans, of maimed children, of Diana in protective gear walking near a minefield in Angola.
``Many, many mines were used in the Persian Gulf war, but no one thought about it,'' Ms.
Fowler said.
``Everybody is aware that mines were used in Kosovo.
The treaty is setting a new international standard''.
Still, as events have shown, a standard is one thing, the eradication of mines another.
Mines are cheap and durable and deadly.
In Yugoslavia, which has not signed the treaty, Serbian troops heavily mined the routes along the mountainous borders with Albania and Macedonia that the Kosovo Liberation Army used to get in and out of the province; that forced the guerrillas into areas that exposed them to Yugoslav fire.
Serbian police also used mines to booby-trap ransacked Albanian homes to keeP refugees from returning home.
(Many returned anyway, and died as a result).
Another reason for discouragement is the weakness of the treaty itself.
The treaty _ the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction _ went into effect March 1, 1999, six months after the 40th nation ratified it, but it has little force.
There is no governing organization to oversee it and no mechanism to punish those who violate it.
It essentially relies on member states to monitor themselves and honestly report on what stockpiles they have and the efforts they are making to destroy them.
Supporters hope that global peer pressure will gradually force nations to comply.
``You don't expect everybody to stop using mines overnight,'' said Caleb Rossiter, an analyst now conducting a study on mine strategy in Korea for the Vietnam Veterans of America.
``Treaties like this take a long time to sink in''.
There is universal agreement among the treaty's supporters that the biggest obstacle to that is the fact that the United States won't sign it.
Despite once advocating a ban, President Clinton bowed to pressure from Pentagon commanders opposed to the treaty's restrictions.
They insist they need the most common type of land mines _ those left buried in the ground _ to protect South Korea from North Korea.
They also want to keep using ``smart'' anti-personnel mines, sophisticated devices that self-destruct after a time, to shield larger anti-tank mines, which are not prohibited by the treaty since the weight of a human is not enough to trigger them.
The administration has pledged to sign the treaty in the future _ but only after the Pentagon develops alternatives to mines, a process critics say has moved slowly.
``I don't think anybody questions the fact that we would be much further along if the United States was not only a participant in the treaty, but an active one,'' said Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
, one of the most ardent advocates of a ban.
Without U.S. support, Leahy added, ``a lot of countries will say, `Why should we sign when the United States, the most powerful country on earth, says it's not strong enough to give up land mines?'''
LONDON (AP) _ Britain's ban on land mines will become total with the elimination of an exemption for ``exceptional circumstances,'' the government said Friday.
On July 10, under pressure to show support for Princess Diana's final campaign against land mines before the anniversary of her death Aug.
31, the House of Commons rushed through a bill ratifying the international treaty banning their use.
But it will not come into effect for some months, until at least 40 of the more than 120 signatories have ratified it.
Prime Minister Tony Blair's government had imposed a moratorium on the operational use of anti-personnel land mines by British forces in May.
An exemption was allowed for the weapons' use in exceptional circumstances, such as to defend an occupied zone.
Defense Secretary George Robertson said Friday that a total ban was being implemented to send a ``clear signal'' to the rest of the world.
Robertson, speaking to BBC radio before making a formal announcement to Parliament, said a concerted effort must be made to get countries that have not signed the convention to do so.
Removing the exemption would reinforce Britain's position, he said.
``We will wipe that away now to make sure that a very clear signal goes out to the rest of the world,'' he told BBC.
``We must now go out there and use Britain's moral authority to make sure that our position becomes the international standard,'' he said.
More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but would not come into force for at least another nine months.
It has to be ratified by a minimum of 40 countries.
Half of Britain's one million landmines have already been destroyed. (acw)
JOHANNESBURG, August 4 (Xinhua) --The International Campaign to Ban Landmines has called on all 14 member states of Southern African Development Community (SADC) to join the mine ban treaty, report reached here said on Friday.
In a message to SADC acting Executive Secretary Prega Ramsamy, the campaigners said they are concerned that SADC members Tanzania, Angola and Zambia have not ratified the treaty and the Democratic Republic of the Congo has not even signed it.
Forty-five of the 53 nations in Africa have signed the treaty, which prohibits use, production, trade in or stockpiling of antipersonnel mines.
BEIRUT, November 14 (Xinhua) --Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy today failed to take Lebanon into signing the Convention to Ban Anti-Personnel Mines during meetings with Lebanese leaders.
When meeting with Axworthy, Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz said if Israel signs the treaty, it will become easier for Lebanon to sign it.
Lebanon is concerned about the issue, but it is impossible for Lebanon to sign it while Israel is outside it, he added.
Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berry expressed the same idea at the meeting.
Lebanon rejected the signing to the ban because the Islamic resistance in the south uses anti-personnel weapons in its fight against Israeli occupation.
Axworthy explained to reporters at a joint news conference with Boueiz that the aim of signing the treaty is to help the countries concerned remove the mines and provide victims with financial assistance.
Axworthy arrived in Beirut Thursday night on his ongoing tour of the region aimed at drumming up support for the treaty that prohibits the manufacture, trade and use of anti-personnel land mines.
In addition to talks with Lebanese leaders, including President Elias Hrawi, Axworthy went to the country's southern port city of Saida Friday afternoon to meet with a group of children victims of land mines.
Canada signed the treaty several months ago and destroyed its last land mine last week.
A conference on the land mine ban will be held in Ottawa on December 2-4 when those participating countries are expected to sign the treaty.
Canada hoped Lebanon can be among the first batch to sign.
The Mideast tour has taken the Canadian foreign minister to Egypt, Israel and Jordan, and will take him to Syria Friday night.
VIENNA, Austria (AP) --Military representatives of 33 countries as well as non-governmental organizations opened a four-day conference Tuesday aimed eliminating land mines throughout Europe.
The conference, organized by the Austrian defense ministry, the Italian armed forces and the West European Union, is to improve cooperation in mine detection and destruction.
``The seminar is a sign of a new era in cooperation in the fields of disarmament and humanitarian assistance,'' Austrian Gen.
Karl Majecen told the conference during opening ceremonies.
Austrian mine clearing experts are working with their counterparts from other countries in detecting and destroying landmines in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Golan Heights between Syria and Israel.
The conference is expected to include discussions on ways to compile information and databanks on non-standard landmines, making them easier to disarm safely.
Majecen said it was time for European countries to coordinate their activities and share information in landmine technology and ways to detect and disarm them During his speech, Italian Defense Minister Massimo Brutti praised efforts by Europe and international organizations to remove ``these instruments of death''.
Brutti said Italy had already taken steps to comply with the 1997 Ottawa Treaty which bans the production, storage and use of such weapons.
The United States refused to sign the treaty because it wants to maintain landmines in the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea.
The Pentagon also wants to exempt anti-personnel mines designed to deter tampering with larger anti-tank mines not covered by the treaty.
Washington is also lobbying NATO countries to allow the stockpiling of anti-personnel mines until the year 2003.
Critics accuse the Americans of trying to undermine the treaty among their European allies. (reid/me)
OTTAWA, December 4 (Xinhua) --The treaty-signing conference on a global ban on landmines concluded here today, with 121 countries put their signatures onto the document.
The treaty goes into effect six months after 40 countries ratify it.
Those who have signed then have four years to destroy their stockpiles of landmines and 10 years to clear minefields.
The signing here is "just a beginning", Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy told the 500-plus delegates from government, non-government organizations and international agencies.
"We must act now and seize the moment," he said, waving a thick document titled An Agenda for Mine Action.
The document was a "framework of a blueprint" and it "sets out directions," he said.
The treaty, negotiated and adopted in Oslo, Norway, in September, bans the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel landmines.
MAPUTO, July 13 (Xinhua) --The Mozambican Anti-landmine Campaign has called upon the parliaments of the Community of Portuguese-speaking States to approve the Ottawa Convention, which bans production, use and stock of lethal land mines, as soon as possible.
The anti-landmine group said in a statement carried by the Noticias newspaper that the use of lethal land mines is violation of basic human rights.
The statement urged the heads of parliament of Mozambique, Brazil, Portugal, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau and Sao Tome and Principe to rethink of the issue of land mines and to support the Ottawa Convention so as to make the whole world free from such mines by the year 2010.
The seven members of the Community of Portuguese-speaking States have signed and approved the anti-landmine convention, but more than 50 countries have not approved the treaty.
The statement expressed regret that the Angolan government and the rebel National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), against the convention, are still using lethal land mines, killing and maiming innocent people, and women and children in particular.
It called upon Portugal, the only member of the Community of Portuguese- speaking States which is able to produce lethal land mines, to stop the mine production and destroy the land mines in stock.
It further asked the Portuguese-speaking countries to exert influence upon the governments concerned in a bid to help the victims of land mines and accelerate the demining process around the world.
MAPUTO, May 6 (Xinhua) --Angola's Deputy Foreign Minister, Toko Serrao said here Thursday that Angola, which is still locked in a civil war, will continue to use anti-personnel land mines.
Serrao made the remarks at the on-going meeting of the signatory states of the convention on the prohibition of the use, storage, production and transference of anti-personnel land mines being held in Maputo, capital of Mozambique.
Serrao is the first Angolan senior official to make a speech at the meeting which started on May 3.
Angolan government has been criticized these days for not observing the land mine prohibition convention, which the Angolan government signed on December 4, 1997.
A report titled "Toward a Mine-free World Monitor Report 1999" said that both the government and the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) had used anti-personnel land mines after they were thrown into renewed civil war in late1998.
An investigator with an international mines prohibition campaign even said new land mine zones had cropped up in eastern Angola's Luena district, and that the local government prevented any move of clearing land mines in the area.
Though the international organization admitted that Angola does not produce or export land mines, it said they have found, in Angola, about 60 kinds of anti-personnel land mines imported from over 10 countries.
It is said that one out of 415 Angolans has been a victim of land mine in this southern African country with a population of 12 million.
Angola, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Namibia are the four countries which suffer most from land mines in the southern African region.
About 250,000 people were killed by land mines and another 500,000 injured by them in this region in the past 20 years.
The land mine prohibition meeting, which has attracted about 1,000 representatives from 72 countries and organizations including the United Nations, will come to a close Friday.
GENEVA (AP) --A global treaty to ban the use of land mines has made a significant difference in its first 18 months, but major blackspots -- among them Chechnya, Kosovo and Myanmar -- remain, anti-mine campaigners said Thursday.
Angola continues to use the weapons although it has signed the treaty, while Burundi and Sudan ''likely'' do so, according to the Landmine Monitor 2000 report.
Sudan has denied the allegation.
The study said Yugoslav forces laid some 50,000 land mines during the Kosovo conflict and that Chechnya also saw heavy laying of mines.
The report, produced by the Nobel laureate International Campaign to Ban Landmines, will be presented next week to a Geneva meeting of countries that have ratified a 1997 treaty outlawing the weapons.
''We have turned the tide in the battle against mines,'' the 1,121-page report said.
It found that trade in the weapons has almost completely halted, with no shipments recorded this year or last.
Since the treaty came into force on March 1 last year, some 10 million stockpiled antipersonnel mines have been destroyed, bringing the total so far to 22 million, it said.
The study estimated that more than 250 million mines remain stockpiled in 105 nations.
China leads the list with some 110 million mines, followed by Russia with 60-70 million, Belarus with 10-15 million and the United States with 11 million, it said.
Ukraine, Pakistan and India each were estimated to have stocks of more than 4 million mines.
Estimates of deaths and injuries were ''sketchy and incomplete,'' the study conceded.
But it found marked decreases in countries including Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cambodia and Mozambique.
Still, new land mine victims have been recorded in 71 countries, more than half of them at peace, it said.
In Kosovo, 492 deaths and injuries were recorded in the year to May; in Chechnya, ''hundreds'' were suspected.
Since the treaty came into effect the weapons likely have been used in 20 conflicts, by 11 governments and 30 rebel groups.
The treaty has been signed by 138 governments and ratified by 101.
Among those who have not signed are the United States, Russia and China.
Washington maintains land mines are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea from invading South Korea.
President Clinton wants the United States to approve the treaty by 2006, but only if the armed forces are able to come up with an alternative.
Russia and China say they need land mines for defensive purposes.
Antipersonnel mines have been used in eight conflicts in Africa over the past year, more than any other continent, Landmine Monitor said.
They killed or maimed more than 1,000 people in Angola.
The report said Colombia, where the two biggest rebel factions have used land mines, is the only country in the Americas where they are now being used.
In Asia, mines were used in at least six conflicts over the past year --among them in Kashmir and the Philippines where, the study said, three rebel groups have used mines or improvised explosives.
Government forces and at least 10 armed ethnic groups in Myanmar laid mines ''in significant numbers'' --resulting in 1,500 mine victims last year -- while both sides used them in Sri Lanka's civil war, it added.
UNITED NATION (AP) _ A Nobel Peace Prize winner, a queen, a billionaire financier, a foreign minister and the U.N. deputy secretary-general joined forces Thursday to fight the next battles in the campaign to ban anti-personnel land mines.
With a land mine treaty ratified in record time, they want every nation to sign it and the millions of land mines that continue to kill, maim and sow terror around the world removed.
And they launched a new fund, which already has contributions and pledges of over dlrs 1.3 million.
``We have never thought that the treaty itself was victory,'' said Jody Williams, co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for her six year crusade with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines that resulted in 122 countries signing the treaty in Ottawa in December.
The land mine campaign brought together governments, grassroots organizations, the United Nations, big business, the late Princess Diana, and ordinary citizens in a unique partnership which Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said is becoming a new model for action on a range of international humanitarian issues including curbing small arms.
The news conference in the U.N.
Trusteeship Chamber launching the land mine campaign's next battlegrounds reflected the new alliance: Williams was flanked by Axworthy, Queen Noor of Jordan, billionaire financier George Soros, U.N.
Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette and Norway's U.N.
Ambassador Ole Peter Kolby.
The queen recalled that she and her husband, King Hussein, were driving in Minnesota, where he is receiving cancer treatment, when they received a call on Sept.
16 that Burkina Faso had become the 40th nation to ratify the land mine treaty _ which meant it would go into effect in March 1999.
``There was a huge `whoopie' that emanated from this car...
throughout the Minnesota countryside that I know was just a faint echo of jubilation that would have been spreading around the world at that time,'' she said.
Since mid-September, five more nations have ratified the treaty, most recently Japan.
Axworthy said Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was ``so enthusiastic'' that he woke him at 6 a.m. to tell him about the ratification.
``It just continues to demonstrate the momentum in the world to make this thing real,'' Williams said.
Noor said it was encouraging that major producers and exporters including France, Germany, Britain and Hungary had already ratified the treaty.
But the United States has refused to sign the convention, maintaining that land mines are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea from invading South Korea.
Russia and China are also holding out, contending they need land mines for defensive purposes.
While the United States has pledged money for demining efforts and assisting victims, Soros said to enthusiastic applause: ``I think the greatest contribution they could make actually is signing the treaty''.
U.S. President Bill Clinton wants the United States to approve the treaty by 2006, but only if the armed forces are able to come up with an alternative weapon by then.
Williams, an American, urged governments and private institutions to contribute to a fund set up with the dlrs 500,000 which the International Campaign received as co-winner of the Nobel prize to continue the campaign's activities ``until we truly eradicate this weapon and aid all the victims''.
Soros pledged dlrs 300,000 and urged the private sector to contribute.
``I think that there is plenty of money out there and I hope that it will rise to the occasion,'' he said.
``This has to be a long-range commitment.
... While we are celebrating, land mines are being used in Kosovo, for instance''.
Axworthy announced a 300,000 Canadian dollar contribution (U.S.
dlrs 196,000).
Kolby announced a Norwegian contribution of dlrs 200,000.
And Williams said Ireland last week donated dlrs 150,000 .
BANGKOK, October 25 (Xinhua) --Thailand is poised to ratify the Mine Ban Treaty of 1997 after the army submitted the letter of affirmation to the Foreign Ministry on Thursday, The Nation reported Sunday.
After several months of vetting and delay, the Permanent Secretary's Office of Defense informed the Foreign Ministry, which is coordinating preparations for the ratification process of the treaty, that it is agreeable to the original text and the Thai translation.
The air force and navy have both submitted their letters of affirmation to the ministry.
The Interior Ministry and the National Security Council have yet to reply.
The treaty, which will become an international law in March next year, imposes a comprehensive ban on using, stockpiling, producing and transporting anti-personnel mines.
Thailand would need at least 800 million baht (21 million U.S. dollars) to clear mines and rehabilitate the victims of land mines.
CACERES, Spain (AP) _ Spain began destroying its stockpile of over 800,000 anti-personal landmines Monday, in compliance with last December's Ottawa treaty.
The first three mines were symbolically incinerated at an explosives factory near this western Spanish city by Defense Minister Eduardo Serra, ministry spokesman Antonio Castro said.
About 1,000 mines are due to pass through the factory's incinerators every day for over two years at a total cost of over 500 million pesetas (dlrs 3.3 million).
A small proportion of the mines will be kept for use in training exercises, Castro said.
An international draft treaty banning the production, export and use of landmines was signed by 121 nations in Ottawa, Canada last December.
The treaty allowed four years for the destruction of all stockpiled land mines, and 10 years for the deactivation of minefields.
Serra told reporters that Spain was at ``the vanguard'' of landmine destruction.
The ministry is destroying Spanish landmines, leaving a question mark over what will happen to mines belonging to United States military bases in Spanish territory, Castro said.
The U.S. did not sign the Ottawa treaty and is therefore not obliged to destroy its own mines, but anti-mine campaigners have been pressuring signatories to destroy all mines within their borders.
An estimated 100 million antipersonnel mines are deployed in about 60 countries worldwide, often killing or crippling people decades after a conflict has ended.
GENEVA (AP) _ The ratification of a treaty aimed at eliminating anti-personnel land mines will make the task of returning refugees to former war zones easier and safer, the U.N. refugee agency said Monday.
As well as preventing future laying of land mines, it will encourage authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, Mozambique and elsewhere to do more mine clearing, said U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Kris Janowski.
The ratification would also help reduce refugees' reluctance to return to their homes because they fear that mines are still buried nearby, he said.
Nations that ratify the treaty pledge to destroy all stockpiles of mines within four years and clear all mines from their territory within 10 years.
UNHCR estimates that up to 700,000 mines are still planted in areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina which were in the front line during the war.
``The mine pollution is enormous,'' Janowski said.
In a press release, U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata welcomed the ratification of the treaty, entitled the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti Personnel Mines and their Destruction.
``It's a gigantic step toward the safety of returning refugees,'' Ogata said.
The treaty will take effect March 1, 1999.
The United Nations made the announcement last Wednesday after the West African nation of Burkina Faso became the 40th country to ratify the pact.
The treaty required ratification by 40 nations and their legislatures to go into effect in those countries.
The United States has refused to sign or ratify it, maintaining that mines are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea from invading South Korea.
Russia and China are also holding out, contending they need land mines for defensive purposes.
Tens of millions of land mines are scattered in more than 60 countries, and they kill or injure an estimated 20,000 people each year, mostly innocent civilians.

NAIROBI, October 23 (Xinhua) --Kenya will next year ratify the Ottawa Treaty banning the use of land mines, according to a senior Kenyan government official.
There is need for protection of human rights as provided for in the international humanitarian law, the Kenya Times newspaper Saturday quoted Attorney-General Amos Wako as saying.
Some 133 states have signed the treaty and Kenya was the 122nd country to sign in December 1997.
About 42 countries out of the 53 member states of the Organization of African Unity have endorsed the treaty.
WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Namibia has become the 24th country to ratify the Ottawa Convention banning land mines.
The ban on use, production and stockpiling of the anti-personnel weapon has been signed by 127 countries.
The treaty must be ratified by 40 countries to become official.
The National Assembly ratified the treaty on Wednesday.
The treaty also requires member states to destroy existing mines.
Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab said Namibia, located on Africa's southwest Atlantic coast, would keep a small number of mines for training in destruction and research.
The International Campaign to Ban Landmines and its former leader Jody Williams won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for their work in bringing world attention to the issue. (sapa/pr/djw)
DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government will have until April 15 of next year to try to stop the United Nations from declaring Kakadu National Park endangered because of the Jabiluka uranium mine.
At its meeting in Kyoto, Japan, UNESCO's World Heritage Bureau on Saturday night expressed ``grave concerns'' about the impact Jabiluka would have on Kakadu's cultural and natural world values.
But after intensive lobbying from the Australian government, the bureau decided not to immediately put the park on its list of world heritage areas considered to be in danger.
Instead it ordered Australian authorities to provide a detailed report by April 15 next year saying what had been done to ``prevent further damage and to mitigate all the threats'' to the park posed by Jabiluka''.
The bureau said that if the report did not show that the threats posed by Jabiluka had been properly dealt with, Kakadu should immediately be put on the in danger list, joining other areas such as the war-torn old city of Jerusalem.
Last Wednesday, the committee called for the scrapping of the mine.
Federal Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted the report as biased, unbalanced and lacking in objectivity.
And while the report was thought to be an embarrassment to the Australian government, Hill stressed that the committee's findings had no legal standing and that construction of the mine would not stop.
Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers) of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or endangered.
The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and cultural values.
About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.
The report said the mine, which could process 19.5 million metric tons of uranium ore over its 28-year life, could damage the environment.
CANBERRA, November 29 (Xinhua) --The Greens accused the Howard government's standing on Kakadu National Park by saying it had become the world's leading environmental pirate for its role in stopping the immediate listing of Kakadu as an endangered area.
Greens Senator Bob Brown said Sunday that the World Heritage Bureau Saturday night in Kyoto, Japan, granted the Australian government until April 15 to produce evidence why the United Nations should not declare Kakadu National Park, which surrounds the Jabiluka uranium mine, endangered.
"The Howard Government has now in the space of 12 months become the leading agent in undermining world agreements and environmental conventions," Brown was quoted by Australian Associated Press as saying.
"It has become the ace environmental pirate on the planet and Australia's international reputation is being very grievously damaged".
At its meeting in Kyoto, the heritage bureau expressed "grave concerns" about the impact Jabiluka would have on Kakadu's cultural and natural values.
But after intensive lobbying from the government the bureau decided not to immediately put the park on its list of world heritage areas considered to be in danger.
Instead it ordered Australian authorities to provide a detailed report saying what had been done to "prevent further damage and to mitigate all the threats" to the park posed by Jabiluka.
If that report was not satisfactory, the bureau said Kakadu should immediately be put on the in danger list, joining the likes of the war torn old city of Jerusalem.
Brown said the delay would see Australia's reputation "dragged through the environmental and cultural fires from experts right around the globe".
The bureau's recommendation would be put to the World Heritage Committee this week for a final decision.
It was unlikely the committee would disagree with the bureau.
"This has come out of an intense political lobby devoid of any environmental or cultural rhyme or reason by the Howard Government".
Brown said he would write to the bureau to say millions of Australians, international experts and the local Aboriginal people did not agree with its decision.
"You cannot proceed with building a mine without damaging the cultural and environmental values of the Jabiluka valley and therefore the world heritage area," he said.
CANBERRA, April 15 (Xinhua) --The following are major news items in leading Australian newspapers Thursday.
The Australian: --The Australian government's environmental report on the Jabiluka uranium mine (located in Kakadu Natural Park), to be released Thursday, found the area is not under threat and attacked a UNESCO report that said Kakadu Natural Park was in danger.
The Sydney Morning Herald: --A freak hail storm swept across Sydney Wednesday night, causing damage worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
The Age: --Euthanasia campaigner Dr.

JABIRU, Australia (AP) _ Archaeological sites that show humans lived in Australia up to 60,000 years ago could be damaged by a uranium mine being built within the Kakadu National Park, a high-level U.N. committee was told Wednesday.
The Australian branch of the International Council on Monuments and Sites said the impact on archaeological and rock art sites in the region of the mine had not been properly assessed.
In a submission to the U.N. team, which is investigating whether the mine threatens the environmental and cultural values of Kakadu, the council said it was particularly concerned about the Malakunanja 2 archaeological site, just 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) from the mine entrance.
``Malakunanja 2 is acknowledged as currently offering the oldest dated evidence of human occupation in Australia, dating some 50,000-60,000 years ago based on thermoluminescence dating of buried sands,'' the submission said.
The council was ``not convinced that the archaeological evidence of Malakunanja 2 will retain its integrity given the pressures of the proposed mine''.
Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.
has begun construction of the Jabiluka mine, which lies on a lease within the boundaries of Kakadu but technically not part of the park.
Environmental groups and local Aborigines oppose the mine.
``It is not certain what impacts noise, vibration, dust and changes to the water table might have on the natural processes of deterioration (of the site) and whether any acceleration of deterioration will occur,'' the council said.
It called on the delegation to declare Kakadu a world heritage area that is ``in danger'' unless Jabiluka is stopped.
The delegation will recommend whether to list Kakadu as the 26th ``in danger'' site of the 552 sites recognized by the United Nations' World Heritage Bureau for environmental and cultural values.
The decision will be made at the bureau's meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December.
ERA and Australia's government claim Jabiluka will not hurt the park.
If listed as in danger, Kakadu would join the likes of the old city of Jerusalem, Cambodia's Angkor temples, and the war-torn cities of Dubrovnik in Croatia and Timbuktu in the African state of Mali.
Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers) of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or endangered.
The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and cultural values.
About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.
CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's conservative government defied a U.N. body's declaration that Kakadu National Park is a World Heritage area by declaring it will allow uranium mining at Jabiluka within the park.
The U.N.
Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization did accept a plea from the Australian government that it be given six months to respond to the panel's ruling.
But the panel recommended that all mining activities should cease in the meantime.
It said the mine, which could process 19.5 million metric tons of uranium ore over its 28-year life, could damage the environment.
The local Mirrar Aboriginal people have been among the most vocal critics of the project, which although actually inside the Northern Territory national park, has been technically excluded as an enclave within it.
Environment Minister Robert Hill said he would compile a comprehensive rebuttal of the UNESCO report, which he has described as superficial and unbalanced.
But he would not tell uranium miner Energy Resources of Australia, which is still 18 months away from mining the first uranium and is still doing preparatory work, to comply with the UNESCO call.
``We are quite satisfied with all the Australian processes for approval of the mine,'' Hill said.
``The mine is not in a world heritage listed area nor in a national park and it will cause neither environmental nor cultural damage,'' Hill said.
Hill said UNESCO's report, made after only a four-day visit to the mine site, ignored the enormous body of evidence gathered over 18 years of mining at Ranger just 12 miles (20 km) from Jabiluka.
Australia's environmental groups reacted immediately to Hill's announcement saying it would seriously damage Australia's reputation.
Greens party Senator Bob Brown said, ``Even major uranium buyers like France, Japan and the U.S. --members of the World Heritage Committee -- voted to stop this obscene mine''.
``If Australia defies the world umpire on the World Heritage Convention no treaty will be seen as safe,'' Brown added.
Environmentalists say reputable surveys show that 82 percent of Australians oppose mining in areas like Kakadu.
They claim that the government's rebuttal of the UNESCO report shows it to be both arrogant and out of touch with its own people and the rest of the world.
Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,200 sq.
km). of flood plains and plateau on Australia's north coast, with waterfalls and hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or endangered.
The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and cultural values.

CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Police arrested more than 100 protesters Tuesday at Energy Resources of Australia's Jabiluka mine development at Kakadu, a world heritage listed area in the Northern Territory.
The 112 were among 130 who entered a machinery compound at dawn, according to a statement issued by the protesters.
Of these 130, 20 ``locked on'' to machinery in the compound.
The protesters, who have been campaigning at the site since March, want development of the Jabiluka mine stopped.
The arrests Tuesday bring the total since the protest action began to about 350.
ERA has identified more than 90,000 metric tons of uranium oxide in ore at Jabiluka and plans to mine the deposit over 30 years.
The company already mines uranium ore at the nearby Ranger mine.
Philip Shirvington, ERA's chief executive, has said independent scientific studies have found no adverse impact on the environment from uranium mining at Ranger.
SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A rowdy group of protesters was ejected from uranium miner Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.'s annual general meeting Thursday after interrupting chairman Campbell Anderson's address.
Those ejected, members of an environmental group called the Wilderness Society, had been protesting against the company's Jabiluka mine development in the Northern Territory.
The demonstrators had bought shares in ERA, a subsidiary of North Ltd.
, to gain entry to the meeting.
Most of those ejected by security guards were young women who were carried out of the meeting still screaming.
During the melee, one protester cried out: ``Don't you care about our children''?
``Hopefully you won't have any,'' Anderson replied.
Protesters also repeatedly asked the board questions about environmental risks of the proposed mine.
Construction has begun at Jabiluka, where ERA has identified more than 90,000 metric tons of uranium oxide, making it one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium ore bodies in the world.
It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (6.2 billion Australian dollars) to Australia's gross domestic product over about 30 years, and boost the country's share of the world uranium market.
SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Debate about the impact of mining in a remote region of Australia reopened Wednesday after UNESCO's World Heritage Bureau decided to investigate claims the area is under threat.
Construction begun one week ago at Jabiluka, a uranium mining lease lying within the boundaries of Kakadu National Park, listed by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization on its World Heritage list of important cultural and environmental sites.
The park is almost 12,000 square miles (19,000 sq.
kms) of largely untouched floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200 kms) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species including many that are rare or endangered.
The park is also recognized for the cultural values of the Aborigines who have lived there continuously for at least 40,000 years and their cave paintings, rock carvings and other archaeological sites.
Thousands of tourists visit the park every year.
The bureau resolved in Paris overnight to send a high-level mission to Australia after receiving submissions from Aboriginal traditional owners of the area and others that Jabiluka will put Kakadu's world heritage values at risk.
The Australian government has assured the bureau its environmental safeguards will not let the region's world heritage or natural or cultural values be affected by the mine, the bureau resolution says.
``Because of the importance, complexity and sensitivity of the issue however...
the World Heritage Committee should visit Australia and examine the situation further,'' the resolution says.
World Heritage Committee chairman Prof.
Francesco Francioni will lead the delegation, which will report to the committee's meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December.
While in Australia earlier this year, advisor to the committee Jim Thorsell said Kakadu could be put on UNESCO's ``in danger'' list, indicating the organization believes the values of the site are in jeopardy.
Such a listing is not binding on the Australian government and would not necessarily prevent the mine from going ahead.
Environment Minister Robert Hill said the government will cooperate with the investigation, but that it is unnecessary because ``there is no evidence that the world heritage values are at risk''.
Mining company Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.
has consistently said its environmental record has been proven by the 16-year operation of the Ranger uranium mine.
Both mining leases are within Kakadu's boundaries, but are technically not part of the park.
Independent scientific studies have found no adverse impact on the environment from uranium mining at Ranger, ERA chief executive Philip Shirvington said, welcoming the prospect of further international scrutiny.
``If they are genuine and open in their objectives then we have nothing to fear,'' he told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio .

CANBERRA, November 25 (Xinhua) --Australia faces international embarrassment over the Jabiluka uranium mine, with a U.N. committee Wednesday demanding the mine be scrapped to prevent it endangering the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area.
In a major embarrassment to the Howard government, the Bureau of the U.N.
World Heritage Committee found Kakadu was under threat, raising the prospect that the committee will this week make Kakadu only the 26th of the world's 552 World Heritage Sites to be placed on its endangered list.
"The mission has concluded that Kakadu National Park is exposed to a number of serious threats which are placing it under both ascertained and potential danger," the bureau said in a report after it sent a mission to Australia to examine claims by conservation groups that Kakadu (National Park in Northern Territory) was under threat from Jabiluka.
"The mission therefore recommends that the proposal to mine and mill uranium at Jabiluka should not proceed".
The finding was hailed by traditional owners and green groups as a great victory, but Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted the report as biased and unbalanced and said the mine would go ahead, according to Australian Associated Press.
Hill denounced the report as biased and unscientific and said Australia would try to have it struck down before it is considered by the World Heritage Committee in Kyoto this week.
He said he was astonished the report could call for the scrapping of Jabiluka because of its perceived threat to Kakadu, but did not object to the nearby Ranger mine, which had been operating for 18 years.
Northern Territory Chief Minister Shane Stone also accused the report's authors of predetermining their findings.
SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Construction of Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade was under way Tuesday, after a protracted legal battle with Aboriginal land owners and amid continuing environmental protest.
A single bulldozer entered the Jabiluka mining lease in northern Australia late Monday and began clearing the site ahead of actual construction, miner Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.
said. Chief executive Phillip Shirvington said construction of the mine will take up to 18 months.
ERA has identified more than 90,000 (metric) tons of uranium oxide at Jabiluka, one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium ore bodies in the world.
It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (Australian dollars 6.2 billion) to Australia's gross domestic product over an about 30-year mine life, and boost the country's share of the world uranium market.
Australia has about 30 percent of the world's recoverable uranium reserves, but only about 14 percent of the world market because of a previous government's restriction on the number of uranium mines.
The Jabiluka project is considered a litmus test for several other potential uranium mine projects in Australia.
Work began on site despite the company not having final approval for its preferred plan for the project.
The company wants to truck uranium ore from Jabiluka to its existing mine and plant at Ranger, about 13 miles (20 kms) away, for processing.
The plan has been approved by government but is opposed by key Aboriginal landowners, who don't want Jabiluka to proceed.
A more expensive option is building processing facilities at Jabiluka.
ERA has a 1983 agreement signed by the landowners approving this plan, but does not have environmental approvals from the federal government.
Landowners have disputed the 1983 agreement and their attempts to have the mining lease declared invalid have failed in the courts.
Shirvington said Tuesday the contractor currently working on the site agreed to work for ERA after protesters blockading the site chained themselves to his truck as he was trying to reach a different job.
``He was pretty angry, we saw the opportunity and negotiated with him to start working for us; he agreed and started straight away,'' Shirvington said.
``The protesters delivered him right into our hands''.
Kate Lecchi, a spokeswoman for the protesters, said they didn't believe the contractor was not going to work on the Jabiluka site, and that demonstrators will continue to try to stop construction.
``We believe that because of our actions ERA is a year behind schedule on this mine and we hope to delay them even more,'' she said from the protest site, about 220 miles (350 kms) from Darwin.
CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A United Nations World Heritage committee called Wednesday for the scrapping of the proposed Jabiluka uranium mine in Australia's Northern Territory.
The committee said the proposed mine would pose a severe danger to the cultural and natural values of the adjacent Kakadu National Park.
``The mission therefore recommends that the proposal to mine and mill uranium at Jabiluka should not proceed,'' the committee said in its report following a visit to Kakadu last month.
However, federal Environment Minister Robert Hill has blasted the report as biased, unbalanced and lacking in objectivity.
``I am disturbed and distressed about the quality of this document,'' Hill said.
``There has not been a case developed that could, in any way, lead to the conclusion they have reached''.
Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers) of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or endangered.
The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and cultural values.
About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.
The report said the mine, which could process 19.5 million metric tons of uranium ore over its 28-year life, could damage the environment.
``The mission has noted severe ascertained and potential dangers to the cultural and natural values of the Kakadu National Park, posed primarily by the proposal for uranium mining and milling at Jabiluka,'' it said.
The miner, Energy Resources of Australia Limited, told the panel that its project does not threaten the environmental and cultural values of Kakadu, which are recognized by the United Nations' World Heritage Bureau.
The company has already begun construction of its Jabiluka uranium mine, which is within the boundaries, but technically not part of Kakadu.
The ERA also promised it would rehabilitate the site ``to a condition ecologically and culturally compatible with Kakadu.''
CANBERRA, October 8 (Xinhua) --The Australian government today gave the green light to the country's controversial uranium mining plan, arguing that it would generate billions of U.S. dollars in revenue for Australians and create 2,000 jobs.
Australian Prime Minister John Howard today defended the government's decision to go ahead with uranium mining on development and environmental grounds.
The planned Jabiluka mine is on the edge of the 22,000 square-kilometer Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, in northern Australia's Northern Territory.
"There is no reason, therefore, why it should not go ahead," Howard was quoted today by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation evening TV news program as saying.
Resources Minister Warwick Parer said estimates indicated the Jabiluka mine contains about 19.5 million tons of ore, which could provide more than 90,400 tons of uranium oxide.
In a move apparently to lobby domestic support for the decision, the minister made it clear that the government is looking to Jabiluka's export potential rather than uranium for domestic use.
"Jabiluka means Australia could become the leading world uranium oxide supplier," Parer said in a statement.
He told reporters that exports from Jabiluka are expected to peak at 4,500 tons a year and the mine is expected to add a total of 4.46 billion U.S. dollars to Australia's gross domestic product over 28 years.
The government's decision however has been condemned by environmentalists and opposition parties.
"It is a dark day for Australia when our most precious World Heritage area is consigned as a 60 million ton radioactive waste dump," Wilderness Society national spokesperson Virginia Young said.
Australian Democrats environment spokeswoman Meg Lees said the government has ignored the wishes of Aboriginal people in the area and environmental concerns.
DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ A high-level United Nations delegation on Monday began touring Australia's Kakadu National Park to examine claims a uranium mine being built in the region threatens unique cultural and environmental values.
An eight-member team from the U.N.'s World Heritage Bureau will visit environmental and Aboriginal cultural sites and speak to interest groups including the company building the mine, Energy Resources of Australia Ltd..
The team will report to a meeting of the bureau in Kyoto, Japan, in December where it will recommend whether to place the park on a list of endangered world heritage sites.
Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (19,000 sq.
kms) of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200-km) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species including many that are rare or endangered.
It is also home to Aborigines who have lived there continuously for at least 40,000 years and is dotted with their cave paintings, rock carvings and other archaeological sites.
The park is one of a handful of 552 World Heritage sites listed for both its environmental and cultural values.
Thousands of tourists visit the park every year.
ERA has government approval to build a uranium mine at its Jabiluka lease within the park's boundaries, near a uranium mine it already operates inside the park.
The company says its good environmental record at the existing Ranger mine shows the Jabiluka project poses no threat.
Environmental groups and the Mirrar Aborigines of the region claim it will cause environmental damage.
U.N. team leader Prof.
Francesco Francioni said its findings will not be binding on the Australian government, even if the team considers the park is under threat.
However, he said governments can be embarrassed into protecting sites listed by the bureau as endangered.
``The continuing value of Kakadu National Park is something that concerns the whole world, the whole of humanity and therefore justifies such interest,'' Francioni said.
Two parks are currently on the endangered list _ Yellowstone in the United States and the Galapagos Islands.

The Age --Australian conservationists and traditional aboriginal owners threatened to blockade development of the huge Jabiluka uranium mine in the country's vast Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, after the federal government approved the mining plan for the Jabilika mine yesterday.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --Two aboriginal protesters of an Australian uranium mine and an African who has worked to protect a huge tropical rainforest were among the winners of the Goldman Environmental Prize.
The $125,000 annuall prizes, to be awarded today, recognize efforts of grassroots environmentalism around the world.
``The common theme as always is that one person can indeed make a difference,'' said Duane Silverstein, who oversees the awards.
``You don't need a special education, special training or a special background to help save the earth''.
The labors of Jacqui Katona and Yvonne Margarula have delayed mining of an estimated 20,000 tons of ore from Jabiluka, one of the world's richest untapped uranium bodies.
The government-approved mine site is in an area surrounded by Aboriginal-owned Kakadu National Park.
Last year Katona and Margarula were convicted of trespassing following a protest against the mine.
Later, Katona urged a United Nations panel to halt the mine operation, saying it amounted to an attack on the Mirrar, an Aboriginal clan that has cherished the land for centuries.
Samuel Nguiffo of Cameroon also won the prize for leading a team in the Congo Basin which informs forest dwellers of a law that allows inhabitants to manage lands prized by foreign logging companies.
``It is unacceptable that the basis for life of millions of individuals be destroyed in order to satisfy the greed of a few private companies,'' Nguiffo said.
Some 20 million to 30 million people live in or near the central African rain forest, which is second in size only to the Amazon forest in South America.
Other recipients of the 10th annual Goldman awards were: --Ka Hsaw Wa, a member of the Karen ethnic minority in Burma, now known as Myanmar.
He fled his home during military rule 10 years ago.
He has interviewed more than 1,000 victims of human rights abuses and documented environmental abuses, including increased logging and the hunting of elephants and tigers.
--Bernard Martin, a former fisherman from Newfoundland who has called for reduced fishing quotas after witnessing the collapse of Canada's east coast fisheries.
--Jorge Varela, a conservationist who has worked to contain the expansion of shrimp farming along the Gulf of Fonseca in Honduras.
Environmentalists say shrimp farming has destroyed critical coastal wetlands, displaced traditional fishing communities and contaminated fresh water supplies.
--Michal Kravcik, a Slovakian hydrologist who galvanized support to stop a proposed dam that would have destroyed the environment and forced the evacuation of four 700-year-old villages.
DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ More than 100 protesters were arrested Friday after overwhelming police and storming onto the site of a proposed new uranium mine in Australia's north, police said.
About 300 protesters walked from a camp set up in March by anti-uranium groups protesting Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.'s planned mine on the Jabiluka mineral lease, about 190 miles (300 kms) east of Darwin.
About 180 protesters climbed a security fence and walked onto the construction site, said spokeswoman Megan Kinninment.
``They were reclaiming the lease for the traditional Aboriginal owners of this land, the Mirrar people, who have been opposed to this mine from the start,'' she said.
Police Superintendent Gary Smith said dozens of protesters stampeded over police on their way to the site, elbowing officers out of the way.
Police were considering laying assault charges against the demonstrators.
Construction of the Jabiluka mine _ Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade _ began in June, after a protracted legal battle with Aboriginal land owners and amid continuing environmental protest.
ERA has identified more than 90,000 (metric) tons of uranium oxide at Jabiluka, one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium ore bodies in the world.
It expects the mine to add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (Australian dollars 6.2 billion) to Australia's gross domestic product over an about 30-year mine life, and boost the country's share of the world uranium market.
Almost 100 arrested protesters had been taken to Darwin because the jail at the nearby town of Jabiru was not big enough, Smith said.
CANBERRA, November 27 (Xinhua) --he Australian government's criticism of a report on the Kakadu National Park was extraordinary, head of the World Heritage mission to Kakadu, Francesco Francioni, said Friday.
The World Heritage Committee report found the Jabiluka uranium mine threatened the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area and raised the prospect of Kakadu being placed on the committee's endangered list.
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted the report as biased and unbalanced and said the mine would go ahead anyway.
The report is due to go before the World Heritage Committee Bureau meeting in Kyoto.
While talking over ABC Radio from Tokyo, Francioni rejected Hill's claim that the mission's report was full of contradictions.
He said the recommendations were designed to remove real and potential dangers from one of Australia's most famous national parks.
He said the majority of the drafting group reflected the views of the report.
"I find it quite extraordinary that this language is used, especially since I personally ensured that the mission cooperated and remained open to any kind of input and any kind of interaction with the Australian government".
The World Heritage convention was supposed to be an instrument of cooperation and not a forum for adversary politics, he said.
The Australian government has already insisted that Jabiluka remain open, which would almost certainly see Kakadu placed on the endangered list if the World Heritage Committee accepts the report of its mission to Australia.
JABIRU, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government has mounted a systematic attack on the traditions of the Aboriginal people living in Kakadu National Park, a U.N. team investigating whether uranium mining threatens the park was told Tuesday.
The 27-member Aboriginal Mirrar clan strongly opposed the building of the Jabiluka uranium mine on its traditional land, in an area surrounded by Kakadu.
``The Australian government has mounted a systematic and sustained attack on the living tradition of the Mirrar and Aboriginal people of Kakadu,'' Mirrar spokeswoman Jacqui Katona told the U.N. delegation.
``This attack on the political and social structures of Aboriginal people has manifested itself in the form of massive industrial development associated with uranium mining,'' Katona said.
``The Mirrar believe that the Australian government supports mining at the expense of their very existence''.
She urged the U.N. group to put Kakadu on the list of world heritage areas considered to be in danger.
The team from the U.N.
World Heritage Bureau is visiting the park to examine claims that the environmental and cultural values of the park are being threatened by the Jabiluka mine.
It will meet with mining company Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.
and government representatives later this week.
The team will report in December to a meeting of the bureau in Kyoto, Japan, where it will recommend whether to place the park on a list of endangered world heritage sites.
If Kakadu is put on the ``in danger'' list _ joining the likes of the old city of Jerusalem, Cambodia's Angkor temples, the war-torn cities of Dubrovnik in Croatia and Timbuktu in the African state of Mali _ the value of the park as a tourist attraction would be reduced, Katona said.
Such a decision would prove a major international embarrassment to the government of Prime Minister John Howard, which has maintained that the removal of 20 million metric tons of radioactive uranium ore over 28 years will not harm Kakadu.
Kakadu is almost 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers) of pristine floodplains and plateau on Australia's north coast, incorporating spectacular waterfalls, a towering 125-mile (200-kilometer) sandstone escarpment and hundreds of animal species, including many that are rare or endangered.
It is also home to Aborigines who have lived there continuously for at least 40,000 years and is dotted with their cave paintings, rock carvings and other archaeological sites.
The park is one of a handful of 552 World Heritage sites listed for both its environmental and cultural values.
About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.
CANBERRA, April 15 (Xinhua) --The Australian federal government Thursday rejected a UNESCO report which called for Kakadu National Park in northwest Australia to be placed on the endangered list because of the threat posed by the Jabiluka uranium mine.
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill said scientific evidence proved the natural values of Kakadu would not be threatened by the development of the mine.
Hill said the report of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage mission contained "several errors of science, law and logic".
Located in the Northern Territory, northwest Australia, the Kakadu National Park covers 20,000 square km.
Many environmentalists have been calling on the Australian government not to approve the uranium mining project adjacent to the park, but the government rejected their environmental concerns, saying jobs and export income to be generated from the mining project is important.
Hill said Australia's response to the report "clearly demonstrated that there is no basis to including Kakadu National Park on the in-danger list".
The findings of the mission report were inconsistent with the fact the Ranger uranium mine, less than 20 km from Jabiluka had operated for 20 years with no adverse impact on Kakadu.
"This proves mining can occur on leases adjacent to Kakadu without harming World Heritage values," he told journalists in Canberra.
SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The opening of Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade continues to inch closer, despite the latest vow Wednesday by Aboriginal landowners to block the development.
Energy Resources of Australia Ltd.
said it expects to begin digging at the remote Jabiluka mining lease in the Northern Territory this month, after the territorial government on Tuesday signed authorizations allowing work to begin on the mine's entrance and shaft.
But the company may be left with nothing but a hole in the ground, as it goes ahead without having formal approvals to either build a processing plant or to truck ore to an established mill at its nearby Ranger mine.
ERA has been forced to consider building a second mill just 13 miles (22 km) from Ranger by Aboriginal landowners' refusal to accept its preferred option, to transport the ore.
The owners of the Jabiluka lease oppose the mine, claiming it will cause environmental and indirect cultural damage.
But they are bound by a 1983 contract approving the mill-on-site option.
Representatives of the Mirrar Aboriginal clan said Wednesday they will seek a court order blocking the territorial government's approval until an environmental approval process for the on-site mill plan is completed.
``We believe the minister cannot make a thorough decision without considering the environmental assessment for the milling option,'' spokeswoman Jacqui Katona told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio. A similar injunction was last week lifted by the territory's Supreme Court.
Philip Shirvington, chief executive of ERA, a subsidiary of North Ltd.
, said there was only a ``small risk'' the company will not receive the remaining environmental approvals.
ERA has identified more than 90,000 (metric) tons of uranium oxide at Jabiluka, one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium ore bodies in the world.
The mine will add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion (Australian dollars 6.2 billion) to Australia's gross domestic product over an about 30-year mine life, it says.
Australia has about 30 percent of the world's recoverable uranium reserves, but has only about 14 percent of the world market.
For more than a decade until 1996, government policy prevented the opening of new uranium mines.
Currently there are only two, ERA's Ranger and Western Mining Corp.
Ltd.'s Olympic Dam.
ERA's success at Jabiluka is considered a litmus test for at least a dozen other potential uranium mine projects in Australia.
DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ An old car dressed up to look like a frill-necked lizard blocked the entrance to the Jabiluka uranium mine site inside the borders of Kakadu National Park on Friday.
A dozen protesters opposed to the uranium mine chained themselves to the car-lizard about 4 a.m., according to blockade spokeswoman Kerry Nettle.
She said it represented the animals in the surrounding Kakadu park which would be endangered by the construction of a uranium mine which is expected to extract almost 20 million metric tons of uranium ore over 28 years.
Mine builder Energy Resources of Australia has denied the mine, which it says will inject 6.2 billion Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 3.7 billion) into the Australian economy, will have any adverse impact on Kakadu.
Senior Police Sgt.
Alan Thomson of the nearby Jabiru police said the protesters locked on to the car will be removed by police.
Thomson said the car looked like a lizard ``with the help of a lot of imagination''.
Federal opposition leader Kim Beazley confirmed Thursday that the Labor Party would stop Jabiluka being built if it won government at the Oct.

CANBERRA, April 4 (Xinhua) --Following are major news items in leading Australian newspapers today: The Australian -- The Federal Government is considering employing Paul Keating's experience with Asia and APEC as part of an ambitious policy to build on Labor's positive work in the region and fix up some problems of the past.
--A fourth uranium mine could be approved within a year after Energy Resources Australia (ERA) company moved to fast-track for the Jabiluka mine in Kakadu National Park.
The Australian Financial Review --Under the Federal Government's new Workplace Relations Act, union members could form US-style local enterprise branches with autonomy from union head offices to negotiate directly with employers.
The Sydney Morning Herald --The Federal Government has confirmed that it will have to cut further into the Public Service than it planned, jettisoning its election promise to rely solely on voluntary departures to reduce numbers.
The Age --More police will patrol the central business district in an attempt to curb the increasing number of beggars.
DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ A firebomb attack caused more than 100,000 Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 60,000) damage Monday to a Darwin office of the company building the controversial Jabiluka uranium mine.
Four gasoline-filled beer bottles were thrown at the Energy Resources of Australia office between 1:45 and 2 a.m., a police spokeswoman said.
One went through a window while the remaining three were found outside the office, which houses ERA's environment monitoring division.
The fire caused more than 100,000 Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 60,000) damage to the office's front room and computer equipment, ERA's principal environmental engineer, Mark Daniell said.
Police have not yet said if they suspect a link between the attack and recent demonstrations throughout Australia against ERA's planned uranium mine in an area surrounded by Kakadu National Park.
The mine is opposed by the area's traditional owners and environmentalists.
Anti-uranium protesters distanced themselves from the Darwin attack.
``We are a peaceful protest.
This was not endorsed in any way by the protesters.
We strongly disapprove of these types of tactics,'' said Sarojani Krishnapillai, a spokeswoman for the protesters.
In another incident Monday, a man chained himself to the office of a rural National Party member of Parliament and threatened to blow himself up if the government did not change its policy on uranium mining at Jabiluka.
The siege ended safely more than four hours later when police overpowered the 50-year-old man.
The Jabiluka mine, which is expected to dig up almost 20 million metric tons of uranium ore in 28 years, is supported by the current conservative government of Prime Minister John Howard.
But it is opposed by Labor, which says it will stop the project it it wins government and there are no legally enforceable contracts in place.
NEW YORK (AP) --In a major step toward resolving health claims against the diet drug combination fen-phen, drug maker American Home Products said just 1 percent of the drug's users have opted out of a multibillion dollar settlement.
Nearly 6 million people took fen-phen before it was pulled from the market in 1997 due to links with serious heart problems, but just 45,000 of them have elected to refuse the $3.75 billion settlement, American Home said Thursday, adding it has decided to go ahead with the deal.
March 30 was the deadline for fen-phen users to opt out.
Those who did so retain the right to sue American Home for punitive damages.
If too many people had opted out, American Home could have scrapped the settlement.
The deal, reached last October, would pay individual fen-phen users up to $1.5 million.
Most, however, would get far less, depending on their level of injury and how long they took the drugs.
It includes money to pay patients who say they were injured by the drugs and for future medical monitoring for those who are still healthy.
So far more than 9,000 suits have been filed against American Home by fen-phen users, imposing a major obstacle for the company as it tries to win back trust of investors who have seen its stock drop because of the litigation and problems with other medicines.
The litigation has also hurt the company's efforts to find a merger partner.
American Home lost its bid to buy rival Warner-Lambert Co.
in part because of uncertainty surrounding the diet drug litigation.
The national settlement still must be approved by a judge.
A hearing is scheduled in federal court in Philadelphia on May 2.
Madison, N.J.-based American Home made fenfluramine, the ''fen'' in the fen-phen combination, and gave the drug a brand name of Pondimin.
It also made Redux, a chemical cousin.
In September 1997, the drugs were removed from the market after a Mayo Clinic study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
The second drug in the combination, phentermine, is still on the market.
The settlement is open to anyone who used fen-phen and Redux in the United States, whether or not they filed suit.
''The number of opt outs is well within the expected range for a nationwide settlement of this magnitude and the company is confident that it can continue to manage this level of opt outs,'' said Louis Hoynes Jr.
, American Home's senior vice president.
The company said most of those who opted out of the deal aren't sick.
Most of the opt-outs have yet to sue American Home, raising the prospect of thousands of new suits.
However, the company showed little concern about this.
''Experience with litigation of these types suggests that such opt outs have generally weaker claims and also may be subject to statute of limitations defenses,'' American Home said in a statement.
About 200,000 drug users registered to participate in the settlement and many more are expected since a deadline for registration hasn't yet been set.
''We believe the response to this settlement represents an overwhelming endorsement of the settlement as a fair and appropriate way to remedy the health problems caused by AHP's diet drugs,'' said Arnold Levin, a plaintiff attorney who helped negotiate the settlement.

TRENTON, N.J.
(AP) --Healthy but still worried, thousands of people who took the fen-phen diet drug combination are seeking millions to pay for years of medical checkups in case they develop heart or lung problems.
Evidence linking the ``fen'' half of the drug duo with sometimes deadly disorders forced two versions of fenfluramine off the market in 1997.
Jury selection began this week in a class-action lawsuit against American Home Products, which made fenfluramine.
If American Home loses the civil trial, it could be forced to pay more than $1 billion over the next decade, one economist estimated in court documents.
``The implications are huge,'' said Hemant Shah, a drug industry analyst with HKS &AMP; Co.
in Warren, N.J.
``You're talking about as much as $1,000 per year per patient.
Then if you take the national implications...
you're looking at some serious problems for the company''.
The suit by New Jersey residents is the first class-action case against American Home to come to trial and the only one seeking payment for medical checkups rather than financial awards.
Madison, N.J.-based American Home already has settled several of about 3,100 individual suits, but those settlements are estimated to total only around $10 million.
During closing arguments of a fen-phen trial in Canton, Texas, on Wednesday, attorneys for Debbie Stone Lovett said American Home hid evidence that its diet drugs caused heart valve damage.
Lovett, a 36-year-old manicurist, said she developed leaky heart valves after taking fenfluramine.
She is seeking unspecified damages in the case, now before the jury.
Nationwide, about 6 million Americans took either fenfluramine, which was sold under the brand name Pondimin, or its chemical look-alike, dexfenfluramine, sold under the name Redux.
American Home pulled both drugs off pharmacy shelves in September 1997, several months after the first reports from the Mayo Clinic linking the drugs to potentially fatal heart valve damage in some patients.
The company insists there's no scientific proof that patients who stopped taking the drugs about two years ago and have no disease now will be injured in the future.
``We continue to believe that routine echocardiograms are not medically warranted for patients who have taken these drugs,'' said company lawyer Anita Hotchkiss.
Studies since the drugs were recalled generally indicate a slightly elevated risk of valve disorders, but that it appears to fade after patients stop taking them.
The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market .
American Home Products Corp.
agreed late Tuesday to pay $350 million to settle 1,400 injury cases brought in Mississippi over its diet drug combination fen-phen, a liability that could endanger the company's proposed $70 billion merger with Warner-Lambert.
American Home Products moved to settle the cases after a Mississippi jury had awarded $150 million in compensatory damages to five plaintiffs, four of whom said the drugs had caused them to develop primary pulmonary hypertension, an often fatal lung illness.
The Mississippi settlement touched off debate among analysts Wednesday as to whether American Home Products' merger with Warner-Lambert would be completed.
Pfizer has made an $82.4 hostile bid for Warner-Lambert and has shown little mercy in pointing out American Home Products' weaknesses, including the company's lingering liabilities involving fen-phen.
Based on Wednesday's closing stock price, Pfizer's offer for Warner-Lambert was valued at $72.4 billion, while American Home Products' bid was $51.1 billion.
Warner-Lambert said in a statement late Wednesday that it remained committed to its merger with American Home Products.
But Pfizer wasted little time in questioning the wisdom of such a deal.
``We have offered a 41 percent premium over the American Home Products' offer,'' said Lou Clemente, executive vice president for corporate affairs at Pfizer.
``That's a $21 billion difference.
That tells us something anyway''.
Investors did not react so negatively to American Home Products' latest woes.
The company's shares fell 56.25 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $40.
Warner-Lambert increased $1.125, or 1.4 percent, to $82.9375.
Pfizer's shares rose $1.125, or 4.9 percent, to $33.75.
``Personally, I don't think the merger between American Home Products and Warner-Lambert will go through, but not because of the Mississippi settlement,'' said Sergio Traversa, a pharmaceutical analyst with Mehta Partners.
``But it doesn't help.
It's just one more reason Warner-Lambert should not merge with American Home''.
Analysts have expressed concern that American Home Products has yet to put its fen-phen liabilities behind it.
Since Pondimin, American Home Products' brand name for fenfluramine _ the ``fen'' in fen-phen _ and Redux, a similar drug, were removed from the market in September 1997, 6,500 lawsuits covering 11,000 people have been filed.
American Home Products agreed in October to pay $3.75 billion to settle claims that the diet drugs had been harmful.
Many analysts applauded the national agreement, but others thought that it did not do enough to limit the company's liabilities.
The agreement, which has yet to receive final approval from a federal judge, did not include primary pulmonary hypertension cases and does not prevent fen-phen users from taking their cases to court.
Some plaintiffs' lawyers said Wednesday that after the Mississippi jury verdict, many fen-phen sufferers would choose to pursue their claims in court.
``In my view, American Home Products' global settlement is now dead,'' said Ed Blizzard, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Houston who is involved in many fen-phen cases.
``A lot of people won't go into the national settlement.
If you look at that $150 million award, it just shows you how angry ordinary citizens get when they hear about these charges''.
Even though American Home Products moved quickly to settle the claims, the company told analysts Wednesday that the legal environment in Mississippi was anything but ordinary.
American Home Products noted in a release Wednesday that even though Jefferson County, the site of the fen-phen case, had only 8,500 residents, the Circuit Court there had liability claims pending from more than 10,000 plaintiffs.
About 500 of the fen-phen cases filed in Mississippi were from plaintiffs who lived elsewhere, including places as far away as Maine and Hawaii, American Home Products said.
Louis Hoynes, American Home Products' general counsel, also told analysts that the settlement amount, which was confidential, was substantially less than $500 million, which had been cited in earlier news reports.
Analysts said Wednesday that the total payout for the Mississippi cases was estimated at $350 million.
It was unclear, though, just how many of the fen-phen plaintiffs would pursue their own cases or join the national settlement.
After the national agreement had been signed, many lawyers had said that it would allow many sufferers to receive a monetary award faster than if they were to go to court.
``Even with the Mississippi settlement, the national agreement will still go forward,'' said Stanley Chesley, a partner with Waite, Schneider, Bayless &AMP; Chesley in Cincinnati, one of the chief negotiators of the national agreement.
``It is not meant to include every case in every state''.
The settlement in Mississippi won't be American Home Products' last day in court.
The company said that it faces a similar case next month in Massachusetts.
Meanwhile, the series of lawsuits filed between Pfizer and Warner-Lambert regarding Pfizer's hostile takeover bid will begin Jan.
10 in Delaware Chancery Court. &QL;
CANTON, Texas (AP) --A Texas woman who blamed the diet drug combination fen-phen for her heart damage has agreed to settle a lawsuit against the manufacturer for a fraction of the $23.3 million a jury awarded her.
News of the settlement Thursday came on the same day as reports that the company --American Home Products Corp.
--is close to settling most of the thousands of diet pill lawsuits filed against it for at least $3 billion.
American Home made fenfluramine, the ``fen'' in the fen-phen combination and gave the drug a brand name of Pondimin.
It also made Pondimin's chemical cousin Redux.
In the Texas case, Debbie Lovett, 36, of Grand Saline, blamed American Home and subsidiary Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories for damage she suffered after taking fen-phen for more than three months starting in October 1995.
Ms. Lovett's attorney Kip Petroff would not disclose the amount of the settlement, but said the deal was reached after considering state law that caps monetary awards in civil suits.
``The amount of the settlement was significantly less than the amount of the verdict, but the amount of the settlement is more than 90 percent of what we thought would be awarded after all of the evidence was considered and after the statutory cap on punitive damages was applied as required by law,'' Petroff said.
AHP spokesman Doug Petkus went a bit further in discussing the deal.
``While the amount is confidential, American Home Products can confirm it totaled less than 10 percent of the amount returned by the jury,'' Petkus said.
Thousands of fen-phen cases have been filed across the nation, but Ms.
Lovett's lawsuit was the first to reach a jury.
Jurors last month found the company was fully liable for Ms.
Lovett's ailments.
American Home Products marketed Pondimin and Redux until September 1997.
That was when the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration pushed for their withdrawal after a Mayo Clinic study linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
Fenfluramine had been sold since the 1970s but became widely used in the 1990s when doctors prescribed it in combination with another drug, phentermine.
When taken alone, phentermine never was associated with health problems.
It remains on the market.
As for the larger settlement, two newspapers reported Thursday that final details were being worked out and the deal could be announced as early as today.
The Star-Ledger of Newark said the settlement could exceed $5 billion, and would resolve more than 4,100 lawsuits brought by 8,000 people.
The Wall Street Journal said the settlement would be about $3 billion.
Both reports cited anonymous sources.
American Home officials refused to comment on the possibility of a wide-ranging settlement.
The Star-Ledger reported that the company's offer includes payments to patients harmed by the diet drugs, along with follow-up medical examinations for millions of other users.
The Journal said those who feel the agreement is inadequate could opt out and pursue cases on their own.
The Star-Ledger said unresolved issues on Wednesday included the structure of the payout and the terms of a side deal with plaintiffs in New Jersey, where a civil trial is under way over whether the Madison N.J.-based drug maker should be liable for the cost of future medical checkups.
The pending settlement would cover individual lawsuits and class-action suits certified in eight states, the newspaper said.
It would need a federal judge's approval.
Last week, the Journal reported that the FBI is probing whether the American Home revealed all it knew about dangers of Redux prior to its approval by the government in 1996.
The company denied knowing about any such inquiry.
American Home's stock has languished in recent months largely due to uncertainty about how much it will have to pay to resolve the diet drug lawsuits.
CLEBURNE, Texas (AP) --Attorneys for American Home Products Corp.
insist the company is not liable for the health problems of a woman who used the diet-drug combination fen-phen, saying she misused the products and was predisposed to heart disease.
Sandra Moore has sued the company for $110 million in the nation's first trial involving the once-popular weight-loss drugs.
Testimony was expected to begin today.
Ms. Moore claims she had to quit her job because of heart valve damage caused by fenfluramine, half of the fen-phen combination, and Redux, a similar product.
Both were marketed by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, a subsidiary of American Home Products.
In opening statements Wednesday, defense attorney Sandy Liser said Ms.
Moore's condition is not severe and could be linked to other causes.
The attorney said Ms.
Moore has a mild and common disorder often called a heart murmur that could be hereditary.
``We will show she had a family history of serious heart disease and obesity,'' the attorney said.
The defense also plans to present testimony that fen-phen, which Ms.
Moore took for 22 months, carried labels that recommended usage of no longer than three months.
American Home Products, the world's seventh-largest drug maker, has been hit with more than 1,800 lawsuits since it pulled the drugs off the market in 1997 at the request of federal health officials.
Fenfluramine carried labels starting in 1988 warning that in rare instances it caused primary pulmonary hypertension, a potentially fatal disorder.
The other half of the fen-phen combination, phentermine, has not been linked to heart problems when taken alone and is still being sold.
Lawyers for Ms.
Moore said American Home Products knew fen-phen caused serious heart problems and underreported the number of cases of primary pulmonary hypertension.
``These drugs were taken off the market because they were unreasonably dangerous,'' said attorney Michael McGartland.
``This should have been told to patients many years before.''
MACON, Miss.
(AP) --On the heels a successful damage suit trial in Fayette against fen-phen maker American Home Products, attorneys are again turning to a Mississippi court with claims of health damage caused by the diet drug.
The latest legal action was filed with Noxubee County Circuit Court on behalf of six women.
The suit comes only four weeks after a Jefferson County jury awarded about $400 million to plaintiffs who made similar claims against American Home Attorney Wilbur O.
Colom of Columbus said the latest lawsuit seeks a larger award, which he said should send diet pill manufacturers a strong message.
"I believe we can produce a multibillion verdict in Noxebee County," Colom said Friday.
American Home, pharmaceutical companies Wyeth-Ayerst and SmithKline Beecham and Savon Drug Stores are among the 12 defendants named in the new lawsuit.
Colom said a trial date would be set for some time in 2001.
Colom said his firm and partners in an Alabama law firm plan additional diet drug suits in Mississippi, including in Jefferson, Holmes and Claiborne counties.
American Home made a diet drug called fenfluramine, the "fen" in fen-phen.
It sold the drug under the brand name Pondimin along with a chemical relative called Redux.
About 6 million people took the mix of fenfluramine and phentermine after it came out in the mid-1990s.
American Home withdrew Pondimin and Redux from the market in 1997 after a Mayo Clinic study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
American Home agreed earlier this year to pay up to $4.83 billion in a settlement that could cover all 6 million users.
The deal would pay claimants anywhere from a few hundred dollars to $1.5 million, though thousands of suits remain.
PHILADELPHIA --Opponents of the proposed $3.75 billion fen-phen settlement vowed Thursday to appeal if the deal is not rejected by a federal judge.
Attorney Edward F.
Blizzard, who represents a group of users who object to the settlement, made one final plea to U.S.
District Court Judge Louis C.
Bechtle to throw it out.
''If we allow this to go forward, there will be a substantial risk it will be reversed and we will have wasted time'' that could have been better spent attending to users' health needs, Blizzard said during his final summation.
After the session, Blizzard promised he would appeal to the 3rd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals if Bechtle gives his approval.
More than 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against American Home Products, maker of fenfluramine, the ''fen'' in the fen-phen diet drug combination.
The Madison, N.J.-based company sold the combination under the brand name of Pondimin and also made Redux, a chemical cousin.
The drugs were withdrawn in September 1997 after a Mayo Clinic study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
The second drug in the combination, phentermine, was not linked to the problems.
Under the settlement, fen-phen users would get a maximum of $1.5 million, though most would get far less, depending on their level of injury and how long they took the drugs.
The settlement also includes money for their future medical monitoring.
Bechtle gave preliminary approval to the deal last November and is expected to decide sometime this summer whether it will stand.
Opponents say monetary damages are insufficient, the settlement does not include compensation for people who may develop health problems later and users had inadequate representation.
Scientists do not yet fully understand the health effects of fen-phen, Blizzard said.
''At this point, the headlights might not be able to capture what is out there.
The science has not been completed yet,'' he said.
Attorneys for American Home and plaintiffs' counsel disputed that, pointing out that 16 major studies were performed to determine the effects of Pondimin and Redux.
The studies found that any ill effects of the drug generally show up right away, said plaintiffs' attorney Michael D.
Fishbein. Of 6 million people who took fen-phen before it was pulled from the market, about 45,000 have refused the settlement and retain the right to sue for punitive damages.
Another 266,000 have registered to join the class.
Those people may still reject the settlement and sue for compensatory damages but are forbidden from collecting punitive damages.
''There has been an overwhelming vote for approval of the terms of the settlement,'' Fishbein said.

HOUSTON (AP) --The family of a woman who died after taking the diet drug combination fen-phen is determined to get a verdict in a trial involving the drug's maker, an attorney said Tuesday.
``We're not interested in talking settlement,'' said Tommy Fibich, one of two lawyers for the family of Mary Marisa Smith, a 34-year-old mother of two who died while trying to lose weight.
The lawsuit by Ms.
Smith's family is believed to be the first relating to the death of a fen-phen user to reach trial.
The lawsuit asserts that American Home Products Corp.
underreported the instances of pulmonary hypertension as a result of using fenfluramine, the ``fen'' part of the drug combination.
The company in the past has contended that evidence linking the drug to the disease is inconclusive.
Fibich said Ms.
Smith died of infection in late 1997 while waiting for a heart-lung transplant.
She spent her final days hooked to a catheter delivering drugs directly to her lungs to keep blood vessels flowing, Fibich said.
Opening arguments took place Tuesday, with testimony to begin Wednesday.
Fibich estimated the trial will take about three weeks.
American Home Products settled another Texas case halfway into a trial earlier this year.
The plaintiff, Sandra Moore of Johnson County, claimed that fenfluramine caused her heart valve damage.
The defense had yet to begin presenting its case.
Another Texas woman took American Home Products to court last month in Canton, but the trial was delayed because lawyers said they could not seat an impartial jury.
Debbie Stone Lovett also alleged fenfluramine caused heart valve damage.
In September 1997, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration pulled fenfluramine from the market, citing evidence it may have irreversibly --and sometimes fatally -- scarred users' heart valves.
An estimated 6.6 million people have used the diet drug combination.
The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
More than 2,600 lawsuits over the health effects of fen-phen are pending, American Home has reported in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.
Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products is the nation's seventh-largest pharmaceutical company.
Through Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, the company marketed Pondimin, (the brand name for fenfluramine) and Redux, a similar product.
PHILADELPHIA (AP) - A federal judge has approved the proposed $3.75 billion national settlement of health claims stemming from the diet drug combination fen-phen, which has been linked to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
Under the settlement approved Monday, fen-phen users would get up to $1.5 million, though most would get far less, depending on their level of injury and how long they took the drugs.
The settlement also includes money for their future medical monitoring.
U.S. District Judge Louis C.
Bechtle gave preliminary approval to the deal last November.
More than 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against American Home Products, maker of fenfluramine, the ''fen'' in the fen-phen diet drug combination.
The Madison, N.J.-based company sold the combination under the brand name of Pondimin and also made Redux, a chemical cousin.
The drugs were withdrawn in September 1997 after a Mayo Clinic study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
The second drug in the combination, phentermine, was not linked to the problems.
''The settlement resolves the vast majority of the claims and potential claims that the company was facing and it's a very, very significant step forward in resolving the litigation,'' said Michael Scott of Philadelphia, one of the attorneys representing American Home.
Attorney Edward F.
Blizzard of Houston objected to the settlement in June on behalf of a group of diet-drug users, saying it would likely be reversed because of all the other lawsuits pending.
Blizzard, who did not immediately return a call for comment Monday, had promised to appeal to the 3rd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals if the judge gives his approval.
Other opponents say monetary damages are deficient, the settlement does not include compensation for people who may develop health problems later and users had inadequate representation.

CANTON, Texas (AP) --Jury selection began Monday in the trial of a Texas woman who blames the maker of diet drug fen-phen for damaging her heart valves.
Debbie Stone Lovett of Grand Saline is suing American Home Products Inc.
and subsidiary, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories.
Also named are Economy Drug of Grand Saline and Wal-Mart Stores, where the prescriptions were filled.
Ms. Lovett is claiming she suffered moderate to severe heart valve damage after taking fen-phen for eight months starting in October 1995.
Also named are Economy Drug of Grand Saline, Texas, and Wal-Mart Stores, where the prescriptions were filled.
Lovett's attorney Kip Petroff said he will prove that American Home knew its products could cause heart valve damage, but failed to put warnings on drug labels.
``They have people whose job it is to review the safety data and detect if things should be put in the label,'' Petroff said.
``By the time she took it, they knew of 35 cases of valvular heart disease, but had not warned doctors about any of them''.
Doug Petkus, a spokesman for American Home Products, declined to comment on the lawsuit.
The Madison, N.J.-based company is the nation's seventh-largest pharmaceutical company.
More than 2,600 lawsuits over the health effects of fen-phen are pending, American Home has reported in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.
Several are class-action suits asking the company to pay for medical checkups and future treatments for people who don't know whether they have problems.
An estimated 6 million people in the United States took fen-phen.
Trial lawyers contend thousands suffered problems such as leaky heart valves and primary pulmonary hypertension, an often-fatal lung disease.
Last month, another woman took American Home Products to court over heart-valve damage.
Sandra Moore settled for a reported $500,000 one week into the trial in Johnson County.
Petroff said a national settlement with AHP is being discussed but that it is in preliminary stages and could take months.
Ms. Lovett is suing for past and future suffering and mental anguish and seeking unspecified damages.
Petroff said the 36-year-old woman suffered a series of small strokes and was hospitalized after taking Pondimin and Redux.
He said tests had indicated her heart was healthy before she took the drug.
American Home Products pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request.
A Mayo Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart-valve damage.
The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
DALLAS (AP) --Lawyers representing millions of people who used the diet drug combination fen-phen are negotiating a national settlement of health claims against the manufacturer, American Home Products Corp.
, a lawyer confirmed today.
The talks are in the earliest stages, but American Home Products hopes to reach an out-of-court deal in cases scheduled for trial in Texas this spring and summer, said Houston lawyer Graham Hill, whose partners, representing plaintiffs, attended two settlement meetings.
The Dallas Morning News, which first reported the negotiations today, said American Home Products would pay billions of dollars under such a deal.
Hill, however, said it was too early to put a price tag on a possible settlement.
``There have been several meetings, and a number of different proposals and scenarios have been discussed, but there are some difficult issues that are going to have to be agreed upon before anything of this magnitude can be concluded,'' Hill added.
American Home Products spokesman Lowell Weiner declined comment on the report this morning.
Last month, the company reached a settlement in the first trial over heart-valve damage from fen-phen, reportedly agreeing to pay $500,000 to one plaintiff.
Thousands of people contend they developed heart problems after taking the drugs.
Some 6 million people in the United States used the drug.
The company wants ``to avoid letting any of these cases go to trial and risk a really huge verdict,'' another Houston lawyer, Don Bowen, told the Morning News.
A large jury verdict, he said, would ``considerably inflate'' a national settlement's price tag.
Through its Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories subsidiary, American Home Products marketed fenfluramine --half of the fen-phen combination -- and Redux, a similar product.
In 1997, the Madison, N.J.-based drug maker pulled fenfluramine and Redux off the market at the Food and Drug Administration's request.
A Mayo Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart valve damage.The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
Settlements in at least nine cases, including those of four Texans, have resulted in amounts of up to $4.6 million.
The company must put between $3 billion and $5 billion into a settlement before it is acceptable, some lawyers and Wall Street analysts told the Morning News.
The drug maker, in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, stated it was aware of 2,615 lawsuits over fen-phen as of March 22.
Class-action lawsuits are certified in Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and West Virginia.
PHILADELPHIA (AP) --Opponents of a proposed $3.75 billion national settlement of health claims against the diet drug combination fen-phen called the deal inadequate Tuesday as a judge began hearing testimony on the fairness of the settlement.
U.S. District Judge Louis C.
Bechtle, who gave preliminary approval to the deal in November, is expected to decide at the end of the two-week hearing whether the settlement will stand.
Edward F.
Blizzard, an attorney for a group of fen-phen users who object to the settlement, wants the judge to throw it out.
''The plan is illegal and unfair,'' Blizzard said Tuesday.
''The amounts being offered to settle these claims are inadequate to compensate people for their injuries''.
The drug's maker, American Home Products, and plaintiffs' attorneys who worked out the settlement last October favor its approval.
More than 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against Madison, N.J.-based American Home, maker of fenfluramine, the ''fen'' in the fen-phen combination.
The company sold the drug under the brand name of Pondimin and also made Redux, a chemical cousin.
The drugs were withdrawn in September 1997 after a Mayo Clinic study linked the fen-phen combination to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
The second drug in the combination, phentermine, was not linked to the problems.
Under the settlement, the fen-phen users would get a maximum of $1.5 million, though most would get far less, depending on their level of injury and how long they took the drugs.
The settlement also includes money for their future medical monitoring.
''The settlement is the result of a dedicated effort between plaintiffs' attorneys and American Home Products to create a comprehensive and equitable plan,'' said Louis L.
Hoynes Jr.
, American Home's senior vice president and general counsel.
Of 6 million people who took fen-phen before it was pulled from the market, 45,000 refused the settlement and retain the right to sue for punitive damages.
Those who remained in the class action may still reject the settlement and sue for compensatory damages but are forbidden from collecting punitive damages.
NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.
(AP) --A judge dismissed the jury in a class-action lawsuit against one of the makers of the fen-phen diet drug combination, raising expections of a possible out-of-court settlement.
In sending jurors home Monday, Superior Court Judge Marina Corodemus said she would hear the case without a jury starting Oct.
12 if a settlement is not reached before then, plaintiffs' attorney Steven Sheller said.
The jury had been hearing testimony intermittently since Aug.
11. Sheller said he thought the case would be settled.
Officials with American Home Products, the drug company, declined to comment.
The case pits the Madison-based company against about 94,000 New Jersey residents who used the diet pill combination, which was taken off the market two years ago after being linked to serious heart and lung damage in users.
American Home Products sold the ``fen'' half of the combination under the brand name Pondimin, and made Pondimin's chemical cousin Redux.
The plaintiffs did not develop heart or lung damage, but the want American Home Products to cover the cost of future medical checkups in case problems develop down the road.
Fenfluramine had been sold since the 1970s but became widely used in the 1990s when doctors prescribed it for weight loss in combination with another drug, phentermine.
The combination became known as fen-phen.
When taken alone, phentermine never was associated with health problems and it remains on the market.
More than 4,100 lawsuits have been filed in state and federal courts against American Home Products over fenfluramine.
The company has proposed a national settlement in which it would pay $1.2 billion for future medical examinations for healthy users of the drug, and an additional $2.8 billion to settle individual suits from people who claim the drug has harmed them.
Plaintiffs' attorneys claim the company hid information from doctors, patients and regulators about possible links to heart valve disease and an often fatal lung condition called primary pulmonary hypertension.
The company denies hiding information, and says it acted properly in marketing the drugs.
CLEBURNE, Texas (AP) --A company hid evidence that half of the popular diet-drug combination fen-phen caused serious heart problems, a lawyer for a woman suing American Home Products Corp.
for $110 million said Wednesday.
The lawsuit is believed to be the first to reach a courtroom over the issue of heart valve damage caused by fen-phen or Redux, and experts said a victory for the woman could prove key to other cases.
A 12-member jury was seated to hear the case, filed by Sandra Moore against American Home Products Corp.
, the parent of pharmaceutical company Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories.
``The sales and marketing people said if you put a black box warning on this product you are going to see sales of the product cut in half,'' Michael McGartland said during opening statements of the civil trial.
``They were making a lot of money,'' he said.
``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what the motivation was''.
Ms. Moore, a former Alvarado resident who now lives in Missoula, Mont.
, claims she wasn't warned about the risks of taking fenfluramine, marketed by Wyeth-Ayerst as Pondimin, or dexfenfluramine, a similar drug sold by the company as Redux.
Fenflurmaine and Redux have been taken off the market.
Fenfluramine makes up half of the ``fen-phen'' combination prescribed to thousands of patients to promote weight loss.
The other half, phentermine, has not been linked to heart problems when taken alone and is still on the market.
Defense lawyer Bill Sims said he looks forward to putting the facts before the jury.
``There's a lot of misinformation circulating about these drugs and why they were voluntarily withdrawn from the market,'' he said.
``We are going to tell it like it is''.
Doctors found mild heart valve damage after Ms.
Moore, 52, took fen-phen for 10 months in 1996.
She is now on medication for her condition.
NEW YORK --American Home Products, already facing thousands of lawsuits related to its once popular diet drugs, was sued on Monday by its marketing partner Interneuron Pharmaceuticals for allegedly concealing the health risks of the pills.
Lexington, Mass.-based Interneuron is seeking unspecified damages against American Home in the suit filed in the Superior Court of Massachusetts.
In the complaint, Interneuron accuses American Home of deliberately concealing information regarding possible health risks associated with the use of "fen-phen," a combination of the anti-obesity drugs Pondimin (fenfluramine) and phentermine.
Interneuron said the information was vital to help it assess the safety of Redux, a chemical cousin of Pondimin, which was developed by Interneuron and marketed by AHP.
American Home's failure to disclose the safety risks from February 1997 through June 1997 prevented Interneuron from taking action, including possibly moving to take Redux off the market earlier, it said.
Interneuron said it lost the opportunity to disclose the safety problems to its shareholders, the financial markets and regulatory agencies, according to the suit.
Such action would have helped protect its reputation, which was hurt when the drugs were banned, it said.
"As a result of AHP's fraudulent activities, Interneuron suffered serious financial loss, including a decrease in its market capitalization of hundreds of millions of dollars," said Glenn L.
Cooper, president and chief executive officer of Interneuron.
American Home denied any wrongdoing with respect to its contractual obligations with Interneuron.
A spokesman said American Home also disclosed all safety data on its anti-obesity drugs to the FDA.
Pondimin and Redux were taken off the market in September 1997.
Pondimin was made and marketed by American Home, while Redux was developed by Interneuron and marketed by American Home.
Interneuron is now facing more than 2,000 lawsuits related to Redux.
In October 1999, American Home agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to fen-phen.
But the settlement has not been finalized, and attorneys said many clients will opt-out of the agreement so they can sue on their own.
American Home's legal problems are one reason the company is having trouble completing its proposed merger with Warner-Lambert.
Warner-Lambert is now in talks to merge with Pfizer Inc.
, putting the deal with American Home in jeopardy.
Interneuron said it has tried for two years to negotiate a settlement with American Home to indemnify Interneuron from lawsuits related to the diet drugs.
Interneuron said American Home first learned of health dangers of fen-phen as early as February 1997, when it received information from the Mayo Clinic.
The Mayo Clinic had collected information from patients who had developed heart valve damage after taking the drugs.
Because of the chemical similarity between Pondimin and Redux, American Home should have immediately alerted Interneuron of the information, the complaint said.
Instead, Interneuron said American Home waited until July 1997 to reveal the information.
American Home withheld the data on the Mayo study because it feared the results would have on the diet drugs' sales, the lawsuit said.
In July 1997, the Mayo Clinic announced that it had received reports of 24 cases in which patients using fen-phen had been diagnosed with cardiac valve disease.
In September 1997, the companies removed Pondimin and Redux from the market.
Shares of Interneuron fell 50 cents to $3 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Shares of American Home fell $5 to $43 on the New York Stock Exchange.
NEW YORK (AP) --American Home Products has agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to the company's once popular fen-phen diet drug combination, the company announced today.
The settlement will include money to pay patients who say they were injured by the drugs and for future medical monitoring for those who are still healthy.
Pending a judge's approval, initial payments will begin later this year.
American Home made fenfluramine, the ``fen'' in the fen-phen combination, and gave the drug a brand name of Pondimin.
It also made Redux, a chemical cousin.
In September 1997, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration pushed for their withdrawal after a Mayo Clinic study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
The settlement is open to anyone who used fen-phen and Redux in the United States, whether or not they filed suit, American Home said.
``This settlement provides fair and equitable terms for both diet drug claimants and American Home Products,'' and allows the company to ``move beyond the uncertainty and distractions of litigation,'' said chairman John R.
Stafford in a statement.
Louis L.
Hoynes, senior vice president and general counsel, reiterated the company's position that the drugs were safe for most people.
``The scientific studies conducted to date and clinical experience indicate that the health of the overwhelming majority of people who took Redux or Pondimin has not been adversely affected,'' he said.
On news of the settlement, shares of American Home rose $3.12 1/2, or 7 percent, to $48.25.
About 4,100 suits have been filed against American Home, making it one of the largest product liability cases ever.
About six million people took the drug combination.
American Home said the maximum amount available to any individual in the settlement is about $1.5 million, depending on the seriousness of their health problems, how long they took the drugs, their age and other medical conditions.
The settlement is optional, allowing users to pursue lawsuits on their own.
However, if American Home believes too many refuse to participate, it can terminate the deal.
The settlement terms call for payments to continue for about 16 years.
Payments to be made during the next two years are anticipated to total $1.85 billion.
A toll-free telephone number (800-386-2070) has been established to provide information on the settlement.
The settlement covers all claims except for patients who say they suffer from primary pulmonary hypertension, a rare but serious lung disorder.
The company said it decided to deal with these cases separately because they are few in number.
It also noted that fen-phen's label included a warning that the drug could cause the disorder.
The settlement includes a $2.55 billion fund to pay for injuries, $1 billion for medical monitoring and $200 million in plaintiffs attorney fees.
The company has also agreed to pay $25 million for heart disease research.
The company said the settlement would cause it to record expenses of about $3.29 billion, after taxes and insurance coverage.
American Home took in about $13 billion in revenue last year and earned $2.5 billion in profits.
In the only verdict yet to be rendered in any fen-phen lawsuit, Debbie Lovett, 36, of Grand Saline, Texas was awarded $23.3 million in July by a jury for heart damage she suffered after taking fen-phen for more than three months.
Last month the company said it settled the case for less than 10 percent of that amount.
A civil trial had been under way in New Jersey over whether the company should be liable for the cost of medical monitoring, but was suspended earlier this week as the settlement appeared near.
DALLAS (AP) --The first trial over heart-valve damage from fen-phen has ended in a reported $500,000 settlement for a woman who used the diet drug combination.
The settlement came a week into Sandra Moore's case against the pharmaceutical giant American Home Products Corp.
The 52-year-old former teacher had sought $110 million.
American Home said today it had agreed to a settlement but offered no details.
The Dallas Morning News, citing unidentified sources, reported that the company will pay $500,000.
Doctors found mild heart valve damage in Ms.
Moore after she took fen-phen to promote weight loss, and she is on medication for her condition.
She claimed American Home knew heart problems could result but hid them to maximize profits.
Her lawyer, Michael McGartland, did not return calls seeking comment Friday.
American Home argued that Ms.
Moore has a mild and common disorder often called a heart murmur that could be hereditary.
The company said it acted responsibly in marketing and monitoring its products.
American Home, through its Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories subsidiary, marketed fenfluramine --half of the fen-phen combination -- and Redux, a similar product.
The Madison, N.J.-based drug maker pulled fenfluramine and Redux off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request.
A Mayo Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
The drug maker has since been hit with hundreds of lawsuits.
The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
Ms. Moore's lawsuit, the first of its kind to go to a jury, was being closely followed by others with similar claims against the company.
Dallas lawyer Kip Petroff, who has 100 fen-cases, said the settlement could encourage more lawsuits, even from people who didn't suffer major medical problems.
``If a mild case is worth however much they got, I think there are lawyers who are going to be encouraged to pursue such cases,'' Petroff said.
Darrell Keith, a Fort Worth lawyer who said he has rejected several fen-phen cases, said he disagreed because such cases are expensive to pursue.
``To sue for $110 million and then a week later take half a million dollars is not what I call a victory; I call that a loss,'' he said.
``I believe it'll have a chilling effect on people with minor to modest damages.''
CANTON, Texas (AP) --A Texas woman who blames the maker of diet drug fen-phen for damaging her heart valves will try again to have her day in court.
A judge on Monday declared a mistrial after attorneys determined they couldn't seat an impartial jury to hear Debbie Stone Lovett's case against American Home Products Inc.
and subsidiary, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories.
``Too many people had their mind made up that fen-phen was dangerous,'' said Kip Petroff, an attorney representing Ms.
Lovett. He said lawyers were in the midst of questioning 62 prospective jurors when they decided they couldn't find an impartial panel.
Several prospective jurors in Van Zandt County said they had relatives who took fen-phen and would feel uncomfortable hearing the case, The Dallas Morning News reported.
Others, the newspaper said, said Ms.
Lovett was responsible for her injuries because she continues to smoke a half-pack of cigarettes a day despite the known health risks.
Petroff said District Judge Tommy Wallace had set July 12 as a date for a retrial, where a larger pool of prospective jurors would be called.
A hearing was scheduled for this morning to consider consolidating the case with another similar lawsuit.
When Lovett's case goes forward, Petroff said, he will prove that American Home knew its products could cause heart valve damage, but failed to put warnings on drug labels.
``They have people whose job it is to review the safety data and detect if things should be put in the label,'' Petroff said.
``By the time she took it, they knew of 35 cases of valvular heart disease, but had not warned doctors about any of them''.
Doug Petkus, a spokesman for American Home Products, declined to comment on the lawsuit.
The Madison, N.J.-based company is the nation's seventh-largest pharmaceutical company.
Also named in Lovett's suit are Economy Drug of Grand Saline and Wal-Mart Stores, where the prescriptions were filled.
More than 2,600 lawsuits over the health effects of fen-phen are pending, American Home has reported in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.
Several are class-action suits asking the company to pay for medical checkups and future treatments for people who don't know whether they have problems.
An estimated 6 million people in the United States took fen-phen.
Trial lawyers contend thousands suffered problems such as leaky heart valves and primary pulmonary hypertension, an often-fatal lung disease.
Last month, another woman took American Home Products to court over heart-valve damage.
Sandra Moore settled for a reported $500,000 one week into the trial in Johnson County.
Petroff said a national settlement with AHP is being discussed but that it is in preliminary stages and could take months.
Ms. Lovett is suing for past and future suffering and mental anguish and seeking unspecified damages.
Petroff said the 36-year-old woman suffered a series of small strokes and was hospitalized after taking Pondimin and Redux.
He said tests had indicated her heart was healthy before she took the drug.
American Home Products pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request.
A Mayo Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart-valve damage.
The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
DALLAS (AP) --American Home Products Corp.
has reportedly paid more than $3 million to settle a lawsuit by a 70-year-old woman that linked her rare lung disease to the diet-drug combination fen-phen.
The agreement in Ruth Burks' case, reported Thursday by the Dallas Morning News, is at least the 12th settlement by the pharmaceutical giant involving former users of fen-phen.
The drug maker, based in Madison, N.J., faces more than 3,100 lawsuits nationwide related to health problems allegedly caused by its drugs.
An American Home Products spokesman could not immediately be reached by The Associated Press Thursday for comment.
Mrs. Burks' lawyer, C.L.
Mike Schmidt of Dallas, confirmed the settlement's existence to the Morning News but refused to discuss specifics.
American Home Products marketed fenfluramine and its chemical cousin dexfenfluramine until September 1997, when the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration pushed for the drugs' withdrawal.
Phentermine, the other drug used in the fen-phen combination, was not pulled from the market.
The newspaper reported the settlement was more than $3 million, citing sources it did not identify.
The Burks settlement comes less than a month after American Home Products agreed to pay between $6 million and $7 million to settle a Harris County lawsuit linking a woman's death to fen-phen.
The trial was the nation's first involving a patient who died after taking the product.
Mrs. Burks took fen-phen from April 1996 to July 1997.
Doctors diagnosed her with primary pulmonary hypertension, a potentially fatal lung disease, in April 1998.
Mrs. Burks now lives in an assisted-living center in Tyler and receives medication intravenously through a chest catheter.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
(AP) - American Home Products settled a lawsuit with the family of a Quincy woman who died after taking the fen-phen drug combination in an attempt to lose weight for her wedding, the company announced Thursday.
Terms of the deal with relatives of Mary J.
Linnen were not released, but the Madison, N.J.-based company said much of the settlement will be used to fund a medical research foundation established by the Linnen family.
American Home Products' Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories division marketed the "fen" drugs fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine, which were combined with phentermine to make "fen-phen".
The Linnens' lawsuit against phentermine-maker Fisons Corp.
of Collegeville, Pa.
, was dropped earlier this month after a judge ruled a medical witness' conclusions were too speculative.
The Linnens' wrongful death case was the first filed against American Home Products in connection with the fen-phen drugs, said their lawyer, Alex MacDonald.
Almost six million Americans took the diet drug combination until it was banned by the Food and Drug Administration in 1997 after reports that some users developed serious, and sometimes fatal, heart problems.
A statement by the company did not address the issue of whether or not American Home Products admitted any wrongdoing, and Wyeth spokesman Doug Petkus refused to comment on the issue.
But in their lawsuit in Middlesex Superior Court, Linnen's parents, Thomas F.
and Mary J.
Linnen, of Palm Coast, Fla.
, claimed that an autopsy at Massachusetts General Hospital determined their daughter died as a result of "pulmonary hypertension associated with fenfluramine and phentermine therapy for endogenous obesity".
In October, American Home Products agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to fen-phen.
But the settlement only applied to patients with possible heart valve problems.
It did not cover Linnen, who suffered primary pulmonary hypertension, said Alex Zisson, an industry analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
The company has set aside approximately another $1 billion to deal with other claims that might arise.
Even though the exact terms of the Linnen settlement weren't known, Zisson said Wall Street had been given no reason to believe it jeopardized that reserve.
"They haven't given out a dollar figure, but at this point they've said the charge will be adequate," Zisson said.
"Wall Street at this point just wants all the fen-phen litigation to go away.
Even if American Home has to pay a little more than the cases deserve, Wall Street would say that's a good deal".
Even at the time fen-phen was being marketed, primary pulmonary hypertension was a recognized, although rare, side effect, Zisson said.
The Linnens claimed their daughter wasn't notified of the risk.
The Linnens and American Home Products settled the lawsuit after it went to trial.
The family claimed Mary Linnen developed PPH after taking fen-phen for 11 days in 1996, although the company disputed at trial that its drug could be conclusively linked to her condition.
Mary Linnen died in February 1997.
The settlement also covered her doctor, Abby Landzberg, of Newton.
Although the Linnens' case was the first wrongful death lawsuit filed in connection with fen-phen, it was not the first settled.
In Houston last year, relatives of 35-year-old Mary Marisa Smith, who claimed fen-phen killed her, agreed to settle for an undisclosed amount of money three weeks into trial.
HOUSTON _ The nation's first fen-phen wrongful death trial ended in Harris County state district court Tuesday with a reported settlement of $6 million to $7 million, and most jurors said afterward they would not have awarded the plaintiffs any money at all.
``We feel we did the best we could for the kids,'' said Sandra Stom of Friendswood, Texas, whose daughter Mary Marisa Smith, 35, died in September 1997 of complications from a rare lung disease, allegedly caused by the ``fen'' part of the diet drug combination.
Stom was referring to Smith's children, 9 and 4 years old.
Other plaintiffs were Smith's husband, Michael, and father, Michael Stom.
Attorneys involved would not discuss the settlement, which is supposed to be confidential.
Lawyers said two other Harris County fen-phen cases, which did not involve deaths, also settled for confidential amounts Tuesday.
A source who asked to remain anonymous said the Smith settlement was between $6 million and $7 million, and the three settlements were $7.5 million to $8 million.
The Smith case was closely watched because it could shed light on whether juries will blame American Home Products of Madison, N.J., for contributing to the death or injury of fen-phen patients.
About 6 million people took one form of the two types of fen drugs the company sold.
The company said in March that more than 2,600 suits had been filed nationwide.
More than 600 have been filed so far in Harris County.
American Home is accused of deliberately downplaying the risks of the two fen drugs, both of which were removed from the market in September 1997 by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration after they were linked to heart valve problems, a condition Smith did not have.
Company lawyers said they felt vindicated by a poll the 12 jurors and one alternate took privately after being excused by state District Judge Katie Kennedy.
Several jurors said that there were eight votes for American Home, three for the plaintiffs and two undecided.
``I'm a scientist, and I was leaning for the defense because of the science,'' said juror Dave Sawicki of Houston, 47, who works in oil and gas.
``There were a lot of emotional adjectives and adverbs during the trial, but I kept looking at the risk of the disease, and it was rare.
I didn't feel there were any good guys or bad guys, it was just a tragic situation''.
Juror Gaetne Pauwels, who cried during testimony describing Smith's death and the children's suffering, said she felt ``exactly the opposite''.
``Evidence showing the company was negligent was flagrant,'' said Pauwels.
``I'm the same age as Mrs.
Smith was and I have two children about the same age, so I could relate to what they would go through''.
Defense attorney Paul Stallings said he found the straw vote ``interesting'' because the defense was only into its second day and the plaintiffs had two weeks to present their evidence.
He said the straw vote will have no bearing on what the company does in other cases.
Plaintiffs' attorney Graham Hill said he was surprised by the straw vote.
He said the outcome would have been different after jurors deliberated.
Hill said that before the settlement was reached, Kennedy had allowed into evidence a memo written by a top FDA official saying the company had manipulated the agency, reversing her prior ruling keeping it out.
The judge, he said, also allowed evidence that the company threatened to sue a pharmacy that tried to warn customers about the drug's possible risks with a boxed warning on its pharmacy envelopes.
A top American Home official testified Monday that the risks of the fen drug that Smith took outweighed the benefits if taken longer than three months.
Smith took it for year.
No jury has yet deliberated on a fen-phen case, and the Smith case was the furthest any such case has progressed.
The first case to go to trial did not involve anyone's death and was settled for a reported $500,000 on April 8 in Cleburne.
Plaintiffs' lawyers have said that American Home wants to avoid a jury decision while it is trying to negotiate a settlement of all fen-phen litigation.
The company has refused to discuss those negotiations.
Smith, who weighed about 270 pounds, took the drug fenfluramine, brand named Pondimin, and phentermine for about a year and lost 70 pounds.
Her prescribing doctor, Leo Borrell, was also sued, but he was dismissed by the plaintiffs last week.
Smith died of a blood infection caused by a catheter used to pump in a drug to widen her pulmonary blood vessels, which the suit said had become constricted by Pondimin.
Plaintiffs' attorneys have said that about 5 percent of the fen-phen cases involve similar constrictions, called primary pulmonary hypertension.
Most of the fen-phen cases allege heart-valve leakage problems, while others claim ``neurotoxicity,'' which has various symptoms, such as fatigue and headaches.
A 1996 European study said long-term users of prescription diet drugs had a 23-fold greater risk than the general public of incurring primary pulmonary hypertension.
But even for long-term diet drug users, the annual risk was low, estimated to be 23 to 46 per million users, and there is no widely accepted biological mechanism linking the drugs to the disease.
The two fen drugs sold by American Home Products were Pondimin and Redux, or dexfenfluramine.
Smith's attorneys claimed that for much of the early 1990s, American Home Products greatly underreported the associations of Pondimin with primary pulmonary hypertension to get FDA approval of Redux in 1996.
Until 1997, Pondimin's label said the drug had been associated with four cases of the disease and one death.
Company officials testified that they were aware of at least five associations as of 1991 and 62 associations and 11 deaths in 1996.
In the trial, company officials conceded the label was inaccurate, but said the FDA knew about all the reported associations and had never demanded it be changed.
They said part of the reason they did not change it was that they were awaiting the results of the European study.
Plaintiffs' attorneys also tried to show the company sought to avoid the most serious type of warning label, bordered by black boxes, because it would drastically cut sales.
Company officials said the boldfaced warning that was used was adequate and approved by the FDA, which had determined that the drugs' benefits outweighed the risks.
Phentermine, the phen part of the combo, was never associated with the same risks and is still available.
&QL; XXXX END OF STORY &QL;
HOUSTON _ The nation's first full trial of a lawsuit involving the death of a ``fen-phen'' diet drug-combination patient is to start Tuesday in Harris County state district court.
The trial is being closely watched because it could indicate whether jurors will buy arguments that the ``fen'' part of the combination could cause serious heart disease leading to death, as well as how much jurors might award in such cases.
Lawyers have declined to comment, saying state District Judge Katie Kennedy did not want them to discuss the trial before opening statements.
Lawyers familiar with litigation over the diet drugs have said several fen-phen death cases in the country have been settled for about $4 million to $5 million each.
The manufacturer of the ``fen'' drug, American Home Products of Madison, N.J., met recently with lawyers in New York and Houston to discuss a possible settlement of the potentially tens of thousands of fen-phen cases nationwide.
A jury verdict in this case could significantly impact such a settlement, lawyers have said.
No figures have been discussed in the settlement talks, lawyers have said, but any such settlement would easily exceed the drug company's $1 billion insurance liability limit for fen-related claims.
The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration pulled ``fen'' from the market Sept.
15, 1997, citing evidence it may have irreversibly, and sometimes fatally, scarred users' heart valves.
An estimated 6.6 million people have used the diet drug combination.
No jury has ruled on any fen-phen cases.
A case in Cleburne, Texas, was the first to reach trial in the country, but it was settled April 8, before American Home Products started presenting its case.
Although the settlement was supposed to be confidential, it was reported to be $500,000.
That case did not involve a death.
The plaintiffs in the Houston-area case are the survivors of Mary Marisa Smith, who died allegedly of primary pulmonary hypertension as a result of taking ``fen'' under the marketed name of ``Pondimin''.
The lawsuit does not say when Smith died or her age, only that she had a life expectancy of at least 50 more years.
The plaintiffs are her husband, two children and two parents, all of Harris County, which includes most of Houston.
They are seeking unspecified damages from American Home Products, Dr.
Leo Borrell, who prescribed the drug, and the M.D.
Managed Weight Care clinic in Clear Lake, Texas.
The plaintiffs also name the manufacturers of the ``phen'' part of the combination, but a panel of state district judges has ruled that those manufacturers are not liable.
The lawsuit claims the defendants had ample knowledge before FDA's withdrawal that the drugs could cause serious heart disease.
All defendants have denied wrongdoing in court documents, saying evidence linking the drug to the disease is inconclusive.
The ``fen'' part of the drug combination was manufactured by a division of American Home Products, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of Philadelphia.
Two versions were marketed _ fenfluramine, sold as Pondimin, and a purer version of the compound known as dexfenfluramine, or Redux.
The FDA withdrawal did not include phentermine, the ``phen'' of the drug combination, manufactured by several companies, primarily Interneuron Pharmaceuticals of Lexington, Mass.
No studies linked this drug with the heart valve damage.
However, phentermine manufacturers were also sued in Harris County because they allegedly marketed phentermine to prolong the usage of either ``fen'' compound from the usual 12 weeks to six months.
Phentermine manufacturers have been dismissed from most, if not all, suits around the country.
&QL; XXXX END OF STORY &QL;
HOUSTON (AP) --American Home Products has agreed to pay $8 million to $9 million to a Houston woman in what could be the largest settlement to date for any individual claiming harm by the fen-phen diet drug combination, the Houston Chronicle reported today.
The deal was reached Friday, the newspaper reported, citing an unidentified source.
Attorneys and the company both declined to comment.
Virginia Brinkley, 55, had to have two heart valves replaced with artificial valves and was facing a third replacement, allegedly because of side effects from the drugs.
Her case was to go to trial on Monday.
John O'Quinn, her attorney, said Brinkley began taking fen-phen in 1995 to lose weight and treat an acid reflux problem.
Her heart valve problems were diagnosed a year later.
American Home made the "fen" in fen-phen, a drug called fenfluramine.
It sold the drug under the brand name Pondimin along with a chemical cousin called Redux.
The company pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market in 1997 after a Mayo Clinic study linked fenfluramine to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
Phentermine hasn't been linked to problems when taken alone.
It is made by another company and is still on the market.
In October, Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products announced it would pay $4.8 billion to settle fen-phen lawsuits.
However, attorneys representing thousands of fen-phen users said they won't participate in the settlement.
PHILADELPHIA (AP) --Shares of American Home Products Corp.
fell sharply on Friday after a ruling by a federal judge that could allow patients in up to 44 states to collectively sue the company for the cost of monitoring their health after they took two diet drugs, known as fen-phen.
American Home shares fell $3.87 1/2, or 8 percent, to $42.12 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The ruling late Thursday by U.S.
District Judge Louis Bechtle in Philadelphia conditionally certified a class-action lawsuit against the company by patients who took the drugs Pondimin and Redux before they were withdrawn from the market in 1997.
The decision allows the federal suit filed last year to proceed to trial.
Pondimin and Redux, two prescription diet drugs often taken in combination, were taken off the market in 1997 at the request of the Food and Drug Administration after some users developed heart-valve damage.
The combination was popularly known as ``fen-phen,'' a reference to the first syllables of the chemicals used to make the drugs.
An estimated 6 million people took the drugs, though AHP contends the majority used them for less than 30 days.
More than 4,000 lawsuits nationwide have been filed against the company by people who say they suffer heart and lung problems because of the pills.
American Home denies any wrongdoing.
The Philadelphia class-action seeks to have AHP pay for checkups for people who used the drugs for 30 days or more between 1992 and 1997.
Residents in six other states are excluded from the Philadelphia-based suit because similar suits are pending in those states, Bechtle ruled.
The ruling comes just as AHP has agreed to pay more than 36,000 women to settle claims that the implantable contraceptive device Norplant caused headaches, irregular menstrual bleeding, nausea and depression.
AHP, the parent of Norplant maker Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement, saying Thursday it was ``purely a business decision.''
HOUSTON (AP) --The manufacturer of the diet drug combination fen-phen is in talks to settle millions of health claims brought by people who contend the drug caused leaky heart valves and often-fatal lung problems, lawyers said Thursday.
Negotiations with pharmaceutical giant American Home Products Corp.
began several weeks ago, but talks are still too preliminary to put a price tag on a possible settlement, Houston lawyer Graham Hill said.
``I don't see how any lawyer on the plaintiffs' side at this point could say what it would take to settle all the cases,'' said Hill, whose firm represents 100 people who say they developed health problems after using fen-phen.
James Peterson, another plaintiff's lawyer, said the drug company initiated the talks.
The Dallas Morning News, which first reported the possibility of a national agreement Thursday, said American Home would pay billions of dollars under such a deal.
A spokesman for American Home, the world's seventh-largest pharmaceutical company, declined comment.
A trial is scheduled later this spring.
Last month, American Home reached a settlement in the first trial over heart-valve damage from fen-phen.
The company reportedly agreed to a $500,000 settlement to one plaintiff.
More than 2,600 individual lawsuits have been filed against fen-phen, and class-action lawsuits asking the company to pay for medical checkups and future medical treatments have been certified in several states.
An estimated 6 million people in the United States took fen-phen.
Trial lawyers contend thousands suffered problems such as leaky heart valves and primary pulmonary hypertension, an often-fatal lung disease.
American Home, through its Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories subsidiary, marketed fenfluramine --half of the fen-phen combination -- and Redux, a similar product.
The Madison, N.J.-based drug maker pulled fenfluramine and Redux off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request after a Mayo Clinic study linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
Attorneys for both sides met Wednesday in Houston, Hill said.
Other meetings have occurred over the past two weeks in Philadelphia and New York.
One possible settlement of the class-action cases could involve American Home paying for medical examinations of fen-phen users who have not yet reported health problems, Hill said.
It has not yet been decided whether those diagnosed with problems would be eligible for damages.

Almost seven years ago, Magic Johnson faced a battery of cameras and announced his retirement from the NBA ``because of the HIV virus I have''.
Today he is remarkably robust by any definition of good health, thanks to drugs that have been so successful that they have reduced the virus to levels that cannot be detected.
His wife and three children are healthy.
Johnson's new TV show, ``The Magic Hour,'' is just one aspect of a busy life: --HIS HEALTH: While by no means cured, he owes the appearance of remarkable health to a Spartan lifestyle and modern medicine.
Like many AIDS patients on these new medications, he takes a combination of three drugs, one a protease inhibitor.Side effects can include nausea, vomiting, headaches, backaches or gastrointestinal problems.
The drugs are expensive, costing $12,000 to $15,000 a year.
--HIS MOVIE THEATERS: He's a partner in a joint venture with Sony Theaters in Los Angeles, Houston and Atlanta, with expansion plans for nine more cities.
In Atlanta, where he already has one multiplex theater at Greenbriar Mall, the financing plans for a second one, in south DeKalb County, drew criticism because of concerns that public money would be used.
But the plan, which was approved by the DeKalb County Commission and will be implemented through the DeKalb County Development Authority, provides financing and interest rate incentives and uses funds from private investors.
--OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS: Johnson recently became Starbucks' first joint-venture partner, with a location in Los Angeles.
He has a joint venture with TGI Friday's, with plans to open restaurants near his theaters.
He also has formed California Urban Investment Partners with the California Public Employees' Retirement System, investing in commercial real estate.
And he represents American Express and Adolph Coors in TV ads.
Recently, he joined Janet Jackson and record industry executive Jheryl Busby in buying a majority stake in Founders National Bank, California's only African American-owned bank.

NEW YORK _ Time Inc.
has joined forces with Starbucks, the coffeehouse giant responsible for caffeinating seven million Americans every week.
The two companies will start publication this summer of Joe, a cultural review that will be sold in the 2,000 Starbucks stores sprinkled across the United States and Canada as liberally as the chocolate powder on top of a double-mocha cappuccino grande.
Scott Mowbray, the managing editor of Joe, said that his editorial goal was to replicate the ideas and the conversation one encounters in a coffeehouse.
To that end, the magazine's subtitle will be ``Life is Interesting.
Discuss''. If that sounds similar to the subtitle for Tina Brown's Talk _ hers is ``The American Conversation'' _ it is purely coincidental, Mowbray said.
``We aren't inviting comparisons to anyone,'' he said.
``It's going to be a cultural magazine, but not in the gray sense, not in the review sense''.
About 400,000 copies of the first 84-page issue, which will cost $3, will arrive in Starbucks stores in June.
Three bimonthly issues are planned for this year.
Howard Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, said: ``Starbucks has emerged as the third place, between home and work, in America.
It is the true extension of people's front porch.
What people do inside Starbucks is talk, and coffee has been the centerpiece of conversation for hundreds of years''.
David L.
Long, president of media sales and marketing at Time Inc.
, a unit of Time Warner Inc.
, is not as interested in conversation as he is in circulation.
``If we can sell a copy and a half a day in each of their stores, we'll make a bunch of money,'' Long said, adding that producing a magazine for a chain that already provides distribution eliminates all the costs of building circulation.
``Our distribution costs are zero,'' he said.
Because Starbucks already has alliances with United Airlines, Barnes &AMP; Noble and the Starwood hotel chain, Joe has natural advertisers.
General Motors, which is not affiliated, has signed up for several pages of advertising in the first issue.
Schultz would not say what writers already had delivered pieces for Joe, but he said he had spoken to Garry Trudeau and Nora Ephron about contributing.
``Did you see `You've Got Mail'''? he asked, referring to the movie Ms.
Ephron wrote and directed.
``She used Starbucks almost like a character in the movie.
It was incredible.''
Debut issue To make sure their customers never get caught without anything to read, Starbucks has launched Joe, a magazine designed to stimulate coffeehouse conversation.
Who better to write about heroes than heroes?
That was the thinking behind Time's ($3.95) ``Person of the Century'' project.
In the final installment of 20 nominees, Henry Aaron writes about Jackie Robinson, and avid soccer fan Henry Kissinger offers his views on Pele.
``They say certain people are bigger than life,'' Aaron writes, ``but Jackie Robinson is the only man I've known who truly was''.
How was the list of nominees compiled?
Time's editors say they looked at people who liberated a segment of society.
``Jackie Robinson broke the color line in baseball; Helen Keller demolished old notions about the blind and deaf; Harvey Milk dared to put himself on the ballot as an openly gay candidate''.
And, of course, there are the old standby heroes such as Charles Lindbergh, Muhammad Ali, Mother Teresa, Anne Frank and America's GIs.
&QR; EYE-OPENER: When director Stanley Kubrick asked Frederic Raphael to work with him on a script in 1994, the screenwriter for ``Darling'' and ``Two for the Road'' jumped at the chance.
Basically, Kubrick wanted to adapt an Austrian novel about a devoted couple whose lives spin off into an erotic nightmare at a masquerade ball in which they are separately propositioned.
Raphael, who describes his experiences with the temperamental director in The New Yorker ($3), soon found himself in his own nightmare.
Kubrick wanted the script for ``Eyes Wide Shut'' to be unmistakably his, and he wanted to move the action from turn-of-the-century Vienna to contemporary New York.
Hadn't many things changed since then, Raphael asked, including relations between men and women?
``Think so''?
Kubrick said.
``I don't think so''.

Produced under a joint agreement with Starbucks and Time Inc.
, the magazine is slick and obviously aimed at a young upscale audience.
Much of the premiere issue takes an edgy look at trust in human relationships.
``It is not a magazine about coffee,'' says Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz, ``but it is certainly inspired by the idea of coffeehouse culture''.
&QR; JUNGLE JANE: Robyn Burnham leads a swinging life, literally, as a paleobotanist whose specialty is studying vines of the South American rain forest.
In an intriguing profile in the second issue of Women Outside ($3.95), Kent Black follows the 42-year-old Burnham deep into Ecuador's heart of darkness in search of medicinal plants.

A recent deal between Starbucks and the urban delivery specialist Kozmo.com _in which Starbucks will essentially set aside space in its coffee shops for Kozmo _ may be the first example of an established retailer offering its floor space and personnel to an e-commerce company.
But it is unlikely to be the last.
Industry executives and analysts predict that such agreements will come rapidly in the next few months, as Internet retailers struggle to address two of their most glaring vulnerabilities _ customer acquisition costs and returns _while continuing to close the gap between virtual and traditional stores.
The agreements will take many forms.
The convenience-store chain 7-Eleven, for instance, plans to install Internet-ready ATMs, which might eventually let customers order goods from Web retailers and have them delivered to the store.
And in such arrangements, customers might also be able to return Internet goods to the stores.
Package handling companies like Mail Boxes Etc.
are already starting to handle returns and exchanges on behalf of Internet retailers.
Other national chains, like drugstores and gas station convenience marts, might also add such services as a side business.
Indeed, any retailer with a national presence and a strong distribution and warehousing system is a prime candidate to join with e-commerce sites, analysts predict.
Customers who enjoy the convenience of the Web might also prefer knowing that if anything goes wrong with a purchase, they can find a real person at a real store to make it better.
``The need for this is huge,'' said Tim Washer, director of interactive research with NFO Interactive, a market research company.
``What it's about is reducing the risk of shopping online.
Offering a retail presence will really facilitate that''.
Kozmo executives stressed those points in announcing the deal this month.
``We'll be able to ride on Starbucks' coattails, and give our customers an incredible sense of confidence,'' said Joseph Park, chief executive of Kozmo, which offers free one-hour delivery of goods purchased on its Internet site.
Kozmo, which operates only in Boston, New York, Washington, Seattle and San Francisco so far, specializes in delivering videos, books, food and convenience goods.
Under the deal, Kozmo will pay Starbucks $150 million over five years for the right to place return boxes in Starbucks stores.
The boxes will initially be used for rental videos, games and DVDs, but will eventually be available for other products, as well, like disposable cameras ready for processing or defective items being returned for a refund.
In addition, Starbucks will promote Kozmo and train its sales staff to answer questions about the Internet company.
Kozmo, in turn, will deliver Starbucks coffees and teas by the pound _ and eventually perhaps hot beverages, too.
The partnership, which is to include joint marketing, will immediately raise Kozmo's credibility with consumers, predicted Chris Vroom, e-commerce analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
And it will also give Kozmo an efficient way to reach new customers, he said.
Vroom said Internet retailers typically spent about $100 to acquire each customer _ an exorbitant amount, because the average customer will spend only about $200 at a given site in a lifetime.
A $30 million annual outlay to Starbucks will swell Kozmo's customer acquisition costs in the short term, he said, but in the long term it could pay off, given Starbucks' huge clientele.
``Starbucks can put a Kozmo logo on coffee cups that 10 million customers a week will buy,'' Vroom said.
``That's a powerful thing''.
Perhaps more powerful is the ability of such partnerships to provide e-commerce customers an easy way to return goods _ not simply rental items, but, more important, goods deemed unsatisfactory by the customers.
Internet merchants have been widely criticized for their failures in this regard, particularly as return rates have reached roughly 30 percent _ a rate slightly higher than in the catalog industry.
nn Retailers with stores online and offline, like Gap and Federated's Macy's, have had an edge at least in part because their customers can return goods to a store whether they were bought online or off.
And though e-commerce companies are loath to open up stores for this reason alone, they are clearly in the market for help from companies that can help streamline returns.
``As I speak, there are four or five people from e-commerce companies in this building talking to us about it,'' said James Amos, chief executive of Mail Boxes Etc.
, speaking from his office in San Diego.
Amos estimated that 300 other companies had asked Mail Boxes ``for access to our 4,000 stores'' in the last several months.
``We're in discussions with just about everyone that'd come to the top of your mind,'' he said.
Amos said the deluge began late last year when the company agreed to provide customers of eBay auctions with help in inspecting and returning items bought online.
Since then, Mail Boxes has begun installing satellite dishes in franchise stores, in hopes of connecting all of its business partners in a single network.
The satellites will not only provide high-speed Internet access, the company said, but will link the stores' cash registers directly to the corporate office and to the company's e-commerce partners.
That setup, in turn, will allow the company to plug into the back-office systems of Internet retailers _ so that if a customer of an Internet-only merchant wanted to exchange an item at a Mail Boxes store, the replacement item could be sent to a Mail Boxes location.
The customer could then simply drop off the old item, pick up the new one and not have to deal with packaging, postage or coordinating delivery times.
Noting that the first e-commerce partnerships will be announced after the satellite system is completed next month, Amos said, ``We're basically going to be a bridge between the virtual and the real world''.
Naturally, Mail Boxes will have plenty of company in that regard.
United Parcel Service, which recently announced plans to expand its network of drop-off centers by testing storefront locations in suburban areas, might use those stores to support e-commerce companies.
``We're definitely going to contemplate it,'' said Mark Rhoney, president of UPS eVentures, the business UPS set up to help e-commerce companies fill orders.
Kenny Kurtzman, chief executive of Ashford.com, an online jewelry and luxury goods retailer, would welcome a partnership with an offline company ``if that would help give customers an easier way to return products,'' he said.
``We'd look to partner with someone like FedEx or UPS to do that''.
In exploring its own partnerships with e-commerce companies, 7-Eleven has not been approached by online jewelers, ``but we have had some bizarre offers,'' said James Keyes, chief operating officer.
``I don't think someone will pick up their living room furniture at our store''.
Keyes said that by this summer, 7-Eleven would test ATMs with Internet access.
Besides getting cash, customers would be able to cash checks or obtain money orders or get directions from Web sites, for instance.
Initially, the ATMs would not include Internet retailers, he said, but that might change eventually.
``If you wanted a new videogame, you could preview it and order it at the store, then have it delivered to the store on the day of the release,'' Keyes said.
Just such a service is already available in Japan, he said, as the result of an agreement between 7-Eleven and Sony.
The company would also welcome the chance to take returned merchandise for Web retailers, ``as long as the goods make sense in our environment,'' Keyes said.
PORTLAND, Ore.
(AP) --Tazo, an Oregon company that once aspired to be the Starbucks of teas, has been bought out by Starbucks.
Seattle-based Starbucks hopes that with Tazo it can attract new customers.
The company will discontinue its in-house Infusia brand of tea, which currently accounts for just 1 percent of Starbucks' $1.3 billion in annual sales.
``Tea will drive more people into our stores, and I think this is the highest-quality tea in the nation,'' said Howard Schultz, Starbucks chairman and chief executive officer.
``It's a much-loved brand''.
Tazo should be available in Starbucks stores by the end of the year.
Tazo calls itself ``The Reincarnation of Tea'' on its labels and cultivates a quirky image.
The ingredients listing, for example, says each tea bag includes ``the mumbled chantings of a certified tea shaman''.
Tazo is sold in tea bags, in leaves and bottled as iced tea.
Its blends include minty Refresh, chamomile-based Calm, citrus Wild Sweet Orange, and Passion, billed as a blend of hibiscus and other tropical flowers and herbs.
Steve Smith, who founded Tazo in 1994, would not disclose what Starbucks paid for Tazo.
LOS ANGELES _ Sipping his coffee at the Starbucks restaurant on Melrose Avenue here, Matt Siess said he loved the brew and the atmosphere.
But he is skeptical about the coffee chain's new ambition to sell things beyond drinks and light food.
``I'm not sure what selling coffee has to do with selling Calphalon,'' he said referring to the cookware products.
``Ultimately, I guess, I think that most people that come here, come here to relax''.
Like some of its customers, Starbucks investors are skeptical as well about the company's plans, announced late Wednesday, to become an Internet retailer, not just of roasted beans and coffee mugs, but of everything from frying pans to towels, picture frames and even sofas and credenzas.
Shares of the Seattle-based Starbucks Corp.
lost 28 percent of their value Thursday, falling $10.625 to close at $26.9375, after the company announced its Internet strategy and said that its earnings for the fiscal year would be 10 percent below Wall Street's expectation.
More than 73 million shares changed hands, making Starbucks the most actively traded issue.
To many investors, the earnings disappointment and the Internet announcement both suggested that a phenomenally successful company was losing its focus.
``They are trying to stretch who they are as a company into an area where they really don't have any expertise,'' said John Ivankoe, an analyst at Schroder &AMP; Co.
The chairman and chief executive of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, who once defied skeptics who said that the country did not need more fancy coffee shops, promised to do the same with Internet strategy, with legions of customers like Siess following Starbucks into cyberspace.
Schultz told analysts and investors in a conference call late Wednesday that the company would create the ``premier lifestyle portal on the Internet,'' saying that the Starbucks Web site would offer ``a feeling of romance, of relaxation'' similar to what he said a customer might experience in a coffee shop.
He denied that Starbucks was losing its focus, telling the analysts that the coffee-shop business ``is and always will be the driver of what we do''.
Starbucks said it expected to earn 54 cents a share in the year that ends on Oct.
3, rather than the 60 cents analysts had been expecting.
Last year, the company earned 44 cents a share.
The problem, Starbucks said, is not that profit from coffee shops is falling.
Rather, they just did not grow enough to make up for other setbacks, like flat sales of the company's Frappuccino bottled coffee drink, which is sold in supermarkets.
Company officials insist that the core business of North American coffee shops is not overdeveloped.
Sales at stores open at least a year are up 5 percent so far this fiscal year.
Starbucks, which has about 2,000 North American shops, is opening 400 new shops this year.
It also wants to expand overseas.
Still, the company has been diversifying to prepare for the day when growth of that core business will slow.
That is where the Internet comes in.
Schultz said that Starbucks would set up a portal site by the end of this year.
Once viewers come to the home page of the site, they will be led to other pages selling not only Starbucks coffee but gourmet food, kitchenware, home furnishings and furniture.
Many of these sites would be managed by retailers that already sell such goods and would retain their brand names.
He also said the company would announce a major strategic partnership this summer to pursue the Web business.
Starbucks will also consider acquisitions and investments in other companies that provide some of the products to be sold on the Web site.
He said he could not confirm or deny rumors that Starbucks was trying to buy Williams-Sonoma, the retailer of fancy cookware.
Schultz said the key to Starbucks' success would be its ability to attract Web customers through its shops by such measures as advertising the Web site on the 14 million paper cups it uses each week.
``Our customers have a relationship with Starbucks that is different from a traditional bricks-and-mortar store,'' he said.
But some of the customers at the Melrose Avenue shop were not that sure.
Rosie Taravella, a 37-year-old actress and screenwriter sipping a Grande Guatamalan, remarked, ``What I'd like to see Starbucks invest in is drive-throughs _ making the obtaining of coffee easier.''
SEATTLE _ While maps looking like they came from a Pentagon situation room flashed on a huge screen behind him, Starbucks Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz stood before a happy house of shareholders Tuesday and touted the progress in bringing the company's brand of coffeehouse culture to the rest of the planet.
``We are building a truly enduring global brand,'' said Schultz.
Starbucks' global juggernaut is on track with plans this year to open 500 stores around the world, Schultz said to an annual meeting filled with people rejoicing over Monday's announcement of a 2-for-1 split of its shares of common stock.
The split will be in the form of a stock dividend payable on March 19 for shareholders of record on March 5.
Starbucks closed yesterday at $52.375, up $2.50.
The company already has 100 stores in Pacific Rim countries such as Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and New Zealand, with plans to have 500 stores in the Pacific Rim by 2003.
And a beachhead has been established in Europe with the acquisition last May of the Seattle Coffee Co.
in the United Kingdom.
The company's expansion program continues in the United States as well.
At year end, the company owned 1,688 stores in 32 states, the District of Columbia, four Canadian provinces and the U.K.
It is projected to have 2,336 stores by the end of 1999.
The aggressive expansion program is fueling the company's steady growth in revenues and earnings with about 84 percent of net revenues coming from the retail stores.
Net revenues rose from $975.4 million in fiscal 1997 to $1.3 billion in fiscal 1998, ``due primarily to the company's store expansion program and comparable store sales increases,'' according to the annual report.
The report goes on to note that the company ``has experienced a certain level of cannibalization of existing stores by new stores as the store concentration has increased''.
But operating margins have grown or maintained a steady pace since 1994 with the exception of 1996 when a South America freeze cause coffee prices to spike.
The margin for 1998 was unchanged from 1997 at 8.8 percent.
Schultz took a shot at those who might think that Starbucks can't sustain such growth over the long term.
``The cynics will say that Starbucks has 2,000 stores and we're nearing saturation,'' said Schultz.
``We are not''.
John Rogers, an analyst for D.A.
Davidson &AMP; Co.
in Portland, agreed.
``There are probably selected markets where you have an abundance of coffee vendors,'' he said.
``But overall, for most of the country, you are a probably quite a ways from saturation.
The evidence of that is the continued growth in same store sales (open at least a year).
Stores that have been there for a long time are still putting up very good numbers, they are still growing''.
Schultz noted that the company enjoys the highest degree of frequency of any retail store in America with the average customer coming in 18 times a month.
The company has big plans to continue leveraging that loyalty to its brand built so carefully at the retail coffee shops.
Starbucks has tapped the Pepsi-Cola Co.'s ``ubiquitous distribution power'' to sell its Frappuccino blended coffee beverage which leads the ready-to-drink coffee category, said Schultz.
The CEO's prediction for revenues from Frappuccino: ``We believe Frappuccino will be bigger than Starbucks is today''.
And at the end of the fourth quarter, Starbucks joined Kraft Foods, Inc.
in a licensing agreement to distribute, market and sell its beans at supermarkets around the nation.
``We have less than 5 percent of the overall coffee market in America,'' said Schultz.
``We are going to have much, much more than a 5 percent share of the coffee market in America, I promise you''.
Schultz, in paying tribute to Howard Behar, who has been overseeing the company's expansion overseas and plans to retire this year, said Behar has been at the heart of Starbucks corporate culture.
It is a culture, said Schultz, that puts a premium on nurturing relationships with both employees and the communities in which it operates.
Of the overseas expansion, Behar said: ``Starbucks set out to be a bridge among peoples and among cultures, not to sell more coffee.''
NEW YORK (AP) --Starbucks will soon be offering a new kind of Joe.
The giant coffee shop owner announced Monday it is teaming with Time Inc.
to publish a magazine called Joe that will be sold at most of Starbucks' 1,800 locations across North America.
The first issue of Joe will be published in June, covering a variety of topics including books, film, art and travel.
Two more issues are scheduled for this year.
``The coffeehouse has always been at the center of conversation, community and culture.
With Joe, we want to encourage those traditions,'' Howard Schultz, chairman of Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee Co.
, said in a statement.
Scott Mowbray, managing editor of Time Inc.'s custom publishing division, will be Joe's managing editor.
Time Inc.
is the nation's largest magazine publisher, with such titles as Time, Sports Illustrated, People and Entertainment Weekly.
It seems absurd: The world's biggest coffee shop, Starbucks Corp.
, trying to buy Williams-Sonoma Inc.
, a seller of leather armchairs and mixing bowls.
Starbucks' acquisition offer, rebuffed by San Francisco's Williams-Sonoma earlier this month, was unexpected because it ignored the conventional rules of retail mergers.
Typically such deals tout synergistic benefits in areas like real estate, buying raw goods or marketing _ none of which have much traction in this case.
Instead, Seattle's Starbucks, a brick-and-mortar retailer, proposed buying Williams-Sonoma, a brick-and-mortar retailer, as an Internet play _ an opportunity for Starbucks to hitch a ride on Williams-Sonoma's e-commerce business.
Four years ago, such a combination would have made no sense.
Even today it seems a bit wacky.
But it also provides a striking example of how the digital world is redefining businesses as analog as a double decaf macchiato.
``Business as usual is dead and the rule book has been thrown out,'' said Jamie Owens, president of the Retail Group, a Seattle consulting firm.
Companies today ``are not fish nor fowl, they've got fins and feathers''.
Starbucks declined to comment on the acquisition attempt, first reported in The Chronicle on Friday, and Williams-Sonoma will say only that it is not for sale.
Sources say that Williams-Sonoma's board voted to reject Starbucks' overture in an emergency meeting in mid-June.
Industry observers see the move as vintage Howard Schultz.
Schultz, Starbucks' chief executive, is proving as ambitious on the Web as he has been with physical stores.
This is a man who, a decade ago, looked at a country where coffee is available on every street corner and proceeded to roll out a national chain of coffee bars.
Now he heads a $1.3 billion company that sells coffee, tea, canned drinks, and ice cream in supermarkets and more than 2,000 coffee bars around the world.
Schultz sees the Web as a key meeting place in the lifestyle of the future, and he plans to be there.
At the center of his strategy is a lifestyle portal and cable television franchise that will feature information, entertainment and e-shopping for upscale women.
Two weeks ago, Starbucks agreed to partner with Oxygen Media of New York, which is designing such a portal.
Details are sketchy, but Schultz said in a statement, ``We'll be able to provide a seamless customer experience through our retail stores, cable and the Internet''.
Already 70 percent of Starbucks high-income customers are on the Internet, Schultz noted, so he's got the right kind of upscale, wired demographics for the project.
Other pieces of Starbucks' Internet strategy include investing millions of dollars in chat-room developer Talk City in April and the launch earlier this month of an online and in-store magazine, Joe, in cooperation with Time Inc.
A press release described Joe as a new vehicle for ``conversation, community and culture'' allied with the Starbucks brand.
But there's a problem: coffee drinks aren't available on the Web.
``Computers can't serve latte, at least not yet,'' noted retail analyst Bonnie Kramer Tonneson of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
Even coffee beans, which constitute a small minority of Starbucks' sales, don't have much Net potential since Starbucks operates physical shops on almost every corner, making access to beans at least as convenient as at &LR; www.starbucks.
&LR; &LR; com.
&LR; So who does Starbucks turn to for a highly branded, well-known merchant partner that can attract wealthy shoppers and generate significant Web sales?
Although Williams-Sonoma is late to the Web _ it just launched its first full-scale site June 1 _ its high-cachet brand name, big-ticket merchandise and loyal customer base make it a logical partner.
But Williams-Sonoma has its own Internet strategy in mind.
Three days after rebuffing the coffee-maker, Williams-Sonoma announced a deal with CondeNet, the online magazine affiliate of Conde Nast magazines.
Williams-Sonoma expects to be a player in a portal/cable TV business under development by CondeNet and Time Warner.
The retailer is rolling out a full-scale Williams-Sonoma kitchenware store this fall, adding to its new wedding registry at &LR; www.
&LR; &LR; wswedding.com &LR;. Next year it plans to launch two Pottery Barn home furnishings sites, a registry and a store.
Cynthia Cohen, president of the consulting firm Strategic Mindshare, likens Starbucks' lust for Williams-Sonoma to the purchase of cataloger Fingerhut Companies Inc.
by Federated Department Stores Inc.
earlier this year.
Fingerhut's appeal was its expertise in back-end order fulfillment, which Federated intends to apply to its e-commerce businesses, said Cohen.
Williams-Sonoma also boasts crack fulfillment systems, and carries the additional value of well-known and highly regarded brand names _ Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Hold Everything and Chambers.
&UR; &LR; Conventional retailers like Williams-Sonoma ``already have equity in consumers' minds, (and) trusted brands have everything to do with the future of e-commerce,'' said Owens.
The Starbucks overture raises questions about Williams-Sonoma's future as an independent company.
One reason it was considered a desirable takeover candidate is that its stock is priced more like that of a modest store and catalog merchant than a hot e-commerce play.
But that is starting to change.
Shares have risen 20 percent since news of the Starbucks bid became public, closing yesterday at $35.81, up $1.81.
Whether Williams-Sonoma is now being valued for its e-commerce potential or as an acquisition target is hard to say.
Tonneson believes the stock still has plenty of upside potential since investors are just beginning to think of it as an e-commerce play.
Consequently, Williams-Sonoma executive stockholders are unlikely to sell now and miss out on any future stock run-up, she said.
``Why give that away to someone else, when now they're really in the game''?
Tonneson said.

SEATTLE _ Basketball legend Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson and Starbucks boss Howard Schultz brought their inner-city road show to Seattle's Columbia City neighborhood Friday.
They opened the latest in their 50-50 joint-venture Starbucks Coffee stores and Johnson said there will be more in Seattle, along with one of Johnson's multiplex movie theaters.
Schultz's Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee Co.
and Johnson's Los Angeles-based Johnson Development Corp.
have recently opened similar Starbucks coffee stores in West Los Angeles and New York's Harlem.
More than 200 residents of the South Seattle Columbia City community turned out to catch a glimpse of the retired National Basketball Association superstar who became a top-flight business executive.
``I saw him on TV playing with Michael Jordan in the Olympics,'' said Michael Davis, 6.
His mom, Sheree Davis, brought Michael and his stepbrother, Forrest Britt, 5, to the store at the corner of Rainier Avenue South and South Edmunds Street to see Johnson and, perhaps pick up his autograph.
``I think this will mean jobs for the neighborhood and will help other businesses come in and help the area become stable,'' she said.
Johnson and Schultz said that along with making a profit, a major goal of their venture is helping the community by showing other companies that it is good business to bring services to inner cities.
``I think there is a balance at what business can be and it's not only to show a profit but to show some benevolence and give back,'' Schultz said.
``We hope other national retailers will come in''.
Johnson said giving pride to the community, bringing ``a first class'' retailer and supplying jobs are among his goals.
``We feel the community here deserves this,'' Johnson said.
``We want what everybody else wants and that's the best of the best _ and today you have the best''.
Johnson said that the millions of dollars he earned during his 13-year professional basketball career financed his businesses and insisted he runs his five-company empire.
``I'm a hands-on boss,'' he said.
``I go over the numbers every day''.
His businesses include movie theaters, a retail mall, television and children's multimedia production companies, a concert and boxing promotion company, a record label and controlling interest in a Los Angeles bank.
Brenda Johnson, a Columbia City resident, agreed that bringing the Starbucks store to the neighborhood could bring jobs and other benefits.
``I hope it will bring more businesses into Columbia City,'' she said.
Not everyone welcomed the new Starbucks store, however.
Outside, a man passed out leaflets charging Starbucks ``exploits prison labor''.
A Starbucks spokeswoman said she knew nothing about the charges and couldn't respond.
A block south, at the year-old Lottie Motts Espresso Shop, Autumn Eaton paused between making lattes to say she is ``disappointed'' that Starbucks will be a competitor.
Schultz earlier said that Starbucks stores ``enlarge the coffee-drinking community and there is usually enough business for all''.
``It's too early to tell what the effect will be here,'' Eaton said.
A small group of Pasqua Inc.
shareholders is accusing Bankers Trust, Pasqua's former controlling shareholder, of stiffing minority investors when the San Francisco coffee chain was sold to Starbucks earlier this year.
A complaint filed in San Francisco Superior Court accused Bankers Trust of undervaluing Pasqua ``in order to avoid jeopardizing a long-standing business relationship (with) Starbucks''.
A Bankers Trust lawyer denied the allegations.
Starbucks paid $7.1 million for the 56-cafe chain in a deal that became final March 1, according to the complaint.
In the suit, led by Pasqua co-founder Mark Zuckerman, eight shareholders argue that the company's market value was much higher.
The plaintiffs together owned less than 10 percent of Pasqua's stock.
They are accusing Bankers Trust, which owned 45 percent and, they say, effectively controlled the board, of breaching its fiduciary duty by not considering bids from Starbucks' rivals.
The Pasqua shareholders also contend that Bankers Trust failed to disclose a conflict of interest: that an affiliate, BT Alex.
Brown, Starbucks' longtime investment bank, was advising Starbucks on the Pasqua merger and receiving fees for the work.
The accusations are ``silly,'' said Peter Ostroff, a partner with Sidley &AMP; Austin who represents Bankers Trust.
Ostroff noted that the court denied a request by the investor group earlier this year to stop the merger.
But the court allowed the plaintiffs to seek an outside appraisal to ensure that they received fair-market value for their shares.
``They don't have the right to any relief other than an appraisal,'' Ostroff said.
``If it turns out that the appraiser agrees the price isn't fair, they'll get an adjustment''.
The complaint, which originally was filed in June, was amended in a filing Monday.
Joseph Tabacco, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said in a telephone interview yesterday that Pasqua's board did not seriously consider offers from other interested parties.
Specifically, Peet's Coffee &AMP; Tea of Emeryville offered $15 million for Pasqua in February, a month before the Starbucks deal closed.
Pasqua's board should have ``engaged in an auction to obtain the best price, that's certainly an opportunity they had,'' said Tabacco, a partner with Berman, DeValerio, Pease &AMP; Tabacco.
But Ostroff said the Peet's offer was ``too little, too late and much too contingent'' on unknowns to scuttle the Starbucks deal.
A coffee-industry source who conducted an independent valuation of Pasqua two years ago said Starbucks' $7 million price tag ``is not out of line'' with his assessment.
Although Pasqua had 1998 sales of $26.5 million and its Bay Area stores were mostly healthy, its operations in New York and Los Angeles were ``hemorrhaging money,'' this source said.
Zuckerman, who served as Pasqua's chairman and chief executive for many years, said he was the lone Pasqua board member to oppose the Starbucks deal.
Because shareholders never gathered for the vote (which was conducted by mail), it was difficult to fight the Starbucks acquisition before the deal closed, he said in a telephone interview yesterday.
Zuckerman could not explain why investors holding the remaining 35 percent of Pasqua shares, including co-founder Martin Kupferman, did not join in the suit.
Kupferman could not be reached for comment.
Tabacco said 90 percent of such cases end in settlements.
Peet's did not return a telephone call.
A spokesman for Starbucks, which was named in the suit as the successor to Pasqua, declined to comment.

SEATTLE (AP) --Starbucks Corp.
shares tumbled today after the coffee retailer warned that shortfalls in its non-core businesses and the cost of launching a new Internet portal will result in lower than expected earnings for the next two quarters and for the year.
Analysts had estimated the gourmet coffee retailer would earn 60 cents per share for fiscal 1999.
But Starbucks late Wednesday predicted earnings of 54 cents per share, with earnings over the next two quarters coming up 3 cents short of expectations.
In afternoon trading today on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Starbucks shares skidded $11.68 3/4 to $25.87 1/2 --a decline of 31 percent.
Company executives had expected that strong retail sales in Starbucks core coffee business would make up the difference, but that didn't happen, Schultz said.
``We raised our expectations too high,'' he said.
Nevertheless, Schultz said, ``We remain as optimistic as ever for the potential for significant profit growth''.
The Internet will play a role in that growth.
To direct the launch of the new Internet portal, Starbucks will form a new subsidiary named Starbucks X, led by senior vice president Debbi Gillotti, Schultz said.
Schultz said the company plans to create a ``canopy brand'' Web site that will include sales of gourmet food, kitchen products and home furnishings as well as coffee products and music.
He also said the company will announce a major strategic partnership for the Internet site later this summer.
By expanding Starbucks' online sales beyond coffee, Schultz said the company is taking a crack at potential revenues estimated at $100 billion.
According to Starbucks, more than 75 percent of the company's customers use the Internet, and they have an average income of more than $70,000.
``This is a category in which we can win,'' Schultz said.
SAN FRANCISCO _ The on-line delivery service Kozmo.com is teaming up with Starbucks Coffee Co.
for cross marketing and in-store promotions.
Starting this spring, Kozmo customers will be able to leave videos and other delivery items in drop-boxes located in Starbucks where the service operates.
Starbucks, the Seattle-based coffee retailer, will also help hype Kozmo as it enters new markets.
The New York-based Kozmo delivers movies, books, magazines, CDs, video games, and food.
Starting this spring, the service also will deliver Starbucks by the pound.
For Kozmo, it gives the burgeoning company much-needed exposure.
So what does the seemingly ubiquitous coffee roaster get out of it?
How about $150 million over five years.
``This all speaks to what most Internet companies are facing, and that's the high cost of customer acquisition,'' said Howard Schultz, Starbucks' chairman and chief executive.
The Internet-to-door delivery service, which was started in 1997, operates in five markets but plans to expand to 20 by the end of this year.
The company opened in New York in January 1999, followed by Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, and Washington, D.C.
The company plans to launch in Los Angeles in the coming weeks.
Schultz said he has been approached by other companies wanting to establish a partnership with Starbucks.
According to Starbucks, 90 percent of its 10 million weekly customer base use the Internet.
``This is the first time we've ever invited another brand or company to live inside our stores,'' he said.
``It's very clear Kozmo has resonated with their customers''.
Internet watchers, however, have questioned the economics of spending the high cost of delivering primarily small ticket items.
Joseph Park, Kozmo's chief executive, said his business model hinges on ``order density,'' or getting a large number of customers to use the service regularly.
``We're a lifestyle brand and we're looking for other products or service our customers would want to use or purchase on a frequent basis,'' he said.
``Coffee is probably one of the most frequent purchases a customer makes.''
Ask for a skinny decaf grande Espresso Macchiato in Marfa and you might get some strange looks.
Forget about getting a hot cup of Guatamala Antigua in Goldthwaite.
Don't look for that to change anytime soon.
That's because while Starbucks Coffee, maker of the big-named bean juices like those, is adding 500 stores this year, most are planned for big cities.
On Tuesday, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz stood before a happy house of shareholders in Seattle and touted the company's progress in bringing its coffeehouse culture to the rest of the planet.
The company has 2,000 stores worldwide, including 106 stores in Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston.
Not even El Paso has made the cut.
In downtown Austin, where you can hardly hurl a stone without hitting a Starbucks or some other java joint _ in some circles the capital city has rapidly become the cappuccino city _ Starbucks is opening at least one new store this year in mid-March at 24th and Nueces streets just west of the University of Texas campus.
The Seattle-based company has opened nine Austin locations since coming to town four years ago.
When determining where to place a new Starbucks, the company looks at a number of demographic factors, including average age, average income and whether a city's residents have been ordering coffee from the company's catalog.
While Starbucks may never make it to the Panhandle or the small towns of East Texas, its presence still may be felt there.
The company tapped Pepsi-Cola Co.
to sell its Frappuccino blended coffee beverage, which leads the ready-to-drink coffee category, said Schultz.
Starbucks also joined Kraft Foods, Inc.
in a licensing agreement to distribute, market and sell its beans at supermarkets around the nation.
``We have less than 5 percent of the overall coffee market in America,'' said Schultz.
``We are going to have much, much more than a 5 percent share of the coffee market in America, I promise you''.

SEATTLE _ Starbucks Coffee Co.
announced a new a consumer products division for its specialty ice cream, bottled coffee drinks and other products sold away from its own shops.
It also said it will share revenue with CARE from its first month's sale of a new package of coffees from Latin America.
The company's new division will be headed by Paul Davis, 42.
Davis has spent 14 years at PepsiCo's Frito-Lay unit, most recently as head of Hostess Frito-Lay Canada.
He becomes president of consumer products for Starbucks, and will report to Starbucks' president and chief operating officer, Orin Smith.
Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz said the move ``represents our commitment to building a major consumer products business'' around ``an enduring global brand''.
The new division will take over business that already brought in $206 million last year, or almost 16 percent of the company's total sales.
Most of it has been joint ventures: the ice cream with Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream; the bottled Frappuccino with Pepsi-Cola; and the supermarket distribution of Starbucks coffee with Kraft Foods Inc.
The company has just introduced a line of premium chocolates in its stores, but made no announcement about any other channel of distibution.
Schultz noted the company's success in extending the Starbucks brand and said, ``We are in the early stages of this business''.
The company also continues in its commitment as a major donor to CARE, for which it has helped to raise $1.4 million since 1991.
Tomorrow, it will begin offering a new package of of coffees from Guatemala, Costa Rica and Brazil, and will donate $1 per package sold through May 11.
The money will be used to support community organization in the highlands of Guatemala, as part of a ``civil society'' project there; girls' education in Nyeri, Kenya, where it has not been customary to send girls to school; and education in hygiene and farming practices in South Sulawesi, Indonesia.
All are countries that grow coffee for Starbucks.
The new pack is also notable in that it is the first time Starbucks has offered single-origin coffee from Brazil.
Mary Williams, senior vice president for coffee, said she had not been impressed with the overall quality of coffee from Brazil, but that it has been improving.
She said this sample, a heavy-bodied, low-acid variety called Ipanema Bourbon, represents the country's best.
Starbucks also said Monday its revenue was up 27 percent in the five weeks ended March 28 compared with a year earlier, or 6 percent on a same-store basis.
On March 28, the company had 2,192 stores.
It had opened 309 in the previous half-year.
The New York Times Co.
and Starbucks Coffee Co.
said Tuesday that they had agreed to the sale of The New York Times newspapers in Starbucks stores for three years in exchange for The Times' advertising promotion of Starbucks.
Financial terms were not disclosed.
The agreement calls for The Times to be sold at all American Starbucks stores.
Some stores may also offer local newspapers and other national newspapers.
The Times will use its advertising resources to promote the products and retail outlets of Starbucks, which is based in Seattle.
There will also be a link between The New York Times' circulation Web site (www.homedelivery.nytimes.com) and the Starbucks Web site (www.starbucks.com).
SEATTLE - The nation's tea industry has seen its great, shining hope - and thinks it might be Starbucks Coffee Co.
The sweet aroma of opportunity wafted through the tea business Tuesday as it absorbed the stunning news that Seattle's gigantic java retailer plans to purchase the highly respected, quirky tea maker Tazo, of Portland, Ore.
, for an undisclosed amount of cash.
``The significance of this marriage is gigantic for the world of specialty tea,'' said Joe Simerini, president of the Tea Association, a New York-based trade group.
``What it pretty much tells you is Starbucks has made up their mind that they want to be in the world of the specialty tea business, and they want to be in it in a big way''.
Starbucks remained largely mum on its plans this week, saying only that it planned to develop new products under the Tazo name and possibly create a new retail format around the brand.
In the universe of tea brewing, that's practically cause for celebration.
U.S. tea makers have spent most of the 1990s watching themselves get almost totally eclipsed by their highly caffeinated brethren.
While Americans slowly clued in to the joys of herbal infusions and the fine nuances of specialty tea blends, they embraced espresso drinks with an enthusiasm that left the quietly prospering tea market looking like an also-ran.
Tazo was born five years ago in the midst of America's blossoming love affair with lattes.
Founder Steven Smith, formerly of Portland-based Stash Teas, drew on years of experience in the industry to create a line of high-quality, high-priced products that stood out both for their funky marketing (names like Awake and Om) and distinct flavors.
``We initially thought we needed to change the way people perceived tea,'' Smith said in a telephone interview Monday afternoon.
``We bet on the fact that the tea category was not price sensitive.
We thought if we made better products, people would buy them''.
The brand quickly became one of the major players in the specialty tea market, which the Tea Association describes as one that emphasizes the quality and integrity of the ingredients.
Other specialty tea makers, according to the association, include Bigelow, Twinings and the Republic of Tea.
Of an overall annual tea market of $4.5 billion, specialty tea sales accounted for about $500 million last year, Simrany said.
That's double the figures of a decade ago, he said.
Starbucks alone reported $1.1 billion in retail sales for fiscal 1998.
Tea sales made up only 1 percent of that total, chief executive Howard Schultz said.
Tazo's impending sale to Starbucks - the deal is set to close at the end of this month - catapults the niche tea maker into the realms of such household names as Lipton and Celestial Seasonings, said Brian Keating, owner of the Teacup, a retail teahouse and shop on Queen Anne Hill and publisher of ``U.S.
Tea Is `Hot,''' an annual report on the tea industry.
The partnership also gives Starbucks the foothold it has sought for years in the specialty tea market, he said.
``Starbucks has been floundering,'' Keating said, testing out a slew of items from chai tea to the iced blended drink Tiazzi this summer to various takes on its in-house hot tea brand called Infusia, all to mixed results.
Tazo gives the company a proven brand with a built-in cache.
``From a business analysis standpoint, I couldn't think of a better marriage,'' Keating said of the Starbucks-Tazo deal.
``It was like two people you wanted to introduce and never thought about introducing them to each other''.
Wendy Rasmussen, executive director of the Long Beach, Calif.-based American Premium Tea Institute, was a bit more skeptical.
``I look on this purchase and it's absolutely fabulous news for my industry or it's really sad news,'' she said.
``It's not one of those gray things.
``Starbucks is going to take a mover and a shaker in my industry and either really, finally do something with tea - or Tazo's going to become this dusty, back-of-the-shelf product in Starbucks stores, and that's going to be a shame''.
Still, the impetus for Starbucks to take the Tazo purchase seriously must be pretty strong, given recent trends in the specialty coffee business, Rasmussen said.
At last year's Specialty Coffee Association trade show, for instance, Rasmussen noted, at least 50 percent of the vendors devoted half their exhibit space to tea products.
``I think people have reached their limit with coffee in terms of their experience with it,'' she said.
``It's `What's the next thing'?
I don't want to say they're bored.
But they are looking for the next new beverage.''

&LR; &QC; &LR; Unlike its fancy blenders and armchairs, Williams-Sonoma Inc.
apparently is not for sale.
The San Francisco kitchen and housewares merchant, which owns the Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn stores and catalogs, spurned a takeover offer in an emergency board meeting earlier this month, according to sources close to the retailer.
Company Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHoward Lester declined yesterday to discuss the situation, saying, ``Nothing is going on now.
From time to time, people have discussions, but we don't comment on those''.
Williams-Sonoma is considered a ripe takeover target.
It is a well-run company with a bright future on the Web and a relatively low valuation, said industry analysts.
With its stock trading at about $29, the company's current market capitalization is $1.62 billion.
Bonnie Kramer Tonneson, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, values it at closer to $3 billion, or $41 per share.
Surprisingly, several sources named Starbucks Corp.
, the Seattle coffee giant, as the likely suitor.
A Starbucks spokesman declined to comment.
Although Starbucks and Williams-Sonoma seem an odd match at first blush, it makes sense when their Internet strategies are factored in, said analysts and other observers.
Just last week, Starbucks announced a partnership with Oxygen Media to develop a lifestyle-oriented portal and cable television business targeting upscale women.
Williams-Sonoma, which has just begun rolling out a series of cyber gift registries and online stores, would be the perfect e-commerce addition, observers said.
``The Starbucks customer is 55 percent women, well educated, over $75,000 median income, and over 70 percent of them use the Net,'' said Tonneson.
``It's the same people who shop at Williams-Sonoma and the ideal demographic for patronizing cooking and epicureal type stuff on the Web,'' Tonneson said.
In addition, Williams-Sonoma's larger stores would be good locales for small Starbucks coffee bars, observers said.
Williams-Sonoma is a particularly attractive Web partner because of its strong stable of brand names, including Hold Everything and Chambers; its decades of direct-to-consumer experience; and its technological infrastructure, which includes a strong Web operation and a large, sophisticated distribution center.
In addition, Williams-Sonoma's valuable customer database of 20 million names, addresses and buying histories will be an even more powerful tool when the company is able to mesh the list with e-mail addresses, said an industry analyst who declined to be identified by name.
&LR; COL.
1 of WILLIAMS () &QL; &QL; &LR; So a lifestyle portal deal does make sense for Williams-Sonoma _ but the company decided to pursue just such an opportunity with a different set of partners, not Starbucks and Oxygen, last week.
Last Wednesday, just three days after the weekend board meeting at which Williams-Sonoma's directors voted to remain independent, the retailer announced that it is talking to CondeNet, an affiliate of Conde Nast magazines, about joining a CondeNet-Time Warner cable and Web business targeting high-income women.
Williams-Sonoma has already arranged to start selling kitchen wares over CondeNet's Epicurious.com site.
So it looks like Williams-Sonoma will go it alone for now, although there is nothing to stop future bids.
``Something's going to happen there,'' said one industry executive.
``Eventually, somebody's going to have too much money to leave them alone''.

SEATTLE (AP) --Starbucks Corp.
warned Wednesday that annual profits would be lower than expected due to shortfalls in its non-core businesses and the cost of launching a new Internet portal.
Analysts had estimated the gourmet coffee retailer would earn 60 cents per share for fiscal 1999.
But Starbucks late Wednesday predicted earnings of 54 cents per share, with earnings over the next two quarters coming up 3 cents short of expectations.
The announcement was made after the markets closed.
Starbucks' shares fell $10, or nearly 27 percent, in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after closing the regular session at $37.56 1/4.
Kevin Calabrese, editor and analyst at Argus Research predicted the stock would rebound gradually Thursday.
``I'm certain it won't hold there in the morning,'' Calabrese said.
But he cautioned, ``I don't think it's going to climb up to where it closed today for a while''.
Despite a strong core retail business, some of Starbucks' other businesses haven't grown as expected, CEO Howard Schultz said in a conference call.
He named the company's specialty food business and its North American partnership with Pepsi.
Schultz also cited $4 million in unbudgeted costs for developing the company's Internet strategy.
Company executives had expected that strong retail sales in Starbucks core coffee business would make up the difference, but that didn't happen, Schultz said.
``We raised our expectations too high,'' he said.
While the company's North American retail profit margin is up 1 percent in fiscal 1999 compared with fiscal 1998, Schultz said profits fell below internal estimates.
In retail sales alone, Schultz said, revenue was expected to be $16 million less than initial internal projections.
Nevertheless, Schultz said, ``We remain as optimistic as ever for the potential for significant profit growth''.
The Internet will play a role in that growth.
To direct the launch of the new Internet portal, Starbucks will form a new subsidiary named Starbucks X, led by senior vice president Debbi Gillotti, Schultz said.
Schultz said the company plans to create a ``canopy brand'' Web site that will include sales of gourmet food, kitchen products and home furnishings as well as coffee products and music.
He also said the company will announce a major strategic partnership for the Internet site later this summer.
By expanding Starbucks' online sales beyond coffee, Schultz said the company is taking a crack at potential revenues estimated at $100 billion.
According to Starbucks, more than 75 percent of the company's customers use the Internet, and they have an average income of more than $70,000.
``This is a category in which we can win,'' Schultz said.
SAN FRANCISCO _ The Starbucks Coffee Co.
plan to acquire Pasqua Coffee is leaving a bitter aftertaste in the mouths of some patrons of the San Francisco-based coffeehouse.
Starbucks, the nation's largest coffee retailer, announced Tuesday that it would buy Pasqua for an undisclosed amount.
Pasqua has 56 outlets in the Los Angles, New York and San Francisco areas.
``I don't like it,'' said Tom Bennett, a construction worker who was sipping a cup of joe at a Pasqua outlet in San Francisco.
``I like the way it is and that's why I come in here''.
Van Sias, a supervisor with the Department of Public Health, said he has been a Pasqua customer for five to six years.
``It's terrible, terrible,'' he said.
Starbucks coffeehouses ``are already all over the place.
``We're gonna have no more choices soon,'' said Berkeley resident Claire Greensfelder, 46, who said she avoids Starbucks at all costs in favor of mom-and-pop cafes.
``I don't care for Starbucks, and I won't go there,'' Greensfelder said.
``It's destruction of individual choice, and it takes the fun out of it if every coffee shop is the same''.
With the purchase of Pasqua, Starbucks will inherit a small chain that had $26 million in revenue last year, adding to an empire that had sales of $1.3 billion by comparison.
The transition should be complete by February.
Starbucks, with more than 1,700 stores in North America, wants to add 400 more in the United States and Canada within the year.
In April, the chain paid about $81 million in stock for the Seattle Coffee Co.
in Britain.
``With the addition of the Pasqua locations, we're even more confident that we'll meet our goal in continental North America,'' said Alan Gulick, a Starbucks spokesman.
Stephanie Sheffield, who works at Pasqua shop in San Francisco, said she learned about the sale from her sister, who works for Starbucks.
``I hope that they leave us alone because Pasqua is more customer-oriented than Starbucks seems to be,'' she said.
In July, the San Francisco-based Spinelli Coffee Co.
was purchased by Tully's Coffee Corp.
, another Seattle company.
Pasqua, which Starbucks plans to convert to the Starbucks banner, operates 48 stores in the San Francisco area, Los Angeles and New York, and has eight licensed airport locations in California.
In addition, the company has a coffee roastery in San Francisco, three commissaries and two bakeries.
Pasqua co-founder Martin Kupferman acknowledged it had gotten more difficult to compete with Starbucks.
``It's Starbucks, and nobody else is going to touch them,'' said Kupferman, who added that he was satisfied with terms of the sale.
&QL; Coffee giant Starbucks Corp.
has purchased Hear Music, an upscale music retailer that until recently was based in San Francisco, for under $10 million.
Starbucks has sold jazz CDs in its coffee shops for several years and considers music an important part of how customers experience its brand, said Bonnie Kramer Tonneson, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
``This is a minor acquisition (for Starbucks), but it is a first step toward fortifying the whole in-store and online experience,'' said Tonneson.
The deal closed in mid-October and Hear's staff has already moved to Starbucks' offices in Seattle, said Don MacKinnon, Hear's former chief executive, in a telephone interview yesterday.
MacKinnon's new title is vice president, music and entertainment, for Starbucks.
Hear Music stores are unusual in that they focus on educating shoppers about music and introducing them to new artists.
Listening stations are arranged thematically; shoppers are allowed to unwrap and listen to any CD in the store.
&UR; &LR; MacKinnon told The Chronicle in September that he intended to roll out 75 to 100 Hear Music stores across the country.
But yesterday, he said plans for new non-Starbucks locations are on hold, although the five existing locations _ in Berkeley, San Francisco, Palo Alto, Santa Monica and Chicago _ will remain open.
Partnering with Starbucks was Hear's best option for going national, MacKinnon said.
It's the best place to find Hear's upscale customer ``in the right mood, in great numbers and at a time when they sort of taking a pause in their day''.
Starbucks did not release terms of the deal other than to say that it spent less than $10 million.
In a conference call with analysts Thursday, Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz disclosed plans to install listening stations in some Starbucks cafes, according to Andrew Barish, an analyst with Robertson Stephens.
The kiosks will likely connect to a Hear Music Intranet that contains music reviews and recommendations.
The Intranet is currently &LR; used in a new Hear prototype store in San Francisco's Metreon shopping center.
MacKinnon said no decision has been made about how many stores will include kiosks.
``There will be different solutions in different stores,'' he said.
Yesterday, 800 of Starbucks' 2,500 stores installed fixtures holding branded Starbucks CDs, plus other selections chosen by the Hear team, such as the popular Buena Vista Social Club.
In the future, MacKinnon and his staff will produce all of Starbucks' CDs.
Music accounts for less than 1 percent of total Starbucks sales, Tonneson said.
Starbucks has installed a link from its home page, www.starbucks.com, to Hear Music's site, www.hearmusic.com.
Starbucks is also promoting links with two other new Web partners, Cooking.com and Geerlings &AMP; Wade, a mail-order wine retailer.
This summer, Starbucks announced an ambitious strategy of creating a ``lifestyle portal'' of upscale brands on the Web.
It formed partnerships with several Web content providers and attempted to buy Williams-Sonoma Inc.
, which spurned the offer.
But investors frowned on that strategy, sending Starbucks' stock plummeting.
Since then, Starbucks has scaled back those plans.
``Instead of an all-consuming focus for Howard Schultz it's more of a sidebar,'' Tonneson said.
Hear Music, which was privately held, generated revenues of between $5 million and $10 million in 1998.
It was founded by MacKinnon and two partners in Cambridge, Mass.
, in 1990.
Hear was sold in 1992 to CML Group, which undertook an unsuccessful rollout.
MacKinnon and a partner bought it back from CML for $371,000 in 1996.
In addition to its five U.S. stores and the Starbucks deal, Hear licenses its name and format to Chapters, a Canadian superstore chain, which runs 12 in-store music shops under the Hear name.

PARIS (AP) _ France's unemployment rate dropped slightly to 11.5 percent in November, but nearly 3 million people remain without a job, the Labor Ministry said Friday.
The number of unemployed fell to 2,940,800 in November down 4,700 from October, the Labor Ministry said.
The jobless rate in October had been 11.6 percent.
Young people less than 25 years old were the main winners, although jobless over 50 also managed to find work, the ministry said.
Unemployment is one of France's worst economic problems, with joblessness among young people a major problem that has contributed to a rise in crime and violence. (parf-dgs)
PARIS (AP) _ Groups of jobless occupied unemployment offices in southern France and in one Parisian suburb Tuesday, keeping pressure on the government to give them a year-end bonus of 3,000 francs (dlrs 535).
The jobless protest, which started in the southern port of Marseille, has spread to Aix-en-Provence and Martigues, where activists occupied a total of eight unemployment offices Tuesday morning.
In addition, about 15 jobless were protesting in an unemployment office in the Parisian suburb of Villejuif.
Meanwhile, police in Marseille evacuated two unemployment offices Tuesday morning, moving about 300 protesters into the streets.
Officials in the southern Bouches-du-Rhone region said Tuesday they would decide ``before Christmas'' on a way to obtain financial aid for the jobless.
They were to hold a meeting later Tuesday.
The movement is similar to one that took place in France last December, with unemployed workers demanding a bonus in order to be able to celebrate the Christmas and New Year holidays.
Last year's protests prompted Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's government to come up with a fund worth one billion francs (dlrs 178 million) to help the needy.
Jobless activists say 15 billion francs is needed to help the jobless this year.
Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent, reflecting a slow but steady improvement in France's high jobless rate, long one of the nation's knottiest problems. (parf-sp)
PARIS, January 3 (Xinhua) --The French government Saturday announced several emergency measures to support the jobless people, including sending an additional 500 million franc (84 million U.S. dollars) unemployment aid package.
Minister of Employment and Solidarity Martine Aubry said at a press conference that the government will present a law on helping unemployed people before Summer this year, in which a series of measures will be taken in the fields of housing, health care and school.
She also promised to continue holding talks with unions and anti-unemployment associations on the terms to be adopted by the government in favor of jobless people.
Meanwhile, the government ordered the local governments in prefectures to solve case by case the job problems of people living in distress, and asked them to maintain "emergency cells" responsible for tackling unemployment.
France's unemployment rate now stands at 12.4 percent, which means that 3,114,600 people among France's working age population are without jobs.
Moreover, 36.89 percent of these people have been seeking jobs for more than one year.
Unemployed people staged a series of protests from Christmas through New Year festival by occupying the offices of government agencies in charge of unemployment insurance.
Since these emergency cells were set up by the end of December, 2,000 cases of jobless people in distress have been reviewed and 700 of them have been given "positive responses" on finding a job, said the government.
The government said that the number of jobs offered increased by 20 percent from November 1996 to November 1997, while the number of lay-offs decreased by 17 percent.
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) --Resulting from different employment policies, U.S. unemployment has dropped by almost half in the past 15 years while most of major Western nations have shown a strong rise with little sign of improvement.
The New York Times said today that the long-term trends emerge from detailed figures that the U.S.
Labor Department has just published.
The figures showed that the U.S. joblessness peaked at 9.7 percent in 1982, the first full year of President Reagan's administration.
It declined steadily for the next seven years, then rose again to 7.5 percent in 1992 when President Clinton was elected.
Then it dropped again, hovering in recent months around the 5.6 percent level it reached last year.
It stood at 5.4 percent in July.
But Japan, which kept its unemployment rate as low as below 2 percent in 1960s and early 1970s, breaking that barrier only in 1976.
A slow, steady rise over two decades pushed it over 3.5 percent this year.
France and especially West Germany also had a history of keeping unemployment low in the 1960s and early 1970s.
But in 1975, West German unemployment more than doubled to 3.4 percent.
And joblessness in France also rose sharply to 4.2 percent from 2.9 percent.
Since then West Germany's rise has continued, reaching 6.5 percent last year with the percentage in the former East Germany not being included.
French unemployment reached 11.5 percent last year and Italy's 12 percent, more than twice the U.S. rate.
Figures for Japan, Germany, France and Italy have continued to edge up in 1996.
Britain is the only major European country whose joblessness peaked at 11.8 percent in 1983 and dropped to 8.3 percent in 1995.
"There's a different focus of the government, especially in France, Germany and Italy," said Mark Anderson, director of international trade for the AFL-CIO.
He explained that "they focus more on a fairer distribution of income and not throwing someone on the street to work for whatever wage he or she can get".
European governments worry a lot about unemployment, but have failed to reverse the upward trend, the newspaper said.
On Thursday a new French law went into effect that encourages businesses to cut working hours and hire more workers.
But the paper said that many economists doubt if it will work.
BONN, June 18 (Xinhua) --German Finance Minister Theo Waigel admitted today that Germany may slightly overshoot the debt requirement for joining the planned single European currency -- the Euro, but stressed that other criteria would be strictly adhered to.
Back from a two-day European Union summit in Amsterdam, Waigel told reporters in Munich that due to the massive debt burden left over from the former East Germany, Bonn could run up a national debt slightly above the Euro benckmark of 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
As for another key Euro criterion which requires member states to bring their budget deficits to less than three percent of GDP, Waigel reiterated that three was three, and it should not be softened.
Waigel also warned against any delay in the planned 1999 launching of the Euro, saying that a delay would encourage EU countries to ease up on budgetary restraint and would almost certainly lead to a surge in the German mark's value that would threaten Germany's economic recovery, and its chances of reducing unemployment.
The Euro is due to be introduced from January 1, 1999.
Countries will be selected to take part in early 1998 based on full economic data of 1997.
But there remains widespread doubts about the future of the Euro because both Germany and France, the two country at the heart of the project, are struggling to meet the qualification criteria, mainly due to their sluggish economic growth and the cost for financing benefits for record high unemployment.
France has openly asked for a softening in the interpretation of the qualification terms of the Euro but Germany has so far insisted on strict adherence.
PARIS, December 30 (Xinhua) --The unemployment rate in France dropped by 0.3 percent to stand at 12.4 percent in November, said the Ministry of Employment Tuesday.
This means that France had 3,114,600 jobless people in November, 9,000 fewer than in October, according to the official way of accounting unemployment.
This is also the first time for the unemployment rate in France to be below 12.5 percent since September 1996.
The unemployment rate dropped by 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent in Septebmer and October.
The drop of unemployment rates among young men and young women below 25 had contributed to the overall improvement of job situation in the country, said the ministry.
The jobless rate among young men dropped by 2.2 percent, that that of young women by 1.7 percent in November.
But people who remained jobless for more than one year increased by 1.2 percent in November, taking up 36.8 percent of the overall number of the unemployed in France.
PARIS, January 12 (Xinhua) --French President Jacques Chirac said Monday that the government should be ``particularly careful'' about the problem of social exclusion, which results from long time unemployment.
The social cohesion of France is now being threatened by unemployment, exclusion and violence in urban suburbs, the president said in response to escalating protests by the unemployed during a meeting with the press.
The protesters have vowed to continue their fight despite aid packages offered by the Socialist government to help jobless persons in desperate situations.
Chirac said the law against exclusion, which will be presented by the government to the National Assembly in March, will ``attack the roots of the evil in all fields,'' including unemployment.
He also suggested the government turn the money subsidized for social aid programs into investment for jobs.
France is running a near-record 12.4 percent jobless rate with a jobless population of 3.1 million, one-third of which has been unemployed for more than a year.
LYON, France, June 27 (Xinhua) --Several hundred people took part in the demonstration here today against the policies of the world's most developed nations.
The protest took place when leaders of the group of seven (G-7) industrialized nations gathered in this southeastern French city for a three-day summit meeting.
The peaceful demonstration, organized by a group of 53 non-governmental organizations, consisted of a series of speeches at Lyon's city labor exchange.
"The G-7 presents itself as the pilot of the general ship of world affairs, thus it places itself in a situation of power and responsibility," said Nigerian Nobel Literature Prize laureate Wole Soyinka, who chaired the event.
"However," Soyinka noted, the group's collective course "militates against the well-being of the majority of peoples".
This, he added, is "leading to mass unemployment, a widening gap between the North and the South and even more profoundly between the affluent and the poor in every society".
"We appeal to the members of the G-7 to take stock of their power and its failures, to be aware of the consequences of the policies that they set in motion," he said.
The demonstration was one of three staged to coincide with the G-7 summit, which drew here leaders from France, the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, Italy and Japan.
PARIS, December 31 (Xinhua) --French President Jacques Chirac gave this evening his New Year good wish message to the French people, in which he stressed the need to fight crimes and unemployment in France.
In his first public address to the nation since he began to co-habit with the leftwing parliament majority in June, Chirac also appealed to the French people for a rally in preparation for the 21st century.
"Twenty-four months only separate us from the year 2000.
Time is speeding, changes multiplying, mentalities evolving, and frontiers becoming blurred.
We live in a time of uncertainty and difficulty, but also rich of promises and possibilities," he said.
He said that there exists too much violence in schools, streets and in public transport, which has become one top worry of the French people together with unemployment.
"Each day, the limits are broken beyond which the society will break up.
It is today, I know, with unemployment, your primary worry," he said.
He stressed that the government would play its role in cracking down crimes and punish those who break the law, which he said is the primary guarantee of freedom.
He appealed to all French citizens to take up their responsibilities to protect the republic values of France and be attached to the principle of tolerance.
In a clear reference to the extreme-right National Front, Chirac called on the French people to reject all the ideas which endanger the unity of the nation.
"Our country is never and will never be the addition of communities existing one by the side of another.
The public balance sheet is never and will never be of particular interests," he said.
Chirac also called on the French people to better contribute to the construction of the European Union by becoming more flexible in their way of thinking and more creative.
"There should be a French ambition: free the force and the energy of our people, create the conditions of richness and activity so that all Frenchmen can profit from it by creating more jobs," he said.
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) - France has raised its unemployment benefits by 2.45 percent as of July 1, announced Denis Gautier-Sauvagnac, president of the unemployment insurance regime of UNEDIC.
This brought the minimum unemployment benefit with a system of degressivity to 142.24 francs (27.3 U.S. dollars) a day.
Meanwhile, the UNEDIC raised the amount of the "floor" of unemployment benefit, below which the degressivity system can no longer apply, by 4 percent to 92.21 francs (17.7 U.S. dollars) a day.
The UNEDIC raised unemployment benefit last in July 1995.
PARIS, July 31 (Xinhua) --The number of jobless in France rose by 22,800 in June, which registered a 0.7 percent increase over the previous month and a 4.6 percent rise over the same period last year.
According to statistics published today by the French Ministry of Labor, the total number of jobless in France now stands at 3,065,600, or 12.5 percent of the working age population of the country.
Le Monde said in a report for its Thursday edition that the rise of unemployment in June was partly attributed to the season, when a large number of youths graduating from school in summer entered the job market.
Another reason is that the economic climate in France remains bad, with a near-zero growth or even below-zero growth in the April-May-June period of 1996, said the local daily.
Agence France Presse said that the rise of unemployment in June has given ground for speculation of an even darker employment situation, with "rigidity in budget policy and decline in social plans risking to push down a revival".
"For the year, the forecasts of specialists are not in the least encouraging.
The National Institution of Statistics and Economics Study expects a 12.3-12.5 percent unemployment rate, while the French Observatory of Economic Circumstances expects an unemployed population of 140,000 by the end of the year and 120,000 in the following year," said AFP.
Meanwhile, Minister of Labor, Employment and Social Affairs Jacques Barrot said today that the government will subsidize 15-20 billion francs (3-4 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997 to finance employment programs.
The opposition Socialist Party said the rise of unemployment underlines the failure of government policy.
"Far from taking the seriousness of the employment situation into its conscience, the government is taking measures which will accentuate the tendency towards the rising of unemployment," said Socialist Party spokesman Francois Hollande.
He listed as examples of government errors reduction of allocations for the new school year, lay-offs in public sectors and reduction of social plans in the defense industry.
The Group of Applied Macro-Economic Analysis (GAMA) said today that the French economy will have a growth of 1.4-1.5 percent in the whole year of 1996.
Although the economic growth dropped by 0.3 percent in the April-May-June period, it will grow by 0.9 percent and 1 percent in the next two quarters of the year, said GAMA.
PARIS (AP) _ Thousands of jobless demonstrated across France on Monday to press the Socialist-led government for a bigger increase in unemployment benefits and a Christmas bonus.
Protests were staged in some 60 cities throughout the country against a 3 percent rise in unemployment benefits announced by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin last week, which jobless associations say is too small.
In Paris, about 400 people occupied the headquarters of French insurance firm AXA to protest against poverty and homelessness in general, unfurling a banner reading ``War on Poverty''.
Claire Villiers, of Act Together against Unemployment (AC!), said the protesters had singled out ``a very big financial company, as poverty grows in our country and the government is leaning toward measures to reduce taxes for the rich''.
In the southwestern city of Toulouse, jobless and homeless groups called for ``a day of action against poverty'', staging protests at the Matabiau rail station and the local government representative's office to demand emergency housing and benefits and free transport for the poor and unemployed.
More demonstrations were planned in Toulouse later in the day.
In the Mediterranean port city of Marseille, some 200 people showed up at the doors of the regional council building demanding that local officials hear them out.
Although France's unemployment rate has edged down to around 11.6 percent in recent months, jobless associations have been seeking to rekindle a protest movement which last year led to the occupation of dozens of unemployment offices across the country. (ly-dgs)
PARIS (AP) _ Transit workers were on strike in several cities on Monday to protest youth attacks that have plagued public transportation across France, officials said.
The latest walkouts affected transit lines in Paris, Marseille, Lille and Chambery, officials said.
The Paris A line of the Regional Express, serving suburbs to the west and east including Disneyland, was severely reduced after a train driver was injured in the financial district of La Defense on Sunday.
A passenger angry that he took the wrong train threw a fire extinguisher through the train's windshield, causing the driver to be hospitalized.
On Monday, A trains were running every 30-45 minutes instead of every 5-10 minutes, officials said.
Only one in five commuter trains were in service around the southern port of Marseille on the second day of a walkout, officials said.
The strike began after a ticket agent was attacked on a line between Avignon and Lyon.
Other attacks sparked a strike over the weekend among Marseille bus drivers, who began returning to work Monday.
But employee representatives said they would halt service after each attack in France's second-largest city.
Similar transit strikes continued for a sixth day in the northern city of Lille _ France's fourth-largest metropolis _ and for a 10th day in the Alpine city of Chambery.
Transit workers have demanded that the government put more police on buses, subway cars and commuter trains to halt the violence.
The attacks are part of a rising crime rate among youths from working class suburbs that have been hard-hit by a double-digit unemployment rate.
While the national figure is 11.8 percent, the rate can top 50 percent in some neighborhoods. (cb-parf)
PARIS, January 28 (Xinhua) --France's unemployment rate dropped by 1.6 percent in December last year, reducing the nation's jobless people to 2,583,600, said the Ministry of Employment Friday.
The unemployment rate of France stood at 10.6 percent at the end of December, the lowest in seven years.
A continuous drop of unemployment rate in France has been observed since July 1997, when the Socialist government led by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin came into power.
Moreover, the number of jobless people dropped by 11.4 percent, or 333,600 people, from December 1998 to December 1999.
The young people under 25 benefited most from the improvement of job market, as the number of jobless among them dropped by 15.9 percent over the past one year.
The number of jobless people aged from 25 to 49 dropped by 11.1 percent, and that of those above 50 dropped by 7.3 percent in the past year.
PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua) --The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) today called on France to adopt more flexible socio-economic policies in its on-going structural reforms.
In its 1997 Economic Survey report on France published today, the OECD, which groups 29 industrialized nations, gave credit to the French government over economic growth and cutting public deficits.
It said that France's economic growth rate could attain 2.5 percent in 1997, and 2.6 percent in 1998, while its public deficit could drop to 3.2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of 1997.
This means that the aim by the French government to attain the Maastricht deficit limit for joining the European single currency, the euro, is within reach, said the report.
The OECD said that the real problem France is faced with is not only "cyclical" but also "structural".
France is greatly lagging behind other OECD countries in flexibility and de-regulation, especially in budgetary policy and the role played by the state in the country's economy, said the report.
It said that as France's public spending is one of the highest among OECD countries in terms of its GDP, it is inevitable for the country to vigorously continue the process of the reform of public spendings.
The OECD called on France to pay attention to the reform of its public sector management, pointing out that many other OECD countries have more flexible public sector management.
It also called on France to pursue the reform of public spending "beyond Maastricht".
"In view of demographic changes, which would suggest that spending pressures are likely to build up after the year 2000, further public spending cuts will probably prove necessary," said the report.
The OECD said that the high unemployment rate of France, which stands around 12.5 percent, reflects the "substantial structural impediments in the functioning of labor markets" of the country.
But it predicted that France's unemployment should fall over the medium term due to reduction in cyclical unemployment, while the measures taken in recent years, in particular the reduction of the cost of unskilled labor, should reduce structural unemployment.
PARIS, September 6 (Xinhua) --The fight against poverty and social exclusion is considered by Frenchmen and Frenchwomen as the second most important issue of the country after unemployment, said a poll published by the newspaper "Le Croix" today.
The poll was conducted by the SOFRES polling group on August 28-30 on 1,000 people who are above 18 and from different social groups.
Fifty-one percent of people aged between 18 and 24 say that they think about poverty and exclusion from time to time, while 34 percent of people above 66 say that they never think about poverty.
Only 9 percent of the members of working class say they never think about poverty and exclusion.
Fifty-two percent of the polled say they personally know someone who is living in poverty or is in the danger of falling into poverty.
Six years ago, 49 percent of Frenchmen said they knew personally someone who was living in poverty.
Sixty-two percent of people say that to have five million poor people in France is something unacceptable, while 20 percent say that they feel "disarmed and powerless" in front of the problem of poverty.
Ninety-four percent of the Communist Party members polled say the state has not done enough for the poor, while most of the members of rightist groups and Catholic communities say the opposite.
Seventy-three percent people say that unemployment of long duration is the principal cause of poverty, followed by the lack of development of job market, and lack of solidarity among people as other causes of poverty.
PARIS, February 3 (Xinhua) --Some 12,000 people have committed suicide each year in France since 1993, said the official National Institute of Demographical Studies (INED) today.
With a suicide rate close to 20 for 100,000 residents in the country, France is ranged the fourth among the Western countries with the highest rates of suicides, after Finland, Denmark, and Austria, said the INED.
The major causes for suicides in France are economic crisis, unemployment, isolation as well as a decrease of the number of religious services and practices, said the INED.
In 1994, 12,500 people committed suicide in France as compared with 8,300 in 1975 and an average of 6,000 in the 1950s, said the report.
The report also said that the age groups that are most vulnerable to suicide are those of younger people, as the number of suicides increased by 3.5 times among the people from 25 to 34 years old and by three times among those from 20 to 24 years old between 1950 and 1995.
The number of deaths resulting from suicides in France has now surpassed that of traffic accidents, also one of the highest among Western countries, said the report.
The INED report was published on the National Day Against Suicide, which was first held last year.
BRUSSELS, November 6 (Xinhua) --Two weeks prior to the European Union (EU) job summit, ministers in the European Council still seem far from agreeing on how to iron out their differences.
The EU ministers spent a long Wednesday airing their sometimes poles-apart views while discussing the guidelines for member states employment policies in 1998.
Wednesday's discussions concluded without an expected press conference, and the discussion continued today for what looked likely to be another prolonged working day for the ministers.
Today's meeting was said to be held with consensus that the problem of unemployment has to be solved through entrepreneurship, employability, adaptability and equal opportunity.
The ministers agreed that they have to move toward concrete and quantifiable commitments for the guidelines which will be delivered to the job summit.
The summit later this month will be in Luxembourg.
At stake will be how much each member state has to pay to create a combined total of 25 million more jobs, if the union is to solve the biting issue of unemployment which now runs at an average high of 10.6 percent.
Unemployment is as high as 19.2 percent in Spain, 12.6 percent in both Finland and France and 10.7 percent in Ireland.
Though the journal of European Report said that unemployment in Germany was at 9.6 percent, the country itself announced its fifth post-war record high of 11.7 percent last month.
The EU is already paying 200 billion ECU (229 billion U.S. dollars) each year in unemployment allowances.
One EU spokesperson said the union was not calling for extra expenditure on unemployment allowances.
It was calling for priorities to be offered in youth employment and long-term employment.
European Commissioner Padraig Flynn, in charge of employment and social affairs, said earlier this week that the shared task of the ministers was to ensure that the EU did not remain the zone of high unemployment as it had been for much of the past decade.
The EU is dedicating the present week as employment week, and discussions and meetings are focused on the issue.
But observers here were left with the impression that before the job summit, the questions of how much to pay in unemployment allowances and in creating more jobs might still remain "a hard nut to crack."
PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua)--The OECD report said that the labor costs for low-skilled workers in France are too high, and recommended that wage flexibility should be raised, including reforming the country's minimum wage system, the SMIC.
It suggests that the role of minimum wage "as a distributive instrument" be reassessed with the objective of increasing employment opportunities, and that the minimum wage be differentiated by age and region.
While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system of France, the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of France's social protection system, in particular the high cost of unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates.
"Despite the 1993 reform of the unemployment insurance system, replacement rates (unemployment compensation rates) have remained relatively high for low income earners," it said.
It suggested that the problems of unemployment and poverty in France be solved through "making the country's benefit system less generous".
The OECD also called on France to reduce restrictions on mass lay-offs by enterprises, and raise restrictions on the renewal of job contracts for an undetermined period of time, and increase the flexibility of work schedules.
It said that the costs of mass layoffs and the time they take to implement are "substantial" in France, and that some collective agreements on employment contain "stringent obligations which can severely hamper the pace of restructuring".
It also regretted that while French enterprises can lay off workers out of economic difficulties, they cannot legally do this simply for obtaining economic benefits.
The report said that since 1992, the supply of part-time jobs has risen substantially in France, where part-time employment was underdeveloped by comparison with other OECD countries in the past.
It pointed out that working hour flexibility for full-time workers is "not as yet very developed" in France, even though the relevant legislation has been relaxed.
"Since 1994, agreements providing for greater flexibility compensated by an overall reduction in working hours have been allowed, but little progress in striking such agreements has actually been made," it said.
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) --British Prime Minister Tony Blair is to tell his European Union (EU) partners that he would stand in the way of attempts to introduce higher social costs in Britain, according to British government sources.
At the special EU summit to be held in the Dutch city Noordwijk on Friday, Blair will say that although the new British government is planning to sign up to the Social Chapter, it is also determined to insist that the 15-nation bloc move to flexible labor markets, government officials said.
Blair, whose Labor party won a landslide victory on the May 1 general election, is expected to press the case for Europe to move towards the policies that have encouraged overseas firms to choose Britain as a base for investment.
The 43-year-old new British Prime Minister will tell the other EU leaders that there is a third way between the Tory-style non-intervention and the kind of over-regulation that is blamed for imposing extra costs and higher unemployment on France and Germany.
He is also expected to make it clear at the summit that he will not allow the Social Chapter to become a means of backdoor imposition on Britain of European legislation on social security and worker involvement on company boards.
An authoritative government official was quoted as saying today: "We don't want to lose control of our social security costs.
We would veto such extra costs being imposed here."
PARIS, January 14 (Xinhua) --Associations for the unemployed in France announced Wednesday that they will hold another nationwide protest on Saturday.
Thousands of protesters demonstrated in Paris and other cities on Tuesday.
Four associations of anti-unemployment militants blamed the government for failing to present new proposals to tackle the 12.4 percent unemployment rate in France, and condemned France's employers for being arrogant toward the unemployed.
"The movement should continue.
Facing the arrogance of the employers, the silence of the UNEDIC (Union Nationale pour l'Emploi Dans L'Industrie et le Commerce), and absence of new proposals from the government, a dynamic should absolutely continue to find its place," said a communique issued by the associations.
The associations also criticized the Socialist government for refusing to revise its 1998 budget to raise the minimum unemployment aid the RMI, and to grant aid to unemployed under the age of 25.
PARIS, August 31 (Xinhua) --The number of jobless people dropped by 1.9 percent, or 52,600, in July as compared with June, the Ministry of Employment announced on Tuesday.
The unemployment rate in France now stands at 11.2 percent, with 2,770,400 people in the labor force in search for a job.
At the end of June, the country's unemployment rate is 11.3 percent.
Minister of Employment Martine Aubry said that the there is an acceleration in the rhythm of decline in unemployment rate in France and the labor market of the country is now very active.
Since the Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin came to power in June 1997, about 353,000 jobs have been created, she said.
The French government predicted that the growth rate of the gross domestic product in the country will attain from 2.2 to 2.5 percent this year.
PARIS (AP) _ Unemployment fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent, the Labor Ministry said Friday.
The figure reflects a slow but steady improvement in France's high jobless rate, long one of the nation's knottiest problems.
The improved figures were largely due to a gain in jobs by men aged 25 to 49, according to the Labor Ministry.
The October data was better than expectations.
Economists had seen October's unemployment level steady from September.
According to the Labor Ministry and to the national unemployment agency ANPE, the number of job seekers fell by 9,000, or 0.3 percent to 2.945 million people.
Job seekers aged 25 to 49 were the greatest gainers, with their number falling by 5,400, or 0.6 percent.
The number of women job seekers aged 25 to 49 declined by 4,500, or 0.4 percent.
However, the number of female job seekers under 25 rose 2,300, or 0.9 percent.
Among older job seekers, men aged 50 and over saw a slight improvement in their situation, with a 0.1 percent drop in unemployment.
But the number of women aged 50 rose by 900, or 0.5 percent, in October, compared to a month earlier.
High unemployment has for years been France's main economic hurdle, and remains so despite steady improvements since Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin took office in June 1997. (eg-dj)
PARIS (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin went on the offensive Tuesday, calling for an increase in social allowances to end jobless protests and accusing President Jacques Chirac of borrowing his ideas.
The Socialist prime minister in recent weeks has wrestled with labor unrest, jobless demonstrations and discord within his government, just as the conservative Chirac has seen his popularity ratings soar.
In a radio and television interview, Jospin said his government has decided to raise two welfare allowances by 3 percent Jan.
1 to ease the plight of France's unemployed.
The increases will be retroactive to Jan.
1, 1998.
Jospin was responding to recent protests across the country by thousands of jobless demanding a 3,000 franc (dlrs 526) year-end bonus.
Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent, reflecting a slight improvement in the country's high jobless rate.
Jospin said that Chirac, who has raised his profile in recent weeks, has ``borrowed a lot'' from his government, particularly regarding reform of the justice system, term limits and equal representation of women in politics.
Jospin also said that although his government is still targeting a 2.7 percent growth rate for France's gross domestic product in 1999, this goal will be hard to reach because of uncertainties on the world global market.
In 1998, he said, France will post 3 percent growth, ``maybe even 3.1 percent''.
Recent opinion polls have shown Chirac gaining in popularity and even beating Jospin in a presidential election with 53 percent of the vote.
Chirac, the leader of the moderate-right Rally for the Republic party, was forced to share power with Jospin, a Socialist, when he lost his majority in legislative elections in 1997. (parf-sp-cb)
PARIS, December 25 (Xinhua) --The 12.5 percent unemployment rate is haunting the Christmas season in France as militants and unionists staged several protests over the past week against unemployment.
French Minister of Employment and Solidarity Martine Aubry Thursday urged the prefectural governments to take care of the unemployed people "in distress" and solve some "emergency cases".
French unions, including the Confederation Generale du Travaile, joined the protests for the first time on Wednesday organized by unemployed workers in Paris, demanding a Christmas bonus of 3,000 to 5,000 francs (500 to 840 U.S. dollars) for each unemployed worker.
The official unemployment insurance agency UNEDIC had to close its door in Paris Wednesday because of protest activities.
Similar protests were staged on the same day in Havre in northern France and in Marseille, and police forced some 40 unemployed people out of an occupied mayoral office building of a district in Marseille.
The workers of a Mercedes d'Etoile automobile plant in Valence in southeast France staged a strike on that day to support their manager, who was said to have been fired by the superiors for keeping the workers on the job.
Moreover, as big shops reported better Christmas shoppings this year than the last, the question is also centered on social disparity in France.
The daily Liberte de l'Est said that one can cite a long list of social conflicts from unemployment to homelessness at this Christmas season.
The daily Le Berry Republicain said that Christmas now remains only as a "reserve of remote impressions of fairy-tales," and the daily L'Humanite said that the seemingly rising prosperity as is shown remains to be proved yet.
While preparing a law on social solidarity to be presented in February, the government is studying a proposal by the Communist Party to subsidize a 1,500 francs (260 U.S. dollars) social aid for each unemployed workers who are more than 55 years old.
BEN GURION AIRPORT, TEL AVIV, October 25 (Xinhua) --Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the interim deal he struck with the Palestinians was unlike the Oslo Accords, which he said were not good agreements.
Speaking at a news conference here after returning from 11-day stay in the U.S. for negotiations, Netanyahu said his deal did provide security guarantee for Israel while being required to relinquish lands to the Palestinians.
The Oslo Accords, signed by his predecessor, late Yitzhak Rabin, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat prepared the ground for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process on the principle of "land-for-peace".
Netanyahu said the newly-concluded agreement established for the first time a concrete mechanism for the Palestinians to fulfill their security commitment before Israel hands over part of the West Bank to them.
He said this was the best he could have been achieved under the current circumstance.
He described as "tremendous difficult" the nine days of bargaining with the Palestinians under U.S. mediation at the Wye Plantation near Washington.
The talks began on October 15 and resulted in the new interim agreement signed at the White House last Friday by Netanyahu, Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
JERUSALEM, July 11 (Xinhua) --Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin expressed optimism here Tuesday that the three-way Camp David summit could achieve positive results and agreement could be reached.
"I am optimistic that agreement could be reached at this Camp David summit because both (Israeli) Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat realize that the price of failure at the summit talks would be high," Beilin told foreign reporters at a press conference organized by the Foreign Press Association.
Barak, Arafat and United States President Bill Clinton gathered at Camp David near Washington Tuesday for the crucial summit, which will try to reach a framework agreement on the key issues of Jerusalem, borders, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements and water.
"Without an agreement it will be bad,....but I think the high expectations and hopes create a situation whereby it is almost impossible to return home without an agreement," he said.
Beilin was one of the architects who helped forge the 1993 Oslo accords between Israel and Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization that provided outlines and principles for the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Each side has much to pay if there is a failure at the summit, he said, adding that the agreement could not be reached without compromises from both sides .
JERUSALEM, February 13 (Xinhua) --In a counter-warning to the Palestinians, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday it would bring disaster on themselves if they resort to violence.
Netanyahu issued the warning here when he spoke to a visiting delegation of Jewish community in the United States.
He was commenting on the warning given by Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat that the Palestinian people would renew intifada (uprising) against Israel if the peace process collapses.
Speaking Thursday at the ceremony held in Ramallah to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1948 Israeli-Arab war, Arafat renewed his pledge that he would declare Palestinian independence in May 1999 at the end of the Oslo process, even in the absence of a final peace agreement with Israel.
He stressed that he would struggle to establish an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
In his speech, Netanyahu launched a scathing attack on the PNA for violating the Oslo peace accords.
He condemned the PNA for failing to prevent pro-Iraqi demonstrations, refusing to revise the Covenant and glorifying terrorists.
He also warned that Israel will scuttle the Oslo accords if Arafat declares independence.
The latest round of war of words came at a time when the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is deeply deadlocked over Israel's prolonged delay in carrying out further troop redeployment in the West Bank.
Under the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed last January, Israel should have finished the first two stages of the three-phased redeployment by September last year.
But Israel has delayed the move due to a dispute over the scope of redeployment.
Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators concluded their talks in Washington Friday, without achieving any breakthrough in breaking the deadlock in the peace process.
The two sides only agreed to continue to talks next week in the region under the supervision of U.S.
Ambassador to Israel Edward Walker.
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) --Israeli senior cabinet ministers today failed to reach agreement on a plan for the Israeli army's redeployment from the disputed West Bank town of Hebron, Israel Radio reported.
The senior cabinet ministers will meet again in a later date after the failure to reach any conclusions today due to the sharp disagreement between the ministers.
The new plan was presented by Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai with a proposal to change the Oslo accords with regard to the extent of Palestinians' control in Hebron.
Under the plan, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) would only gain the civilian control over the area, and the overriding security control would remain in Israel's hands.
Under the Oslo accords, the Israeli army is to pull back from about 80 percent of Hebron, leaving all Arab neighborhoods of the town under the full control of the PNA, designated Zone A.
However, under the new proposal, Hebron would no longer be designated Zone A, but part of Zone B, an area of shared control, with the Israeli army permitted to move freely as it deems necessary for security reasons.
During today's cabinet meeting, Transport Minister Yitzhak Levy of the National Religious Party demanded that the Jewish community in Hebron be strengthened.
Meanwhile, Palestinian officials, having already accepted a delay in the implementation of the Hebron redeployment, repeatedly said that they would not renegotiate any signed agreement.
Early this month, Palestinian Council Speaker Ahmed Queria stressed that the Palestinians would not open new negotiations on the Hebron issue, saying the Israeli troops should pull out in accordance with the Oslo accords.
Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natsheh also said that the Palestinians would not agree to Israeli troop patrols in the Arab neighborhood as part of an Israeli redeployment in the city.
Under the Oslo 2 accord, the Israeli army was supposed to pullback from of Hebron by March 28.
However, following a series of suicide bombing attacks, the redeployment was delayed.
Then the redeployment was postponed again due to the May 29 Israeli general elections for security reasons.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said he has been studying the issue of the redeployment in Hebron, but giving no date when he would make the final decision.
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) --After an overnight secret meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu expressed optimism about reaching a Hebron deal.
Speaking to businessmen in Tel Aviv today, Netanyahu said that some progress had been achieved at his meeting with Arafat which was held at the Eretz checkpoint between Israel and Gaza Strip.
"We have made progress, but we still have not reached agreement on all the issues.
We will make sure that we will stand firm on the principles of security and reciprocity," he said.
Netanyahu said he was optimistic about reaching peace and security, adding that such negotiation required "patience".
Today's surprise meeting lasted for over three hours and ended at seven O'clock this morning in the presence of U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath told Israel Radio.
He said that positive results were achieved in the summit, but there was still one major issue remaining unsettled --the timetable for further Israeli troop redeployment in rural areas of the West Bank.
Arafat convened a meeting this afternoon of his senior advisers and some members of the Palestinian negotiating team to update his meeting with Netanyahu.
Noticeably, Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny also took part in the meeting to learn about the latest developments in the Hebron talks.
Egypt has been under fire recently from Israel, which alleged that Cairo was using its influence to encourage the Palestinian side to delay the Hebron deal so to extort more concessions.
Israeli and Palestinian sources all agreed that, with today's summit, the difficult Hebron talks that have been lingering on for three months seemed to have taken a positive turn.
The summit was the result of Ross' intensive mediation efforts as the U.S. is increasing pressure on both sides to wrap up the Hebron deal.
Under the Oslo peace accords, Israel troops should complete the pullback from the rural areas of the West Bank by September 1997 after the Hebron redeployment by last March.
Israel has delayed the Hebron pullback since the wave of Islamic suicide bombing attacks from late February to early March last year.
The Hebron deal has virtually been completed, but due to lack of trust between the two sides, the Palestinian Authority links the signing of the deal with Israel's commitment to further pullback.
It wants the U.S. to guarantee in a written form of Israel's commitment to the Oslo accords before it signs the Hebron agreement.
Meanwhile, Ross is continuing his mediation efforts today to bridge the remaining gap.
He held a meeting with Arafat this morning, and is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu late today.
GAZA, June 20 (Xinhua) --The Palestinians have accepted a two- week postponement in the implementation of a promised further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, Voice of Palestine radio reported Tuesday.
Palestinian Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei (also known as Abu Ala), head of the Palestinian team to the so-called back-channel talks with Israel, told the radio that the Palestinians have agreed to the delay in the Israeli pull-out, initially scheduled to be carried out by June 23.
Palestinian chief negotiator on interim affairs, Saeb Erekat, told the radio that the United States had echoed the Israeli request for such a delay.
The scheduled Israeli withdrawal was a main issue in Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's talks with U.S.
President Bill Clinton last week in Washington, Erekat said.
Erekat noted that what the Palestinians want is an assurance from the U.S. that the Israeli third withdrawal from the West Bank, outlined in the Oslo accords signed by the two sides in 1993, would be carried out.
Israel had threatened that if the Palestinian side rejects its demand for the postponement and insists on the withdrawal being carried out on time, it will stick to a previous government decision that the third withdrawal will cover only 1 percent of the West Bank territories.
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should transfer all remaining West Bank territories to Palestinian control during the third redeployment.
Israel so far has handed over full or partial control of about 40 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
It is still unclear how many of the West Bank territories would be included in the third withdrawal, despite press reports that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is ready to hand over 90 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in a final peace agreement.
DAMASCUS, September 27 (Xinhua) --The Damascus-based Arab Parliamentary Union (APU) today denounced Israel's policy of settlement, describing it as a serious challenge to the foundations and principles of the Mideast peace process.
This came in a statement issued by the Arab Parliamentary Union in the Syrian capital today.
Israel has announced that it plans to make new settlements in Jerusalem and Bethlehem and to construct 300 more residential units for Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
The plans are continuation of Israeli Prime Minister's Benjamin Netanyahu's policy of Judaizing the Holy City of Jerusalem and altering its Arab-Islamic identity, said the statement.
Israel is trying to encircle the Arab cities with a belt of the Jewish settlements, the statement added.
Announcing these plans, Israel defies all the U.N. resolutions, the Madrid conference principles, the Oslo accords and the will of the international community.
The APU called on parliamentarians of all over the world to urge their governments to exert all types of pressure on Israel to abandon this peace-destroying policy.
The APU pointed out that it is an international responsibility to save the Mideast peace process by compelling Israel to abandon its policy of settlement and to declare its commitment to the principles of the peace process, particularly the land-for-peace principle.
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) --Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has turned down an invitation to attend a meeting in Norway next week to mark the fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords.
Israel Radio reported Wednesday that Norwegian foreign minister on Tuesday personally requested that Netanyahu attend the meeting, but Netanyahu said he was too busy to go to Norway.
David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Netanyahu, also said the prime minister had to deal with "more important things" in Israel at the present time.
Besides, Netanyahu said he did not intend to travel to the birth place of the Oslo Accords since he had no part in the historic peace agreements.
But he reportedly would send his diplomatic advisor Uzi Arad to take part in the commemoration.
The question was in fact cropping up earlier this month when the Norwegian government invited Netanyahu to attend the celebrations.
An aide to the prime minister said then that Netanyahu "thought it would not look good if he attended, when the Oslo work is not completed here".
Both Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres are planning to attend and scheduled to speak at the meeting to be held in Oslo next Monday.
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross would also participate, Israel Radio said.
Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
Since their signing in September in 1993, Netanyahu has regularly attacked the Oslo Accords but has grudgingly reiterated commitment to carry them forward.
Israel is still at loggerheads with the Palestinians over its withdrawal from the West Bank, although the two sides should have moved forward to final-status talks two years ago according to the Oslo Accords.
JERUSALEM, April 28 (Xinhua) --Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to declare an independent Palestinian State on May 4 this year.
Talking to reporters before meeting with foreign diplomats here on Wednesday afternoon, Netanyahu said the peace process could be moved forward if Arafat refrains from doing so.
Otherwise, he pointed out, the 1993 Oslo accords could collapse and he would not further implement the Oslo accords if he wins in the May 17 elections.
Arafat has stated many times in the past that he has the right to declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 this year, when the five-year transitional period under Oslo expires.
The Palestine Liberation Organization Central Council is discussing in Gaza whether to declare statehood on May 4.
Netanyahu opposes unilateral Palestinian statehood declaration, threatening to annex parts of the West Bank now under Israeli control.
The peace process could only be moved forward through negotiations, he said, adding that no unilateral actions could help.
Meanwhile, he said that Israel could not accept the resolution adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Commission Tuesday in Geneva, which calls for Palestinian self-determination on the basis of the U.N. partition resolution 181 adopted in 1947.
The commission's resolution also calls for the right of Palestinian refugees to return home.
GAZA CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) --Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Central Council started its discussions here Tuesday on the issue of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat presided over the meeting, which was held at the Presidential Office and attended by over 100 council members.
The council has 124 members.
As invited, a delegation of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) headed by its spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin attended the meeting as observers.
Representatives from other Palestinian political factions also took part in the meeting.
The council meeting's main topic is whether Arafat would announce the formation of an independent Palestinian state in the teritories on May 4 this year, when the five-year Palestinian self-rule transitional period expires under the 1993 Oslo Accords.
As the meeting is in progress, hundreds of Palestinians from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, are demonstrating in front of the office, urging the council and Arafat not to postpone the declaration of statehood on May 4.
Arafat has stated many times in the past that under the Oslo principles, he has the right to declare an independent Palestinian state on that date.
For this purpose, he traveled recently to many countries to seek their support and advise over this matter.
But Israel opposes this idea, threatening to annex parts of the West Bank territories now under its control.
The United States, seeking to persuade the Palestinians not to declare a state, urged on Monday again Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) not to take unilateral actions but set themselves a new target of agreeing on a permanent settlement within in a year.
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday officially sent a letter to Arafat, in which he once again asked Arafat to cancel the announcement of a state on May 4 and stressed the U.S. would help move the peace process forward after Israel's May 17 elections.
Backing up Clinton's call, the White House issued a statement the same day, promising to facilitate that process, to bring Israeli and Palestinian leaders together within six month after Israeli elections to review the status of their efforts and to help reach an agreement.
It is not clear how long the council meeting would take, but the whole world, particularly the United States and Israel, are anxiously to see what decision the council would make on the statehood issue.
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) --In a stern warning to Israel, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat said Thursday that Palestinians are ready to renew the intifada (uprising) if the peace process collapses.
In a speech at the ceremony held in Ramallah, West Bank, to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1948 Israeli-Arab war, Arafat renewed his pledge that he would declare Palestinian independence in May 1999 at the end of the Oslo process, even in the absence of a final peace agreement with Israel.
The Palestinian leader said "the Palestinian people do not remember the painful experience to cry, but to renew our commitment to our national goal - the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital".
He said that those who oppose the Palestinian move to achieve independence "can drink from the Gaza Sea or Dead Sea".
Afrafat stressed that he was ready to die in order to put East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since 1967, in the Palestinian hands.
The PNA is hoping to establish an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital, a move opposed by Israel which has declared the whole Jerusalem as its eternal capital.
Summarizing the suffering of the Palestinians in the past, Arafat paid tributes to the bravery of his people who have carried on the longest revolution of this century.
He added that the Palestinians will continue to stay on their land and nothing, even nuclear, biological and other weapons, will force them to leave.
Arafat's warning came at a time when the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is deeply deadlocked over Israel's prolonged delay in carrying out further troop redeployment in the West Bank.
Under the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed in January, 1997, Israel should have finished the first two stages of the three-phased redeployment by September last year.
But Israel has delayed the move due to the dispute over the scope of redeployment.
In order to break the stalemate, the United States is currently hosting Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in Washington to bridge the gap.
But no breakthrough has been achieved so far, as the Palestinian side has turned down a U.S. proposal on a 13 percent withdrawal in the second redeployment, which is to be implemented in two phases according to the PNA's fulfillment of its obligations.
Thursday's ceremony kicked off a series of events in the coming year to mark the so-called "Catastrophe" --the forced mass exudos of Palestinians in 1948.
Over 3 million Palestinians have been forced to exile since Israel won the 1948 independence war and occupied a large part of the Palestinian territories.
Among the activities is a proposed international conference of all countries which have suffered similar disaster to discuss the Palestinian catastrophe.
A committee in charge of the commemorative activities will also establish a museum to document modern Palestinian history, the Jerusalem-based Palestinian news service Jerusalem Media and Communication Center reported.
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) --President of Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat today Condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies on peace process and sanctions against the Palestinians.
In an interview with the Egyptian TV program "Beit Al Arab" broadcast today, Arafat said Netanyahu does not want peace or respect the signed agreements, adding that Netanyahu has admitted that he ignores the Oslo accords.
His criticism came two days after the Israeli government has decided to build more homes in Efrat settlement in Jerusalem.
Netanyahu announced Wednesday night that his government will continue to bolster the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and plans to build 300 homes in the Efrat settlement.
Arafat slammed Israel's economic sanctions against the Palestinian self-rule areas, which has caused many Palestinians vulnerable to starvation.
He said that the Palestinians lose 9 to 10 million U.S. dollars every day due to the closure imposed by Israel after two multiple suicide bombings hit Jerusalem on July 30 and September 4.
On the outcome of the United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to the PNA-ruled areas, Arafat said that Albright has reaffirmed the principles based on the United Nations Security Council resolutions, the land for peace formula, and the peace accords signed between the PNA and Israel.
He said the U.S. stance is positive, yet it needs practical steps to confront the Israeli intransigence.
Following Israeli decision to expand the Efrat settlement, Albright criticized it as inconsistent to the kind of climate for negotiations that she wanted to create.
JERUSALEM, January 15 (Xinhua) --A senior Palestinian National Authority (PNA) official Thursday urged Israel to implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement in a bid to move the Mideast peace process forward.
Addressing a press conference here, PNA Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath said that Israel should implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed with the PNA instead of making its own decisions which are against the provisions of these agreements.
Sha'ath made the remark while commenting on an Israeli document concerning PNA's obligations and decisions relating to Israel's security in the West Bank.
On Tuesday, the Israeli cabinet passed a 12-page document accusing the PNA of violating its obligations.
And on Wednesday, the cabinet decided to keep all the areas in the West Bank it termed as vital to Israel's security and national interests in a permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians.
These areas include two security strips on each side of the West Bank, water resources, Jewish settlements, strategic roads and Jewish historical sites.
Sha'ath said the Hebron agreement signed early last year stipulate that Israel carry out a three-stage troop redeployment in the West Bank by mid-1998, adding the Israeli cabinet's decisions on security issues in the West bank meant that it does not want to redeploy its troops in the West Bank but rather permanently occupy the Palestinian lands.
Referring to the final-status talks as initiated by Israel, he said how the PNA could enter into such talks with the Israeli government which refused to redeploy its troops in the West Bank and commit to its obligations as specified by the signed accords.
The permanent solution of the Middle East problem is the establishment of an independent state of Palestine, safe borders between Israel and Palestine, safe cooperation in all fields between the Palestinians and the Israelis, Jerusalem should be the safe capital of the two peoples, Sha'ath said.
He urged the U.S. and other countries to put pressure on Israel to implement all agreements it signed with the PNA.
CAIRO, June 28 (Xinhua) --Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa reaffirmed Sunday that Egypt opposes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin's proposal for holding a Madrid II international conference on the Mideast peace process.
"There is nothing called `Madrid II'," Moussa was quoted by the Middle East News Agency as saying.
He was commenting on the idea put forward by Netanyahu for convening a multilateral conference to tackle all regional issues but not the Israeli-Palestinian peace deadlock specifically.
In an interview published Saturday on the Spanish newspaper ABC, Netanyahu said he believed that peace talks held along the lines of the 1991 Madrid peace conference would be "useful" to solve the regional problems, such as water distribution and environment protection.
But he did not want the conference to tackle specifically the Israeli-Palestinian peace stalemate, arguing that negotiations on bilateral levels are being held with the U.S. participation.
Egypt interpreted the Netanyahu proposal as an attempt to annul the land-for-peace principle set by the Madrid conference and the Oslo accords that Israel signed with the Palestinians.
The Madrid conference, which brought Israelis and Arabs to face-to-face talks for the first time, formulated the the landmark land-for-peace principle and the framework for bilateral and multilateral talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
Moussa reiterated that there is no need at present to hold a Madrid II conference since the 1991 Madrid conference has already laid the main bases for the peace process on all tracks.
The top Egyptian diplomat noted that there is now an Egyptian-French initiative on holding an international conference to deal with the crisis created by the present Israeli policy.
He explained that the proposed conference is "not to renegotiate the principles of Madrid conference," rather to call on the parties to implement these principles.
During his visit to France in May, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his French counterpart Jacques Chirac jointly proposed the holding of an international conference to discuss the current peace deadlock.
Meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar in Cairo Saturday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flatly rejected Netanyahu's Madrid II idea, warning that this could blast the whole peace process.
GAZA CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) --Palestinian leader Yaser Arafat said here Tuesday that he favored to declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 this year.
Addressing the meeting of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Central Council, Arafat said the outcome and fate of the Palestinian people's struggle have asked the Palestinian leadership to declare an independent Palestinian state in the territories on time.
In his speech, Arafat briefed the council members about the current development in the Middle East peace process, the situation in the region and his discussions about the statehood issue with leaders of foreign countries he recently visited.
Anyway, he said, the issue of the statehood declaration should be decided by the council.
Shortly after Arafat's address to the meeting, a report on whether to declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 this year was submitted to the council for consideration, a senior Palestinian official said.
Meanwhile, U.S.
President Bill Clinton's letter to Arafat was also made public to the council, the official added.
The PLO Central Council started discussing here Tuesday over the issue of the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
As invited, a delegation of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) headed by its spiritual leader Sheik Ahmed Yassin attended the meeting as observers.
Representatives from other Palestinian political factions also took part in the meeting.
The council meeting's main topic is whether Arafat would announce the formation of an independent Palestinian state in the teritories on May 4 this year, when the five-year Palestinian self-rule transitional period expires under the 1993 Oslo Accords.
As the meeting is in progress, hundreds of Palestinians from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, are demonstrating in front of the Office, urging the council and Arafat not to postpone the declaration on May 4.
Arafat has stated many times in the past that under the Oslo principles, he has the right to declare an independent Palestinian state on that date.
For this purpose, he traveled recently to many countries in the world to seek their support and advise over this matter.
But Israel opposes this idea, threatening to annex parts of the West Bank territories now under its control.
The United States, seeking to persuade the Palestinians not to declare a state, urged on Monday again Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) not to take unilateral actions but set themselves a new target of agreeing on a permanent settlement within in a year.
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday officially sent a letter to Arafat, in which he once again asked Arafat to cancel the announcement of a state on May 4 and stressed the U.S. would help move the peace process forward after Israel's May 17 elections.
Backing up Clinton's call, the White House issued a statement the same day, promising to facilitate that process, to bring Israeli and Palestinian leaders together within six month after Israeli elections to review the status of their efforts and to help reach an agreement.
It is not clear how long the council meeting would take, but the whole world, particularly the United States and Israel, are anxiously to see what decision the council would make on this statehood issue.
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) --At least three Palestinian students were injured in clashes with Israeli soldiers Tuesday at Bitonia checkpoint near the West Bank city of Ramallah, Palestinian security police said.
The clashes erupted when the Palestinian students threw stones at the Israeli soliders, who responded with fired rubber-coated bullets, the police said.
The students held a demonstration on the occation of May 4, the date on which the five-year Palestinian interim self-rule period, stipulated in the Oslo accords, expires, to demand an early end of Israeli occupation of the Palestinian land and the declaration of an independent Palestinian state in the territories.
According to the Oslo accords, a permanent peace agreement should be signed between the Palestinians and Israel by the date.
And the Palestinians believe they have the right to declare an independent state on the day.
However, a permanent peace accord remains out of reach by Tuesday and Palestinian leadership has delayed decision over statehood declaration until after the May 17 Israeli elections to avoid squandering international good-will.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had visited dozens of states to rally support for his statehood proclamation, but many states urged him to hold off the unilateral move on May 4 to avert being exploited by hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the coming elections.
A senior Palestinian police officer told Xinhua that everything could happen in the territories today or tomorrow because the Palestinians do not have their independent state in the territories on the historic date.
"We are ordered to maintain order in the territories since Monday night and we are prepared for any eventualities," the officer said, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Fatah movement also organized a large-scale demonstration in the West Bank town of Hebron Tuesday morning, urging the palestinian leadership to declare an independent state.
Thousands of Palestinian demonstrators marched from the Hebron University to the "border line" between H1 and H2, but no clashes are reported so far.
About 500 Jewish settlers, whose settlements are located in H1 area, live among 130,000 Palestinians, whose living areas are called H2.
Meanwhile, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is scheduled to hold a demonstration Tuesday afternoon in Ramallah to demand the Palestinian leadership let the Palestinian people exercise their sovereignty on the Palestinian land and get rid of the Oslo accords.
The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, another Palestinian political faction, is to organize a demonstration Tuesday afternoon in Gaza to voice its support for the declaration of the statehood.
Jerusalem, September 13 (Xinhua) --When the historic Oslo Accords were signed in Washington today five years ago, the Palestinians were promised land and the Israelis peace.
Five years later, the rosy picture remains a dream.
Under the Oslo, most of the West Bank should have been handed over to the Palestinians two years ago.
Today, however, the Palestinians are still struggling to get a small portion of the land.
On the part of Israel, it is still dissatisfied with what the Palestinians have done on fighting terrorism, declaring that more Israelis have been killed in terror attacks in the five years since Oslo than in the 15 preceding years.
The fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords has been marked by clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli soldiers, the Israeli closure of the West Bank and Gaza, and massive peace demonstrations in Israel.
Israel and the Palestinians had been expected to sign an agreement over the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in Washington Sunday, but nothing happened.
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is still shuttling between the two sides to bridge their gaps over the second stage of Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and the prospect of an agreement remains unclear.
The Oslo peace process went quite smoothly in its first two years.
Following a series of deadly suicide bombings sponsored by Hamas against Israel in early 1996 and the current Likud government came to power in the middle of that year, the peace process began to falter.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had repeatedly attacked the Oslo Accords for being incomplete and failing to address Israeli security concerns, has replaced the "land for peace" principle by "peace with security" since he took office in 1996.
In line with this policy, Israel began to build Jewish settlements, abolishing the former Labor government's policy of freezing their establishment, and delayed the redeployment in the West Bank.
Israel also tightened the control over Jerusalem, on which both Israel and the Palestinians claim sovereignty, by intensifying settlement activity and demolishing Palestinian houses.
In June this year, it approved a controversial plan to expand the city far beyond its current borders, annexing some areas in the West Bank.
All these measures, together with sporadic Hamas terror attacks, have derailed the Oslo process and led to the current stalemate in the peace talks.
Oslo Accords have designed a confidence-building mechanism by leaving most of the toughest issues to final status talks, but the depth of recrimination between the two sides has shaken the foundation of the peace treaty.
Political observers said that the Oslo Accords are in a coma, if not dead, and the lack of mutual confidence is the root.
Five years of peace process, no matter how tortuous it goes, have changed the attitudes of Israeli and Palestinian people.
Analysts said that more and more Israelis are accepting the reality of a future Palestinian state and most Palestinians believe there is no alternative to Oslo Accords.
Since the deadline of Oslo Accords is approaching, analysts noted that the two sides have to rebuild their mutual trust as soon as possible and carry out all signed agreements seriously and swiftly.
That's the only path to peace the Oslo Accords envisioned five years ago, they said.
EILAT (ISRAEL), April 30 (Xinhua) --Israeli and Palestinian negotiators opened another round of final-status talks in Israel's southern Red Sea resort city of Eilat on Sunday, in an effort to reach a framework agreement on final-status issues.
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran and his Palestinian counterpart Yasser Abed Abbo headed their respective negotiating teams to the talks, the third intensive one with the involvement of the United States.
The U.S. special Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is scheduled to join next Tuesday the current talks, which will last till May 12.
The two sides have already held two rounds of intensive talks since March 21 with the involvement of the United States at Bolling Air Base near Washington, the United States, but no substantial progress was made.
Under the Sharm El Sheikh peace deal signed last September in Egypt, the two sides have to reach a framework agreement on final- status by February 15 and a final-status peace accord by September 13, 2000.
But due to slow progress in the talks, Israel has suggested the two sides reach the framework agreement in May this year.
The final-status issues that the two sides have to tackle include the status of Jerusalem, the borders of the Palestinian entity, the fate of Palestinian refugees, the future of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and water.
Moreover, the two sides also have to decide on the last Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank under the Oslo accords signed in 1993.
So far, Israel has already handed over about 43 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
Israel has to transfer the remaining West Bank territories except some military zones and Jewish settlements to the Palestinians under the Oslo accords.
Edward Said, America's foremost Palestinian patriot and polemicist, sets forth Monday night on a journey ``In Search of Palestine''.
He carries a heavy load of memories of a homeland that was taken by force, leaving many of its people in refugee camps or under Israeli occupation.
Wherever he goes, Said finds fellow Palestinians being abused by Israeli settlers and authorities.
Their history, as he tells it, began with ``the catastrophe'' of 1948, when hundreds of Arabs were killed and thousands of others lost their homes and property to the conquering Jews.
In this hourlong BBC production, the prolific writer and scholar sets aside his intellectual credentials and makes little attempt at evenhanded reporting as he concentrates on his family's loss and on what he sees as the continuing afflictions of the Palestinians.
Everywhere, the camera finds symbols of Israeli power: the guns and bulldozers used to repress peaceable Arabs.
Missing from his account is any acknowledgment that there may be an Israeli side to the area's tumultuous history.
Despite expressions of sympathy from friendly Israelis, Said finds mainly oppression by Jews and indifference by most of the world to what he condemns as prevailing injustice: the years of expulsion, uprooting and destruction, with no alleviation in sight.
Arabs, he says, have been demonized, while the ``barbaric, inhuman'' actions of the Israelis go uncriticized.
Said holds out little prospect that the Oslo accords will do anything to improve the Palestinians' plight.
As he sees the situation, the new Palestinian authority is cooperating in holding down the indigenous population; the land of his childhood is gone forever.
The viewer need not accept Said's sad and bitter polemic as the whole story, affected as it is by his passion over the world his people have lost.
Production notes: IN SEARCH OF PALESTINE 10 p.m.
ET Monday on PBS
GAZA CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) --Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has warned that the failure of the signed Palestinian-Israeli peace accords will lead the region to violence.
Arafat made the remarks in an exclusive interview with Xinhua on the eve of his visit to China.
He will start his three-day visit to China on Monday.
He said the Palestinians are seeking peace --but with several options all open in resisting the abhorred Israeli occupation.
"We have the longest revolution and the longest intifada (uprising) in the modern history.
The collapse of the (signed peace) accords...
will return the region to the circle of violence," he said.
"The basic rule to push forward the peace process," he said, "only requires the honest implementation of the accords and adherence to land-for-peace principle, in line with international legitimate resolutions, especially Security Council resolution 242 and 338".
Arafat blamed Israel for the 16-month-old stalemate in the peace process, saying the Israeli side had in reality relinquished the peace accords ever since the Israeli incumbent government came to power two years ago.
Israel has failed to keep their promises made in signed agreements on issues like redeployment in the West Bank, Jewish settlements, and issues of transition period, Arafat said.
"These measures constitute grave and flagrant violation of international legitimate resolutions, including Resolution 242 ...
They also violate the Oslo accords which very distinctly call for refraining from any measures that touch any issues of the final negotiating phase with the issue of Jerusalem in the forefront," he noted.
He also criticized Israel for its "unjust blockade" of Palestinian areas, including the prevention of the entry of goods and obstruction of the free movement of the Palestinian people.
"We are regularly losing more than 10 million (U.S).
dollars each day by the economic blockade, that is to say, many times as much as the donor countries are offering if measured on annual basis," he said, adding that unemployment rate in the Palestinian areas exceeds 65 percent.
The Israeli policy is causing much frustration to the Palestinians and leading to misery and grave danger, Arafat said, noting that "the situation is approaching starvation, and I ring the bells of danger.
In as much as peace is in the interest of all, the explosion will hit everyone."
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) --The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat emphasized Sunday in Gaza that Jerusalem is part of the occupied land, according to the Jerusalem-based Palestinian press service JMCC.
Upon his arrival from Cairo, Arafat said that even under the Oslo Accords, Jerusalem is part of the occupied land, and Israel should commit itself to all obligations of peace and respect the signed agreements.
He was commenting on Israel's activities marking the 31st unification of Jerusalem which are going on on Sunday here.
Israel captured the whole Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war.
Arafat also urged the United States to announce its peace initiative concerning Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank in order to put more pressure on the Israeli government to live up to its contractual obligations.
He said that during his meeting in Cairo with Egyptian Presdient Hosni Mubarak, they discussed the Egyptian-French initiative for convening an international conference for countries aiming at breaking the deadlocked Middle East peace process.
The Cairo meeting was positive and constructive, he said.
Meanwhile, a large number of extremist Jewish demonstrators are gathering near the Kattanin Gate that leads to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem, as part of their 31st celebrations of Jerusalem unification.
The Jewish demonstrators burned a model of Oslo Accords and tried to enter into the Mosque.
Meanwhile, Palestinian officials and civilians, including the PNA's Jerusalem governor, are gathering inside the premises of the Mosque to try to prevent the Jewish demonstrators from entering into the holy site.
The Israeli Peace Bloc also demonstrated in East Jerusalem on Sunday to voice their support for the the peace process.
There is so far no report of conflict between Israelis demonstrators and Palestinians.
For the first time in Israel's history, its upcoming election is about who will control the Interior Ministry, not the Foreign Ministry.
It's about what kind of Israel, not what size of Israel.
Although he didn't set out to do this, no one is more responsible for this shift than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
By reluctantly embracing the Oslo peace accords and grudgingly advancing them through the Hebron and Wye agreements, he broke down the historic wall between Labor and Likud voters when it came to the peace process.
It is no longer just Labor that is ready to deal with Yasser Arafat, and Likud that shuns him as a terrorist.
It is no longer Labor that is ready to accept some kind of Palestinian state while Likud rejects it.
Thanks to Netanyahu, there is now a loosely unified core of 75 percent of Israelis ready to proceed with the Oslo accords toward a Palestinian state of some size or other.
With that sort of consensus in the middle, who cares who controls the Foreign Ministry?
Unfortunately, though, Netanyahu did not knock down the wall between Labor and Likud on the peace issue by synthesizing the two sides.
He actually knocked that wall down by backing into it, while all the time telling his hard-core religious-nationalist supporters that he was not abandoning their cause.
It may have been that the only way to bring the majority of Likud voters into Oslo, without triggering a civil war, was by Netanyahu winking, nodding, lying, blaming everything on Labor, the Ashkenazi elites and ``the leftists,'' and constantly bashing Arafat, whether he was living up to his commitments or not.
Plenty of Likudniks wanted to be lied to as they accepted the inevitability of Oslo _ and he accommodated them by embracing Oslo while constantly denouncing those who delivered it.
Therein lies the greatest irony about Bibi Netanyahu: He brought a whole new segment of Israel into the peace process _ but he stayed out of it himself.
That is, he never wanted to take ownership of it, and he still doesn't.
Bibi struck important deals that legitimized Arafat as a peace partner, but he still runs against him in this election.
In 1996, Bibi won because a majority of Israelis were overwhelmed by Oslo, the Rabin assassination and the blowing up of Israeli buses.
But thanks, in part, to his own real success at winning better Palestinian security compliance, a majority of Israelis now accept Oslo.
In other words, thanks to Bibi's having routinized the peace process, many Israelis want to get on with it, finish it and look to the future.
But instead of leading that parade, Netanyahu is shying away from his own accomplishment and running instead on the past.
He repeatedly runs TV ads showing the Israeli buses that were blown up in Jerusalem.
Because he refuses to embrace his own peace process, he is incapable of painting any positive vision of the future.
His campaign advertising is virtually devoid of any hope, and when you can't give hope, when you cannot educate, when you cannot articulate people's aspirations, when you cannot unify, you cannot lead.
I just received two e-mails from friends in Israel that sounded identical themes, although neither knows the other.
One was from a religiously observant friend who lives in the village of Zichron Yaacov, Victor Friedman (no relation).
Victor wrote: ``Even people who hate the left, and can't imagine voting for Ehud Barak, are tired of the kind of political and social atmosphere created since Bibi came to power.
The lying, trickery, corruption, divisiveness, incitement _ people don't like it''.
The other was from a Jerusalem-based writer, Laura Blumenfeld, who wrote that Israel today is suffering from ``Multiple Israel Disorder _ Bibi thought he could hold onto power by dividing everyone into squabbling tribes.
He was wrong.
The shot that killed Rabin was like the starting gun on the race between factions.
But after three years of bumping and biting each other's necks, people are tired''.
By breaking down the divide between Labor and Likud on peace, Bibi created the opportunity for national unity in Israel as never before.
But by doing it in such a divisive fashion, he has also created a longing for national unity as never before _ a longing that he seems unwilling and unable to satisfy.
On Monday we will find out if Bibi can survive Bibism.
JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) --Egypt today gave Israel three weeks to implement its peace agreements with Palestinians, otherwise it will cancel a Middle East and North Africa economic summit due to be held in Cairo in November.
The ultimatum was issued by Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny at a press conference today.
Bassiouny said that Egypt demanded Israel to take immediate actions in implementing the signed agreements with the Palestinians.
The actions included redeploying Israeli troops from Hebron, conducting further redeployments under the Oslo accords, opening safe passages between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and lifting the closure on the Palestinian self-rule areas.
He stressed that Egypt wants deeds but not words from the Israeli government.
Bassiouny issued the stern warning only one day after Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy paid his first visit to Egypt, during which he held talks with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa and President Hosni Mubarak.
Moussa threatened that Egypt would cancel the Cairo economic summit if Israel fails to redeploy its troops from the West Bank town of Hebron, saying, "I cannot imagine that the economic summit would take place when the withdrawal from Hebron has not happened yet".
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should have completed the Hebron pullout by late March, but it froze the plan after a series of extremist attacks killed 58 people from late February to early March.
The new Israeli government promised to conduct the pullout, but demanded certain revisions.
"In the absence of implementation, it will be a very serious situation.
It is impossible to imagine that we can talk about regional cooperation when the peace process is obstructed or paralyzed.
It would be illogical, out of the question," Moussa added.
Levy said today Moussa's view was exactly that of Mubarak, who was responsible for issuing the ultimatum.
In a strong reaction to Egypt's threat, the Israeli government today warned Cairo against "making things worse" by issuing such an ultimatum.
The Office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement blasting Egypt for issuing "an unfortunate threat that can only raise the tension in the region".
An Israeli official pointed out that Egypt needs the Cairo summit more than Israel does.
Egypt is the chief Arab mediator between Israel and the Palestinians when the two sides held negotiations on the Oslo accords.
Although Egypt is the first Arab country that established diplomatic ties with Israel, the two states have been slow in normalizing their relations, which are often marred by the disputes over the peace process and bilateral frictions.
JERUSALEM, October 23 (Xinhua) --Israeli former Prime Minister Shimon Peres expressed Friday welcome to the peace agreement reached by Israeli and Palestinian leaders at Wye Plantation outside Washington.
Reports reaching here from the plantation said that after nine days of intensive talks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat reached an agreement on issues discussed.
The signing ceremony was planned at White House later Friday.
Under the agreement, Israel will hand over another 13.1 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians, release part of the 3,400 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, open two roads between the West Bank and Gaza Strip as safe passage while the Palestinian side convenes its National Council to abrogate parts of the anti-Israeli articles from its Chart and other concrete plans to strengthen security cooperation with Israel.
The agreement reached at the Wye Plantation was a victory for the Oslo accords which kicked off the Mideast peace process, Peres told the Israeli TV Channel 1.
Agreement means everything has been decided on paper and its implementation is more important, Peres said, urging both sides to implement the agreement according to agreed timetable.
In Israel, only a minority of people oppose the peace and the majority must support what has been reached at Wye Plantation, Peres said.
Peres, who is also a Knesset (Parliament) member, contributed a great deal in the peace process, particularly in formulating the Oslo accords.
But Israel's right-wing groups and politicians strongly opposed what has been reached at the Wye Plantation.
Uzi Landau, chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, told the Channel 1 that he will oppose Netanyahu's decision to hand further West Bank land to the Palestinians.
JERUSALEM, September 14 (Xinhua) --Over 10,000 Israeli peace activists gathered in Tel Aviv overnight to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the signing of Oslo Accords and protest the Likud government's policies.
The rally, held in the Museum Plaza, was organized by activists of the opposition Labor, Meretz and Hadash parties and the peace movement Peace Now.
It was attended by former Labor's former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, Labor leader Ehud Barak, Meretz head Yossi Sarid and Leah Rabin, widow of the slain Labor Premier Yitzhak Rabin, local newspapers reported today.
Bearing banners reading "Returning to Rabin's path" and "Save the peace," the demonstrators demanded the current Likud government act to continue the peace process.
Speakers at the rally strongly attacked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government's policies that have put the peace process in danger.
Organizers handed out stickers that read, "What have you done today to topple the government"?
"Peace will overcome the delusions of this regime, Oslo will not die," Peres said in his speech.
"Four years ago peace was born in Oslo.
In the last year and a quarter Netanyahu's government has tried to break Oslo.
Oslo was no mistake, the Netanyahu government is the big mistake".
Barak blasted Netanyahu's policies for "leading us on the path of Bosnia and Belfast," warning that the next war is already waiting for the Israeli people behind the door.
"The handwriting is on the wall and only the blind or members of the government are unable to read it," Barak said.
A roar of applause rose from the crowd when Sarid said "Bibi, go home".
Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Quria (Abu Ala) sent a letter to the rally, calling on Israeli peace activists to join with the Palestinian people in seeking peace.
"In this flameless and lightless period, let us join hands and together firmly grip the torch of peace.
Together let us breath new life into this process and rebuild trust and recreate an atmosphere where confidence between our peoples prevails so that we both realize our common dream in this land of peace," he said.
It was the historical signing of the Declaration of Principles in Washington four years ago that formally triggered off the Oslo peace process, named for the Norwegian capital where peace was initiated in secret meetings.
However, the process, which has borne fruits including the Palestinian autonomy in Gaza Strip and West Bank, received a severe blow when the hardline Likud government came to power in Israel last year.
Israel's continuation of settlement activities, land confiscation and delay in troop redeployments have virtually halted the whole process and led to renewed tensions with the Palestinians.
Even a much-awaited visit by United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright here last week failed to break the deadlock, that was caused by Israel's building of the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem since March and was aggravated by a recent wave of suicide bombings launched by Islamic militants in Jerusalem.

BLACK *Associated Press Writer LARAMIE, Wyo.
(AP) --A judge today barred defense lawyers from using a ``gay panic'' defense in the murder trial of a man accused of beating gay college student Matthew Shepard.
State District Judge Barton Voigt told lawyers for Aaron McKinney that the strategy was, in effect, a temporary insanity or a diminished capacity defense, both of which are prohibited under Wyoming law.
Afton N.
Timothy, McKinney's stepsister, testified that she learned of the beating from McKinney's then-girlfriend, Kristen Price, who said he and an accomplice planned to pose as homosexuals and rob Shepard.
McKinney, 22, is charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard's death last year.
The 21-year-old University of Wyoming political science major suffered at least 18 blows to the head.
Prosecutors say McKinney and Russell Henderson, 22, posed as homosexuals, lured Shepard out of a downtown bar, drove him to a remote fence, tied him to it and pistol-whipped him into a coma.
Police said robbery was the main motive but that Shepard may also have been singled out because he was gay.
During opening statements, the defense told jurors that the crime was triggered by a combination of McKinney's drug and alcohol use, traumatic youthful homosexual episodes and an unwanted sexual advance by Shepard.
They had hope to borrow a page from what is informally called a ``gay panic'' defense, built on a theory that a person with latent gay tendencies will have an uncontrollable, violent reaction when propositioned by a homosexual.
Prosecutor Cal Rerucha countered that such testimony would give others an excuse to kill people they don't like, such as minorities.
And the judge said today that he did not believe defense attorneys had offered any evidence that such a strategy would be relevant.
``Even if relevant, the evidence will mislead and confuse the jury,'' he stated in a written order released before the trial resumed today.
McKinney could receive the death penalty if convicted.
Henderson received two life sentences after pleading guilty in April to felony murder and kidnapping.
DENVER (AP) --An emotional audience greeted the world premiere Saturday of ``The Laramie Project,'' a unique collaboration between a New York-based theater troupe and the people of Laramie, Wyo.
, about the murder of Matthew Shepard.
They cried and then cheered at the end of the three-act, nearly three-hour performance attended by nearly 50 townspeople and members of the media.
The play about the death of the gay University of Wyoming college student was the brainchild of Moises Kaufman, founder of the Tectonic Theater Project, whose members collaborated on the drama now on view at the Denver Center Theater through April 1.
``To actively step back and sit and watch everything unravel is surreal,'' said Matt Galloway, bartender at the Fireside Lounge, where Shepard met the men who killed him.
``I had so much anticipation.
It is interesting to undo the wound that you think is healed, but it hasn't''.
The production was a monumental effort involving 18 months of preparation, including six trips by members of the company to Laramie for interviews with scores of residents and friends of the 21-year-old Shepard.
Their thoughts and opinions were pieced together by the troupe, working under the guidance of Kaufman and Leigh Fondakowski, a company member who put together the script.
Shepard's death in October 1998 received national attention.
He was beaten, hung on a fence in a lonely prairie field and left to die.
Two young men, Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson, are serving life sentences for the murder.
Kaufman has called the murder ``a watershed event,'' one that captured what this nation is and where it is going as a society.
In that respect, it echoes, Kaufman says, his best-known work, ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' which had a long New York run, as well as a successful engagement at the Denver Center Theater last year.
The play, which chronicled Wilde's downfall, was based, in part, on trial transcripts, trials that eventually send the homosexual Wilde to prison for ``gross indecency''.
``The thing that shocked me about the trials of Oscar Wilde was that in reading the transcripts, you did not only see the story of this man's downfall but you saw exactly where Victorian society was at in terms of class, gender, sexuality, the monarchy, imperialism, capitalism,'' Kaufman has said.
``And I think that in the same way, Matthew Shepard's beating, cruel victimization and murder, did a similar thing.''
LARAMIE, Wyo.
_ In a case that galvanized national outrage over anti-homosexual violence, a 21-year-old roofer pleaded guilty on Monday to kidnapping and murdering a gay college student and was sentenced to serve two consecutive life sentences.
Escaping a possible death sentence, Russell Henderson was sentenced by District Judge Jeffrey Donnell for his part in the beating and murder of the student, Matthew Shepard, here six months ago.
The case propelled the issue of violence against gays onto magazine covers and into family dinner conversations.
``You are deserving the fullest punishment this court can mete out,'' the judge said, after accepting a plea bargain agreement two days before opening arguments were to begin in the case.
In a sole reference to Shepard's sexual orientation, the judge said the murder was ``part because of his lifestyle, part for a $20 robbery''.
During an emotion-packed hearing at the Albany County Courthouse here, Henderson turned to Judy and Dennis Shepard and apologized for murdering their 22-year-old son.
In what may be a preview of his testimony this August at the trial of a second man accused in the case, Henderson described his former workmate, Aaron McKinney, as the mastermind of the Oct.
6 kidnapping of Shepard from a bar here.
After listening impassively to this testimony, the judge turned to Henderson and said, ``This court does not believe you feel any true remorse in this matter''.
Conceding that he faced an ``academic choice,'' Donnell chose the harsher sentencing alternative, two life sentences to be served consecutively, rather than concurrently.
In his final comments before the defendant was led away to spend the rest of his life in jail, the judge told him, ``You are not a victim here, Mr.
Henderson, you are a perpetrator''.
Wyoming legal experts said on Monday there was virtually no chance that Henderson would ever be eligible for parole.
In recent weeks, a Wyoming coalition of clergy and a national coalition of gay groups spoke out against applying the death penalty in the Matthew Shepard case, a position they said was in harmony with their wider opposition to capital punishment.
Compressing an enormous amount of drama into a one-hour hearing, the court proceedings included the Shepards telling Henderson of their deep pain, the defendant giving his first public account of the crime, and his grandmother telling a packed courtoom of a loving young man who grew up in a household free of hate.
Dressed soberly in black pants, a gray shirt, and a black and white paisely tie, Henderson had let his hair grow out, shunning the skinhead look he favored at the time of his arrest.
``It was 10 p.m., and me and Aaron decided to go out to a bar,'' Henderson testified, responding to question's by his lawyer, Wyatt Skaggs.
After drinking ``a few pitchers of beer'' at the first bar, he said they went to a second bar, the Fireside.
There, while drinking another pitcher, he said McKinney noticed the college student.
``Aaron had mentioned to me that he wanted to take him out and rob him,'' Henderson testified in a clear if subdued voice.
``I disagreed with this''.
Painting his former roofing workmate as the author of the crime, he said that McKinney told tim to drive the pickup truck borrowed from McKinney's father, where to drive and where to park.
``Aaron McKinney, he pulled out a gun and told Matthew Shepard to give him his wallet,'' continued Henderson, who said that while he drove his friend beat Shepard.
After parking in an isolated field near a subdivision where Henderson once lived, McKinney ``pulled Matthew out of the truck and continued to hit him,'' with the pistol, he said.
``Aaron told me to go get a rope out of the truck,'' Henderson continued as the Shepards stared grimly ahead.
``Aaron told me to tie his hands'' to a fence pole.
``Matthew looked really bad, I told him to stop,'' Henderson continued.
``Mr. McKinney hit me above the mouth.
I returned to the pickup truck''.
After driving away, leaving the beating victim tied to a fence in temperatures that dropped below freezing, Henderson said that he and his friend got into another fight.
When caught by a Laramie police man, he said that he lied about what he had been doing earlier that evening.
The next day, instead of calling for medical help for Shepard, Henderson said that he and his girl friend, Chasity Pasley, and McKinney's girlfriend, Kristen LeAnn Price, drove 50 miles east to a truck stop in Cheyenne with his bloody clothing ``and put it in a dumpster to cover up that I was out there when Matthew was beaten''.
Ms. Pasley pled guilty in December to being an accessory after the fact to first-degree murder and faces sentencing.
Ms. Price was freed on bond in January and faces a trial on the same charges in May.
nn After Henderson spoke, it was the turn of Lucy Thompson, his maternal grandmother who has raised him since he was a baby.
``Our hearts ache for the pain and suffering that the Shepards have gone through,'' Mrs.
Thompson, said turning to Matthew's parents who sat in the front row of the courtroom.
A devout Mormon, she said, ``We have prayed for you many, many times.
You have showed us such mercy''.
Mrs. Thompson, who raised Henderson until he dropped out of Laramie High School near the end of his senior year, described him as ``a survivor'' whose ``mother was young and not ready to be a mother''.
Three months ago, at age 40, Cindy Thompson Dixon, Russell's mother, froze to death on a rural road outside of Laramie after a night of drinking.
Describing a ``loving and kind'' side to her grandson, she recalled him playing on the floor with his young cousins.
As his aunts and other relatives hugged each other for comfort on a front-row bench, she added, ``Even as a teenager, Russell was never embarrassed to give me a hug or to kiss me on the forehead in front of his peers''.
Referring to newspaper accounts of his grandson's expressionless demeanor in court, she said, ``I have looked into his eyes, and I know'' that he is in pain.
Noting that ``the case has developed into a hate crime,'' she said that she never preached hatred in her household and that ``Russell has never been a hateful individual''.
Russell, she intimated, was a loyal follower, adding, ``Sometimes friends would take advantage of his loyalties''.
In closing, she turned to the judge and begged him not ``to take Russell out of our lives forever''.
Turning to Matthew's parents again, she looked them in the eyes and said, ``I want to thank all the Shepards.
I love you even though I have never known you''.
The packed courtroom had scarcely absorbed this appeal, when it was the turn of Henderson, who hoped to earn a slim chance of one day winning parole.
Standing at the same podium, he turned his back to the judge and addressed Matthew's family, saying, ``Mr.
and Mrs.
Shepard, there is not a day that doesn't go by that I don't see what happened that night''.
``I know what I did,'' he continued, turning back to Donnell.
``I'm very sorry for what I did.
I am ready to pay for what I did''.
Then it was the turn of Mr.
and Mrs.
Shepard, who had traveled from their home in Saudi Arabia for the chance to address the court in their native Wyoming.
Mrs. Shepard spoke first, pausing at times to regain her composure as she recalled her son's blossoming interest in theater, politics and international cultures.
``He wasn't my son, my first born anymore,'' she said, recalling hugs and late night talks.
``He was my friend, my confidante, my constant reminder of how good life can be''.
She remembered that the last time she saw him he was covered with bandages and wired with tubes in an intensive care unit of a Fort Collins, Colo.
, hospital.
``One of his eyes was partially open,'' she recalled.
``I could see the clear blue of his eye.
But the twinkle of his life wasn't there any more''.
In contrast to the warm and trusting son she had known, she said that touching his arm in the hospital provoked an involuntary reaction, ``He began to shake and quiver''.
Referring to her son's savage beating _ he was kicked in the groin and beaten 18 times around the head _ she said in disbelief that ``such an act of cruelty was unthinkable''.
The stress on the Shepard family was so great, she continued, that within a month of Matthew's funeral, his paternal grandfather died.
``At times, I don't think you are worthy of addressing,'' Mrs.
Shepard said, turning to the man who had just pled guilty to murdering her son.
Speaking slowly, but firmly, she vowed, ``We won't allow you to kill our family''.
Shepard, looking drawn, rose to speak, saying he had thrown away remarks he had written on the plane.
``My son was born blind,'' he said in an impromptu speech.
``Not physically blind, but blind to people's differences _ short or tall; black, brown or white; religion or ethnic backgrounds.
His friends included gays and so-called straights''.
``When I meet strangers and make small talk, they ask, `do you have children'''? he continued.
``Now, I take a deep breath and say `I have one son,' not two''.
He recalled bathing his young son, teaching him to sing ``Row, Row, Row Your Boat,'' ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'' and other nursery rhymes.
With anger in his voice, he turned to the defendant and said, ``You, Mr.
Henderson, helped to sink that boat, to shoot Frere Jacques, and to shoot down that star''.
Summing up his remarks to a 175-pound man who had helped to kill his 105-pound son, Matthew's father said, ``It takes a brave man to tie up another man, who did not know how to clench a fist until he was 13 years old''.
After the Shepards, Cal Rerucha, the Albany County attorney, kept his remarks brief.
Turning to the defendant, he said, ``Mr.
Henderson you have created hell on earth _ for a family, for our community, for the state.''
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) --A U.S. man convicted of killing a gay college student was sentenced Thursday to life imprisonment.
The prosecution had originally asked for the death penalty for Aaron McKinney, 22, for killing Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college student, but later Shepard's parents agreed to spare him from lethal injection.
McKinney expressed regret for his role in the murder, which spurred nationwide rallies for legislation against hate crimes.
"I really don't know what to say other than that I'm truly sorry to the entire Shepard family," McKinney told the court.
A jury had found McKinney guilty Wednesday of felony murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery.
According to the agreement, McKinney will serve two consecutive life sentences, one for felony murder and one for kidnapping.
President Bill Clinton praised the jurors' decision, saying "this verdict is a dramatic statement that we are determined to have a tolerant law-abiding nation that celebrates our differences, rather than deepening them".
"We cannot surrender to those on the fringe of our society who lash out at those who are different," he added.
LARAMIE, Wyo.
(AP) --Matthew Shepard was struck at least 20 times, the blows raining down so hard that they fractured his skull a half-dozen times, a coroner testified today.
``Matthew Shepard died as a result of the blunt trauma injuries he sustained to his head and face,'' said Patrick Allen, coroner for Colorado's Larimer County, where Shepard died.
Some jurors winced as they viewed graphic photos of the homosexual college student's injuries, including his bloodied face and ear.
Allen testified as the trial of Aaron McKinney entered a second day in the Albany County Courthouse.
He is accused of kidnapping, robbery and first-degree murder.
Defense attorneys have said McKinney was guilty of manslaughter, but have argued that his judgment was affected by drugs, alcohol and childhood memories of sexual abuse.
On Monday, jurors saw pictures of the ponderosa pine fence where Shepard was left to die, his hands tied behind his back, and the pool of blood caused by blows as he fought his attackers.
Shepard's mother, Judy, dabbed her eyes when prosecutors showed jurors the graphic photos while McKinney's father, William, bowed his head.
McKinney barely glanced up.
``Matthew Shepard made a frail attempt to fight back,'' said prosecutor Cal Rerucha during opening statements Monday.
``McKinney struck him as hard as he could''.
Defense attorneys countered that McKinney, who faces the death penalty, didn't intend to kill Shepard when he and a friend accompanied Shepard from a Laramie bar after he asked McKinney for a ride home.
The 21-year-old University of Wyoming freshman was driven to a remote area, pistol-whipped and left overnight in near-freezing temperatures.
The defense portrayed McKinney as the victim of sexual abuse who lashed out when approached for a gay encounter.
McKinney's judgment that night was affected by alcohol, methamphetamines and ``some sexually traumatic and confusing events in his life,'' defense attorney Jason Tangeman told jurors.
Tangeman said McKinney, 22, was confused by homosexual encounters when he was younger.
In one case, McKinney was forced into an oral sex act with a neighborhood bully, Tangeman said.
``Did Matthew Shepard deserve to die?
No, that's ridiculous.
No manslaughter victim deserved to die,'' he said.
``That's what Aaron McKinney is guilty of --manslaughter''.
McKinney has been charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery.
The trial of the other man accused of the slaying that shocked the nation, Russell Henderson, ended in April just before a jury was seated.
Henderson pleaded guilty to felony murder and kidnapping and was sentenced to life in prison.
The plea allowed Henderson to avoid the death penalty.
On Monday, prosecutors called their first three witnesses: Aaron Kreifels, the college student who found Shepard; Charles Dolan, the neighbor who tried to help; and Albany County Deputy Reggie Fluty, who said she told the barely breathing victim, ``Baby, I'm so sorry this happened''.
Kreifels and Dolan described efforts to free Shepard from the fence, his hands tied to the bottom of a post.
Fluty said it appeared Shepard had been crying.
Shepard was taken to a hospital where he died five days later.
On the same day Americans learned last week that Matthew Shepard, a 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, had been tortured, strung up like an animal and left to die on a fence outside Laramie, Wyo.
, the Family Research Council was co-hosting a press conference in Washington.
It was the latest salvo in a six-month campaign by the religious right, with the tacit, even explicit, approval of Republican leaders, to demonize gay people for political gain in this election year.
This particular press conference was to announce a new barrage of ads _ a TV follow-up to a summer print campaign _ in which alleged former homosexuals who have ``changed'' implore others to do likewise ``through the power of Jesus Christ''.
The commercials, gooey in style, end with a slogan: ``It's not about hate...
It's about hope''.
But it's really about stirring up the fear that produces hate.
If these ads were truly aimed at gay people, they wouldn't be broadcast at extravagant cost to the wide general audience reached by TV, and they wouldn't be trumpeted in Washington, insuring free national exposure, three weeks before Election Day.
The ads themselves, despite the sugar-coating of ``hope,'' ooze malice.
In one of them, homosexuality is linked to drug addiction and certain death by AIDS; all of them implicitly posit that homosexuality is itself a disease in need of a cure.
Matthew Shepard has now been ``cured,'' that's for sure.
As his uncle, R.W.
Eaton, told The Denver Post, the 21-year-old Matt, who aspired to a career in diplomacy and human rights, was ``a small person with a big heart, mind and soul that someone tried to beat out of him''.
Of his nephew's shattered body Eaton said, ``It's like something you might see in war''.
And a war it is.
Go to the Family Research Council's Web site and you will find a proud description of its readiness to ``wage the war against the homosexual agenda and fight to maintain the traditional meaning of `family'''.
The head of the Family Research Council is Gary Bauer, a GOP power broker and putative presidential candidate, who disingenuously goes on talk shows to say that his organization hates no one and deplores violence.
But if you wage a well-financed media air war in which people with an innate difference in sexual orientation are ceaselessly branded as sinful and diseased and un-American seekers of ``special rights,'' ground war will follow.
It's a story as old as history.
Once any group is successfully scapegoated as a subhuman threat to ``normal'' values by a propaganda machine, emboldened thugs take over.
Two weeks after James Byrd was savagely dragged to his death from a pickup truck in Texas in June, I wrote a column about an ugly incident outside the GOP state convention in Fort Worth, where a mob threatened a group of gay Log Cabin Republicans who were protesting discriminatory treatment by their own party.
The gay-bashers had been directly preceded by steady saber-rattling from Republican politicians: Sen.
James Inhofe of Oklahoma had likened James Hormel, a gay nominee to an ambassadorship, to David Duke; Pat Robertson had wondered on TV if God might wreak havoc on Disney World for its ``Gay Days''; the Texas GOP spokesman had likened Log Cabin to the Ku Klux Klan.
Just two days after this near-brush with violence in Fort Worth, Trent Lott was on TV seconding the religious right's condemnation of gay people as sinful and sick.
A frightened gay Texas Republican who had been at the convention melee asked when I interviewed him then: ``Do you have to have someone hurt and beat up and dragged from a truck to stop this''?
Months later not even the murder in Laramie has moved Lott to apologize for his words, and still no major GOP leader dares take on its ``religious'' wing and its crusade against people like Matthew Shepard.
In one of the new ads in that supposedly hate-free crusade, an ostensibly loving mother condemns her son for the ``bad choice'' of being gay.
Is it that mother who speaks for American values, or is it Matthew's?
``Go home, give your kids a hug,'' Judy Shepard said in a message read by a tearful hospital spokesman who announced her child's death early Monday morning, ``and don't let a day go by without telling them you love them''. &QL;
NEW YORK _ What began as a rally down Fifth Avenue to mourn and protest the killing of a gay college student in Wyoming ended chaotically on Monday night, with nearly 100 arrests and several injuries after demonstrators faced off against police officers in riot gear and on horseback.
Several demonstrators and police officers were slightly injured during the loosely organized rally, whose planners did not have a permit to march in the street.
One woman was hurt by a police horse when mounted officers were sent into the crowd to disperse the marchers.
More than 4,000 people attended the march, which was billed as a ``political funeral'' to protest the killing of Matthew Shepard, 21, who died on Oct.
12 after being beaten and lashed to a fence in Wyoming in what the authorities called a bias-related crime.
Carrying a pine coffin and memorial candles, the marchers had planned to march down Fifth Avenue from 59th Street to Madison Square Park at 23d Street.
Scuffling between the marchers and the police broke out at several points along the route when officers in riot gear tried to keep the demonstrators on the sidewalk.
Several organizers and marchers accused the police of over-reacting, and said there would have been no problems had they been allowed to continued along their planned route.
But police officials defended their response, saying the demonstrators created a safety hazard by spilling into the streets.
Ruth Finklestein, a march organizer, said that she was injured by a police horse when mounted officers rode into the crowd on West 43d Street in an effort to disperse the marchers.
``I'm taking part in a demonstration against the gay-bashing in Wyoming and here in New York City, which is supposed to be the center of gay life in New York,'' she said, nursing her swollen, bruised right ankle while waiting for an ambulance.
``We were doing nothing illegal, wrong or unsafe, and I was trampled by a horse ridden by a New York City police officer''.
On Monday night police officials said that they had made at least 96 arrests, mostly for disorderly conduct.
One police lieutenant injured his finger in the fracas and was sent to a local hospital for X-rays, the police said.
First Deputy Police Commissioner Patrick Kelleher defended the police actions.
``They had a right to gather,'' he said of the marchers.
``But once they left the sidewalk they were endangering the motorists, they were endangering the pedestrians.
And we were forced to make arrests''.
But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who rarely minces his words when it comes to civil disturbances, struck a conciliatory tone when asked about the protest.
``It's a very worthy cause,'' he said on Monday night in Nashua, N.H., where he was visiting.
``I can understand why they are so outraged and upset''.
Marchers held aloft signs that said ``Stop Hate Crimes,'' ``Homophobia Kills'' and ``Where Is Your Rage''?
Many marchers said they were marching not only to protest the killing of Shepard but also to call attention to the problem of anti-gay bias crimes in New York City, where reports of such attacks have risen 78 percent so far this year over the same period last year.
``As lesbian and gay people, we know that Matthew Shepard is only the tip of the iceberg,'' said Sara Pursley, an organizer.
``We are people who live every day knowing that this could happen to us''.
The size of the march appeared to surprise both the loose-knit group of people who organized it and the police.
Kelleher said that the police called in more officers from all five boroughs when the trouble began.
``We increased the number of people significantly to put it back under control,'' he said on Moonday night.
LARAMIE, Wyo.
(AP) --Gay college student Matthew Shepard was pummeled to death by Aaron McKinney in a drunken, drug-induced rage after Shepard made a pass at him, McKinney's attorney said Monday as his trial began.
``Did Matthew Shepard deserve to die?
No, that's ridiculous.
No manslaughter victim deserved to die,'' Jason Tangeman said in opening statements.
``That's what Aaron McKinney is guilty of, manslaughter''.
The roofer's judgment that night was affected by alcohol, methamphetamines and ``some sexually traumatic and confusing events in his life,'' Tangeman told jurors.
The trial of the other man accused of the slaying that shocked the nation, Russell Henderson, ended in April just before a jury was seated.
Henderson pleaded guilty to felony murder and kidnapping and was sentenced to life in prison.
The plea allowed Henderson to avoid the death penalty.
Prosecutor Cal Rerucha said his case against McKinney will not deal with Shepard's gay lifestyle.
``It will simply be about the pain, suffering and death of Matthew Shepard at the hands of the defendant, Aaron James McKinney,'' he said.
Prosecutors then called their first three witnesses: Aaron Kreifels, the college student who found Shepard; Charles Dolan, the neighbor who tried to help and a female Albany County deputy, Reggie Fluty, who told the barely breathing victim, ``Baby, I'm so sorry this happened''.
Kreifels and Dolan described efforts to free Shepard from the pine log fence, his hands tied to the bottom of a post.
Fluty said it appeared Shepard had been crying.
Shepard was taken to a hospital where he died five days later.
Shepard's mother, Judy, dabbed her eyes when prosecutors showed jurors graphic photos of the young man's badly beaten face, and McKinney's father William, bowed his head.
McKinney barely glanced up.
Shepard, McKinney and Henderson met in a Laramie bar about a year ago, where Shepard asked McKinney for a ride home, humiliating him in front of friends because McKinney believed Shepard was gay, Tangeman contended.
Tangeman said McKinney, 22, was confused by three homosexual encounters that occurred when he was 7, 15 and 20.
In one case, McKinney was forced into an oral sex act with a neighborhood bully, Tangeman said.
Rerucha said McKinney and Henderson drove Shepard, 21, to a remote area, where they robbed him of $20, lashed him to the fence and began pistol-whipping him.
Opening statements were made after a jury of 10 men and six women, including four alternates, was seated in McKinney's trial on charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery.
He could be sentenced to die if convicted.
The jury includes three students at the University of Wyoming, where Shepard was a freshman studying human rights.
NEW YORK _ For some of the younger marchers, the demonstration Monday night that paralyzed parts of midtown Manhattan was their first political rally.
For some older protesters, though, the march _ to express outrage over the killing of a gay college student in Wyoming _ was a return to the angry street protests that had so often symbolized the militancy of the gay rights movement.
As the chaotic denouement of the march and the police response was debated Tuesday, one thing seemed clear: The size of the loosely organized protest showed how the killing of Matthew Shepard has galvanized gay men and lesbians in New York and around the country as has no other single event in recent years.
The demonstration began at 6 p.m. as a rally in front of the Plaza Hotel on 59th Street near Central Park, then swelled to 5,000 people on Fifth Avenue, blocking traffic.
Confrontations with police officers resulted in 120 arrests.
While the size of the protest in midtown surprised even its organizers, the evocation of anger and sadness on the streets of New York was hardly unique.
Candlelight vigils have taken place across the country, from Washington to Grand Junction, Colo.
, Raleigh, N.C., and Lubbock, Texas.
In San Francisco, the giant rainbow flag in the Castro district that symbolizes the gay rights movement was lowered to half staff.
The Internet has been filled with discussion of the crime, students have rallied on college campuses, vigils have been held at churches.
The cause of the passion, participants say, is a sense that even as gay people have become more accepted in society than ever before, there are stark reminders of the hatred and violence of the not-so distant past.
Well before Shepard's murder, a sharp increase in police reports of anti-gay bias crimes in New York City had unsettled gay people, shaking them out of what some call complacency in the years since the height of AIDS activism.
Recent protests over issues like benefits for domestic partners and the right to march in the St.
Patrick's Day Parade have lacked the drama of the guerrilla street tactics of AIDS activists.
Some gay men and lesbians contend that their success in drawing attention to AIDS gave some a false feeling of security and acceptance, especially in the city with the largest gay population in the country.
``There was a sense, I think, in the gay community, particularly living in a certain segment of it in New York City, that we can live in a kind of bubble and feel relatively safe and feel as if we've arrived,'' said Tim Allis, 37, a magazine editor.
``A sense that gay rights are there, that we are so much a part of the mainstream in so many ways, so visible, with so many role models on television.
It's a bit of an illusion''.
Thomas Ruble, 45, had been to two gay pride rallies and parades, but never to a large protest march until Monday night.
``Sometimes, in our little gay lives in the middle of America, I think we have forgotten that they kill us,'' he said.
``They hate us''.
In more than 20 interviews with gay men and lesbians in the past week, many people said that the killing of Matthew Shepard had struck a strong emotional chord.
Some cited his clean-cut image.
Others spoke of the brutality of the crime, in which he was left, severely beaten, lashed to a fence in near-freezing temperatures to die.
Jay Blotcher, who was a spokesman for Queer Nation, a street protest group, in the early 1990s, said that in recent years, his group and other militant organizations had run out of steam and were failing to attract young members.
``We were looking to younger people to pick up the mantle and it wasn't really happening,'' he said.
``I attributed that to that fact that a new generation came of age and said: `I don't have to be a gay activist, I'm just a gay person.
It doesn't have to be an issue'''.
``I think something like this reminds us that it still is an issue,'' he added.
``There were lots of young people at the rally on Fifth Avenue.
And there were people I know there who had hung up their activist mantles and gone into semiretirements''.
In New York City, there were 82 anti-gay bias crimes reported this year through Oct.
4, compared with 46 during the same period last year, representing a 78 percent jump, said Deputy Inspector Barbara Sicilia, commander of the Bias Unit.
Overall bias crimes rose by 2 percent, to 384 from 374.
Although the most incidents were reported in lower Manhattan, where they usually occur, more incidents were also reported in the boroughs of Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island.
Carl Locke, director of client services at the Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, a nonprofit organization that helps victims of bias crimes, said the spread of bias crimes across the city shows the extent to which gay people are becoming more visible outside their usual neighborhoods, Greenwich Village and Chelsea in Manhattan and Park Slope in Brooklyn.
``Most gay-related crimes have people come to your neighborhood and seek you out to hurt you,'' he said.
``Now people don't have to come downtown.
As we are more visible outside of Manhattan, we have also seen an increase in crimes in those neighborhoods''.
While many activists believe that anti-gay crimes are on the rise across the country, statistics are difficult to come by.
The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Projects, which collects data from 14 organizations across the country, reported that violent crimes against gay people rose 2 percent, to 2,445 incidents, in 1997, the last year for which statistics are available.
In 1996, the report said, anti-gay crimes rose by 6 percent.
But those figures reflect incidents labeled bias crimes by local organizations, which often use different standards from police when determining motivation.
Jack Levin, a professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University in Boston and an author of ``Hate Crimes: The Rising Tide of Bigotry and Bloodshed'' (Plenum Press, 1993), said it was not unusual for anti-gay crimes to buck the trends of other bias crimes.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) ``Most hate crimes respond to economic factors like the unemployment rate, but not gay-bashing,'' he said.
``Gay-bashing has nothing to do with money, with economic survival.
That's why so many perpetrators are teen-agers and come from every point among the economic continuum.
It is typically done by young people, with their hormones raging, feeling confusion about sexual identity.
Young guys in denial about their own homosexual feelings who see the very presence of a gay person as a threat''.
The demonstration Monday night was billed as a ``political funeral'' for Shepard.
But organizers also saw it as an opportunity to protest the rise in anti-gay crimes in New York City and to call on the state Senate to pass an anti-bias law for gay people.
Nineteen states, including New York, do not have legislation that specifically prohibits anti-gay hate crimes.
In these states, someone who assaults a gay man or a lesbian can be convicted of assault, but not a bias-related assault.
New York does have a law, aggravated harassment in the first degree, that outlaws harassing people because of ``the race, color, religion or national origin of such person,'' but it makes no reference to sexual orientation.
Allis, the magazine editor, said that Shepard's killing put recent history into a new light.
``There was that sense of connecting the dots,'' he said.
``Between the well-publicized murders, the less-publicized hate crimes that we hear about across the country, Trent Lott's words calling homosexuality a disease, and small acts of intolerance, there were all sorts of indications.
But the murder of Matthew Shepard brought the picture into relief.''
LARAMIE, Wyo.
(AP) --A judge has issued a gag order for lawyers involved in the Matthew Shepard murder trial, saying they ``gravely injured'' the defendant's right to a fair trial.
``There exists a very real danger that counsel's playing to the media has already gravely injured, or at least made much more difficult, the prospect of seating a jury in this case,'' Judge Barton R.
Voigt wrote Thursday.
Voigt's ruling stemmed from a dispute between lawyers representing Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson.
Henderson has pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping in the death of Shepard, a University of Wyoming student who was lured from a bar in October and fatally beaten.
He received two life sentences.
Henderson admitted driving Shepard to a remote area and tying him to a fence, but said he tried to intervene to prevent McKinney from inflicting a more severe beating.
He said McKinney, who has yet to be tried, struck him in the face.
McKinney's attorney, Dion Custis, told reporters Henderson fabricated the story to save himself from the death penalty.
Henderson's public defender Wyatt Skaggs then publicized copies of allegedly incriminating letters supposedly written by McKinney, drawing another round of criticism from Custis.
DENVER _ Matt Galloway talks in sporadic, sometimes emotional bursts.
His hands fly around.
His body tries to keep up.
At least that is how Stephen Belber portrayed him onstage.
``I questioned that at first,'' the real Galloway said after watching ``The Laramie Project,'' a new play by Moises Kaufman of the New York-based Tectonic Theater Project, which had its premiere here on Saturday night.
``But I guess I really do talk like that.
It was pretty accurate''.
As a bartender at the Fireside Lounge in Laramie, Wyo.
, Galloway was one of the last people to see Matthew Shepard alive 17 months ago before two local roofers lured him into a truck, beat him, robbed him and left him for dead on a wooden fence on the outskirts of town _ all because Shepard, a 21-year-old student at the University of Wyoming, was gay.
After five days in a Colorado hospital, Shepard died.
The roofers received life sentences with no chance of parole.
The serendipity of Galloway's role in Shepard's life, as well as the relationships that scores of others had with Shepard, have been woven into an emotional performance, drawn from court records, personal journals and 200 interviews in Laramie conducted by Kaufman, his writers and his actors.
``The Laramie Project'' examines homophobia, class distinctions and cowboy culture by blending the chronology of the case with the anger, confusion, sadness and embarrassment it left behind.
The play ultimately questions whether Laramie, or the nation, has changed as a result.
The words of more than 60 people are conveyed by eight actors simulating the appearance, mannerisms and speech patterns of the people they interviewed.
Kaufman, 36, who wrote the critically acclaimed play ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' said his new play represented an effort to use the stage as a journalistic medium.
And it succeeds to the extent that a three-act play lasting nearly three hours can mine deeper feelings than newspaper and television reporters who face daily deadlines.
Kaufman even breaks a little news in the play, revealing that Reggie Fluty, the deputy sheriff who first reached Shepard at the fence, learned later that the victim was HIV positive and feared that her efforts to resuscitate him had exposed her to the virus that causes AIDS.
She began drug therapy, and tests showed she was not infected.
But in addressing larger issues attached to the murder of a gay man for no other reason than his sexual orientation, the play reflects a community still in conflict: Romaine Patterson, a university student, says she was inspired to pursue courses in political science in order to fight for human rights, yet a Baptist minister, who goes unnamed in the play, says he hopes that during the 18 hours Shepard was tied to the fence, he had a moment to reflect on his lifestyle.
Galloway, 25, a senior at the university who still works at the Fireside, was one of several Laramie residents portrayed onstage who attended the opening performance.
In an interview, he said the Shepard murder had changed some attitudes in Laramie, including those of friends of his who no longer use the word ``fag'' to describe a gay man.
At the same time, he recalled two customers coming into the Fireside last week, asking to buy T-shirts bearing the name of the bar as a souvenir of where Shepard spent his last moments.
Galloway said he was repulsed by the request.
Zackie Salmon, 52, who manages a scholarship program at the university, was briefly portrayed onstage, expressing repugnance at one of the killers, Aaron J.
McKinney. As a lesbian, she said, she has noticed that the death of Shepard has had some salutary effects on Laramie's gay and lesbian population, which is larger than most gays and lesbians there had ever realized.
``Before this incident, I would have never felt as comfortable being who I am,'' Salmon said.
``After the Matthew Shepard incident, there was a push for understanding, like we're going to face what happened in our community and we're going to change''.
But even so, Salmon added, she has a lesbian friend who works in a different department at the university who has told her that she fears she could lose her job if her sexual orientation were made public.
``I still won't walk across the street holding my partner's hand,'' she said.
``I would do that in New York and I've done it in San Francisco.
But I still won't do it in Laramie.''
LARAMIE, Wyo.
(AP) --A prosecutor asked 71 prospective jurors today to set aside the emotions of pity and rage if chosen for the trial in the death of gay college student Matthew Shepard.
Prosecutor Cal Rerucha also told the panel to remember that Shepard, who was beaten and left tied to a fence in near-freezing weather last fall, was ``a victim that was different, a victim that was not the same as you and I''.
But he emphasized that the Constitution requires all people to be treated fairly under the law.
Rerucha's statements came as the trial of Russell Henderson began in Albany County District Court.
During his comments to potential jurors, defense attorney Wyatt Skaggs shifted the blame for the killing to Henderson's co-defendant, Aaron McKinney, who was to be tried later.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew Shepard,'' Skaggs said.
He also warned jurors they would be seeing ``really, really graphic'' photos during the trial.
As he said this, Matthew Shepard's mother, Judy, who was in the last row of the courtroom, slowly looked down.
By the lunch break, 10 prospective jurors had been dismissed for various reasons, including health and business issues.
One woman was dismissed for child care reasons.
During the morning session, Henderson, 21, showed little emotion and occasionally looked at the pool of possible jurors seated in the courtroom's spectator section.
Henderson and the 21-year-old McKinney both face the death penalty if convicted in a case that has become a central focus for gay rights activists and others seeking stronger bias crime legislation.
Opening statements were scheduled for April 6.
Authorities said Henderson and McKinney, both high-school dropouts, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar last October and then kidnapped and beat him, leaving him lashed to a fence.
Shepard, a political science major at the University of Wyoming, was not found for hours and died five days later at a hospital.
Despite the attention given the case, there were only a few spectators in the courtroom.
Fenced-off areas for protesters outside were empty.
Still, police stepped up patrols today outside the courthouse because anti-gay protesters and gay rights advocates have clashed repeatedly over the case.
Jim Osborn, who attended grade school with Shepard and remained his friend, stopped by the courthouse on his way to work.
``The most important thing is: My friend is dead,'' Osborn said.
``Matt was a person.
He wasn't just a gay man.
Nothing can bring him back''.
Asked about having to endure the trials of the two murder suspects, Osborn said, ``It's going to be very difficult''.
On Tuesday, Shepard's mother asked Congress and state legislatures to enact bias crime laws to deter future acts of violence.
``There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes from happening.
But they can reduce them,'' Mrs.
Shepard said at a news conference in Washington, D.C.
``They can help change the climate in this country, where some people feel it is okay to target specific groups of people and get away with it''.
Mrs. Shepard declined to discuss the trial, saying only that she and her husband ``want to allow justice to run its course''.
City spokesman Randy Vickers said police have set up fences to keep news reporters and demonstrators at bay, and access to the courthouse has been limited to one door, where two metal detectors have been installed.
The trial is expected to last five weeks.
Before savagely beating Matthew Shepard with a pistol butt, one of his tormentors taunted him, saying, ``It's Gay Awareness Week,'' a police investigator has testified at a hearing in Laramie, Wyo.
, for one of two men accused of the murder of the gay college student.
The testimony, by Sgt.
Rob Debree, came at a daylong proceeding Thursday.
In the evening, Robert Denhardt, a visiting county judge, ordered Aaron McKinney, 22, to stand trial on charges of first-degree murder, robbery and kidnapping.
The other suspect, Russell Henderson, 21, a friend of McKinney, has waived his right to a preliminary hearing and is to be arraigned on the same charges on Dec.
2. Throughout the hearing, Dennis and Judy Shepard, parents of the slain student, sat stoically in Albany County Court as police witnesses provided new details about a crime that produced a national wave of anger at anti-gay violence.
Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, in Laramie, was fatally attacked a few hours after he had attended a planning meeting for Gay Awareness Week events on campus.
Debree, the lead investigator for the Albany County Sheriff's Department, testified that he conducted a tape-recorded interview with McKinney on Oct.
9, two days after the beating and three days before Shepard died in a hospital in nearby Fort Collins, Colo.
In that interview, Debree recalled, McKinney said he and Henderson had identified Shepard as a robbery target and had then lured him out of a Laramie bar and into their truck by pretending to be gay.
By McKinney's account, the detective said, the attack began after Shepard had placed his hand on McKinney's leg as they drove through Laramie.
``Guess what, we're not gay,'' the detective quoted McKinney as saying he had told Shepard.
``You're going to get jacked.
It's Gay Awareness Week''.
The detective said McKinney had admitted hitting Shepard three times with fists and six times with a stolen revolver.
An autopsy found that Shepard had been hit 18 times in the head.
He was also bruised on the backs of his hands, indicating that he had tried to protect himself, and around the groin, indicating that he had been kicked repeatedly.
About 18 hours after the beating, a bicyclist found him still alive, tied to a ranch fence.
Reggie Fluty, an Albany County sheriff's deputy, testified on Thursday that Shepard's wrists had been so tightly bound that it had been difficult to cut the rope and that his head had been covered in blood except for a clean spot ``where he'd been crying and the tears went down his face''.
A Laramie police officer, Detective Ben Fritzen, testified that he had interviewed Kristen Price, McKinney's 18-year-old girlfriend.
Fritzen said that in explaining the violence, McKinney had told Ms.
Price, ``Well, you know how I feel about gays,'' Ms.
Price and Chasity Pasley, Henderson's girlfriend, waived their right to preliminary hearings and are to be arraigned on Dec.
9 as accessories after the fact.
A public defender for McKinney, Dion Custis, told the judge at the hearing that the state had failed to prove that the slaying had been planned, as is required for first-degree murder, or that Shepard had been kidnapped.
Custis also said a watch and other belongings left at the crime scene showed that robbery was no factor.
But Cal Rerucha, the Albany County prosecutor, said Shepard's wallet had been found in a dirty diaper in the kitchen of the Laramie apartment shared by McKinney, Ms.
Price and their 4-month-old son, Cameron.
Addressing the judge, Rerucha said: ``They beat him for $20, your honor.
That was the contents of the wallet.''
``It's Gay Awareness Week''! taunted one of the two men charged with murdering Matthew Shepard just before they slammed a pistol butt into the University of Wyoming student's head 18 times.
Police testimony at a preliminary hearing two weeks ago also indicates that Matthew had not made a pass at his assailants, which didn't stop them from referring to him repeatedly as ``queer'' and ``faggot''.
By the time the beating was over, Matthew's head was entirely covered with blood except, as a sheriff's deputy explained, ``where he'd been crying and the tears went down his face''.
Was this a slaughter driven by pathological hatred or just by robbery?
(The wallet he was carrying contained $20).
The trial will tell, we can hope.
What remains as certain now as on Oct.
12, the day Matthew died, is that this murder happened against the backdrop of a campaign in which the far right, abetted by political leaders like Trent Lott, was demonizing gay people as sick and sinful.
Since FBI figures show that hate crimes due to ``sexual-orientation bias'' are rising even as the national crime rate goes down, the most pressing question now is: Has that ugly backdrop changed?
Not enough.
In the aftermath of the Wyoming killing, the same groups that worked overtime to stigmatize gay people have mounted a furious propaganda defense to assert that their words and ads demeaning gay people have nothing to do with any anti-gay crimes.
Given that these are the same groups that claim the ``pro-gay'' rhetoric of an Ellen DeGeneres or Joycelyn Elders foments homosexuality, it isn't easy for them to argue now that their own words have no consequences.
So they instead attack those who call them on their game, hoping we might be intimidated and shut up.
As one of their apologists, Hadley Arkes, wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, my columns on this subject are ``vibrant with a hatred of the Family Research Council and evangelical Christians''.
It's a nice try at changing the subject, but taking a stand against the anti-gay crusade of the political organizations of the religious right is not a stand against Christians, evangelical or otherwise.
Most people who abhor homophobia are themselves Christian _ and so, for that matter, are most gay Americans.
As for the Family Research Council, it is not even a quasi-religious organization but a moneyed secular outfit whose leader, Gary Bauer, wants to be president.
And the Shepard killing has hardly deterred its demonization of gay people as subhuman.
One new tack _ according to a council draft document I've seen _ is to show that ``homosexuals are at much greater risk from one another than from bias-related attacks''.
And so the plan is to inform us that more gay men die of AIDS than of bias-related murders _ a nonsensical pairing intended to brand gay men as diseased.
Since gay women can't be stigmatized en masse with AIDS, the council had to use real ingenuity to prove that they, too, are vermin at ``much greater risk from one another'' than from gay-bashers.
The solution turned up in a ``Culture Facts'' newsletter it published only nine days after Matthew Shepard's death and is still posted on its Web site.
Titled `` `Gay' Violence Escalates,'' it asserts that ``The University of Houston-Downtown in a recent study found that 47.5 percent of lesbian relationships involve some form of domestic abuse,'' compared with 0.22 percent for married women.
I reached the unnamed source of this ``fact'' in Houston _ Lisa Waldner, an assistant professor of sociology.
Previously unaware of what she called the council's ``misleading'' use of her work, she told me that this so-called ``recent study'' was a paper she co-wrote as a student in 1992 about the lifetime experiences of a non-random sample of gay people she knew and their circle.
She said it was wrong to ``say this is the average for all lesbians'' and that the council's comparison of her study with another on married women was meaningless since they used completely different methodologies.
But if not even Shepard's death could derail the Family Research Council's ``loving'' crusade against homosexuality, the unmasking of its fallaciously ``scientific'' slurs won't stop it now.
What, you have to wonder, will?
LARAMIE, Wyo.
(AP) --Aaron McKinney, accused of the fatal beating of gay college student Matthew Shepard, pulled out a gun and clubbed another man hours after Shepard was attacked, a teen-ager testified Tuesday.
Jeremy Herrera, 19, said McKinney was arguing with Emiliano Morales III when McKinney went to his truck, pulled out a gun and hit Morales from behind.
``I heard a thud.
It was the most sickening thing I ever heard in my life,'' said Herrera, who added he struck McKinney with a thick stick.
Police said the fight helped them connect McKinney to Shepard's beating.
McKinney is charged with murder, kidnapping and robbery.
If convicted, he faces the death penalty.
During the first full day of testimony, jurors also heard from the coroner who examined Shepard's body, a bartender and Morales, who said the beating rendered him unable to identify his attacker.
McKinney's co-defendant, Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty to kidnapping and felony murder in April and received life in prison.
Prosecutors say McKinney and Henderson kidnapped Shepard and took him to a remote area near Laramie on Oct.
7, 1998 and lashed him to a fence, where they robbed him of $20.
Shepard was beaten into a coma.
He died five days later.
WASHINGTON (AP) --With fresh prodding from President Clinton, the Senate is having another go at expanding the list of hate crimes and giving federal prosecutors more leeway in bringing hate crime charges.
But while an almost identical bill was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate last year, this time it has touched off heated debate over whether the measure infringes on state and local powers of law enforcement.
Supporters cited the 1998 death in Jasper, Texas, of James Byrd, a 49-year-old black man, who was dragged behind a pickup truck; and the death, also in 1998, of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old homosexual University of Wyoming student, who died after being beaten into a coma and tied to a fence.
Neither state had a hate-crimes statute.
''Hate crimes are modern day lynchings,'' said Sen.
Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
, the principal sponsor.
''They tear at the heart and soul of our country''.
Kennedy's legislation was headed for a vote Tuesday as an amendment to an unrelated defense bill.
Clinton met with Byrd's family Monday in Houston and renewed his appeal for Senate passage.
He also put in a few calls to wavering senators.
Byrd was dragged to death on a country road by a trio of white men.
''Crimes motivated by hate are really fundamentally different and I think should be treated differently under the law,'' Clinton said.
''I ask all of you to stand up with this fine family.
We have to pass this legislation''.
The president cited FBI statistics that showed almost 8,000 hate crimes were reported in 1998, the latest year available.
The legislation would add offenses motivated by sexual orientation, sex or disability to the list of hate crimes already covered under a 1968 federal law.
It also would give federal prosecutors the option of pursuing a hate-crime case if local authorities refused to press charges.
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the Judiciary Committee chairman, was pressing a rival approach that would set up a $5 million-a-year fund at the Justice Department to help state and local authorities investigate and prosecute hate crimes.
His proposal also would authorize a federal study to see whether hate crimes were not being prosecuted by state and local authorities.
Hatch said the Kennedy measure was overly broad.
For instance, he suggested that under it every rape prosecution could be deemed a hate crime and prosecuted in federal courts.
''There is little evidence that a broad federalization of hate crimes is warranted,'' Hatch said.
''Serious constitutional questions remain''.
Another potential problem facing the Kennedy measure: Senate Republican leaders are wary of further weighing down the defense bill with irrelevant amendments.
Democrats are seeking to use the legislation to press a range of high profile issues in this election year.
A Kennedy spokesman, Will Keyser, said Kennedy was optimistic the measure would be approved, although he suggested the vote could be close.
The Senate adopted the hate-crimes legislation last year as part of a spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and State departments, but it stalled in the House.
Kennedy's measure would expand a 1968 federal law that defines hate crimes as assaults motivated by the victim's race, color, religion or national origin as the victim attempts to exercise certain specified federally protected activities --including voting or attending school.
His measure has 42 co-sponsors, including six Republicans.

The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Nov.
4: The killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming who in 1998 was beaten, lashed to a fence and left to die, shocked Americans by lifting homophobia to a new level of savagery.
A jury has now convicted Aaron McKinney of murder, kidnapping and robbery in the case, and he could face the death penalty.
The other defendant, Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping earlier, and is serving two life sentences.
Although McKinney admitted that he had committed the attack, his lawyers hoped to raise a type of ``gay panic'' defense.
In their opening statements they argued that McKinney was guilty only of manslaughter because sexual abuse in childhood had caused him to respond in a rage to the victim's alleged homosexual advances.
The presiding judge, Barton Voigt, rejected that argument as inadmissible at trial, ruling that it amounted to a diminished-capacity or temporary-insanity defense, neither of which is allowed under Wyoming law.
The ``gay panic'' defense has no statutory basis, but it has been invoked in other cases.
Typically, the argument is that the attacker, stirred by fears that he is himself homosexual, becomes so offended by what he perceives as a sexual advance that he is provoked to kill the victim.
In other words, the attacker should not be held fully responsible for acts triggered by his own homophobia.
Excusing violence motivated by prejudice would not be tolerated in racist attacks against ethnic minorities, and should not be allowed to stand in cases involving attacks against gays.
Voigt's ruling leaves open the possibility that testimony about McKinney's childhood sexual abuse could be presented in the penalty phase of the case.
Childhood abuse would clearly be relevant in sentencing deliberations.
But that is quite a different matter from allowing anti-gay hatred to be employed as an affirmative defense for criminal acts.
LARAMIE, Wyo.
(AP) --A man testified he was angered by a sexual advance by gay college student Matthew Shepard inside the same bar that Shepard later met up with his alleged killers.
Michael St.
Clair was the first defense witness called in the murder trial of Aaron McKinney.
The defense opened its case Friday.
McKinney, 22, is charged with robbery, kidnapping and murder, and could be sentenced to death if convicted.
His attorneys are trying to convince the jury McKinney is guilty of manslaughter rather than murder.
They have argued that he snapped during a drunken, drug-induced rage after a sexual advance by Shepard triggered memories of a childhood homosexual assault.
St. Clair told jurors Shepard asked to sit with him inside the Fireside Lounge on Oct.
6, 1998, before making a sexual suggestion.
``It was really offensive to me,'' St.
Clair said.
``It set off something inside.
It made me angry''.
Shepard later met McKinney and Russell Henderson at the bar, where St.
Clair said he saw the three leave together.
Prosecutors say the two lured Shepard out of the bar, took him to a remote area where they robbed and beat him.
He was left to die tied to a fence post.
Henderson, 22, is serving two life sentences after pleading guilty to murder and kidnapping.
Before the defense testimony began, attorneys asked the judge to allow them to use the ``gay panic'' strategy, contending it is crucial for jurors to understand why the roofer beat Shepard to death.
``These life experiences may say how he reacted that evening,'' defense attorney Dion Custis said in a hearing after prosecutors rested their case.
``That is for a jury to decide, not the court''.
Prosecutor Cal Rerucha countered that such testimony would give others an excuse to kill people they don't like, such as minorities.
``You can't have a conspiracy of two people who go out and pretend to be homosexuals and commit a robbery and claim homosexual panic,'' he said.
Judge Barton Voigt said he would rule on the issue Monday.
Earlier Friday, prosecutors rested their case against McKinney.
During four days of testimony, prosecutors drew a timeline of the events, culminating in the playing of McKinney's jailhouse confession, in which he described in detail how Shepard was beaten.
LARAMIE, Wyo.
_ Aaron J.
McKinney killed a gay student at the University of Wyoming last year in ``a five-minute emotional rage'' because the student, Matthew Shepard, had made sexual advances that reminded him of homosexual abuse he had suffered as a child, McKinney's lawyer told a jury on Monday as his murder trial began here.
The jury of 12 and four alternates heard a different rationale for the killing from Cal Rerucha, the prosecutor for Albany County, who said that McKinney and a friend, Russell Henderson, fully intended to murder Shepard after kidnapping him and robbing him of $20.
For that, prosecutors are seeking a death penalty for McKinney.
Henderson pleaded guilty to murder this spring to avoid a death penalty.
He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms with no chance of parole.
The case attracted wide attention.
Shepard, 21, was beaten more than 20 times on the head with a.357-magnum handgun, tied to a fence on an isolated prairie road and left to die.
He was found by a bicyclist 18 hours later and taken to a hospital, where he lived only four more days.
The case became a rallying cry for states and the federal government to pass and expand hate-crime measures, but fewer than half the states have passed such measures, and Wyoming remains one of eight states with no hate-crime laws.
Federal lawmakers last week dropped provisions of a bill that would have expanded the definition of hate crimes to include crimes motivated by victim's sexual orientation.
Nor has the case appeared to stir much interest in Laramie.
The spacious courtroom was far from filled.
Shepard's mother, Judy, sat with several friends opposite several of McKinney's relatives, including his father, Bill McKinney.
Otherwise, the audience was made up of mostly reporters.
In his opening arguments, Jason Tangeman, one of Kinney's court-appointed lawyers, conceded that McKinney was responsible for Shepard's death.
But in mounting a defense designed to bring a prison term, rather than execution, Tangeman argued that McKinney's past, as well as his poor judgment, led him to drug addiction and alcohol abuse.
Tangeman told jurors that McKinney had been using large amounts of methamphetamine in the days before the killing and was drinking heavily in the hours before he and Henderson encountered Shepard at a local bar.
But in disputing Rerucha's contention that Shepard's sexual orientation played no role in events leading to the killing and that McKinney was driven solely by greed and violence, Tangeman argued that McKinney was ``haunted by a past, that put him into a rage, put him into a five-minute emotional rage of chaos''.
The distinction is important.
If prosecutors can prove malicious intent and premeditation, they have a better chance of winning a death sentence.
If defense lawyers can show the killing evolved from a moment of passion or rage, they may persuade the jury to find the defendant guilty of a lesser charge, like manslaughter.
But even if prosecutors put on an air-tight case, it might be difficult to win a death sentence.
Wyoming is one of 38 states that have a death penalty but one of the least inclined to use it.
Since the Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that capital punishment was constitutional, Wyoming, Idaho, Colorado and Ohio each have put to death only one prisoner.
Wyoming has only two inmates on death row.
Rerucha presented a chronology for the night of Oct.
6, 1998, from the Fireside Lounge, where McKinney and Henderson encountered Shepard, to the beatings, which began as the two drove Shepard around town and continued at the fence.
But in Tangeman's version, Shepard was portrayed as a sexual predator who had sought a ride from the two men and had ``reached over and grabbed Aaron's genitals and licked his ear''.
As a result, Tangeman told the jury, McKinney ``becomes very, very upset and beats Matthew Shepard,'' prompted by memories of a sexual encounter forced upon him by an older boy when he was 7.
Tangeman said the older boy threatened to spread the word that McKinney was a homosexual.
Also, Tangeman said, McKinney at 15 had a consensual sexual encounter with a male cousin .
The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, April 6: Russell Henderson's decision to plead guilty to the kidnapping and murder of Matthew Shepard is little consolation to the Shepard family, but it provides an appropriately severe sentence for one whose apparent anti-gay hatred led him to destroy a young life.
The sentence of two consecutive life terms saves Henderson from the possibility of the death penalty but makes it virtually certain he will spend the rest of his life in prison.
It is not yet clear whether he will have to testify against Aaron McKinney, the co-defendant who will be tried for capital murder this summer.
Judge Jeffrey Donnell said in court Monday, as he dismissed the defendant's weak apology, that ``The pain you have caused here, Henderson, will never go away''.
Unfortunately, lawmakers in Wyoming and in other states seem quite willing to forget what happened.
In the days and weeks after the murder, it seemed that the nation would be awakened to the virulence of anti-gay beliefs that partly propelled this murder.
Matthew Shepard's youth, and the horrific way he died _ tied to a fence, beaten and left to die in the cold _ made many realize that homosexuals need protection from the kinds of hate crimes that have caused other groups in this nation's history to live in fear.
Yet in a very short time, the old prejudice that homosexuals are not discriminated against and do not warrant ``special'' protection has resurfaced in a backlash.
The Wyoming Legislature this winter killed an effort to pass the state's first hate-crimes bill.
The bill would have increased penalties for those convicted of crimes motivated by bias.
Anti-gay bias measures also died in other mountain states.
In an appallingly callous explanation of the defeat, one Republican leader in the Wyoming Senate said, ``My feeling right now is that the committee is tired of discussing bias crimes''.
The fact remains that anti-gay violence accounted for more than 1,100 reported hate crimes in this country in 1997, according to the latest FBI figures.
Matthew Shepard is just one more grim statistic.
The conviction of one man and the trial of another for his murder are appropriate responses to this criminal act.
But state and national officials must still show leadership in creating laws that send an unmistakable message that such hatred will not be tolerated in this society.
Matthew Shepard, 21, died early Monday after being in a coma for nearly a week.
He had been robbed, beaten and pistol-whipped in the head so severely his skull was too crushed for surgery.
The father of one of two accused suspects said his son told him he committed the crime because he was embarrassed when Shepard flirted with him in front of his friends.
Anti-gay violence and even deaths are not new.
But Shepard's killing has touched off an intense reaction among gays and lesbians nationwide because of its extreme brutality and timing.
Shepard lost his life at a time when describing homosexuality as a sickness that needs curing is gaining political currency.
``Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be dismissed simply as the fault of deranged, isolated individuals,'' said Beatrice Dohrn, legal director of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York.
``His attackers are among millions of Americans who constantly hear the message that gay people are not worthy of the most basic equal treatment''.
The Christian right, led by the Center for Reclaiming America in Fort Lauderdale, last summer bought a series of ads in major newspapers claiming that love and religious teaching will ``cure'' homosexuality.
The group plans to air similar television ads soon.
Last spring, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
, told a television interviewer that homosexuality is a sin and that gay people should be helped ``just like alcohol or sex addiction. . . or kleptomaniacs''.
Only 21 states, including California, have hate crime laws that include sexual orientation.
In Wyoming, three attempts to pass such laws have failed.
Lesbian and gay activists say that although polls show that most Americans favor nondiscrimination, their support can erode when laws don't protect gays, political leaders call them sinful and religious organizations say they can change if only they tried.
``There can be no stronger testament to how toxic the environment is that has been created by the extreme right than what happened to Matthew Shepard,'' said Kate Kendell of the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco.
``It is crystal clear to lesbians and gay men in this country that hate rhetoric is directly linked to this kind of violence''.
Statistics are not yet available for 1998, but hate crimes against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people increased nationally by 2 percent in 1997.
In high schools and colleges, violence against gays and lesbians gay youth increased a dramatic 34 percent, according to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs.
The increases appear to be a combination of both a jump in actual crimes as well as a growing readiness to report attacks.
In another study released earlier this year by the University of Washington, one in 10 community college students admitted to committing hate crimes against gays.
Some interviewed said an unwanted advance or flirtation was a legitimate reason for an assault.
``I don't know how much more it's going to take for the right to recognize their vitriolic rhetoric takes on actively violent overtones in the hands of certain individuals in this country,'' Kendell said.
Janet Folger, national director of the Center for Reclaiming America, called the young man's death ``reprehensible'' and said the ads were not to blame.
``The main cause of the increase in violence in this country is our having removed moral absolutes from our society and turning away from what God would have us do,'' Folger said.
``When certain elements in our society advocate that everyone should do what they want to do, without any consideration of God's laws, our society will regretfully become more violent''.
Shepard's death was a major topic of conversation in San Francisco.
At Castro and Market streets, the Castro rainbow flag was lowered to half-staff, and mourners left impromptu memorials.
San Francisco Supervisors Tom Ammiano and Mark Leno spoke briefly about the need for ending hate crimes.
``It's thrown into relief what I call the jihad against the gay community,'' Ammiano said, ``from Trent Lott to those ads to the fights against gay marriage''.
Next month, voters in Alaska and Hawaii will be asked to change their state constitutions to keep same-sex couples from marrying.
In March 2000, if a ballot petition submitted last month qualifies, Californians will vote on a law that bars gay marriages .
LARAMIE, Wyo.
(AP) --Jurors saw photographs of Matthew Shepard's bloody face as prosecutors began presenting their case against Aaron McKinney, accused of beating the gay student to death in a drunken, drug-induced rage.
They also saw pictures of the ponderosa pine fence where Shepard was left to die, his hands tied behind his back, and the pool of blood caused by more than a dozen blows as he fought his attackers.
Shepard's mother, Judy, dabbed her eyes when prosecutors showed jurors the graphic photos while McKinney's father, William, bowed his head.
McKinney barely glanced up.
``Matthew Shepard made a frail attempt to fight back,'' said prosecutor Cal Rerucha during opening statements Monday.
``McKinney struck him as hard as he could''.
Defense attorneys countered that McKinney, who faces the death penalty, didn't intend to kill Shepard when he and a friend accompanied Shepard from a Laramie bar after he asked McKinney for a ride home.
The 21-year-old University of Wyoming freshman was driven to a remote area, pistol-whipped and left overnight in near-freezing temperatures.
The defense portrayed McKinney as the victim of sexual abuse who lashed out when approached for a gay encounter.
McKinney's judgment that night was affected by alcohol, methamphetamines and ``some sexually traumatic and confusing events in his life,'' defense attorney Jason Tangeman told jurors.
Tangeman said McKinney, 22, was confused by homosexual encounters when he was younger.
In one case, McKinney was forced into an oral sex act with a neighborhood bully, Tangeman said.
``Did Matthew Shepard deserve to die?
No, that's ridiculous.
No manslaughter victim deserved to die,'' he said.
``That's what Aaron McKinney is guilty of --manslaughter''.
McKinney has been charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery.
The trial of the other man accused of the slaying that shocked the nation, Russell Henderson, ended in April just before a jury was seated.
Henderson pleaded guilty to felony murder and kidnapping and was sentenced to life in prison.
The plea allowed Henderson to avoid the death penalty.
On Monday, prosecutors called their first three witnesses: Aaron Kreifels, the college student who found Shepard; Charles Dolan, the neighbor who tried to help; and Albany County Deputy Reggie Fluty, who said she told the barely breathing victim, ``Baby, I'm so sorry this happened''.
Kreifels and Dolan described efforts to free Shepard from the fence, his hands tied to the bottom of a post.
Fluty said it appeared Shepard had been crying.
Shepard was taken to a hospital where he died five days later.
LARAMIE, Wyo.
(AP) --About 600 people gathered Sunday night for a candelight vigil honoring Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was fatally beaten and tied to a post a year ago.
``We on this campus, in Laramie and in Wyoming, are people of peace, of inclusiveness,'' the Rev.
Roger Schmit, of St.
Paul's Newman Center, told people on the University of Wyoming campus.
One of two men accused in the slaying, Aaron McKinney, 22, goes on trial Monday on charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery.
The other suspect, Russell Henderson, 22, pleaded guilty in April to felony murder and kidnapping and received two life sentences.
Shepard, 21, was lured from a bar Oct.
7, 1998, driven to a remote prairie, tied to a fence, pistol-whipped into unconsciousness and left to die on the freezing plains.
He died on Oct.
12, 1998, and McKinney's trial begins amid several memorials commemorating the one-year anniversary of his death.
SACRAMENTO, Calif.
_ California's hate crime law would get beefed up for murderers of gays, lesbians and the disabled under a measure approved by the Assembly with strong Republican support.
Current California law requires a sentence of life in prison without parole or the death penalty for anyone who deliberately sets out to kill someone because of race, color, religion or nationality.
A measure written by Assemblyman Wally Knox, a Democrat from Los Angeles, would add disability, gender and sexual orientation to that list with one important caveat: It would not give jurors the option of imposing the death penalty in such cases.
Because of his own objections and concerns from gays and lesbians, Knox's bill would instead increase the penalty from the current 25 years to life in prison, to life in prison without parole.
``The district attorneys literally were having cases where people confessed that they had murdered people because they were gay or lesbian, and could not charge them with special circumstances,'' Knox said.
His measure passed the Assembly Wednesday with a 55-17 vote and now moves to the Senate.
The bill got the support from some of the most conservative Republicans, who saw the legislation as tough on crime.
One Republican, Assemblyman Jim Cunneen of San Jose, offered an amendment Wednesday to add the death penalty to the bill, but was turned down by the Democrat-controlled Assembly.
Under the Knox bill, a prosecutor must prove the victim was intentionally killed because of his or her actual or ``perceived'' disability, gender or sexual orientation.
The bias must be an actual cause or substantial factor in prompting the killing.
The California Department of Justice said 10 people had been murdered in the state between 1995 and 1997 as a result of hate crimes, although a number for gay-related murders was not available.
There were 112 gay-related hate crimes, none of them murders, in San Francisco last year, according to the city Hate Crimes Unit.
Prompted in part by the murder of Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyo.
, last year, more than 450 bills have been introduced in legislatures around the country this year on issues important to gays and lesbians.
The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is tracking several in California, including a measure to protect gay and lesbian high school students from discrimination.
WASHINGTON _ Flanked by Republican lawmakers, the father of Matthew Shepard, a college student whose beating death stemmed from the fact that he was a homosexual, urged Congress Monday to adopt legislation that would extend federal hate-crime protection to gays and lesbians.
``We call upon the president and Congress to come together, put all differences aside and pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act,'' said Shepard's father Dennis at a news conference in front of the U.S.
Capitol. ``We urge our nation's leaders to take every possible action to end the violence that killed our son''.
The legislation ``will not end hatred and will not even stop hate crimes from happening,'' Shepard added.
``But it can reduce them by making it easier for our federal government to put resources into the hands of people best suited to combat these crimes _ local law enforcement agencies''.
Shepard's mother Judy stood by her husband but did not speak.
On Oct.
6, 1998, Aaron McKinney, 21, and Russell Henderson, 22, lured Matthew Shepard, 21, out of a bar, robbed him, beat him with a pistol and tied him to a fence on the outskirts of Laramie, Wyo.
He died five days later.
Both assailants were convicted and given double life sentences.
In July the Senate approved the legislation as part of an appropriations bill for the Commerce, Justice and State Departments, but the House did not.
Republican leaders dropped the measure entirely during a conference committee of House and Senate lawmakers.
Current federal law permits federal prosecution of a hate crime only if it is believed to be motivated by the victim's race, color, religion or national origin.
In addition, the assailant must have intended to prevent the victim from exercising a federally protected right, such as voting.
The new measure would add attacks against people because of their gender, sexual orientation or disabilities to the covered crimes while eliminating the protected-right requirement.
Thus, it would make federal prosecutions easier to pursue and relieve local jurisdictions from the financial burden of trying such prosecutions.
Speaking to reporters Monday shortly after the Capitol news conference, President Clinton said at the White House, ``We must pass strong hate-crimes legislation''.
He added, ``I want to express my personal appreciation'' to the Shepards for coming here to lobby for the measure.
At the Capitol briefing, Sen.
James Jeffords, R-Vt.
, pressed his colleagues to adopt the measure before lawmakers adjourn in the next several days.
He cited reports that hate crimes against gays and lesbians are on the rise.
``It can be done, and it must be done,'' Jeffords said.
Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore.
, who assessed the chances of passage at ``50-50,'' said gays and lesbians need federal protection.
``Some crimes are so odious that an extra measure of protection is demanded by us so that (they) can never again be repeated among us.
``Never again should we in the federal government withhold our help and stand idly when a Matthew Shepherd is tied to a fence, beaten and left to die because he is gay,'' Smith added.
He accused Republican opponents of the measure of blockig its passage ``because it has to do with the issue of homosexuality, and many people are uncomfortable with that''.
Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla.
, issued a challenge to GOP colleagues who oppose abortion rights.
``If you are really pro-life as you say so often in so many debates, then prove it in this case _ that you are...
pro-every human life,'' he said.
Another speaker at the news conference, Robert DeBree, an Albany, Wyo.
, sheriff's detective, said that after McKinney was found guilty last week of robbing, kidnapping and murdering Shepard, he went back to a detention center and ``was smiling and laughing'' as he watched news reports of himself on television.
DeBree added, ``We have to got to send a message somewhere, and it has to begin here.
Congress, please pass this''.
Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have hate-crime laws that include sexual orientation while 20 have hate-crime laws that do not.
Eight states have no hate crimes laws.
In addition to meeting with lawmakers, Dennis and Judy Shepard met Monday with White House Chief of Staff John Podesta and Attorney General Janet Reno.
On Tuesday, Dennis Shepard said, he will try to meet with Senate Majority Leader Sen.
Trent Lott, R-Miss .
The moment of truth is fast approaching in the politicized quarrel over a national missile defense.
President Clinton has said he will decide this summer whether to build a phased system to protect against several dozen long-range missiles.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, after pocketing the Duma's ratification of START II and passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, has warned that if the United States withdraws from the 1972 ABM Treaty to build the missile defense, ``We will withdraw not only from the START II treaty, but from the whole system of treaties on limitation and control of strategic and conventional weapons''.
The stakes could not be greater.
The $60 billion system contemplated by Clinton risks undoing nuclear weapons cooperation with Moscow and might also compel Beijing to expand and modernize China's basic deterrent force of about 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.
What would follow, arms control specialists fear, would be a chain reaction of nuclear weapons proliferation.
India would probably not be able to resist pressure to deploy its nuclear missiles and match a Chinese build-up, and Pakistan would be almost certain to follow suit.
Even Japan could be tempted to use its stockpile of fissile material to join the Asian nuclear-weapons club.
The argument for national missile defense is more compelling than was President Reagan's old ``star wars'' concept.
Instead of trying to defend the United States against the full panoply of Soviet rocketry _ a clearly impossible task _ the system would be a defense against only one or two missiles fired by a rogue state such as North Korea or Libya.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said that the system would not and could not be a defense against Russia and therefore would not upset the deterrent value of the mutually assured destruction concept.
Three of the four criteria Clinton has said he will consider when making his decision on the system are: the scope of the threat to be countered, the effect on nonproliferation, and the cost.
The first cannot be accurately calculated.
No one knows what rogue states might conceive of, and those in favor of the system suggest it could act as a deterrent.
The effect on nonproliferation could be dire, but it ultimately depends on how the project is presented.
As for cost, the government has already squandered about $60 billion in the vain pursuit of the ``star wars'' vision of missile defense that Ronald Reagan was willing to fund.
Members of the current Joint Chiefs of Staff, who are unenthusiastic about the latest proposal for a missile defense system, have to worry that other, more tangible military needs may get short shrift if the politically driven system is funded for the coming decade.
Clinton's fourth criterion is technological feasibility.
Independent scientists and weapons designers who have analyzed the system say it can be overcome, relatively cheaply, by countermeasures that are readily available to any state capable of deploying a long-range ballistic missile.
Chemical or biological agents could be delivered in warheads that release large numbers of bomblets, or submunitions, that would overwhelm the interceptors of the system.
Nuclear warheads inside mylar balloons could be hidden among hundreds of similar balloons serving as decoys.
The sensors of the current missile defense system are not able to distinguish decoy balloons from those that contain nuclear warheads.
Moreover, the system that Clinton is to decide on this summer has not been tested against realistic countermeasures.
There is no evidence that the first phase of the system, planned to become operational in 2005, could cope with decoys or simple cooling shrouds on incoming warheads.
Plus, there have been no real-world tests to determine whether the full system, scheduled to be completed about 2010, could distinguish an empty radar-reflecting balloon from one with a nuclear warhead in it.
In addition, a missile launched against the United States would be easily tracked from its point of origin, and there would be no doubt from whence it came.
A nation making such an attack could expect instant destruction.
No presidential decision to deploy a national missile defense should be taken until the system proves, in tests analyzed by disinterested scientists, that it cannot be defeated by countermeasures that must be anticipated from any state capable of delivering a ballistic missile to these shores.
Perhaps in the years to come, a workable national missile defense system will be developed.
But there is no such thing in existence today, and an unworkable national missile defense system threatens to make Americans less, not more, secure from long-range missiles.
The true challenges of creating a national missile defense should be debated in the coming presidential campaign.
Research should continue on missile defense, and a commission of distinguished, independent scientists should be established to assess future tests against real-world countermeasures.
But for the present, national missile defense is simply not a viable defense option.
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) --The U.S. military will conduct the eighth test of an anti-missile defense system in New Mexico State in the country Tuesday morning after seven successive test failures, the Defense Department announced Monday.
The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile is being developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation to track and collide with attacking enemy warheads in flight.
Tuesday's test, postponed two weeks ago when a target missile went out of control, will be conducted over White Sands, New Mexico State, missile test range, Pentagon officials said.
THAAD is designed to protect troops and bases from medium-range ballistic missile attack.
Despite the failures to date, Pentagon insists that much is learned from each test whether or not the intercept takes place.
The most recent test was aborted May 25 when a Hera target --a converted Minuteman missile -- tumbled out of control shortly after launch.
The THAAD missile, designed to collide with and shatter enemy ballistic missiles, was not launched.
The Defense Department cited a number of reasons for the THAAD system's failures so far, including problems with the target-seeking system on the interceptor rocket.
WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) --A U.S. prototype missile interceptor streaked into space on Tuesday night in search of a mock warhead launched from an Air Force base in California, but failed to hit the target, the U.S.
Defense Department said.
The failure is an apparent setback in the Pentagon's drive to develop a national missile defense (NMD) system.
The interceptor rocket was launched from a U.S.
Army missile range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 20 minutes after the target missile lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 9:19 p.m.
EST (0219 GMT on Wednesday) and headed over the Pacific Ocean.
WASHINGTON (AP) --Legislation approved Thursday by the House and sent to the White House would commit the United States to an anti-missile national defense system.
President Clinton was expected to sign the measure, which the Senate modified to meet administration objections.
The legislation, passed 345-71, states that it is the policy of the United States to deploy, as soon as technologically possible, an effective system capable of defending U.S. territory against limited ballistic missile attack.
It also states there will be continued negotiations with Russia on arms reductions.
Russia has opposed construction of a U.S. missile defense system, saying it violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
The administration has said it will not decide until June 2000 on firm plans for an anti-missile system.
Clinton vetoed similar legislation in 1995.
He also opposed an earlier House version passed March, saying it did not make clear that the defense system would be limited and focused against threats from rogue states rather than existing nuclear powers.
The Senate changed the bill to reflect those concerns and the House agreed to the revised version Thursday, despite some reluctance by supporters of the original House plan ``I'm not happy with the legislation,'' said Rep.
Curt Weldon, R-Pa.
, chief sponsor of the House version.
The changes, he said ``are simply cover for liberal Democrats who don't support missile defense''.
Weldon and Rep.
Floyd Spence, R-S.C.
, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said it should be clear that when the president signs the bill he is changing U.S. policy and committing the nation to a national defense system.
``The threat of ballistic missile attack is real, and it is here today,'' Spence said.
But Rep.
Norman Dicks of Washington, a leading Democratic defense expert, cited military testimony that it will be at least 2005 before tests can determine whether a credible defense system can be build.
``We ought to be very sober about any of these exhortations...
from people who want to wish this into existence''.
The administration has budgeted $10.5 billion between 1999 and 2005 to develop a limited national missile defense system.
It became more positive toward eventual deployment of such a system after North Korea last year tested missiles that flew over Japan.
The system envisioned by both Congress and the White House is a scaled-back version of the space-based Strategic Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars'' program, proposed by President Reagan in 1983.
Reagan's plan was aimed mainly at stopping an attack from the former Soviet Union, while current research is designed more to stop a limited attack from a rogue or terrorist state.
It would not be space-based .
LONDON (AP) --Britain should push the United States to halt plans for its national missile defense system, a parliament committee on foreign affairs recommended Tuesday.
The missile defense program is a $60 billion system that would allow the United States to destroy incoming warheads.
Critics of the system argue that the program would increase Britain's vulnerability to attack without offering coverage by the U.S. defensive screen.
The Foreign Affairs Committee into Weapons of Mass Destruction recommended that the government urge the United States ''to seek other ways of reducing the threats it perceives,'' rather than try the missile shield.
The bi-partisan committee in its report said it was not convinced that the missile defense program ''represents an appropriate response to the proliferation problems faced by the international community''.
It also questioned the program's feasibility, noting that two out of three tests on the system didn't work.
The lawmakers also warned that Russia and China opposed the program, which could be ''dangerously destabilizing''.
The Pentagon has set a target date of 2005 for having a national missile defense ready for use.
WASHINGTON (AP) --The Clinton administration has selected Alaska as the likely first site for its proposed anti-ballistic missile defense network.
State Department spokesman James Rubin, who announced the decision Wednesday, said the administration won't decide whether to deploy a missile defense until next summer.
Rubin spoke as U.S. and Russian officials in Moscow opened two days of negotiations on the terms under which a missile defense could be established.
In 1972, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed in the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty not to construct a national defense against such missiles.
The theory was that leaving both sides vulnerable deterred nuclear attacks because either country would face deadly retaliation.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott on Wednesday began two days of talks with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov on reducing nuclear stockpiles and possibly changing the treaty.
Defense Secretary William Cohen also is expected to discuss the issue with his Russian counterpart on a trip to Moscow next Monday and Tuesday.
Russia, hard pressed financially to create its own anti-missile defense, is reluctant to make the change.
But the United States wants to modify the treaty so it can build a limited defense against attack by rogue states, such as North Korea.
``The president has made some decisions that will enable us to begin engaging Russia now on changes on the ABM treaty that would be necessary if we seek to deploy a limited national missile defense system,'' Rubin said.
President Boris Yeltsin agreed in June to discuss ABM modifications, but Russian officials continue to insist that an anti-missile defense system in the United States would tilt the strategic balance and start a new arms race.
Washington argues the system would not upset strategic stability because it would not be effective against a massive attack of the kind Russia is capable of launching.
WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's proposed national missile defense system could be fooled by simple decoys or other countermeasures easily within the grasp of any nation able to launch a nuclear warhead at the United States, a team of prominent scientists said Tuesday.
The scientists, including several who have served in the past on Defense Department research panels, said that the government should delay any decision on whether to proceed with a missile-defense network, which is expected to cost $30 billion.
``We could see a lot of ways to get around this system and we presumed that if a country was able to mount a missile attack against the United States it was also able to use these well-known countermeasures to confuse or overwhelm this system,'' said Andrew Sessler of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
The study by 11 physicists and engineers was done by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Union of Concerned Scientists.
The scientists based their calculations on nonclassified information describing the complete missile defense system from the Pentagon and other agencies.
The scientists questioned why the Pentagon is waiting until 2005 _ at least five years after President Clinton has said that he will decide whether to put such a system into operation _ to test whether its system would be fooled by realistic countermeasures.
The initial proposed system of 100 anti-missile missiles, ground radar and satellites is meant to protect the nation from a limited nuclear attack or an accidental launching.
In their report, the scientists argued that if the North Koreans were sophisticated enough to build an intercontinental ballistic missile that could threaten the United States, they were clever enough to use countermeasures such as balloon decoys or an aluminum shield that could cool a nuclear warhead and thereby deceive an interceptor.
The Pentagon called the study's findings premature, saying that the missile defense system is in the early development stage and that the main focus for now remains hitting a target, not defeating countermeasures.
``It's a prototype and you have to walk before you run,'' said Mike Biddle, spokesman at the National Missile Defense Office.
In two preliminary tests of the system, the anti-missile missile or kill vehicle was able to hit a mock warhead only once.
As a result, the Pentagon has delayed a third test until June before Clinton decides whether to approve the system.
``We are arguing to defer the decision until there has been more research and development, and tests of various systems using real world conditions,'' said Lisbeth Gronlund, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The panel studied several potential methods that an enemy might use to defeat the missile shield, including shiny mylar plastic balloons, like the kind sold in grocery stores, which the scientists said could easily fool the defense system.
A government intelligence report made public last September acknowledged that emerging missile states were capable of using decoys.
But Biddle said that, based on classified intelligence information, the Pentagon is confident that the defense system will work against against any challenges or countermeasures that could be mustered by the year 2005.
The scientists said that a missile defense system might also be confused if an enemy enclosed a warhead in an aluminum shield cooled by liquid nitrogen, foiling the heat-seeking sensors on the anti-missile missiles sent to destroy the warhead.
``In this defense system the attacker always has the advantage,'' said George Lewis a panel member from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) --The Republicans in the U.S.
Congress have been blocked by Democrats in their efforts for a legislation to deploy a nationwide ballistic missile defense system by 2003, Congress sources said today.
By a party-line vote of 53-46 Tuesday, the U.S.
Senate fell short of the votes needed to end a Democratic filibuster against the missile defense legislation sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.
A total of 60 votes were needed to end the debate and bring on a vote on the Defend America Act calling for the deployment of the defense system.
Republicans argued during the Senate debate that a national missile defense system is needed now because of the growing threat of missile attacks on the U.S. targets.
But Democrats expressed their support for the U.S. administration's stance on the issue.
President Bill Clinton has said that he favors a national missile defense but does not believe that the system should be deployed now because the threat of missile attack is remote.
Democrats said that the missile defense system would be too costly and undermine the strategic arms treaties with Russia.
A recent Congressional Budget Office study estimated that the missile defense system would cost as much as 60 billion U.S. dollars at its first stage.
The estimate has prompted the House Republican leaders to pull their version of the bill, sponsored by House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
Under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the United States and Russia are limited to build a single ballistic missile defense system.
Russia has deployed its system around Moscow.
The United States has no defense against a long-range missile.
The Pentagon is still working on an estimate, but its most recent estimate last spring put the tally at $36 billion for a system with 100 missile interceptors at a single site, in Alaska.
The figure covers the building and operating of the system for its expected life of 20 years.
The General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, estimates it will cost $60 billion if --as many missile defense proponents urge -- the system is expanded to two interceptor sites, each with 100 interceptors.
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) --A U.S. anti-missile missile failed Monday for the sixth time to hit a flying target, a defense official said.
It was not immediately known why the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense missile failed to intercept the target missile Monday morning, said Bob Hunt, spokesman for the Army program executive office for air and missile defense in Huntsville, Alabama State.
"The telemetry data is still coming in and they're still analyzing it," Hunt said.
The test was the ninth in a series of 13 flight tests for the THAAD missile program and the sixth attempt at intercepting a missile.
The system has cost 3.8 billion U.S. dollars so far.
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) --U.S.
Defense Department said Wednesday that it would continue testing its costly anti-missile defense system despite five consecutive test failures.
"We're bound to have failures," Defense Secretary William Cohen told a Senate defense subcommittee Wednesday, a day after the fifth straight failure of test on the system.
Cohen said "technology can be very complicated".
But he added that Pentagon would press forward with the 15 billion U.S. dollar program.
The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) failed to intercept a target ballistic missile during a test at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.
"Preliminary investigation indicates that the THAAD missile lost control shortly after launch," the Pentagon said in a written statement.
"The missile impacted on the White Sands Missile Range about two miles north of the launch site".
The missile system, built by Lockheed Martin Corp.
, is designed to protect troops in the field from attack by Scud and other short- and medium-range missiles.
It is supposed to be an improvement on the Patriot missile system.
President Bill Clinton's budget request for missile defense seeks 822 million dollars for continued testing and development of THAAD next year and the House National Security Committee has endorsed that figure.
The Army wants to begin buying 40 interceptor missiles as a first installment on a system that is projected to cost 15 billion dollars to acquire and 18 billion dollars to operate over 20 years, the Associated Press reported Wednesday.
India's nuclear tests in the last couple of days backed Republican lawmakers' call for a national missile defense system.
They cited India's nuclear tests as fresh evidence of the need for such a program.
WASHINGTON (AP) --Revised estimates of nuclear missile capability, particularly of North Korea and Iran, add new urgency to development of a national missile defense system, the Clinton administration's top arms-control official said.
``Cold war disciplines are gone.
Technology is more widely available,'' John Holum, acting undersecretary of state for arms control and international security affairs, told a Senate confirmation hearing.
House Republican leaders were to rally on the steps of the Capitol today to applaud President Clinton's signing of a GOP-sponsored bill committing the United States to a national ballistic missile defense against limited attack, as might be launched by a small nuclear power.
Since Congress passed that bill in May, two developments have occurred on the missile-defense front: --ussian President Boris Yeltsin agreed, for the first time, to consider reopening the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to consider easing that prohibition against either American or Russian nationwide ballistic missile defense systems.
--fter six straight failures, a $3.8 billion experimental missile defense system scored its first hit in a test at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, shooting down an incoming test rocket.
Holum, in testimony Monday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, voiced strong support for deploying a missile defense system.
He said a 1998 report by a panel headed by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had ``a profound impact'' on Clinton administration policy.
The Rumsfeld panel concluded that North Korea and Iran could develop long-range missiles within five years and probably are secretly doing so.
Even if a missile defense is outlawed by the 1972 ABM treaty, national interest dictates that the United States move ahead in planning for such a system anyway, Holum said, echoing views of Republican members of the committee.
The threat of a nuclear attack by a small power ``is clearly very prominent'' as an area of concern, far more so than just a few years ago, Holum said.
President Clinton vetoed an earlier bill committing the nation to a missile-defense system.
But in a compromise with congressional Republicans, he agreed this year to support similar legislation, the bill he signed.
``In light of new estimates on the ballistic missile threat, in particular from North Korea and Iran, national missile defense is now closer to becoming another integral part of our strategy against proliferation,'' Holum testified.
Holum appeared at a nomination hearing to be the first person to serve in the new post.
He had served since 1993 as director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, but the agency went out of business on April 1 when its functions were merged with the State Department.
The panel was expected to approve the nomination, perhaps as early as Wednesday, when it also votes on the nomination of Richard Holbrooke to be U.N. ambassador.
The administration says it will make decisions on details of a missile defense system next June.
Rather than blindly follow the ABM restrictions, Holum said, ``I believe our missile defense should be geared toward threat.''
WASHINGTON (AP) --It would be far cheaper and quicker to deploy a sea-based national missile defense system than to build one on land as envisioned by the Clinton administration, a group of conservative defense analysts said in a report Wednesday.
``We need to act now,'' declared Henry Cooper Jr.
, chairman of the Heritage Foundation study and former director of Pentagon anti-missile programs during the Bush administration.
Cooper listed the growing ballistic missile threat from countries such as North Korea and Iran as a reason for ``urgency'' on the matter.
The Heritage Commission on Missile Defense, which included 14 retired officers and defense and political officials who served mostly in Republican administrations, accused the current White House of failing to make missile defense a national priority.
President Clinton, however, is seeking a major increase in spending for national missile defense, urging Congress to approve $6.6 billion over the next five years for program development.
A land-based national missile defense system, under study by the Clinton administration, would cost an estimated $10.5 billion to build and, if approved, wouldn't be deployed until 2005.
The 77-page Heritage report concluded that a sea-based system to defend U.S. cities and shores from enemy missiles would cost less than $8 billion and take only about four years to deploy.
The system would include 650 missile interceptors on the Navy's 22 Aegis cruisers and destroyers now on patrol around the world as well as space-based sensors to detect incoming missiles and relay tracking data.
A Pentagon report, however, has estimated it would cost $19 billion to expand the Navy's Aegis fleet to become roving missile defense systems to protect the 50 U.S. states as well as American troops overseas.
Navy Capt.
Michael Doubleday, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Defense Department had no comment on the Heritage Foundation findings.
The Navy already has spent $1 billion developing a so-called theater missile defense system to protect ships and troops from regional threats, mostly from short- and medium-range missiles.
But it could take up to 10 years to perfect a system for shooting a missile out of the sky.
In fact, major technological hurdles have prevented the Navy, the Air Force and the Army from actually building a system that can defend against anything but short-range and slow-moving cruise missiles.
It could take years before scientists and the defense industry build a system capable of striking a high-altitude, intercontinental missile.
The Clinton administration hasn't decided to deploy a national missile defense system, partly because it would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow.
Critics say the ABM treaty is no longer valid because it was negotiated between the United States and the former Soviet Union, not Russia.
WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) --The United States Defense Department on Thursday awarded a research and development contract to Seattle's Boeing Co.
to coordinate a missile-defense system, Defense Secretary William Cohen announced.
Under the 1.6 billion dollar contract, Boeing will design, develop, test and integrate a variety of components for a space-age "National Missile Defense" (NMD) to guard the nation against ballistic missile attack.
During the research, Boeing will design a system of ground-based interceptor missiles and space-based satellites for missile launch detection and communications.
They will be tied together with a sophisticated battle management control.
If the system works, the Pentagon could make a decision to deploy it in 2003.
The Pentagon said the value of the contract could eventually reach 5.2 billion dollars if the system works and moves towards deployment.
The NMD, emerging from former U.S. president Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" program, is to stop a smaller or accidental attack by another country against the United States.
The United States has spent billions of dollars on nuclear missile defense since Reagan put up his plan more than a decade ago, but little success has been achieved.
The U.S. military is also trying to develop an even more limited Theater Missile Defense (TMD) program to protect troops and bases from missile attack around the world.
But that program has experienced four successive failures.
However, Cohen said the United States was making "great progress" towards solving the technological problems involved in producing a national missile defense system.
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) --The U.S.
Defense Department announced Thursday that it will skip a planned third test of an anti-missile missile.
The decision gives the Army a tentative go-ahead to move into the next phase of development of the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system that is the centerpiece of the Pentagon's effort to provide missile protection abroad for U.S. and allied troops and their staging areas.
The main reason for moving ahead with THAAD after two successes instead of three is to force the missile contractor, Lockheed Martin, to focus on the missile interceptor that will actually be fielded, rather than the prototype used thus far, said Peter Franklin, deputy director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
Franklin said the two successful tests this summer have "proven" that the missile works.
Critics, however, said after the second successful test in August that the THAAD system should be tested against faster, more capable missiles than the Hera rockets used in testing at White Sands Missile Range.
He said a final decision will be made next year on beginning the next phase of the project, in which Lockheed Martin will translate the design work done thus far into a missile that will enter initial low-rate production.
The Pentagon is scheduled to begin fielding the THAAD system in 2007.
Franklin did not say whether skipping the final flight test will enable it to be fielded earlier than that.
The Defense Department has spent about 4 billion U.S. dollars on THAAD so far.
Skipping the final flight test will save 15 million U.S. dollars.
Last year, the Pentagon said it would require Lockheed Martin to validate its design by scoring three successful intercepts.
The missile had failed in its first six attempts to shoot down a mock warhead, but it recorded its first success on June 10 this year, followed by another August 2.
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) --The U.S. military today tested over the Pacific Ocean a sensor designed to detect and track incoming nuclear missiles, the Defense Department said.
A rocket carrying an optical sensor and data system was fired from Kwajalein Missile Range in the Marshall Islands for the test under the national missile defense program, it said.
The sensor, built by Boeing Company, located dummy warhead targets from a Minuteman-2 missile launched 21 minutes earlier from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.
Now in its initial test stage, the sensor is designed to be mounted on small rockets to collide with enemy nuclear warheads once they are identified and tracked.
The Defense Department planned to develop weapons for a national missile defense system by 1999 and then to decide whether to deploy it within three years.
Defense Secretary William Cohen has announced plans to spend an additional 2 billion dollars on the multi-billion missile defense program over the next five years.
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) --The U.S. military successfully tested an anti-missile defense system Thursday by destroying a missile with another one high over New Mexico State, the Defense Department said.
"It was a successful intercept," a Pentagon official said.
The U.S.
Army's Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile hit and destroyed a Hera test rocket in flight over White Sands, New Mexico State.
The success followed six consecutive failure attempts.
The THAAD is being developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation to track and collide with attacking enemy warheads in flight.
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) --The United States will restructure its ballistic missile defense (BMD) programs and place its highest priority on developing the next generation of Patriot missile defense system and lower tier Navy anti-missile system, the Pentagon said today.
The restructure decision came after a six-month study of BMD programs led by U.S.
Defense Undersecretary Paul Kaminski, U.S.
Defense Secretary William Perry told reporters at a Pentagon conference presenting the review.
Kaminski said that some 450 million U.S. dollars will be added to the next generation of Patriot PAC-3 missile system and Navy Area Defense (lower-tier) system.
The first generation of Patriot missile defense system was widely used in the U.S.
Gulf War operations in 1991 to knock down Iraqi scud missiles soaring into neighboring countries.
The U.S.
Navy system is designed to have similar coverage but operates from Aegis cruisers.
Perry said that the development of the two missile defense systems will meet the need for countering potential short-range missile threats against the United States.
However, the study says that the Pentagon should not deploy a national missile defense system until 2008.
The Republican-controlled Congress has been pressing for such a system to be deployed by 2003.
Perry said that the Pentagon has planned to take some 2 billion U.S. dollars away from the BMD programs and to use them to buy more urgent military equipment such as tanks, jet fighters and trucks.
WASHINGTON _ In a second straight success, an experimental theater missile defense system intercepted a target missile Monday at a New Mexico test site, prompting the Pentagon to predict that the missile will graduate to its second stage of development next year.
The $3.9 billion Theater High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, has been plagued with problems, and it failed six earlier tests.
It intercepted its first target in June.
One failed test in March led the Pentagon to impose $15 million in penalties against the developer, Lockheed Martin, and members of Congress had asked the Pentagon to find another contractor.
Monday's test involved the missile's ability to hit its first target outside the earth's atmosphere as well as hitting a separated warhead for the first time, said Jennifer Canaff of the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
Ms. Canaff said Monday's test was more difficult because the cooling of the target in outer space reduced the ability of the missile's infrared sensors to detect it.
Approved in the early 1990s, the program to create a mobile ground missile defense system against medium-range ballistic missiles would be used overseas, if it is ultimately deployed.
China has protested American plans to create theater missile defense systems with Japan, South Korea and possibly Taiwan to protect allied and American troops based in northeast Asia.
Several independent scientists questioned the importance of Monday's tests and said that until the missile system was tested against targets that more closely simulate those in war, the results were going to be misleading.
``You've got to test against realistic targets that actively try to evade the defense system _ simulate real world targets _ and not just hit missiles on a test range,'' said Tom Collina, director of the arms control program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Washington watchdog group.
Officials at Lockheed Martin say those tests will come in the next engineering and manufacturing phase of development.
But the missile defense system must still pass one of two final tests to be held in September and next February before it can move to that phase.
SYDNEY, Australia (AP) --Iran's weekend test of a long-range missile underscored the need for a U.S. national missile defense system, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Monday.
Iran tested its Shahab-3 ballistic missile, with a range of 800 miles, on Saturday.
Tehran is developing a longer-range Shahab-4, which it claims will be used to carry satellites into space and not for military purposes.
The test ''is one of the reasons why it is important for the United States to undertake to research, develop and potentially deploy a national missile defense system that would provide protection against countries such as Iran posing a threat to the United States,'' Cohen said on the last day of a three-day visit to Australia.
U.S. defense authorities are developing a multibillion dollar national missile defense system, but Washington has not yet approved its deployment.
The United States also would look to Australia to play a role in the missile defense system if and when it is approved, Cohen said.
Australian Defense Minister John Moore said Australia would consider a request for participation if the system gets the go-ahead.
But that expectation could prove unfounded if the opposition Labor Party wins federal elections expected by late next year.
Labor is opposed to Australian participation in the scheme.
The two countries jointly run the Pine Gap satellite tracking center in central Australia and that secretive facility would likely be used to track missiles as part of the U.S. missile defense system.
The ministers were speaking after the two countries agreed to share new defense technology and cooperate on its development --an agreement that gives Australia enhanced access to U.S. military research.
Moore said the agreement would be of particular benefit to Australia's troubled fleet of six Collins Class submarines, which have been plagued by technical problems ranging from periscope malfunctions to excessive noise and vibration, as well as problems in computer defense systems.
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) --U.S.
President Bill Clinton today voiced opposition to building a costly new national missile defense system that the Republican-controlled U.S.
Congress has been advocating.
In a commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut, Clinton said that the Republicans's proposal "would force us to choose a costly missile defense as long-range missile attacks on the United States is extremely remote".
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry told reporters earlier in the week that the so-called the rogue nations could not build long-range missiles against the United States in at least 15 years.
It makes little sense to build a system now "before we know the details and dimension of the threat we face," Clinton said.
The U.S.
Congress has insisted that the United States should develop and deploy a national missile defense system by 2003.
It has proposed to add billions of U.S. dollars to the Pentagon budget in the fiscal years of 1995 and 1996.
Last year Clinton vetoed the defense legislation that contained a national missile defense program, expressing concern that it could violate a 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty with Russia.
WASHINGTON, May 12 (Xinhua) --The Pentagon's fifth missile defense system failed to intercept a target on Tuesday, the Defense Department said in a statement.
The test on the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD system, was done at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.
The missile, built by Lockhead Martin Corp.
, lost control shortly after launch, the statement said.
It appeared to be caused by a booster rocket problem.
The missile hit the missile range about three kilometers north of the launch site.
The interceptor missile and target debris landed on the missile range, the statement said.
The test at 7:20 a.m.
EDT was the eighth overall for the THAAD and the fifth involving an actual missile flight and attempted intercept.
The THAAD system is designed to provide U.S. forces in the field protection from attack by Scud and other short- and medium-range missiles.
It is to provide broader defensive coverage than the Patriot missile system.
The program, emerging from former U.S.
President Ronald Reagon's "Star War" plan 15 years ago, was to be deployed in three years if necessary.
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) --A U.S. prototype missile interceptor streaked into space on Saturday morning in search of a mock warhead launched from Vandenberg Air Force base in California State, but failed to hit the target, the U.S.
Defense Department said.
The failure is an apparent setback in the Pentagon's dive to develop a National Missile Defense (NMD) system.
The interceptor missile was launched from a U.S.
Army missile range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 20 minutes after the target missile lifted off from Vandenberg and headed over the Pacific Ocean.
WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) --The U.S.
Army scratched Tuesday's test flight of an antimissile missile because of a problem with the one that was to serve as its target.
The Hera target missile --a modified Minuteman 2 -- was fired from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico State of the United States.
The Army had planned to launch a Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile to knock the target missile out of the sky.
It was not immediately known what the problem was, said Jim Eckles, a White Sands Missile Range spokesman.
The THAAD missile had failed in six previous flights to hit flying targets.
The system has cost at least 3.8 billion U.S. dollars.
The Defense Department charged Lockheed Martin Corporation, the maker of the antimissile system, a 15-million-U.S.-dollar penalty for not achieving a hit during a March 29 test as required by its 15 billion U.S. dollars contract.
The THAAD is designed to strike enemy missiles fired from at least 800 miles away _ the kinds of weapons nations such as Iran, North Korea and Pakistan are developing, raising the threat to U.S. troops and allies overseas.
The antimissile missile has technology that is the most sophisticated military weaponry, and it would contribute to development of a system that could protect the United States.
WASHINGTON (AP) --The Pentagon conducted two tests Thursday of important elements of the proposed national missile defense system in preparation for another attempt to shoot down a target in space.
In the first test, a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.
, released 20 objects in flight to test the ability of a prototype ground-based radar to distinguish among them.
In a real missile intercept mission, the radar's role would be to keep an intercepting missile on a collision path with its target and not allow it to be fooled by decoys around the target.
The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, the Pentagon office in charge of the program, said preliminary indications are that the prototype radar successfully distinguished among the 20 objects in space.
The radar is situated on Kwajalein Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean.
In the second test, conducted about two hours after the first, also involved a Minuteman III missile launched from Vandenberg.
It was designed to test elements of the national missile defense system --such as an ''in-flight interceptor communication system'' used to send information from the ground radar to the interceptor missile -- that will be used in the next attempt to shoot down a mock warhead in space.
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said that next test is expected to be conducted early next year.
Until recently that test was scheduled for November, but the timing has slipped due to technical problems.
The two previous intercept attempts failed, most recently in July.
On Sept.
1, President Clinton announced that more testing was needed before he could have enough confidence in the technical feasibility of national missile defense to authorize the start of construction.
Clinton said it would be up to the next president to decide whether and when to go ahead.
His decision effectively ended missile defense supporters' hope of having a system ready for use by 2005.
Bacon said Thursday's tests show that the Pentagon is moving ahead with development work even though deployment has been put off.
''We're on our normal schedule to continue development of a national missile defense system,'' he said.

WASHINGTON _ Surrounded by organizers of Sunday's so-called Million Mom March for tougher gun laws, Sen.
Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill Tuesday to require buyers of handguns and certain semiautomatic weapons to get licenses.
``When you want to hunt, you get a hunting license; when you want to fish, you get a fishing license, but when you want a gun, no license is required,'' the California Democrat said at a news conference announcing her proposal.
Feinstein said the legislation is needed because each day 80 people, including 12 children, are killed by guns in the United States.
She said she does not expect her measure to pass this year but predicted it will be buoyed by the tens of thousands of mothers who plan to demonstrate on Mother's Day in the nation's capital and 67 other cities against gun violence.
Under Feinstein's proposal current owners of handguns and semiautomatic firearms that can use detachable ammunition clips would have up to 10 years to get licenses.
Buyers of new guns would pay a $25 fee to a firearms dealer or a state-certified entity to get licenses.
Applicants would have to provide their date and place of birth.
They would also have to pass a background check and a written firearm-safety test and sign a pledge to keep weapons safely stored.
Sen. Frank R.
Lautenberg, D-N.J.
, the chief co-sponsor of the measure, said the Senate ``does not have enough votes to pass sensible gun control legislation'' because of the power of the National Rifle Association.
But he asked, ``What could be a better fight?
A mother has to know that her kids are safe.
Why shouldn't we be able to get some action in this place''?
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
, said gun control advocates ``cannot allow those people who are against what we're trying to do to paralyze us, to freeze us in place''.
Feinstein said only one lobby can stand up to the NRA _ women.
She said the Million Mom March is just ``the beginning of an effort to mobilize women''.
The senator said that ``for years we've been hearing from gun owners who say they have rights''.
She added, `We have rights to walk down the street and not get shot''.
Donna Dees-Thomases of Short Falls, N.J., founder of the Million Mom March, said Feinstein's gun-licensing legislation is her top priority.
``We put that on our agenda since day one,'' she said.
The organization also favors gun registration.
Dees-Thomases said she expects at least 150,000 mothers to demonstrate in Washington, D.C.
Sunday. She also predicted that tens of thousands of women, including large numbers of ``stroller-moms'' with young children, will turn out to protest in Denver, Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles.
She said the main objective of the march is to urge women to find out how their lawmakers are voting on gun control legislation.
``This is about mothers taking responsibility for themselves,'' she said.
The march organizers are also pushing for passage of gun control measures in the so-called juvenile justice bill, passed in different forms by both houses of Congress last year.
The legislation has been stalled in a conference committee for more than 10 months.
The most controversial part of the stalled bill is a measure that would require that private dealers at gun shows check the backgrounds of would-be firearm buyers.
The legislation would also require safety locks on handguns, ban the sale of assault weapons to minors and stop the import of high capacity ammunition clips.

STOCKTON, Calif.
_ Sen.
Barbara Boxer is fighting to re-establish what some analysts say could be her greatest asset in her race for re-election: incumbency.
In a campaign swing through California's fertile Central Valley, the Democratic incumbent reminded voters of her service in Washington over the past six years.
``We did a lot together,'' Boxer told 50 supporters Thursday at an event in Stockton highlighting her support for the 1994 crime bill, which provided funding for 173 new police officers in that city.
``I want to keep us working together''.
The trip comes as a new poll by the Los Angeles Times shows Boxer pulling slightly ahead of her Republican opponent, state Treasurer Matt Fong, by 5 percentage points, 49 percent to 44 percent, among those likely to vote in the Nov.
3 election.
That is seen as less a sign of a newfound popularity for Boxer than proof the negative commercials she has begun running against Fong on issues like abortion and the environment are cutting into his support.
Some political observers have criticized Boxer for doing little in her race against Fong to remind voters that she is a sitting senator at a time when the economy is solid, crime is down and voters are generally content.
``She needs to focus on what she has delivered for California,'' said Barbara O'Connor, communications professor at California State University in Sacramento.
``She needs to highlight what she's been able to bring home''.
With just days before the election, both Boxer and Fong are crisscrossing the state.
Each is still furiously raising money in order to plaster voters with expensive, last-minute television commercials.
For Fong, the campaign has become nearly all fund-raising, with rarely more than one public event a day.
He explains that he has held public events throughout the campaign, but must now focus on securing cash.
``As a challenger, I need to raise the dollars to compete,'' Fong said after a $125,000 fund-raiser in San Francisco Wednesday night.
Citing the new barrage of negative ads against him, ``I have to answer those charges, and that's what we're doing''.
Fong, who adeptly used the President Clinton's affair with a former White House intern to bash Boxer early in the race, is now seeking to weaken her by linking her to labor unions and trial lawyers, who have been among the largest contributors to her campaign.
At a luncheon Wednesday at the San Jose Rotary Club, he accused Boxer of siding with the trial lawyers who supported Proposition 211, a failed measure to allow shareholder lawsuits against companies if their stock price plummeted.
Many Silicon Valley companies fought the initiative.
He also said Boxer sided with labor union bosses in opposing broader trade-negotiating powers for the president.
Fong is counting on supporters like Helen Buckholtz, a Portola Valley Republican, who said she supports Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, but won't vote for Boxer because she's ``too negative, too partisan''.
Boxer's Central Valley campaign tour Thursday took her through some areas where she has had little support in the past.
In her 1992 election, her opponent, conservative television commentator Bruce Herschensohn, out-polled her in several key Central Valley counties: Fresno (55 percent to 37 percent), Merced (49 percent to 39 percent) and Madera (60 percent to 32 percent).
A Public Policy Institute of California poll last week showed Boxer trailing Fong in the more conservative Central Valley, but had her in a dead heat with her Republican challenger statewide.
WASHINGTON _ Sens.
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer announced Thursday they will wield gavels during the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles next month as the first two women co-chairs of a national political convention.
Feinstein and Boxer, both California Democrats, will make opening remarks at the convention, which begins Aug.
14th and preside over votes and official business from the dais.
The two women previously chaired Democratic conventions as single chairpersons.
In 1992, Democrats chose Texas Gov.
Ann Richards to chair their New York convention and in 1984, Gov.
Martha Layne Collins of Kentucky was selected as the chair of the convention held in San Francisco.
Feinstein said the convention would shine a spotlight on the fact that California _ the largest state in the country with 34 million people _ has elected two women senators.
``This shows the openness of the party to women,'' Feinstein said in an interview.
Boxer recalled watching Sen.
Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.
, on the dais at the 1992 Democratic National Convention in New York when she nominated Al Gore as vice president.
At the time Mikulski was the only Democratic woman senator who hadn't been appointed to fill a position.
The Senate now has nine women: Feinstein, Boxer, Mikulski and Sens.
Mary Landrieu, D-La.
, Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark.
, Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, Patty Murray, D-Wash, and Sens.
Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, both Maine Republicans.
Boxer and Feinstein were both running for Senate seats in 1992 and both spoke at the convention that year.
``It was an amazing experience,'' Boxer recalled.
Feinstein won her election that year to serve out the remaining two years of Pete Wilson's term when he resigned his Senate seat to become governor.
Boxer also won her election, succeeding the retiring Alan Cranston.
``Now we've made history together as the first women co-chairs of the convention, so this is a wonderful moment,'' Boxer said.
The Democratic National Committee also announced Thursday that California Gov.
Gray Davis will serve as the convention's honorary chair.

WASHINGTON _ Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
, said Wednesday that the Democrats will have a strong campaign issue in the coming election as a result of Republicans scuttling her party's proposals to boost patients' rights.
``I do think a patients' bill of rights becomes a major campaign issue,'' said Feinstein, who is running for reelection next year.
And, she said, ``I think it will be part of the presidential campaign''.
Her comments at a breakfast meeting with reporters came in the wake of the Senate defeat Tuesday of Democratic proposals including one by Feinstein that would have ensured that doctors, not health plans, would decide if a treatment is medically necessary.
Her comments were echoed by other Capitol Hill Democrats who contend they are forcing Republicans to take politically unpopular stances on the Senate floor opposing patients' rights.
In votes Tuesday, Senate Republicans also beat back popular Democratic amendments that would have let women in health maintenance organizations pick an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary doctor and ensure that doctors and patients have the final say on how long women can stay in the hospital after surgery for breast cancer.
Another Democratic initiative would have guaranteed patients insured access to emergency rooms.
Republicans are expected to approve their own narrower bill on Thursday on how to regulate managed care providers.
But aides to President Clinton have said they will recommend that he veto the GOP version.
Republicans say the Democratic proposals would lead to escalating medical costs, increased insurance premiums and more uninsured people.
Feinstein told reporters that the issue of reining in managed care organizations is especially important in California.
There, she said, doctors are filing for bankruptcy and hospitals are closing at alarming rates, but managed care providers continue to take in large profits.
``In California, there are real problems,'' she said.
``I just saw a list of new hospitals that will close shortly''.
On Wednesday Republicans offered their own managed care proposals, including one designed to help women who are recovering from breast cancer surgery.
A measure by Sen.
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, would require that decisions on length of stay following a mastectomy be determined by the patient and her own physician.
Her plan is similar to the Democratic proposal, but Republicans said that measure was too vague.
Republicans also planned to offer their own measure regarding access to emergency rooms.
Feinstein predicted that Democrats will win at the polls next year by blaming Republicans, not only for rejecting Democratic patients' rights proposals, but also for killing legislation that would have regulated tobacco companies and tightened rules on gun purchases.
She accused the Republicans of having a ``pro-tobacco and anti-health care reform kind of vision'' and said, ``I think the dominant share of Americans are on the other side of these issues''.
She said gun control will loom large in the campaign because of evidence that juveniles are able to get firearms easily and bring them into schools.
There is a clear need, she said, for ``targeted, prudent regulation of firearms''.
Feinstein also said her own campaign fund-raising efforts for 2000 will yield about $2 million by the end of June.
Asked about speculation that she could be a vice presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket, Feinstein downplayed the idea.
But she said, ``I think the time is right'' for a woman on the ticket.
``I think we have established that women are taking an historically unprecedented role in politics,'' she said.
But she said the speculation about her ``makes me uncomfortable,'' because ``it builds up an expectation''.
``I intend to be U.S. senator,'' Feinstein said.
``I intend to serve another term.
... I can't see into the future...
but I want to be a U.S. senator from California.
The probability is very strong that I will be a U.S. senator.''
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.
_ Democratic women senators headlined a breakfast at the Beverly Hills Hotel on Wednesday to celebrate women in Congress.
Of course, in the U.S.
Senate there are only nine of them, but the speakers, including California Sens.
Barbara Boxer and Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, urged everyone to work hard to elect more.
``Women today are the major political force in this country,'' said Feinstein to the 150 guests, many of whom quickly erupted into applause.
When the cheering quieted, Feinstein said, ``I didn't see a single man clapping''.
Of the 1,852 people who have served in the United States Senate, 27 have been women, said Sen.
Patty Murray, D-Wash.
Of the women, 12 served for a day or two to fill in for their husbands who had just died, she said.
``We are really proud that our husbands did not have to die in order for us to serve,'' said Murray, who hosted the breakfast sponsored by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
The committee has hosted numerous events this week at exclusive locales, such as Spago.
The breakfast Thursday was one of only three events open to the press.
The effects of the seemingly endless week of socializing and political promoting were showing Thursday morning.
Guests guzzled coffee in preparation for the final day of convention activities.
``In hindsight, we should have scheduled (the breakfast) a little earlier in the week or a little later in the morning,'' said Ed Tobin, an executive at Microsoft who introduced Murray.
Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La.
, said she's been so excited since she arrived in Los Angeles that she lost her voice.
But she quickly found a doctor to fix her up.
And who better than Barbra Streisand's doc?
The singer's doctor told her, ``If you follow these instructions, you'll never be able to sing like Barbra, but you'll be able to talk tomorrow''.
Though Landrieu's voice was still a little raspy, she gave a quick speech and was off to the next event.
SAN FRANCISCO _ Republican Rep.
Tom Campbell of California has gained no headway in his bid to unseat Democratic Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, according to a San Francisco Examiner-KTVU poll showing that one third of state voters still don't recognize his name.
Campbell campaign officials said they planned to unleash ads this summer that will help the moderate congressman turn the numbers around.
``We have not yet begun to fight,'' said Campbell senior strategist Sean Walsh.
The poll, conducted by Del Ali of Research 2000 in Rockville, Md.
, showed Feinstein with a formidable 57 percent to 34 percent lead among those who had picked their choice for U.S.
Senate if the election were held today.
The poll also showed that 26 percent of Republicans said they preferred Feinstein.
The Silicon Valley congressman is ``the kind of Republican who could win a statewide election, but I don't see a scenario where Campbell could pull off an upset,'' said Ali, whose firm conducted the poll July 17 through 19.
It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
The questions were posed to 827 registered voters who vote regularly in state elections.
Republicans and Democrats were divided equally.
Add to Campbell's weak name recognition a bustling economy and voter approval for Feinstein, and the congressman appears to face even more of an uphill battle.
``Incumbents get too much credit when things go well and too much blame when things go bad.
It's a good election cycle to be an incumbent,'' said Ali.
``It always starts with the economic times.
You've got a job, money in the bank, and people feel secure.
They're not going to rock the boat by throwing out the status quo''.
Feinstein, he added, ``would almost have to go out and try to lose the election''.
Feinstein was first elected to the Senate in 1992 to fulfill the last two years of a six-year term.
When she stood for re-election in 1994, she narrowly beat back a challenge from Republican Michael Huffington.
This is Campbell's second stint in Congress.
He served as a U.S. representative between 1988 and 1992.
He returned to Congress in a special election in 1995 after a brief term in the state Legislature.
He narrowly lost a bid for the U.S.
Senate primary in 1992 to ultra-conservative Bruce Herschenson, who in turn was defeated in the general election by liberal Democrat Barbara Boxer _ a race many observers believed Campbell would have won had he faced her.
The last poll on the Feinstein-Campbell race was two weeks before California's March primary, when Feinstein had 54 percent to Campbell's 36 percent.
Last week's poll shows Feinstein doing slightly better than Campbell among men _ 48 to 44 percent _ and far better _ 65 to 24 percent _ among women.
The poll also shows the senator from San Francisco ahead in every region of the state except for the Central Valley, where each received 44 percent of the vote.
Feinstein was far ahead of Campbell among ethnic groups and Caucasians alike.
Campbell is a pro-abortion rights Republican who sells himself as fiscally conservative but socially more liberal.
Feinstein scored a 57 percent favorable rating, compared to a 23 percent rating for Campbell.
Political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of the School of Politics and Economics at Claremont Graduate University said Feinstein probably earned points among Democrats and Republicans alike by coming out early in her criticisms of President Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
``It showed her independence and values and toughness.
Voters appreciate that even if the people who work with her do not,'' said Jeffe.
``She doesn't toe an ideological partisan line and that's where voters are these days''.
Walsh said the Campbell campaign was gearing up for an aggressive race, and planned to start defining the soft-spoken congressman long before Labor Day, the unofficial kickoff day for the November election.
Walsh said Campbell has been called ``the smartest man in Congress'' by Roll Call magazine.
But he acknowledged: ``We have to raise his name ID and profile.''
WASHINGTON _ California Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, whose decision not to run for governor earlier this year came after months of intrigue and public speculation, is leaving no suspense about her plans for re-election to the Senate.
The Democratic senator said Thursday that she will seek re-election in 2000, and will begin the effort later this month with a fund-raiser in San Francisco.
``The reason I didn't run for governor is that I want to continue in the Senate,'' Feinstein said Thursday in an interview.
``I believe I can continue to be effective in the Senate''.
After three statewide campaigns in the 1990s, the 64-year-old former San Francisco mayor has become one of the most recognized and popular politicians in the state.
Feinstein is frequently mentioned as a potential running mate for the Democratic presidential nominee in 2000.
``I'm not planning on that happening.
.. . It's not a possibility at this stage,'' Feinstein said.
``At this point, everything in me is going to work toward continuing in the United States Senate''.
Although no Californian has ever done it, state election officials say Feinstein could run for vice president and Senate at the same time.
Were she to win both elections, Gov.
Gray Davis, a Democrat, would appoint a temporary replacement until voters elect a successor.
Democrats, bolstered by their strong showing in last month's elections, believe they have a chance to regain control of the Senate in 2000.
Republicans currently hold a 55-to-45 advantage, but Democrats hold fewer of the seats up for re-election.
Feinstein was first elected to the Senate in 1992 and has earned a reputation as a no-nonsense centrist who works well with Republicans as well as Democrats.
Her fiercest critics have been civil libertarians, who have decried her efforts to restrict information on the Internet (ranging from the dissemination of personal data to instructions on how to build bombs) and gun advocates, who oppose her ban on assault weapons, which was passed in 1994.
Several Republicans have expressed an interest in the seat, including Rep.
Chris Cox, R-Newport Beach, who recently transferred campaign contributions into a Senate campaign account in order to keep his options open.
Other Republican candidates mentioned as possible contenders include Rep.
Tom Campbell, R-Calif.
, California Secretary of State Bill Jones and State Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush.
Multimillionaire Al Checchi, who made a bid for the Democratic nomination for governor earlier this year, laid to rest rumors that he might be interested in challenging Feinstein in the Democratic primary.
``I don't want to be senator,'' Checchi said Thursday from his Los Angeles home.
Feinstein estimated that she will need to raise at least $15 million to defend her seat, and will begin the process with a women's event in San Francisco later this month.
Large fund-raising events are being planned for both San Francisco and Los Angeles early next year.
Feinstein has enlisted the help of longtime political advisers Kam Kuwata and Bill Carrick.
In a move that may boost her chances for re-election, Feinstein has reclaimed her seat on the influential Senate Appropriations Committee, which oversees $1.5 trillion in annual discretionary spending.
Two years ago, Feinstein gave her seat on the committee to Sen.
Barbara Boxer as a way to help her fellow California Democrat's chances for re-election.
Boxer used the position to help lobby for _ and then boast about _ tens of millions of dollars for California projects including BART, the Presidio and preservation of San Francisco Bay.
Boxer will now take Feinstein's seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Discussing her priorities for the next Congress, Feinstein said she will push for the construction of new schools and work to discourage the practice of ``social promotion,'' in which students are moved from grade to grade without any testing of their skills.
She also said she will revisit the issue of guns and may introduce legislation to require child safety locks, regulate ``Saturday night specials,'' and close a loophole in the assault weapons ban that permits the import of large bullet clips.
The Senate may be consumed with a trial of President Clinton if the House approves articles of impeachment later this month, an ordeal that she complained is evolving into ``Melrose Place on Lafayette Park''.
Feinstein initially issued an angry rebuke of Clinton after he admitted to deceiving the nation about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
Now, although open to a resolution to censure the president, she has ``not seen anything'' to make her think Clinton should be removed from office.
``I think it's extraordinarily important that this chapter be closed.
I think worldwide the United States looks worse and worse''.
Feinstein will have a good opportunity to gauge the president's reaction to the House Judiciary Committee's inquiry.
She has accepted a White House invitation to accompany Clinton on a trip to the Middle East on December 12, the day the House Judiciary Committee is expected to complete its impeachment proceedings .
Among the speakers on Monday evening's program: Sens.
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California In 1992, Californians made history by pulling the lever for both Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.
In her eight years in Washington, Feinstein, a native Californian and the former mayor of San Francisco, has quietly pushed for anti-crime legislation and issues close to home.
One of her biggest victories was attaching an assault weapons ban to the crime bill passed by President Clinton in 1994.
Boxer is a strong abortion rights advocate who has vigorously fought the ban on partial birth abortion.
Boxer is linked to the Clinton White House by the marriage of Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham, to her daughter, Nicole.
Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland After organizing neighbors to protest the construction of a 16-lane highway through the historic Fells Point area of Baltimore, Barbara Mikulski plunged into politics in the late 1960s.
Then a social worker, Mikulski went on to serve as City Councilwoman in her hometown of Baltimore, before serving in the House from 1976 to 1986 and being elected to the Senate in 1986.
She is also the co-author of two mystery novels with a political twist.
``Capitol Offense'' and ``Capitol Virtues'' sketch the life of a freshman female senator from Pennsylvania who Mikulski has called a ``somewhat younger, somewhat slimmer, but no less politically savvy'' version of herself.
Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana Mary Landrieu was elected in 1996, and with Sen.
John Breaux of Louisiana, she forms the last of the all-Democratic Senate delegations in the South.
Landrieu grew up in New Orleans, the oldest of nine children of Moon Landrieu, the mayor of the city in the 1970s.
In 1979, after graduating from Louisiana State University, she became, at 23, the youngest woman ever elected to the state Legislature.
She was elected to the Senate in 1996, with a moderate platform.
Sen. Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas Growing up on a rice farm in Helena, Ark.
, Blanche Lambert Lincoln, 39, was elected to the Senate two years ago.
After serving two terms in the House, she took a two-year leave from public life because she was about to give birth to twin boys.
When she ran for the Senate in 1998, she put their pictures on her campaign posters.
Rep. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan Elected to the House in 1996, Debbie Stabenow is involved in what is shaping up to be one of the nation's most bitterly contested Senate races.
She is challenging Sen.
Spencer Abraham by highlighting her own legislative record that goes back to 1975, when she became county commissioner by fighting a proposal that would have shut down a local hospital that accepted Medicaid.
WASHINGTON _ After three weeks of lobbying and 25 different versions of a censure resolution condemning President Clinton but not convicting him, Sen.
Dianne Feinstein still couldn't find the magic language.
Every time she used tougher words to win Republican support, she would lose Democrats.
When she softened the language, she would lose Republicans.
In the end, she couldn't muster the 67 votes needed to allow a floor vote on her resolution.
Censure was as dead as the House campaign to convict the president.
``Everything caused problems, every preposition, every adjective, every adverb,'' Feinstein said Friday.
``We tried to incorporate every suggestion everybody made but it seemed we lost support on one side every time we picked it up on the other''.
After the Senate voted to acquit Clinton, Feinstein tried to bring up her censure resolution.
But Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who opposed censure because he thought it was unconstitutional, blocked her with a parliamentary tactic.
She needed 67 votes to overcome Gramm and allow a vote on the resolution.
But she only received 56 votes.
In the end, Feinstein's resolution was placed into the Congressional Record but not adopted by the Senate.
``It may or may not come up again,'' Feinstein said later, acknowledging that ``people want to get past this''.
``We made a point, because we got the resolution into the Record signed by one-third'' of the Senate, she said.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
, indicated that, as far as he was concerned, the matter was closed and the Senate would not take up censure again.
``The problem with the censure resolution right now is that, I think, the Senate is tired''.
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
, said that since a vote on censure wasn't allowed Friday, ``Now is the time to stop.
Let the recriminations stop.
It's going to take a while to put some of these pieces back together''.
In its final form, her three-page censure resolution, signed by 38 senators, condemned Clinton for ``shameful, reckless and indefensible'' behavior in connection with his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
It said Clinton ``deliberately misled and deceived the American people,'' ``gave false or misleading testimony'' which ``had the effect of impeding discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings''.
The statement said Clinton's conduct demeaned the office of the president and ``creates disrespect for the laws of the land''.
Her campaign for censure was aided by Sens.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
, Robert Bennett, R-Utah and Joseph I.
Lieberman, D-Conn.
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
, who didn't sign Feinstein's censure resolution but voted Friday to allow it to come up for debate, praised her colleague's efforts in tackling such a difficult task.
``Sen. Feinstein deserves a lot of credit,'' Boxer said.
``It shows that Sen.
Feinstein is a person who really likes to work both sides of the aisle.
She did a remarkable job''.
Boxer said she signed an early version of the censure resolution but didn't support later, tougher versions.
Lieberman praised Feinstein for being ``very persistent and very principled'' in her fight to bring a censure resolution to the floor.
Although Feinstein has sided with Clinton on many issues, including the 1994 legislation that banned 19 types of assault weapons, she became the first Senate Democrat to publicly scold Clinton for lying about his relationship to the American people.
A day after President Clinton addressed the nation Aug.
17 and admitted an ``inappropriate relationship'' with Lewinsky, Feinstein shocked many of her supporters and colleagues by publicly denouncing him.
``My trust in his credibility has been badly shattered,'' she said.
``I was present in the Roosevelt room in January when the president categorically denied any sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
I believed him''.
She was referring to the now-famous finger-wagging denial by the president that he had ever ``had sexual relations with that woman''.
Shortly afterward, Lieberman, another influential Democrat made a floor speech harshly condemning Clinton's conduct.
That was followed by an increasing chorus of Democrats who expressed their disillusionment with Clinton's behavior.
Feinstein has since rebuffed attempts by Clinton to discuss the Lewinsky affair with her, although she has corresponded with him on other matters, such as getting federal aid for citrus crops in California's central valley that were damaged in December by a freeze.
The Clinton administration responded by approving federal aid for victims of that freeze disaster, including $1.7 million for farm workers who lost their jobs.
After the Senate vote to acquit Clinton, Feinstein scheduled a news conference at 1:30 p.m. to discuss censure.
But a bomb threat caused Capitol police to order an emergency evacuation, forcing Feinstein to cancel the news conference.
Asked about her future relations with the president, Feinstein said the ball now is in his court.
``We've just been through a year of trauma,'' Feinstein said.
``''He's been our leader _ he is our leader and we have to come to terms with this...
The president is speaking about reconciliation.
The president is the one who brought this on and reconciliation is up to him.''
WASHINGTON _ Sens.
Dianne Feinstein and Paul Coverdell, conceding Tuesday that the Senate won't cancel the Clinton administration's decision to certify Mexico as a drug-fighting ally, proposed a ban on business dealings with foreign companies that serve as fronts for drug cartel smuggling.
Feinstein said Mexican drug cartels must be targeted ``like a laser beam''.
``The cartels of Mexico today are stronger than Mafia organized crime ever was and I believe they represent a threat to the U.S.,'' Feinstein told a news conference.
``Our enemies should be the cartels, not Mexico vs.
the U.S''.
Feinstein stressed that she doesn't want to hurt trade or friendship with Mexico and that she believes top Mexican government officials are ``doing their level best'' to fight drug trafficking.
Feinstein, D-Calif.
, and Coverdell, R-Ga.
, have led past unsuccessful Senate efforts to override administration certifications of Mexico.
Coverdell said the bill would focus on ``bad actors'' in Mexico, as opposed to seeking to override the administration's decision to certify Mexico.
``While we're not decertifying Mexico, we're decertifying the cartels,'' he said.
Coverdell said he and Feinstein ``adamantly oppose'' efforts to repeal the law that requires the administration to give annual certifications to Congress that Mexico or other nations with drug-trafficking histories are cooperating in the U.S. war against drugs.
If a foreign country loses an annual certification, it could risk losing U.S. aid.
Coverdell acknowledged that Congress won't repeal the certification of Mexico this year.
The Feinstein-Coverdell proposal targets foreign narcotics dealers considered a threat to U.S. national security.
It would freeze the assets of drug traffickers and ban their related businesses _ either front businesses or those run from drug profits _ from trading with American companies.
The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control would draw up a list of narcotics traffickers and impose criminal penalties of up to $500,000 per violation or $250,000 and up to 10 years in prison for American companies that do business with them.
In Colombia, the U.S. government has targeted and financially crippled a drug store chain, a poultry business and pharmaceutical laboratories connected to drug cartels.
&QL; (STORY CAN END HERE --OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS).
&QL; Meanwhile, efforts were continuing in the House to strip Mexico of its certification.
President Clinton on Feb.
26 certified to Congress that Mexico is a fully cooperating drug-fighting ally.
Congress has 30 days from that date to overturn the president's decision, a prospect that seems highly unlikely.
Mexico's certification has been renewed 13 times since 1986 when the annual process went into effect.
Reps. John Mica, R-Fla.
, Clay E.
Shaw Jr.
, R-Fla.
, and Spencer Bachus, R-Ala.
, introduced a resolution Tuesday to decertify Mexico in what they said was a first step toward overturning the certification.
Mica said America is ``on the verge of having a state to the south of us that is an ally become a narco-terrorist''.
Bachus called Clinton's decision to certify Mexico ``a sham''.
``To certify Mexico is to make a mockery out of the certification system,'' he said.
Bachus acknowledged he faced ``an uphill battle,'' and said he has no assurances that the House will actually vote on the resolution.
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.
, said this year's recertification ``cheapens and degrades'' the work and sacrifices that other countries are making to fight drug trafficking.
The following countries are subject to the re-certification process: Afghanistan, Aruba, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia, China, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela and Vietnam.
WASHINGTON _ In June, just as the Democratic presidential primaries were nearing an anticlimactic end, the Clinton-Gore administration boasted of its successes in advancing the political standing of women since the U.N. conference on women's rights in Beijing five years ago.
But thus far in his very private process of selecting a running mate, Vice President Al Gore has given few hints that he is ready to do just that by selecting a woman for the No.
2 spot on the Democratic ticket this year.
This week, as he began to narrow the number of vice presidential candidates, Gore suggested that his long list included women, though he was not specific.
``I think it's only fair to the men and women involved to keep it private and dignified,'' he said of his selection process.
But hardly any of the news accounts of Gore's selection process speculated on the possibility of the vice president selecting a woman.
Most of the speculation centered on Sens.
John Kerry of Massachusetts, Bob Graham of Florida, Evan Bayh of Indiana and Tom Harkin of Iowa, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine.
But what about a woman?
Is it possible that Gore is haunted by the ghost of 1984, when Vice President Walter Mondale picked a little-known New York congresswoman, Geraldine Ferraro, and went on to the greatest defeat in modern American politics?
``I don't think that has anything to do with it,'' said Marla Romash, a longtime political associate of Gore.
``It's more about numbers than anything else.
There just aren't that many women to choose from''.
Indeed, the ranks of Democratic female politicians are so thin that noted Democratic pollster Celinda Lake has reached into the ranks of lieutenant governors for a possible running mate for Gore.
Admittedly, Lake's candidate is no average lieutenant governor: Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of Maryland, daughter of Robert F.
Kennedy. But the vice presidential selection process of both Gore and Texas Gov.
George W.
Bush, the soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee, has generally rankled people who had hoped to see more of a female presence.
``It just shows once again that women have an uphill battle in politics as in any other field dominated by white males,'' said Mary Hawkesworth, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey.
It is the same for women worldwide.
When it comes to a ``gender balanced'' presidential ticket, ``The political parties like to talk about viability _ or lack of it,'' added Hawkesworth.
``But the fact is, there are plenty of women who would be viable candidates''.
Former Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, who served in the last two Republican Cabinets, was widely touted as a possible Bush running mate.
But the governor chose oil industry executive Dick Cheney, a former congressman and secretary of defense.
As Gore coasted to victory in the Democratic primaries this spring, generating a guessing game about a running mate, Sen.
Dianne Feinstein of California was mentioned frequently.
A seasoned politician and one of the best speakers in American politics today, Feinstein has a generally _ but not uniformly _ liberal voting record.
But Feinstein is up for re-election this year.
And she is from a state that Gore could win this fall without her help.
In addition, she voted against NAFTA, one of the administration's major accomplishments, and was among the first Democrats to condemn President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
``Gore's biggest problem (in selecting a female running mate) is the size of the pool,'' said Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Clarement-McKenna College in California.
Democratic women account for just six senators, 39 House members and one governor, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.
Like Feinstein in the Senate, 37 of the 39 House members are up for re-election _ two are leaving the House.
Shaheen also is seeking another term.
The six Democratic senators average 19.8 years each in politics, topped by Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, 27 years; Feinstein, 26 years; and Barbara Boxer of California, 24 years.
The six men most mentioned as possible Gore running mates average 22.3 years each in politics, with Graham at the top, 34 years, and Gephardt, 29 years.
Reps. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and Louise Slaughter of New York are the Democratic women who have served the most consecutive years in the House: Kaptur, 18, and Slaughter, 14.
But neither has been mentioned as a possible running mate.
Neither have Clinton Cabinet members Donna Shalala, Alexis Herman or Janet Reno.
(Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is barred by the U.S.
Constitution from running because she was not born in the United States).
``Gore's choice has to be perceived by most voters as presidential,'' said Joel Goldstein, author of ``The Modern American Vice Presidency''.
Added Romash: ``You don't get on the list in a vacuum; you get on the list by having years of experience in public service.
And we're still working to increase the number of women available to be on the list''.

WASHINGTON _ Declaring that the power of a million moms can defeat the gun lobby, California Sen.
Dianne Feinstein introduced legislation Tuesday to require that gun owners obtain licenses and register their firearms.
Feinstein introduced her measure as thousands of women began traveling to Washington for a Mother's Day rally on the National Mall in support of gun control.
Flanked by march organizers, Feinstein said the rally ``gives us the opportunity to bring together people around a measure that I think will be a pivotal one in the upcoming presidential campaign''.
The Democratic senator's legislation would impose requirements on gun owners similar to those that exist for drivers.
Owners of handguns, and semiautomatic firearms that use detachable magazines, would need licenses, which would cost $25.
All sales of such weapons would be recorded and the information transmitted to the Treasury Department.
``The time has come to say enough is enough and demand of Congress the passage of commonsense gun laws,'' Feinstein said in a Capitol Hill news conference.
&LR; sh1 &LR; Boxer Present Feinstein was joined by Sens.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
, and Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
, and they stood before an oversized photograph of 10 children being led by police away from a Los Angeles day care center after a shooting there last summer.
``In this country, when you want to hunt, you get a hunting license; when you want to fish, you get a fishing license.
But when you want to buy a gun, no license is necessary,'' Feinstein said.
``That makes no sense''.
Feinstein chose to introduce the measure, nearly a year in the making, in the days before the ``Million Mom March'' as a way of galvanizing support and trying to apply pressure to the pro-gun forces in Congress.
Although the march is being sponsored by a nonpartisan group, its leaders stood with Feinstein at Tuesday's news conference and said licensing and registration is their top priority.
Several far more modest gun control measures _ including legislation to require child safety locks, ban the sale of guns to minors, and extend a three-day background check to gun shows _ were passed by the Senate last year.
However, they were not approved by the House and are now languishing in a conference committee.
Feinstein acknowledged that her more sweeping measure has almost no chance to pass the current Congress, saying that the most powerful lobby in Washington is the gun lobby.
``There is only one counter-lobby that can stand up to them,'' she said, ``and this is the women in America''.
Feinstein said the political climate in Washington will change if Democrats prevail in November's election.
Organizers of the Million Mom March hope to attract at least 100,000 _ and perhaps as many as 250,000 _ supporters to the National Mall on Sunday, and tens of thousands more at spin-off rallies in 67 other cities, including Oakland (the Oakland rally begins at 1 p.m. at the Lake Merritt bandstand).
Adding to the confrontational atmosphere surrounding the issue, a Dallas-based group called the Second Amendment Sisters will hold a counter-march to draw attention to the lives that are saved by guns every year.
Organizers said they ``want to show the American public that not all women are pro-gun control''.
The two marches will be on opposite sides of the Washington Monument.
The Million Mom March will go east from the monument to the Capitol, while the Armed Informed Mothers' March will go west toward the Lincoln Memorial.
Texas state Rep.
Suzanna Gratia-Hupp will be the keynote speaker at the pro-gun march.
Gratia-Hupp was in a restaurant in Killeen, Texas, in 1991 when a lone gunman killed 21 people in a shooting spree, including her parents.
She said she believes she could have saved lives, had she been armed, by shooting the gunman.
Only two politicians will speak at the gun control rally: Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat whose husband was killed by a gunman on a Long Island commuter train, and Maryland Lt.
Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, whose father, Robert, was assassinated 32 years ago as he ran for president.
Feinstein's news conference included harrowing stories from individuals whose families have been shattered by guns.
Claudette Perry of Washington, D.C., told of a 3 a.m. phone call in which she learned the son of a close friend had been shot dead in the back and of her agonizing conversation informing the mother.
As tears welled up in her eyes, and rolled down the cheeks of many others gathered in Senate hearing room, she talked of the misery inflicted on thousands of families and the loss of freedom for so many kids.
``Don't talk to me about your right to carry a firearm,'' she said, warning lawmakers that they have a choice of either ``signing on to active gun control legislation or signing out in November''.
Gun supporters mocked Feinstein's proposed restrictions, saying they would be followed only by law-abiding citizens and not by the criminals who terrorize the public with guns.
``The American people are fundamentally skeptical that gun regulation will reduce violent crimes.
They favor strict enforcement of the existing laws,'' said Jim Manown, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association.
``Anyone who is familiar with the landscape of the Congress knows that this bill isn't is &LR; going anywhere,'' Manown said, accusing Feinstein of engaging in little more than a publicity stunt.
``If the senator ever chooses to leave public service, she will have a sterling career as a publicist''.
Feinstein has been a foe of the gun lobby since she was San Francisco's mayor nearly two decades ago and sponsored a citywide handgun ban that was approved by the Board of Supervisors but ultimately struck down by a state court.
In 1994, as a first-term senator, she pushed through a ban on assault weapons.
WASHINGTON _ For the first time since reading the special prosecutor's report on President Clinton's affair with a onetime intern, Sen.
Dianne Feinstein said Thursday she felt ``a personal sense of betrayal'' and said she rebuffed an offer to talk to the president about it.
But Feinstein, D-Calif.
, said talk about whether Clinton should resign ``is way premature'' and said the congressional investigation into alleged impeachable offenses should be allowed to play out.
In a rare interview in her office, Feinstein was at times at a loss for words when trying to describe the ``sadness and disappointment'' she felt after reading the report of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, a task she said took four hours.
She also said revelations that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde had had an affair with a married woman in the 1960s ``is different'' from Clinton's situation and ``only increases animosity'' from Republicans.
``This was an intern,'' Feinstein said, referring to Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
``This was something while he was president.
That's its pertinence.
The fact that it was in the White House, in the Oval Office''.
Hyde, R-Ill.
, has acknowledged the affair occurred.
It took place in the 1960s, before Hyde ran for Congress.
Feinstein said she turned down an offer from one of Clinton's aides to talk with the president about the Lewinsky affair.
``I said I didn't want to talk to the president,'' Feinstein said.
``I was angry''.
Since then, Feinstein said, she hasn't talked to the president but has consulted on other matters with members of his administration.
``To be candid, it's still hard to believe,'' said Feinstein, who is the senior senator from California, a state Clinton has assiduously courted throughout his presidency.
``This is the kind of thing that is difficult on a personal level for me''.
However, she added, ``I can separate my personal dismay and disappointment from what I have to do as a senator'.
Clinton's admission that he lied about the Lewinsky affair, and the sordid details surrounding it, have drawn a growing number of Democrats in Congress to criticize the president's conduct.
But most have stopped short of saying Clinton should be forced from office because of an extramarital relationship.
Feinstein was ambivalent about the impending release of a videotape of the president's Aug.
17 testimony before the federal grand jury investigating his conduct.
After the testimony, Clinton went on national television and admitted having an extramarital relationship with Lewinsky.
``If there's something that adds light to the situation and is pertinent to the situation, it might be a wise thing to do,'' Feinstein said.
``But if it's something to inflame the situation, I don't think that's what it should be about''.
She also said she the House Judiciary Committee must be bipartisan as it proceeds with its own assessment of whether Clinton committed impeachable offenses.
The Starr report accused the president of perjury, abuse of power and obstruction of justice in trying to conceal the Lewinsky affair.
``I hope we can have a relatively short process,'' Feinstein said.
``I hope it does not drag on for a year and a half.
Feinstein recalled how she was sitting only a few feet away from Clinton in the White House in January when he waved his index finger at the television cameras and denied to the nation that he had ever had ``sexual relations'' with Lewinsky.
Feinstein said ``the body language'' and the ``directness of the statement'' convinced her he was telling the truth and she believed that for seven months.
``I believed it and I believed it totally,'' she said.
Later, when Clinton dispatched members of his Cabinet to convince others he was telling the truth, she was even more certain.
But then she was shattered.
``On August 17, when I heard the statement, my world came crashing down,'' Feinstein said.
``I feel a personal sense of betrayal.
I felt a gut-level deep sense of betrayal''.
At the time, Feinstein told reporters her faith in the president's credibility was badly ``shattered''.
Feinstein said her office had received about 12,000 phone calls from constituents since Friday, when the Starr report was made public, as well as 1,500 electronic mail messages.
``Some people are in tears, some are irate and some are extraordinarily supportive of the president,'' she said.
``This has a long, long tail on it.
It's not just the president.
It's the future of the American presidency too''.
If Clinton is to survive the scandal, ``he will need to show he will continue to be a strong president,'' Feinstein said.
``That's where the jury's out.''
WASHINGTON _ Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
, said she will vote against both articles of impeachment because House prosecutors failed to prove ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' that President Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice in the Monica Lewinsky matter.
``Although I deplore the circumstances that have brought us to this point, I do not believe they present a clear and present danger to the functioning of our government,'' Feinstein said during closed-door deliberations on the Senate floor Wednesday.
Her office released a copy of her statement Thursday.
``Therefore, this president, who has been a good president for the people of the United States, should not be convicted and removed from office,'' Feinstein said.
Feinstein, whose vote for acquittal was expected, has carved out a major role in the impeachment finale by touting censure as an alternative to conviction.
She has formed an unlikely alliance with Sen.
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, to build support for a censure resolution, though it appeared Thursday that their effort was doomed.
Impeachment, Feinstein said, is a grave step envisioned by the Constitution's framers as a last resort when a president's actions threaten the function of government.
Given that high threshold, ``I do not believe the House (prosecutors) established beyond a reasonable doubt that this president is guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice''.
Feinstein cited the charge that Clinton encouraged Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
House prosecutors relied on Lewinsky's testimony to prove this charge, but Lewinsky herself said that Clinton never told her to lie and that the two of them never discussed the contents of her affidavit, Feinstein said.
``One may speculate that the president encouraged her to lie, but quite simply the point hasn't been proven,'' Feinstein said.
Charges that Clinton conspired to hide gifts he gave Lewinsky and worked with confidant Vernon Jordan to find her a job also were marked by contradictory testimony and evidence bolstering a more innocent interpretation of events, Feinstein said.
She took dead aim at Republican handling of the impeachment process, saying GOP House members ``prematurely released'' grand jury testimony to the public and failed to call key witnesses during impeachment hearings before the House Judiciary Committee.
While she was ``appalled'' by Clinton's characterization of Lewinsky as a stalker in a conversation with White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, ``the fact that this is a popular, well-respected president (who) has strong support must be considered''.
In the international arena, removing Clinton would be ``de-stabilizing,'' Feinstein added.
Feinstein devoted part of her floor speech to the push for censure.
``The president's behavior was immoral, deplorable and indefensible,'' Feinstein said.
``It sent the wrong message to the nation and our children''.
While it does not threaten the security and stability of the nation, Clinton's behavior does warrant ``strong condemnation and censure, and there should be a formal means for senators...
to express this condemnation''.
Censure would not be a legal judgment, but rather a ``legislative measure'' through which senators could express ``moral conclusions'' on Clinton's conduct, and thereby send a message ``to the people of our nation, especially its youth''.
Feinstein's California colleague, Sen.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
, also said Thursday that she would vote to acquit Clinton.
But unlike Feinstein, Boxer said she opposes censure.
Boxer told reporters she is concerned that a Senate debate over censure could eat into the chamber's legislative agenda.
``I worry about it becoming the dominant issue in the Senate,'' she said.
``I'm worried it could take too much time away from other work''.
Republican opposition to censure is growing, presenting a high hurdle to Feinstein and other censure advocates.
Moving a censure resolution to the floor would require two-thirds of the Senate _ 67 votes _ to suspend Senate rules, Feinstein said.
``I would hope at the appropriate time these votes would be present,'' she said .
WASHINGTON _ Some Senate Democrats said Tuesday they will seriously consider a resolution drafted by Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D.-Calif.
, condemning President Clinton's conduct in trying to cover up his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
As Clinton's impeachment trial continued in the Senate, lawmakers in both parties made clear they still believe that Republicans will be unable to muster the two-thirds majority needed to remove him from office on perjury and obstruction of justice charges.
Feinstein's resolution would censure him for both having the affair and then concealing it from his cabinet, other government officials and the nation.
The measure does not deal with the perjury or obstruction of justice charges approved by the House of Representatives but instead focuses on presidential misconduct.
The resolution neither clears the president of criminal behavior nor implicates him.
Feinstein said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
, had agreed to take up her resolution following Senate action on the two articles of impeachment now being tried.
Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I.
, said Feinstein's resolution is the first of what will likely be a number of proposals that Democrats will consider before bringing a censure plan to the floor.
``It's a very good place to begin,'' Reed said of the resolution.
He added that lawmakers need to find the exact, appropriate wording to ensure the resolution passes constitutional muster.
``From the very beginning of this process, I thought censure was appropriate,'' Reed said.
Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis.
, said many senators feel that if Clinton is acquitted, ``something needs to be on the record'' that condemns him for his actions.
Some conservative Republicans have said they won't back such a measure.
For instance, Sen.
Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, has argued that the Senate cannot censure a president because it would violate the separation-of-powers clause in the Constitution.
But DeWine said a number of Republicans may find the censure option appealing if the Senate votes against articles of impeachment.
Republicans control 55 seats while the Democrats have 45 seats.
A simple majority vote would be needed to approve a censure resolution.
Feinstein's measure would be considered as a non-binding resolution that does not require a House vote or Clinton's signature.
Both the House and Senate often approve non-binding resolutions on various subjects such as supporting U.S. troops in Iraq.
Democrats maintain that if a censure resolution is non-binding, it will not pose any constitutional problems.
There is an outside chance, however, that the Senate may never get to an actual vote on the articles themselves.
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has proposed that the Senate simply vote to adjourn and accept the House charges of perjury and obstruction of justice as the ``highest form of censure'' against Clinton without having the Senate take its own vote on the charges themselves.
Asked about Feinstein's proposal, Sen.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
said it now appears that witnesses will be called and that there's no way to tell if censure will come up.
``Once you start a trial process, you don't know where and how it's going to end,'' Schumer said.
He added that the atmosphere is likely to get highly partisan and ``that could damage the Senate not just now but later on.''
WASHINGTON _ This scandal that was, to many, all about sex and the married man closes with an unexpected twist: Women come out winners.
Meager winnings, maybe, for the female leads in the yearlong soap opera.
Paula Jones got her money and a makeover.
Monica S.
Lewinsky has a big book deal and bragging rights for a boffo performance before the House impeachment managers.
Even the vilified Linda R.
Tripp has embarked on a network TV image-enhancement tour.
But just as ``the year of the woman candidate'' followed Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's sexually charged confirmation hearings in 1991, many think women will benefit politically from Washington's toxic mix of sex, machismo, and partisanship that ended Friday with President Clinton's acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial.
It's no coincidence that Elizabeth Dole, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Senator Dianne Feinstein suddenly are being touted as women who can win high office in 2000 _ even though none has said she will be running for office.
``For heaven's sake, look what we have been put through because of the foibles of Washington's failed old-boy network,'' said Elizabeth Sherman, director of the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
``People think they can clean things up by electing a woman who is more honest, more compassionate, more authentic, and, true or not, not as prone to the kinds of sexual peccadillos that men are''.
This week, Dole, a two-time Republican Cabinet secretary and the recently retired head of the American Red Cross, debuted on the political stage with a speech in New Hampshire that included several references to her gender and repeated calls for restoring integrity and moral leadership in the White House.
``There's been a little speculation that I might run for president,'' said Dole, who is expected to formally announce her intention to do that this week.
``If I run, this will be an important reason why: The United States deserves a government that is worthy of her people''.
Polls show Dole, who is married to former senator Bob Dole, the 1996 presidential candidate, not only has a shot at the top of the GOP White House field but also would defeat Vice President Al Gore in a head-to-head matchup today.
A year ago, nobody was giving any serious consideration to Hillary Clinton's running for public office.
But her dignified handling of a public embarrassment, a political crisis, and certainly, a personal ordeal, won Mrs.
Clinton a combination of respect and sympathy that sent her once-sagging popularity through the ceiling.
Mrs. Clinton also dived into last fall's elections, campaigning where her beleaguered husband couldn't and proving that she could pump up huge crowds and make the difference for Democrats in tight races.
Now she is being wooed by New York Democrats to run for an open Senate seat in 2000 ``It's wait and see, give her time,'' said Marsha Berry, Mrs.
Clinton's press secretary.
``She has not ruled it in or out''.
Berry said the first lady is ``gracious and listens'' to New Yorkers who are promoting her candidacy, but she refuses to discuss it, or even think about it, until the impeachment issue is gone.
President Clinton, however, brought it up at a recent fund-raising dinner in Manhattan, quipping that he might be remembered as ``the person who comes with Hillary to New York''.
``Hillary's political standing has vastly improved, but isn't it a terrible irony that people who didn't like her because of her independence, intelligence, and ambition, found her a much more sympathetic character after she was taken down and humanized as a humiliated wife''? said Wendy Kaminer, an author and public policy fellow at Radcliffe College.
Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women, said she thinks Mrs.
Clinton ``has an agenda, and she is out there stirring things up''.
NOW also is poised to stir things up.
Its political action committee met this week to plan ways to promote Feinstein, California's senior senator, as vice president on the Democratic ticket in 2000.
One idea is to have NOW members show up at campaign events featuring Gore or former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley with placards that say ``Democrats Deserve Dianne,'' and ``Countdown to D (Dianne)-Day''.
Ireland said NOW officials had not spoken to Feinstein, a proven money-raiser from a state rich with electoral votes, but she did not expect her to ``run from the room and slam the door'' on a vice presidential draft.
Feinstein has gotten attention as a tough and persistent critic of the president's behavior.
``The lesson we learned in the last year is that it is entirely possible to have an administration that is good on the issues and on appointing women and still have a streak of sexism a mile wide,'' said Ireland, in an effort to justify NOW's push to get the second woman on the Democratic ticket.
Former representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York was the first, in 1984.
Unquestionably, President Clinton put women who shared his politics _ his wife, Democratic lawmakers, and feminist activists _ on the spot by his relationship with Lewinsky.
The president became a campaign issue last fall for Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer of California, Patty Murray of Washington, and Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, who defended Clinton's record but said they deplored his conduct.
Boxer and Murray were reelected; Moseley-Braun was not.
Feminist leaders were accused of hypocrisy for loudly championing sexual-harassment laws but staying silent when such charges were brought against a president who advocated for women's rights.
``If Democratic women in the House or Senate had turned against him, if feminist groups had abandoned him, or if his wife had indicated at any point that she did not stand by him, it could have been a turning point and tipped the public scales against the president,'' said Martha Burk, president of the Center for the Advancement of Public Policy, a liberal advocacy group for women.
Now, Burk said, ``it's definitely pay-back time''.
Women's groups want the White House to act quickly on their issues: legislation guaranteeing women equal pay for equal but not identical work, improved child care, and recognition of the special needs of older women in any Social Security overhaul plan.
``If that doesn't happen, women who stood by the president are going to be supremely disgusted and look beyond the Democratic Party, particularly if Republicans put forward a good female candidate next year,'' Burk said.
Dole has said she is not interested in the No.
2 spot on the GOP ticket, but three Republican female senators emerged as leaders and up-and-comers in the party during the impeachment trial.
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas led an unsuccessful campaign to open the Senate's final, secret deliberations.
Maine's two senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan M.
Collins, teamed up to seek bipartisan agreement on a finding of fact proposal to rebuke the president.
That effort failed, too.
Ireland might try to enlist the Republican women in what she says will be a major effort this year to get Congress to strengthen sexual-harassment laws and beef up the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for better enforcement of civil rights laws.
``We're going to make every effort to capitalize on the Republican Congress's recently expressed and newfound interest in sexual-harassment laws and enforcement,'' Ireland said.
``Over and over they said, `We care'.
We say, `Fine, show us'. ''
WASHINGTON _ Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
, said Wednesday that the ``time is right'' for a woman to be on the Democratic ticket _ but she bristled at the notion that she is the most likely candidate.
``I can't read into the future.
I don't know what may happen or may not happen,'' Feinstein told California reporters over breakfast.
``I intend to be (a) United States senator''.
Gauging Feinstein's chances of being the Democratic vice presidential nominee is a popular _ though vexing _ pastime for many Washington pundits.
The former San Francisco mayor has long been regarded an attractive running mate for whoever wins the Democratic presidential nomination, and the speculation has intensified in light of polls indicating that Vice President Al Gore is struggling to maintain his advantage among women and Californians.
Feinstein provides little guidance, showing little interest or patience with the topic Displaying a coyness that has become a trademark during her 30-plus years in politics, Feinstein sipped orange juice and brushed aside questions attempting to assess her interest, acknowledging that such talk a year before the election ``makes me uncomfortable''.
``It builds up an expectation that I really don't see there,'' Feinstein said.
``I can't say what may happen.
... The probability is very strong that I will be United States senator''.
Feinstein told reporters that she is focused on the issues she believes will form the core of her re-election bid: Improving health care, preserving Lake Tahoe, restricting the sale of guns, eliminating the gasoline additive MTBE, and bringing together opposing sides in California's long-running water wars.
Feinstein is an overwhelming favorite to win re-election.
The only announced Republican challenger is Bill Horn, a member of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors who is almost completely unknown elsewhere in the state.
Although technically she can run for both senator and vice president at the same time, it would be awkward at best and could threaten what now appears to be an easy re-election, several aides said.
Then there is the indelicate matter of her age.
The only reason Feinstein would accept No.
2 is so she might someday be No.
1, her loyalists say.
Feinstein, who turned 66 last month, is not too old for the post _ now.
But if she were to serve two terms as vice president, Feinstein would be 75 by the time she sought the presidency _ older than Ronald Reagan when he ran for re-election.
Feinstein was courted as a potential running mate by Vice-President Walter Mondale in 1984, when she was mayor of San Francisco.
Her response to the initial inquiries then ring a familiar tone.
``I am interested in being mayor,'' she said at the time, adding that the vice presidency ``is not my interest.
I do not intend to pursue it.
I intend to continue to run San Francisco''.
Feinstein ultimately sought the nomination with vigor, but was passed over in favor of Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y.
The case for Feinstein as potential running mate is much stronger than it was 15 years ago.
In 1984 she was the mayor of a Democratic city; now she represents a state with 54 electoral votes _ 20 percent of the total needed to win the presidency.
She comes from the same ideological wing of the party as Vice-President Gore and former Sen.
Bill Bradley, the only two Democratic presidential candidates.
She has established herself as a lawmaker who is tough on crime, strong on public education, and is seen as a figure who can rise above the partisanship that is so out of favor.
With the exception of Hillary Clinton, Feinstein has emerged as the nation's most recognizable Democratic woman at precisely the time that the demand for female candidates appears to far outstrip the supply.
Of the party's six female senators and 39 representatives, none comes close to matching Feinstein in stature or electability.
No one argues with the political pressure on both parties to place women on their tickets.
`We've now established very strongly throughout this country that women have taken a historically unprecedented role in elections,'' Feinstein said.
``(They are) turing out in abundance, (they are) creating the kind of critical mass in numbers that can be very effective in electing officials''.
The speculation over Feinstein's candidacy may not reach a crescendo for a little more than a year, when Democrats gather in Los Angeles to formally nominate candidates for president and vice president.
For now, Feinstein is not only the leading female contender, but for most pundits she is the top contender.
``A woman with U.S.
Senate and big city mayoral experience who happens to be from the nation's largest state _ Wow!
She's surely a serious VP possibility with any presidential candidate,'' wrote Ron Faucheux, editor and publisher of Campaigns &AMP; Elections Magazine.
Feinstein's credentials look so good on paper that Parade Magazine put her on the cover this spring as one of five women most likely to become president by the year 2008.
Washingtonian magazine also names her the most likely VP nominee, calling a Gore-Feinstein ticket ``the closest thing the party can find to a Hollywood Dream Team''.
That is an image that some _ friends and foe _ dispute, and an event late in the 1994 Senate campaign provides a telling example.
It was a Saturday night, and President Clinton was in San Francisco at the Fairmont Hotel, extolling Feinstein's virtues and raising money for her re-election before a large crowd of wealthy contributors.
Feinstein was not there.
She had remained in Washington to cast a vote against Clinton's top legislative priority at the time _ the North American Free Trade Agreement.
``She doesn't have a No.
2 personality,'' said an aide.
``What happens,'' speculated another associate, ``when President Gore wants to do one thing, and Vice President Feinstein wants to do another''?
Of course, aides to former Sen.
Lyndon Johnson probably felt the same way in 1960.
WASHINGTON _ Whether President Clinton corrupted Monica Lewinsky is a subject for clergymen.
That he has corrupted the language in undeniable.
Caught having sex with the intern, he denied having ``sexual relations''.
It's the listener's fault, he insisted last month on national television, for not catching his drift.
He regretted having ``misled'' us.
The coming of September has brought a new cargo of verbal rubble.
It was not until Friday that the man who admitted to a liaison that was ``not appropriate'' could be coaxed to utter the two words that properly express an apology.
Again, the blame for the failed communication is hung on the listener.
From Moscow, a disappointed Clinton says that he has gone to the trouble of re-reading his Aug.
17 televised speech to the nation and can find no deficiency.
Again, it must be the listener's fault.
If the man in the Oval Office remains tongued-tied about his behavior during all those 18 months in the room adjoining the Oval Office _ and all those seven months of brazen cover-up _ another American leader is teaching us the power of a few words spoken with conviction.
``I was present in the Roosevelt Room in January when the president categorically denied any sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
I believed him.
``His remarks last evening leave me with a deep sense of sadness in that my trust in his credibility had been badly shattered''.
This was Sen.
Dianne Feinstein's morning-after reaction to the president's address on Aug.
17. Feinstein, D-Calif.
, has issued no public statement since.
On the hottest topic in Washington, she has refused to give journalists what they desire most: words.
Yet, followed as it has been by these weeks of heavy silence, Feinstein's statement continues to echo, just as Clinton's can still be heard, thanks to the unforgiving videotape, making that dreadful, point-of-no-return denial back in January.
``... I want to say one thing to the American people,'' Clinton said, his finger pointing into the camera like an Uncle Sam ``I WANT YOU'' poster.
``I want you to listen to me.
I'm going to say this again.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman...
Miss Lewinsky''.
To Feinstein, those unforgettable, unretractable words were not those of a politician denying something for which he was embarrassed.
They were the words of a political contract: I'm telling you the truth.
Now, you go out and defend me.
Today Clinton must contend with the outrage of those who spent winter, spring and summer honoring their end of that contract _ only to learn it was all a sham.
In this twilight struggle, the senator from California has been especially eloquent, conveying the disquiet of her soul in the quiet of her bearing.
Such discretion is enviable in today's climate.
Where Feinstein has avoided the contamination of the Lewinsky Affair, others have not been so lucky.
She has learned the hard way that once a few words have been spoken on this sordid affair, the surest way to protect your honor is to keep your distance; the best way to declare your outrage is to keep an impressive silence .
WASHINGTON _ In an effort to resolve bitter differences over data encryption, Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
, brokered a meeting Tuesday between several prominent high-tech executives and top law enforcement officials.
The closed-door discussion brought together for the first time FBI Director Louis Freeh, Attorney General Janet Reno and such high-tech leaders as Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates to review the data-scrambling technology, which keeps computer communications private.
Freeh wants the FBI to be able to access encryption codes for wire-tapping and other criminal investigations.
The computer industry contends that such efforts threaten privacy and free speech.
The Clinton administration also wants to maintain controls over exports of U.S. encryption technology.
The industry argues that the controls put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage, hamper innovation and ultimately undermine their lead in technology.
Feinstein, a strong law-enforcement supporter, is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's panel on technology, terrorism and government information.
Feinstein said in a statement that she has ``developed a strong interest'' in encryption, and that when she learned that Freeh ``had not had the opportunity to talk directly with the CEOs of American high-tech companies regarding his concerns,'' she offered to organize a meeting.
``I have always believed that when there are areas of disagreement, it is helpful to bring the principals together to talk face to face,'' said Feinstein, for ``frank and informal discussion''.
The meeting allied Gates with some computer executives who have frequently been his harshest critics _ Jim Barksdale, president of Netscape; Scott McNealy, chief executive officer of Sun Microsystems; and Eric Schmidt, chief executive officer of Novell _ as well as Steve Case, chief executive officer of America Online.
Other law enforcement officials included Thomas Constantine, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Bobby Moody, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and William Murphy, president of the National District Attorneys Association.
All declined to divulge details about the meeting.
WASHINGTON _ Dianne Feinstein's easy ride to re-election is over.
Though Feinstein remains the favorite, Rep.
Tom Campbell's entry Tuesday into California's 2000 Senate race immediately transformed the sleepy contest into a spirited showdown of national significance.
Campbell's experience, fund-raising ability and moderate positions instantly make him the front-runner in a crowded field of largely unknown GOP candidates.
Feinstein must now engage in a far more aggressive campaign, while Democratic Party leaders no longer will be able to ignore the California contest in favor of headline grabbers such as Hillary Rodham Clinton's quest for a New York Senate seat.
And the sudden intensity diminishes the likelihood that Feinstein will be named to the Democratic ticket as either Al Gore or Bill Bradley's running mate.
``Tom Campbell has won elections,'' said Jim Jordan, political director for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee.
``He's a serious person and not a joke''.
Feinstein, who abhors campaigning perhaps more than any other politician at her level, must now gird for another tough contest, her fourth statewide battle of the decade.
``Campbell is a much smarter, more experienced and much more adroit candidate'' than Feinstein's previous Senate opponents, said Dan Schnur, a GOP strategist who served as former Gov.
Pete Wilson's communications director.
``This will be her toughest race since she lost to Pete Wilson (in 1990)''.
Even before Campbell entered the race, Feinstein's camp maintained that they took nothing for granted.
However, none of the other candidates _ Ron Unz, Ray Haynes, Bill Horn or J.P.
Gough _ has Campbell's electoral advantages.
``He's the best candidate that Republicans have in the field,'' said Jennifer Duffy, an editor for the Cook Report, a nonpartisan political newsletter that handicaps congressional races.
``She may not have to run a marathon,'' Duffy said of Feinstein's race for re-election, ``but she's going to break a sweat''.
Campbell, a Stanford Law professor who is regarded by colleagues as perhaps the most cerebral member of Congress, said he will base his Senate run on the intellectual notion of individual liberty.
``I believe a person should have a personal life as free from government intrusion as possible,'' Campbell said.
It is from that belief that Campbell says he draws his support for legal abortions, as well as his opposition to a personal income tax (which he says should be replaced by a national sales tax).
It will be a tough sell in a contest against a woman whom &LR; Campbell has so far refused to criticize.
``Senator Feinstein has been a good senator,'' Campbell said Tuesday.
``I believe I could be a better senator''.
Though his moderation will be an asset in the contest with Feinstein, he must first convince conservative Republican primary voters that he is their best choice.
At a news conference last night in Washington, Campbell said no less than five times that he was a ``fiscal conservative,'' touting his support of small government and less taxes.
``I'm as fiscally conservative as anyone in the field,'' Campbell said, ``and I'm someone who's got a chance to actually win''.
No matter how eloquent Campbell gets &LR; may be on the stump, the case against Feinstein will be hard to make.
She is a respected political moderate, as Republican Senate candidate Matt Fong _ who lost to Barbara Boxer last year _ seemed to concede when he repeatedly commended Feinstein in his stump speech, declaring that Boxer ``is no Dianne Feinstein''.
Now that she is their opponent, Republicans have begun to portray Feinstein as less accommodating, insisting the crowning achievements of her Senate career _ the creation of a new national park in the Mojave Desert and the enactment of a ban on assault weapons _ are not so popular in the burgeoning suburbs and inland cities far from the coast.
``Barbara Boxer was far left, and Dianne Feinstein is moderate left,'' said Fong, who is now a state co-chair of George W.
Bush's campaign.
Fong said Feinstein's GOP opponent in 1995, former Rep.
Michael Huffington, ``who was not exactly a first-tier candidate, showed that Dianne Feinstein is vulnerable''.
Of course, what Huffington had in ample supply was money, pumping $29 million of his own resources into the campaign.
Fong, who has yet to endorse a candidate in the GOP race, said the best candidate will be ``whomever can raise the most money''.
Republicans also are counting on the strong coattails of the GOP presidential nominee to help whomever runs against Feinstein.
``The political climate is going to be significantly better for Tom Campbell in 2000 than it was for Matt Fong running in 1998,'' said Steve Schmidt, who was Fong's communication director.
Republicans will go after Feinstein for her strong political connections to China _ she is on close terms with Chinese President Jiang Zemin _ as well as her husband's business ties to the country.
``At the same time that we're looking into accusations of Chinese spying, she's having dinner with Jiang Zemin,'' said Stuart DeVeaux, a spokesman for the California Republican Party.
For all of the potential lines of attack, Feinstein enjoys a broad base of support.
A Field Poll released last week showed her favorable ratings well above 50 percent.
``Feinstein has demonstrated she can be an independent voice for the people of California,'' said her campaign manager, Kam Kuwata, in what is likely to emerge as a campaign theme.
Campbell's announcement puzzled many observers _ and not only because it was made after sunset from the Republican Party headquarters on Capitol Hill.
Why leave a safe House seat to take on an incumbent with great poll numbers, proven fund-raising ability and a strong bipartisan reputation?
Those who know him say Campbell has grown increasingly frustrated in the House, where he has always been treated as an outsider.
Campbell has consistently voted against his GOP colleagues on matters ranging from abortion to gun control, and he was one of only seven Republicans to vote against Newt Gingrich's bid to be re-elected as speaker in January 1997.
That, coupled with pressure from Stanford University to choose between a career in politics or academia, pushed Campbell into making the gamble.
``He hates it in the House,'' said a Democratic member who asked not to be identified.
``I think he believes he has nothing to lose.''
WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday approved a measure that would help guarantee access to cheap generic AIDS drugs for African countries that have been devastated by the epidemic.
The measure's approval was a major defeat for the American pharmaceutical industry, which had pressed Congress to stop foreign countries from producing generic versions of their drugs.
But AIDS groups applauded the measure's approval, saying the price of AIDS drugs is critical because the vast majority of the world's HIV and AIDS cases are in developing countries, where people can't afford expensive drug cocktails.
``In the case of drugs that can give men, women and children a new lease on life, we should not be bickering over obscure trade policy,'' said Daniel Zingale, executive director for AIDS Actions, a Washington advocacy group.
Although exact figures are unavailable, generic drugs tend to be significantly cheaper than brand name AIDS drugs, which can cost $12,000 to $15,000 a year.
The conflict pitting intellectual property rights vs.
access to AIDS drugs began in 1997.
That's when South Africa passed legislation allowing it to circumvent Western pharmaceutical firms by granting small local companies permission to produce their own AIDS drugs, or import them from countries, such as India, that make cheaper generic versions.
However, trade officials and lobbyists for U.S. drug companies have fought back, pressing Congress to protect intellectual property rights.
U.S. drug companies appeared poised to win a battle in that fight early on Wednesday, when the Senate was considering an African trade bill that would have allowed the U.S.
Trade Representative to impose sanctions on Sub-Saharan African countries that produce cheaper generic versions of U.S.
AIDS drugs.
But Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
, persuaded Republican leaders to accept an amendment to the trade bill that would allow those African countries to continue to produce their copycat AIDS drugs.
Feinstein said banning these generic AIDS drugs in Africa would have caused needless suffering and death in countries where AIDS is so widespread it is a public health emergency.
``If you don't have generic drugs, you effectively say that people in Africa are not going to get the treatment that can sustain life,'' Feinstein said in an interview.
Speaking on the Senate floor, Feinstein said about 34 million people in Africa _ about the size of the population of California _ are infected with HIV or AIDS.
About one-third, or 11.5 million these people, have died from the disease, she said.
She said those deaths represent 83 percent of the total HIV and AIDS-related deaths worldwide.
``The impact of AIDS in Africa is huge,'' Feinstein said.
``It continues to be a major threat to the well being of the entire African continent.
... It is clearly in the national interest to prevent the further spread of HIV\AIDS in Africa,'' she said.
Seeking her second full term in the U.S.
Senate, Democrat Dianne Feinstein has more campaign money than all of her would-be opponents combined, a commanding lead in public opinion polls and virtually no opposition for her party's own nomination.
And she has been biding her time during the primary campaign, confidently preparing to take on Rep.
Tom Campbell, the presumptive Republican nominee, in November.
This may not be as good as it gets in politics, but this is as good as it has ever been for Feinstein.
``People know me,'' she told the Chronicle during an interview last weekend.
``We take the public trust very seriously, and I think people believe, by and large, that I've honored my commitments''.
It's a long way from 10 years ago, when Feinstein, now 67, was running for governor and was booed at a state Democratic convention for declaring her support for the death penalty.
Feinstein was the outsider then, running for the nomination against Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who had the support of virtually every major state Democrat.
She won the primary and lost narrowly to Republican Pete Wilson.
Two years later, she ran for the Senate.
She defeated John Seymour, Wilson's hand-picked successor, and got more votes than any Senate candidate in American history.
In 1994, because she was finishing Wilson's incomplete term, Feinstein was on the ballot again, running for re-election against Republican Rep.
Michael Huffington.
Huffington spent $30 million attacking Feinstein and came within 163,000 votes of defeating her.
But today she holds a commanding lead in the polls: 5 to 1 over Campbell in the most recent Field Poll, more than 2 to 1 over all Republican opponents combined.
Her support cuts across party lines, cuts across ethnic and gender lines and runs the gamut of the political spectrum.
``She's perceived as carrying herself with dignity and grace, as a senator who's knowledgeable, on the job, paying attention to what's going on,'' said pollster Mervin Field.
A centrist who snubs the outer edges of political ideology, Feinstein ``has not done or said anything that turns the California public off,'' Field said.
In fact, Feinstein even seized the middle ground during the impeachment controversy, expressing outrage at President Clinton's personal conduct while maintaining support for his policies.
It was ``the perfect position,'' said Field.
``Dianne has always appealed to the same middle everybody talked about Clinton appealing to,'' said veteran Democratic strategist Darry Sragow.
``It took people a long time to figure that out because she was the mayor of San Francisco, and they assumed she had to be a liberal.
She's always been a centrist''.
As such, she has benefited from the public perception that Clinton's centrist policies have been effective in spurring the nation's economic boom, and that she has been a consistent supporter of legislation to drive down the federal budget deficit.
She also has benefited from one major centrist move by Clinton _ turning gun control into a tough-on-crime position, which Feinstein has embraced as a central issue to her legislative career.
She is at her most passionate when decrying the ``trickle-down of guns to children'' and the ``nation awash in guns,'' and vowing to push through yet more legislation that will regulate the sale and distribution of handguns and assault rifles.
Her popularity in California is one reason she is frequently mentioned as a possible running mate for Vice President Al Gore, should he win the Democratic presidential nomination.
She would be permitted to run for both vice president and senator on the same ballot.
Feinstein has endorsed Gore, but she declined to comment on the possibility of running with him.
``I don't pay attention to it.
If it were to happen, I'd certainly think about it,'' she said.
Feinstein also recalled that she was mentioned in the same way in 1984, when then-Democratic nominee Walter Mondale selected New York Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro as his vice presidential running mate.
Meanwhile, Feinstein is sitting on a campaign treasury of more than $2.6 million.
She also has in place a veteran team of campaign advisers, many of whom have been with her through all her campaigns of the past decade.
Her only opposition in the Democratic primary is Emeryville attorney Michael Schmier, who admits he has no money with which to mount a challenge against Feinstein.
He is running largely to protest the dwindling number of appellate cases that are published for public review.
Feinstein's time has been spent preparing for the general election.
Last year, her campaign spent nearly $900,000 on an intense telemarketing campaign, signing up small donors in the $5 to $10 range who also will commit to doing volunteer work when it comes time to turn out voters at the end of the campaign.
Campaign manager Kam Kuwata said the telemarketing effort has raised more than $1.1 million in small donations and has generated a list of more than 125,000 people who will serve as a grassroots army.
``We're still trying to figure out if we're going to go on TV in the primary.
We haven't made that decision,'' said Kuwata.
Feinstein campaign officials say they want to see what kind of advertising Campbell airs.
He is expected to begin a statewide TV advertising effort late this week or early next week.
Campbell began his campaign with a call for replacing the income tax with a national sales tax and allowing local governments to initiate programs to provide free drugs to drug addicts.
His unconventional proposals mystified Feinstein and her top advisers.
``He's sort of a strange candidate,'' said Feinstein media consultant Bill Carrick.
``I don't take him for granted, but I think the campaign will play itself out in less than traditional ways''.
That would be much to the evident relief of Feinstein, who still has unpleasant memories of the the race against Huffington, who ran ads on television all but two weeks of the 11-month campaign.
Huffington's blitz began in January, when he bought a full minute of TV prime time during the telecast of the Winter Olympics and attacked Feinstein for her vote supporting the Clinton administration's budget deficit reduction package.
Feinstein was watching at home, and ``my gut went, `Oooohhh,' '' she said.
Asked how her gut reacted when she saw that Campbell began this campaign with a call for a national sales tax and a drug giveaway, Feinstein said, ``My gut relaxed.''
SACRAMENTO _ U.S.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein's Republican opponent charged Thursday that her support of normalizing trade with China could financially benefit her billionaire husband, Richard Blum.
GOP Rep.
Tom Campbell said Feinstein left blanks on her 1999 federal statement of economic interests that could mask substantial investment in China by Blum.
In 1997, Blum said he had invested as much as $2 million in various Chinese ventures.
Feinstein said Thursday that she and her husband dumped all their investments in China after the May 1999 economic statement was filed.
In the past, she insisted she maintained a ``fire wall'' between her senatorial duties and Blum's far-flung financial dealings.
``Neither Dianne nor her husband have any holdings in mainland China,'' said Kam Kuwata, Feinstein's campaign manager.
``We fill out these forms very carefully.
If Dianne Feinstein had done something that's not complete, wouldn't we have heard about it''?
The issue of her husband's investments has dogged Feinstein since she was elected to the Senate in 1992.
The possibility of a conflict of interest was raised in 1996 by her last GOP opponent, Mike Huffington.
Campbell, who has vowed not to make Blum's far-flung business dealings an issue, said Thursday he was criticizing Feinstein, not Blum, for failing to disclose the scope of the couple's holdings.
``Failure to disclose is the senator's responsibility,'' Campbell said.
``You go to the pages.
You see empty columns.
That's her responsibility''.
But Kuwata said Campbell was wrong when he said Feinstein had left the value of 14 investments blank.
The value is listed later, Kuwata said, under each investment's assets, not after its title.
Campbell said Feinstein could settle the issue by releasing her 2000 economic statement, which was filed earlier this month with the Senate Ethics Committee.
Under its normal policy, the committee will make the document public next month.
That will be after the Senate vote on granting China permanent normal trade status.
``I think we'll abide by the rules of the ethics committee, not Tom Campbell's requests,'' Kuwata said.
In 1997, when Feinstein's opposition to stripping China of most favored nation trading status led to questions of the benefit to Blum's investments, Blum promised that any future profits from China would be donated to the American Himalayan Foundation.
Blum founded the charity in 1979 to help Tibetans oppressed by the Chinese government.
``This should remove any perception that I, in any way...
benefit from or influence my wife's position on China,'' Blum told The Chronicle at the time.
Kuwata said none of Blum's Chinese investments turned a profit.
The 1999 statement does show Blum maintaining a $100,000 to $250,000 investment in Newbridge Capital Ltd.
, a Hong Kong-based joint venture that coordinates Blum's investments in China.
One of Blum's limited partnerships that holds an interest in Newbridge is Golden China, L.P., whose assets were listed at between $500,000 to $1 million.
Golden China was valued at between $250,000 and $500,000 in Feinstein's 1996 financial disclosure statement.
Feinstein's 1999 statement also included another limited partnership called Shanghai Pacific Partners.
It was valued at less than $1,000.
On her 1996 form, Shanghai Pacific Partners was valued between $500,000 and $1 million .
WASHINGTON _ Sen.
Dianne Feinstein detoured from the Democratic leadership Thursday, vowing to vote this fall for a Republican-led constitutional amendment that would empower Congress to ban flag desecration.
California's senior senator said she has believed since childhood that the American flag is a ``unique representation of our Democratic union'' and ``much more than a piece of cloth''.
In 1995, Feinstein joined 49 Republicans and 13 other Democrats in voting for a flag-protection amendment, but it fell three votes short of the necessary two-thirds majority.
She likened the flag to the Constitution, and said burning and desecrating it goes well beyond the free speech protections provided in the Constitution's First Amendment.
``To me that isn't speech _ it's conduct,'' she said in an interview.
``In the form of shorts or a T-shirt, it's a piece of cloth,'' Feinstein said.
``But in the form of the flag, it's very special...
There are two things that unify us, language and our flag''.
``The flag is the overwhelming symbol of our nation,'' Feinstein said.
``People die for it ...
The American flag holds a unique position in our society as the most important and widely recognized representation of our freedom and unity''.
Feinstein, 65, said she recalls seeing a newspaper photo of Marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima in the final months of World War II.
``It was one of the most graphic images I have ever seen,'' Feinstein said.
``At the same time that those soldiers raised the flag, they raised the hopes and the spirits of the entire nation''.
Veterans groups have lobbied for the amendment this year and in the past.
``This is a very big issue for them,'' Feinstein said, adding that many soldiers ``carried the flag into battle and died for it''.
The flag amendment has wide support from Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
, whose support is crucial for moving the issue to the floor for a vote.
Spearheading the amendment is Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G.
Hatch, R-Utah.
Feinstein's position runs counter to that of many Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Thomas A.
Daschle, D-S.D.
, who has said the flag is important, ``but freedom of speech is more important''.
Other foes of the amendment say flag burnings or other methods of flag desecration are extremely rare and don't warrant altering the Constitution.
The Citizens Flag Alliance, a group pushing the amendment, says it can count 64 senators for the amendment, which needs 67 votes or two-thirds of the senators present to pass.
The proposed amendment, which would carve out an exception to the First Amendment by giving Congress the power to enact laws against flag desecration, has already won House approval.
If it passes the Senate, the amendment would require ratification by three-fourths of the states.
Polls indicate a majority of voters favor the flag amendment and 49 states have passed resolutions asking Congress to approve it.
The flag amendment would overturn U.S.
Supreme Court rulings in 1989 and 1990 that struck down state and federal flag desecration laws as unconstitutional violations of freedom of speech.
In June 1997, the House voted 310-114 House vote in favor of the amendment.
The 1995 flag amendment passed the House by a 312-120 vote before failing in the Senate.
That amendment would have allowed state legislatures as well as Congress to enact flag-protection laws .
WASHINGTON _ With one arm around each of the grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez, Sen.
Dianne Feinstein on Friday reassured them that American law is on their side and predicted their grandson will be returned to his father in Cuba.
After meeting for 45 minutes with Raquel Rodriguez and Mariela Quintana, Feinstein described them as ``heartbroken'' and ``sobbing'' and said she would do ``whatever I can'' to protect their rights.
``I have just spent some time with two women who were very intimidated, very fearful and very concerned,'' Feinstein, D-Calif.
, said outside her Senate office.
``Grandmothers should not have to go through this and politics should not enter into it,'' she said.
``I believe that justice is going to find its way.
I just hope it's soon because politics and political movements shouldn't use children to meet their priorities''.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service has ordered the American relatives of Elian Gonzalez, 6, to return the boy to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in Cuba.
Elian Gonzalez, who was 5 at the time, was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov.
25 after the boat carrying him to the United States capsized, killing his mother, her boyfriend and nine other people.
Meanwhile Friday, the Florida nun whose Miami Beach home was used earlier in the week for a meeting between the boy and his grandmothers abruptly threw off her impartiality and came out in favor of keeping the boy in the United States.
Following a meeting with members of Congress in Washington, Dominican Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin said: ``The child has been in the torment of the seas and now he's been in the torment of political agendas.
Somehow we must find for him calm seas, at least for a while''.
O'Laughlin also met with Attorney General Jane Reno in hopes of persuading her to withdraw the INS order to send the boy back to Cuba.
But Reno, who oversees the immigration agency, refused to budge.
``I continue to believe, based on all the information available to me, including the information that Sister Jeanne shared with me, that the person who speaks for this child is his one surviving parent _ his father,'' Reno said in a statement released after the meeting.The grandmothers spent a third day Friday meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
Besides Feinstein, the women met with Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
, and Reps.
Maxine Waters, D-Calif.
, and George R.
Nethercutt Jr.
, R-Wash.
Feinstein said she told Rodriguez and Quintana that U.S. law and immigration policies are on their side.
``Elian has a father who loves him and has a home for him in Cuba.
In our society there are basic rights _ that includes the right of a father to have a son back''.
Feinstein called congressional efforts to grant Elian Gonzalez citizenship so he can remain with his Florida relatives are ``terrible''.
Gonzalez's relatives in Florida are fighting to prevent his return to Cuba, arguing that it was the wish of his mother for the boy to live in the United States.
Feinstein, however, said ``a gold chain, a baseball cap, a trip to Disney Land and American razzle-dazzle'' are confusing the 6-year-old boy.
She added that if the Cuban boy returns home and the father decides to bring Elian back to the United States ``on his own volition, that's another story''.

It certainly is easy to get fat in America.
Take the room service breakfast at the Marriott Hotel in Gaithersburg, Md.
If you order a bagel and orange juice, what comes is two huge bagels, orange juice, a banana and strawberries _ a meal with at least 1,000 calories.
Clearly, some people are succumbing to temptation.
Last week, in a special issue devoted to obesity, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a litany of bad news.
Americans are eating more than ever, increasing their average number of calories year by year.
And the percentage of adults who claim they are physically inactive remained nearly flat from 1991 to 1998, at about 29 percent.
The combination of more calories and little exercise yields a predictable result: Americans are getting fatter every year.
More than half are now overweight and nearly 18 percent are obese _ more than 30 percent above ideal body weight, according to an official medical measure of fatness.
(Overweight is defined as a body mass index of 25 to 29; obese is an index of at least 30.
Your body mass index is 4.89 times your weight in pounds divided by the square of your height in feet).
And obesity is not just a social stigma _ it is associated with poor health, from diabetes to heart ailments to gall bladder disease.
To make things worse, a hormone called leptin that was supposed to be the magic bullet for obesity, making people effortlessly lose fat while retaining muscle, looks like a bust.
In a preliminary study reported last week, most people who took leptin lost little or no weight _ one fat person who took the highest dose actually gained 20 pounds.
Medical experts disagree about where the nation goes from here.
Some fear that without a national anti-obesity campaign, the future could hold more bad news.
Others say there may in fact be a magic bullet for obesity one day, thanks to the miracles of molecular biology.
And these experts say the pathway to a truly effective obesity drug is being illuminated by the very hormone, leptin, that has proved so disappointing.
The doomsayers look around and see a national disaster, an obesity epidemic that shows no signs of abating.
Every time it seems that Americans can get no fatter, they gain a bit more weight.
These experts foresee an ever-ballooning population gobbling ever greater quantities of food while getting ever less exercise.
The Journal of the American Medical Association exhorted doctors to counsel fat patients about diet and exercise.
It also called for a campaign to combat Americans' growing girths.
If the nation can mount a national effort against cigarettes, why not do the same for obesity, the journal asked in an editorial.
``The time has come to develop a national comprehensive obesity prevention strategy that incorporates educational, behavioral and environmental components analogous to those already in place for tobacco use,'' the journal said.
Those who expect a pharmacological fix see the beginning of a new age of drug development that will find molecules that make fat people lose interest in eating to excess.
Perhaps the drugs should be reserved for those cursed with the most stubborn obesity, some researchers say, but at the very least they should help very fat people who cannot control their weight.
The optimism comes from work that began with the discovery of leptin, the first molecule ever found that acts on the brain as part of a natural weight control system.
As such, it has revealed molecular pathways that may lead to truly effective and precisely targeted weight loss drugs.
``This is my prediction,'' said Dr.
Steven Heymsfield, who is deputy director of the obesity research center at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York and who directed the recent leptin study.
``We are going to be able to turn off appetite completely _ eventually.
The therapeutics will be sophisticated enough to stop people from eating''.
He added that while there are certainly social and environmental influences on body weight _ people who live in Southern states tend to be fatter, poor people tend to be fatter _ eventually obesity will be controlled just like high cholesterol levels.
Those who cannot, or will not, control their levels through diet can take a pill.
``I got into the field 10 years ago, when there was still this lingering idea that psychological factors and gluttony or a lack of willpower were the underlying explanations for why so many people were overweight,'' Heymsfield said.
``Seven or eight years ago, the first studies came out saying that genetics is very, very important, but at that point most people felt that it would be one or two decades before we went from knowing that fact to a molecular discovery''.
With the discovery of leptin in 1994, Heymsfield said, ``People were shocked''.
That discovery came when scientists reported that leptin made genetically fat mice stop eating and become thin.
The next year, the hormone was found in people.
At first many researchers hoped that obesity would turn out to be a simple matter of a leptin deficiency: give the hormone to fat people and they will get thin.
But it turned out that overweight people make plenty of leptin.
Despite an assiduous search, scientists have found only a half-dozen people in the world whose bodies produce no leptin.
These people eat voraciously _ one 3-year-old girl consumed 2,000 calories at a sitting.
When several of these people were treated with leptin, they lost their appetites and their weight plummeted.
Now some experts suggest that the hormone's role is to signal the brain that there is fat on the body. nn
When the federal government held its first summit meeting on nutrition 31 years ago, the principal food problem was hunger, and the proposed solutions were improvements in food stamps and the establishment of the WIC program for infants, children, and pregnant women.
This week, the second national nutrition summit found a twofold problem: hunger and obesity.
Combating the latter is complex, and Washington is doing less than it could to improve American diets.
In three decades, much progress has been made in getting food to those who need it.
Still, a combination of high housing costs, the unevenness of the economic boom's benefits, and restrictions on food stamps and other programs forces many Americans to ask for help in finding their daily bread.
In a survey of mayors last year, 85 percent reported that requests for emergency food assistance had grown, by an average of 18 percent.
At the same time, the nation's other great nutrition problem is obesity, now reaching epidemic proportions.
One fifth of all Americans are obese, raising their risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.
Several sessions of this week's summit explore how schools, employers, restaurants, and the media can change the patterns of eating and inactivity that lead to obesity.
The summit took place just days after the government updated its dietary guidelines, as it does every five years, and for the first time specifically recommended exercise to help avoid obesity.
But the government caved in to the sugar industry by rejecting language favored by its own panel of scientists calling on consumers to ``limit'' sugar intake.
Instead, the guidelines say Americans should ``moderate'' their sugar consumption.
The wording change followed a massive lobbying effort by the sugar processing industry, which has contributed $1.2 million to senators since 1995.
In March, 30 senators signed a letter making the extraordinary argument that there is no proven link between sugar and obesity.
Government was a public health leader in pointing to the obvious relationship between cigarettes and cancer, when the tobacco industry was raising bogus questions about scientific proof.
Now, government can't seem to connect a candy bar with an unhealthy paunch.
CHICAGO (AP) --Obesity is not as dangerous for elderly people as it is for the middle-aged or young adults, researchers reported today in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The findings are similar to those in a study reported last year that indicated being overweight shortens life expectancy up to age 75, but does not make much of a difference afterwards unless people are extremely obese.
``The absolute risk of dying gets higher and higher as you get older until you die, but the importance of obesity as a risk factor decreases,'' said Ralf Bender, an obesity researcher at the University of Bielefeld in Germany and principal author of the latest study.
Other researchers said the findings are not that meaningful.
``Obesity is a major public health problem at any age, and this study does nothing to suggest that that has changed,'' said Dr.
JoAnn Manson, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School.
In the latest study, researchers studied 6,193 obese men and women who ranged in age from 18 to 74, following them for an average of 14.8 years.
The patients, who were referred to an obesity clinic between 1961 and 1994, were grouped by their age and body mass index.
Body mass index, or BMI, is increasingly becoming the standard way of talking about obesity, since it is an easy way to compare the girth of people of different heights.
BMI is body fat in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
According to dietary guidelines issued by the Department of Agriculture, a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight and 30 and above is obese.
Researchers found that the mortality risk for a really obese person --with a BMI of 40 or more -- was highest for those age 30 or younger.
Moderately obese men and women --with a BMI between 32 and 40 -- who were age 50 or older had the lowest mortality risk, the study says.
Some researchers not involved with the study argued that BMI is a limited measure of obesity in the elderly because bone density declines with age.
They also noted that the study participants were recruited rather than randomly selected.
WASHINGTON _ Former U.S.
Surgeon General Dr.
C. Everett Koop launched an Internet site Thursday to help overweight people ``lose weight in a healthy manner and keep off the pounds for good''.
``At a time when obesity is escalating to epidemic levels, it is important to reach Americans with solution-oriented information on weight control,'' Koop said at a news copnference to unveil the Shape Up and Drop 10 site (www.shapeup.org).
The number of obese Americans has more than tripled since 1991 to 90 million, and recent estimates suggest that obesity-related diseases may cost Americans more than $100 billion annually.
For a registration fee of $15 and $10 a week thereafter, adults 18 and over can join the pay-as-you-go program and select a plan that fits their needs.
It allows individuals to: _ Set personal weight management goals, including weight loss or prevention of weight gain.
_ Choose each day's meal and snack from four types of diets _ basic, non-dairy, lacto-ovo or vegan.
_ Control calories both at home and when eating out.
_ Choose from five different physical activity plans.
_ Determine each week what weight management challenges need to be addressed.
The proceeds from Shape Up and Drop 10 will support Shape Up America, a non-profit nationwide network founded by Koop that developed the site, and organizations representing the leading associations in the field of medicine, public health and physical activity.
Whatever's left over will be used to underwrite weight loss programs, said Dr.
Barbara J.
Moore, president of Shape Up America.
Moore said people may get better results with Shape Up and Drop 10 than they might get with their personal physicians.
``Their personal physicians spend only eight minutes with them (per visit), which is not enough time,'' Moore said.
She added that because physicians can charge as much as $150 per visit, people can't afford to visit their doctors weekly for weight loss tips.
Since leaving the surgeon general's office in 1989, Koop has been involved in another Internet venture, drkoop.com, which aides say helps people manage their personal health with comprehensive, trustworthy information.
Koop is also the Elizabeth DeCamp McInerny professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.

At the same news conference Thursday, Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's non-voting delegate to Congress, promoted her legislation to encourage healthy diets and physical activity.
Norton said her $15 million Lifelong Improvements in Food and Exercise (LIFE) Act, introduced in Congress late last year, is designed to address the 300,000 cases of preventable disease estimated to result each year from unhealthy diets and physical inactivity.
``The underlying theme of the bill is that unhealthy lifestyles have gained such a foothold in every part of the country that only major intervention can affect existing runaway patterns in time,'' Norton said.

BOSTON (AP) _ Scientists have discovered another genetic flaw that seems to raise the risk of obesity.
Several genetic defects have already been found that increase the tendency to put on weight.
None of them, acting alone, appears to be a frequent cause of obesity.
The latest was discovered by Dr.
Michael Ristow and others from the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston.
It was reported in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
The defective gene produces the protein for peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2.
It is involved in one of the steps in the production of fat cells.
The researchers, working with scientists in Cologne, Germany, looked for the defective gene in 358 German volunteers, 121 of whom were overweight.
Four of the obese people carried the mutated gene, but none of the normal-size people had it.
The researchers concluded that the bad gene increases growth in fat cells and contributes to obesity in some people.
LOS ANGELES, May 28 (Xinhua) --More than half of American citizens are overweight and one out of four is obese, according to the latest issue of Science.
"The prevalence of overweight has risen dramatically over the past two decades and, if this trend persists, the entire U.S. adult population could be overweight within a few generations," reported Dr.
James Hill, director of the Colorado Clinical Nutrition Research Unit, and Dr.
John Peters of the Procter and Gamble Company in Cincinnati, Ohio.
They said the root cause is a sedentary lifestyle combined with the ready availability of tasty, calorie-and-fat-rich food.
"This is especially evident in the so-called fast food restaurants where super sizing of menu items is commonplace," they wrote.
They pointed out that genetic factors are not to blame for oversized Americans, saying that genes can not have changed substantially in the last two generations.
They offered several options to prevent obesity.
First, obesity must be recognized as the serious public health problem.
Second, consumers must be educated to eat foods low in fat, such as fruit, vegetables and whole grains in restaurants and grocery stores.
Third, schools need to schedule more activity for youngsters, and children need to be encouraged to eat low-calorie, low-fat foods too.
A study of more than 1 million Americans provides the most convincing evidence yet that simply being overweight can cut your life short.
The study, the largest ever done on obesity and mortality, found that overweight people run a higher rate of premature death.
And this was true even among people who didn't smoke and were otherwise healthy during their middle years.
The study was conducted by the American Cancer Society and published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
It settles once and for all any lingering questions about whether weight alone increases the risk of death and disease, said Dr.
JoAnn Manson, a Harvard University endocrinologist and preventive-health specialist.
``The evidence is now compelling and irrefutable,'' Manson said.
``Obesity is probably the second-leading preventable cause of death in the United States after cigarette smoking, so it is a very serious problem''.
The study found an especially clear association between excess weight and a higher risk of dying from heart disease or cancer.
And unlike a similar study last year that suggested being overweight is less of a problem as people grow older, this study found many more deaths among overweight people of all ages, especially those over 75.
More adults and children are overweight than ever before, with 55 percent of American adults weighing more than they should.
``The message is we're too fat and it's killing us.
We need to come up with ways as a society to eat less and exercise more,'' said American Cancer Society epidemiologist Eugenia Calle, lead author of the study.
Manson said: ``It's going to take a coordinated campaign to turn this around, at the community level, at the environmental level, with changes in the food industry and marketing industry, having more bike paths and sidewalks''.
Black women were found to be the only exceptions to the rule.
The study found the most obese black women did not have a significantly higher risk of premature death than slender black women.
That poses a fascinating scientific riddle, said June Stevens, a University of North Carolina professor of nutrition.
``Although I had seen this in several other studies, I wasn't ready to believe it was true,'' she said.
``Now I'm thinking maybe this is true, and we need to figure out why''.
Still, Stevens and Manson said the study probably understates the risks of obesity for black women.
They pointed out that slender, non-smoking black women have a higher risk of death to begin with than their white counterparts, probably because they have less access to health care than white women and more undetected disease.
That makes it appear that weight alone doesn't play a big role in death rates among black women.
``It would be really unfortunate if we became more complacent about obesity in blacks than in whites,'' Manson said.
The researchers studied participants in the national Cancer Prevention Study II from 1982 through 1996.
The average age at enrollment was 57.
The researchers calculated each subject's body mass index, or BMI, a ratio of weight to height, and tracked them for age and cause of death.
The results were adjusted for age, education, physical activity, alcohol use, marital status, use of aspirin as a blood-thinner, consumption of fats and vegetables, and use of estrogen supplements.
Among healthy, non-smoking white men and women and black men, the researchers found a gradually increasing risk of death beginning with a BMI of 25, which is 150 pounds for a 5-foot-5 woman and 174 pounds for a 5-foot-10 man.
The fattest white men, with a BMI of 40 or more --278 pounds on a 5-foot-10 frame -- were 2.58 times more likely to die than their healthiest peers, men of the same height weighing 153 to 170 pounds.
White women with a BMI of 40 or greater --240 pounds for a 5-foot-5 woman -- were twice as likely to die as their counterparts who weighed 132 to 148 pounds.
Thin men and women also had higher death rates, but it was not clear whether their low weight was a cause or an effect of disease.
LOS ANGELES, September 24 (Xinhua) --A new study released Friday shows that most California residents are choosing fast-food over more nutritious choices -- and are paying for it with soaring rates of obesity.
According to statistics accumulated by the California Department of Health Services, nearly half of Californians who ate out on an average day chose a fast-food restaurant, up from one- third in 1989.
And the number of Californians who are overweight or obese jumped 50 percent between 1984 and 1997.
What's more, the rate of diabetes rose 25 percent during the same period.
Obesity is a known risk factor for adult-onset diabetes, heart disease, and some types of cancer.
"In California, it's expected that approximately 35,000 people will die this year from illnesses related to poor diet and physical inactivity," Dr.
James W.
Stratton, a state health officer, predicted Most Californians polled blame aggressive television advertising for their poor food choices, according to the report.
The new study is based on two surveys.
Dietary habits were assessed by telephone surveys conducted every other year starting in 1989, while information on weight and physical activity came from a separate yearly report conducted every year since 1984.
&UR; &QL; &LR; &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR; The culprit behind America's weight problem may not be what we eat but how much we eat.
Increasingly, health experts and researchers are naming the nation's penchant for large portions and ``supersizing'' as a leading cause of obesity.
Nearly 55 percent of Americans are overweight, a rate much higher than Asian or European nations, says Melanie Polk, a registered dietitian with the American Institute for Cancer Research, a not-for-profit organization focusing on the link between diet and cancer.
Although U.S. fat intake has dropped in the last 20 years from an average of 40 percent to 33 percent of calories consumed, the average daily calorie intake has risen from 1,854 to 2,002.
If exercise levels remain equal, that translates into a weight gain of 15 pounds a year, according to the National Institutes of Health.
``A major reason people are getting bigger,'' Polk says, ``is that their servings have gotten larger, and commercial food portions are a major culprit''.
French fries from McDonald's offer a clear example of the phenomenon.
An order of supersized fries has 540 calories and 26 grams of fat.
When the company began selling french fries in the 1950s, a small order _ the only one available _ had 220 calories and 12 grams of fat.
The institute also &LR; recently &LR; surveyed croissants &LR;, quesadillas &LR; and bagels, popular &LR; American &LR; foods adopted from other countries.
In each case, the item grew in size and calories when it was adapted for the American market.
The average Parisian croissant weighs slightly more than an ounce and is about 15 inches in circumference.
The typical American-style croissant weighs almost twice that and measures 181/2 inches.
And American-made croissants tend to have more sugar and fat, Polk says.
The bagel, seen as a healthy alternative to fattier breakfast pastries, has ballooned since its birth in Eastern Europe.
Even in its first 60 years in America, it stayed small and close to its European cousins _ about 11/2 to two ounces.
But today some bagels have more than doubled in size.
National bagel-maker Lender offers a 41/2-ounce ``Big and Crusty'' bagel; Dunkin Donuts' plain bagel is four ounces.
And people rarely eat bagels plain.
Adding fat-laden spreads like cream cheese and peanut butter boost the caloric content.
And the bigger the bagel, the more spread it can take.
&LR; Quesadillas have also morphed into calorie bombs since their immigration from Mexico, Polk says.
Small corn tortillas filled with potato, cheese and beans are common in northern Mexico, and cheese and chicken in five-inch corn tortillas are popular in other parts.
But in America, the most common quesadilla is a 10-inch flour tortilla filled with cheese.
Polk estimates the typical American-style quesadilla contains more than 1,200 calories and 70 grams of fat.
&LR; In other studies, nutritionists and researchers are nudging out the concept of ``bad foods'' like soda and fat in favor of focusing on the huge portion issue.
Two soda-consumption studies released this spring by researchers from Georgetown and Michigan State universities showed that overweight children consumed only two ounces more of sugared, carbonated soft drinks than than children who weren't overweight, and that soft drinks have not replaced milk in children's diets.
``If we want a villain to blame for increases in childhood obesity, then we should point our fingers at the real culprits _ huge portions of food and a lack of physical activity,'' says Maureen Storey of the &LR; Georgetown Center for Food and Nutrition Policy.
Calls to eliminate certain foods isn't a practical way to help children or adults lose weight, she says.
``We should get over this good food-bad food silliness and move on.''
UNDATED - Health specialists are calling it a ``fat epidemic,'' and no wonder with the latest numbers showing that more than half of Americans are overweight and one out of three adults is obese.
The fat and fatter trend has initiated more research into obesity than ever, especially in light of another group of findings linking extra weight to myriad serious health problems, including heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes and even some forms of cancer.
``Being overweight is not just a personal problem but a genuine public health threat,'' said University of Colorado obesity researcher James O.
Hill in the May issue of the journal ``Science''.
Yet although much has been learned about obesity, it's still a medical enigma that prompts more questions than there are answers.
What is known: Obesity is caused by a complicated interaction of environmental and genetic factors.
Up until 20 years ago, obesity was considered less a disease and more the end result of gluttony and a sedentary lifestyle.
Consuming more calories than you burn off is still the primary factor in most cases of obesity.
But geneticists now are recognizing that heredity plays a salient role also.
Arizona has been a focal point of considerable research in the area of obesity and genetics.
For the past 30 years, the Gila River Pimas have agreed to participate in generational studies on obesity.
The Pimas, as a group, have an unusually high incidence of obesity, which also has contributed to their highest recorded rates of diabetes in the world.
A Gila River Pima man has an 80 percent chance of becoming diabetic before he's 55, according to Dr.
David Harrowe, a public health officer for the tribe.
Obesity researcher Dr.
Eric Ravussin, formerly with the National Institutes of Health in the Phoenix area, has studied the Pimas, and was the focus of the February '98 ``New Yorker'' magazine article ``The Pima Paradox''.
He believes the Pimas' plight is tied closely to their genetic inheritance.
``As desert dwellers, the Pima evolved ``thrifty'' fat genes as a survival mechanism to help conserve fat during periods of famine,'' Ravussin said.
As long as they ate moderately and ate traditional low-fat foods of cholla-cactus buds, honey mesquite, prickly pears and tepary beans, squash and white-winged dove, their weight was kept in check during normal times.
But as the Pimas abandoned their traditional foods and began to eat like other Americans, and in mass quantities like other Americans, their thrifty fat genes became a liability.
Their new higher-fat diets were stored rather than metabolized, according to Ravussin.
Geneticist Murray Brilliant, a professor in the department of pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said it's not exactly clear what the Pima studies say about the non-Pima population.
``But, obviously, in every population there are people who have more thrifty genes than other people,'' Brilliant said.
``If that wasn't the case, then everybody who ate the same thing would be the same weight''.
There's also overwhelming evidence that obesity is linked to hormonal irregularities.
Obesity specialist Dr.
Donald Robertson of the Southwest Bariatric Nutrition Center in Scottsdale, Ariz.
, said the consensus among researchers is that a fat cell is actually an endocrine organ.
``Like a thyroid or adrenal, it produces its own hormone, called leptin,'' Robertson said.
``Understanding how leptin works seems to be a key in treating obesity''.
It's generally believed that leptin signals the brain to stop eating, which creates the sensation of satiation, or feeling full.
However, this signal does not get through properly in some overweight people.
Consequently, scientists have tried to inject synthetic leptin, hoping this would stimulate the satiation response.
But preliminary findings indicate the weight-regulating hormone leptin isn't the miracle fat cure some hoped it would be.
Endocrinologist Dr.
Antonio Tataranni worked with Ravussin in Phoenix at the National Institutes of Health in the study of Pimas and obesity.
His work with hormone anomalies has convinced him that obesity has a physiological basis.
``I don't think there's any question that obesity is a disease,'' Tataranni said.
``It's a matter of understanding how hormones stimulate different areas of the brain''.
On occasion, obesity research has turned up the unexpected.
A London study in 1995 connected overeating with pathological behavior.
People who are overweight often say they don't understand their weight gain because they ``practically eat nothing at all''.
Yet the London study showed that people who are fat dramatically underestimate their food intake (up to 50 percent), especially the high caloric, fatty foods.
``We don't know if it's lying or a subconscious omission,'' said head researcher Dr.
Berit Heitmann.
In either case, researchers in the study concluded that denial further impedes chances for weight loss.
It's still unclear how big a role genetics and other innate factors have in the overall obesity package.
But Harrowe, the Pima public health officer, feels emphasizing factors we can't control does little to help Pimas or non-Pimas who are overweight.
``What you don't want is people developing this attitude that there's nothing they can do about it anyway,'' Harrowe said.
``You have to focus on lifestyle changes''.
Many obesity researchers agree, and believe that the fat epidemic is primarily the end result of an abhorrent culture that places inordinate emphasis on quantity.
``Becoming obese is a normal response to the American environment,'' said obesity researcher Hill.
Hill, director of the Colorado Clinical Nutrition Research Unit at the University of Colorado, puts a preponderance of blame for fat Americans on our culture: Americans have too much food available; social and work situations encourage overeating; restaurants compete by offering bigger and bigger servings; 64-ounce Big Gulps and Thirst Busters have replaced 12-ounce bottled soda; and technology has made it possible to avoid exercise.
Ravussin, formerly with the National Institutes of Health, agrees and has come to group these factors into what he calls the pathoenvironment.
``Obviously, if the Pimas' environment had not changed so drastically, they would not be in their current condition,'' Ravussin said.
``But the same can be said for non-Pimas.
Getting food was hard work until 100 years ago.
Now, it's available in abundance without any activity required to obtain it''.
Robertson, of the Southwest Bariatric Nutrition Center, said he'd like to see our culture put more emphasis on physical activity and education on nutrition rather than see who can come up with the largest soft drink under a buck.
He said he'd also like restaurants to be more responsible in the portions they serve.
``You go to some restaurants and order what you think is a normal meal and you get enough for three people,'' Robertson said.
``It's obscene.
My wife and I now routinely order one entree and split it''.
If nothing else, obesity specialists want the public to snap out of it and wake up to the serious health risks associated with being overweight.
Science, they remind us, has yet to find a magic pill that cuts weight gain without unhealthful side effects, and many researchers believe that any such drug will have to be combined with diet and exercise anyway.

&QL; &QL; &QL; &QL; Are you obese?
&QL; Obesity is defined clinically as being 20 percent heavier than your ideal weight.
&QL; Overwhelming research shows that the risks of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, osteoarthritis and even some forms of cancer start to climb when body-fat levels are above a rating of 24 BMI (body mass index), but really soar above a BMI of 30.
&QL; A rating of 25 is overweight; 30 obese; 40 severely obese.
&QL; To calculate your own approximate body mass index: &QL; - Multiply your weight by 700.
&QL; - Divide the answer by your height in inches.
&QL; - Divide again by height in inches.
&QL; It should be noted that these new government guidelines do not take all factors into consideration, especially muscle weight, which is heavier and generally more healthful than fat weight.
&QL; &QL; &QL; By the numbers &QL; - Fifty-four percent of all American adults are heavier than is healthy, according to a recent study from the University of Colorado.
About one-third of American adults are obese, which is defined as being 20 percent over your ideal weight.
Twenty-five percent of people under the age of 18 are considered obese also.
&QL; - Instances of severe obesity _ not being able to fit in an airline seat _ have ballooned 350 percent over the past 30 years.
&QL; - The National Institutes of Health report that obesity is the second-leading cause (after smoking) of preventable death in the United States today, and estimate that obesity-related disease costs the nation about $100 billion a year in direct health-care expenses or in lost productivity.
&QL; &QL; &QL; Slim-down plan &QL; Recommendations by obesity specialists for thinning up America: &QL; - Encourage physical exercise, perhaps even reward people with reduced insurance premiums or additional vacation time.
&QL; - Encourage restaurants not to use food portions as a competitive issue.
People generally will eat all that they are served.
&QL; - Increase the sense of urgency about controlling obesity among the public and health-care workers through government-sponsored campaigns similar to the ones for anti-smoking.
&QL; - Require schoolchildren to exercise vigorously at least 30 minutes daily.
&QL; - ncrease the availability of low-fat foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and make processed low-fat foods as tasty as high-fat versions. &QL;
ATLANTA (AP) --The laid-back Southern lifestyle is affecting waistlines below the Mason-Dixon line.
Southerners are less likely to hike, ride a bike, walk or join a health club than their counterparts in the rest of the nation.
As a result, Southerners are tipping the scale at more than 30 percent above their ideal body weight.
In short, they're obese.
A study released Tuesday by the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the number of Americans considered obese soared from about one in eight in 1991 to nearly one in five last year.
In the Southeast, the obesity rate jumped 67.2 percent in that time frame, with Georgia leading the nation with a whopping increase of 101.8 percent.
West Virginia led the nation in terms of an overweight population, with an obesity rate of 22.9 percent.
Two culprits were suspected for the change: urban sprawl and heat.
Many experts in Georgia blamed the extra pounds on modern suburbs, with no sidewalks to encourage walking and long commutes forcing residents to spend hours in their cars instead of exercising.
``Atlanta is not a walkable community.
We don't have sidewalks that lead anywhere,'' said Pam Wilson, a dietitian with the Georgia division of public health.
``Even if we do find a sidewalk, they dead-end into an eight-lane highway''.
The period measured in the study coincides with a time of rapid population growth around Atlanta.
In 1991, Georgia had one of the lowest obesity rates in the country.
Dr. William Dietz, a co-author of the CDC study, said the sprawl around Atlanta keeps people trapped in their cars for hours, encourages them to eat quick meals of greasy fast food and prevents them from having enough time to exercise.
``People in Atlanta drive more than in any other urban area in the country,'' he said.
``Community redesign may foster higher levels of activity and go a long way in preventing obesity''.
Others blamed Southern weather, saying the summers are too hot for people to get outside.
The lowest obesity rates in the nation, by comparison, were in New England and in the West, where people are more active and the weather is cooler.
``If they don't get out in the morning, they don't exercise,'' said Harry DuVal, director of the University of Georgia fitness center.
``They go in and find air conditioning''.
``It all adds up to a very unhealthy lifestyle,'' added Wilson.
The CDC study, which is included in today's issue of Journal of the American Medical Association, was based on telephone surveys of more than 100,000 participants each year between 1991-98.
Younger adults, people with some college education and Hispanics showed the most drastic increases, but ``a steady increase was observed in all states; in both sexes; across age groups, races, educational levels; and occurred regardless of smoking status,'' the study found.
Overall, the population of obese men and women in the United States increased from 12 percent in 1991 to 17.9 percent last year, according to the CDC survey, which said that figure might be conservative.
Another study in the journal attributed an estimated 280,000 deaths a year to being overweight, but said the figure could be more than 374,000.
Being overweight has been strongly associated with greater risk of certain illnesses, including heart disease, high cholesterol and blood pressure, diabetes, stroke and some cancers.
CDC Director Jeffrey P.
Koplan said a national strategy is needed to combat obesity.
He called for workplaces offer healthier foods and exercise facilities, more sidewalks and bike paths, and encouraging children to play outdoors instead of watching TV or using computers.
``In general, restoring physical activity to our daily routines is critical.''
LOS ANGELES (AP) --Obesity is a U.S. epidemic that has surged in the past decade and now affects nearly one in five adults, killing some 300,000 a year, a collection of new studies suggest.
The studies, which will be published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association, are the latest to spread the warning that Americans are getting fatter --and that fat kills.
``Obesity is a major cause of mortality in the United States,'' concludes one of the surveys.
One study by the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the number of Americans considered obese --defined as being more than 30 percent over their ideal body weight -- soared from about one in eight in 1991 to nearly one in five last year.
In 1991, four out of 45 participating states had obesity rates of 15 percent or higher, while the figure for 1998 was 37 states, according to the study.
That data, which was to be announced today at the AMA's annual Science Reporters Convention, was based on telephone surveys of more than 100,000 participants each year between 1991-98.
Younger adults, people with some college education and Hispanics showed the most drastic increases, but ``a steady increase was observed in all states; in both sexes; across age groups, races, educational levels; and occurred regardless of smoking status,'' the study found.
Overall, the population of obese men and women increased from 12 percent in 1991 to 17.9 percent last year, according to the CDC survey, which said that figure might be conservative.
Other recent research has found that more than 50 percent of Americans are overweight and 22 percent are obese, even though weight-loss products and services are a $33 billion-a-year industry.
Being overweight has been strongly associated with greater risk of certain illnesses, including heart disease, high cholesterol and blood pressure, diabetes, stroke and some cancers.
A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine of more than 1 million Americans concluded that obese people run a significant risk of dying early, even if they don't smoke and are otherwise healthy.
Another study in this week's JAMA issue on obesity --all of the studies involved Americans at least the age of 18 -- attributed an estimated average of about 280,000 deaths a year to being overweight, but said the figure could be more than 374,000 when the numbers are calculated differently.
The figures were adjusted for sex, age and whether the subjects smoked but did not factor in chronic disease or family histories that might indicate a predisposition to an illness.
An editorial accompanying the obesity issue of JAMA calls for developing a comprehensive national strategy to prevent obesity.
Growth in the marketing of fast food and snack food, as well as lack of exercise, are among the reasons Americans are taking in more calories than they burn, the editorial concluded.
``Children watch more television daily, physical education has been markedly reduced in our schools, many neighborhoods lack sidewalks for safe walking, the workplace has become increasingly automated, household chores are assisted by labor-saving machinery, and walking or bicycling has been replaced by automobile travel,'' the editorial said.
BOSTON _ Years of emphasizing exercise and healthier diets have done little to stem the growing epidemic of obesity in the United States, with more than 20 percent of adults and up to 15 percent of children now considered obese, a top US health official said Friday.
Preventing obesity is one of the most important public health issues facing the nation today, yet the best way to attack this mounting problem has not been devised, said Dr.
William H.
Dietz, director of the Division of Nutrition and Physical Activity for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
``We're on our way to solving the tobacco problem.
The next major problem is how to turn obesity in the other direction,'' said Dietz at a conference sponsored by the Massachusetts Public Health Association.
Considering that obesity and related health problems consume about 6 percent of the national health care budget, as estimated by one recent Harvard study, ``not to do anything about obesity and physical inactivity is very expensive,'' Dietz said.
To indicate the intractability of the problem, Dietz and other speakers at the conference Friday cited numerous studies and statistics showing the ease with which Americans put on the pounds and the difficulty in shedding them.
Between 1963 and 1994, for instance, the average weight of 10-year-old boys and girls increased by about 3.5 pounds, as a result of an extra 1.1 calories per child per day on average being consumed over that time period, according to statistics that Dietz has calculated but not yet published.
The most startling increase is for the 35-year-old woman, who gained an average of 18.6 pounds between 1980 and 1994 as a result of an extra 12.7 calories per day being consumed over that time period.
A 35-year-old man gained an average 5.4 pounds in that period, by consuming an average of an extra 3.7 calories per day, according to Dietz's calculations, which are based on complex formulas including average expenditures through physical activity.
To put the additional calories per day in perspective, a banana provides about 80 calories.
In an effort to help focus the nation on the need to prevent obesity, particularly among children, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plan to unveil early next year the first revision in the growth charts for children in nearly 20 years, adding a body-mass index to the traditional weight and height measurements, according to Dietz.
The body-mass index, or BMI, has been considered a better measurement of obesity in adults than the traditional weight and height charts.
The growth charts, a staple of pediatricians' offices and parents concerned about how their children compare to others of the same age, will allow the plotting of a child's BMI against that of other children of the same age.
``That's a big deal,'' Dietz said.
In Massachusetts, as elsewhere in the nation, low-income children are at greatest risk of obesity and other nutritional problems.
Elizabeth Metallinos-Katsaras, director of Pediatric and Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance for the State Department of Public Health, presented 1996 data on 128,000 low-income Massachusetts children under the age of five in the government nutritional program Woman, Infants, and Children.
More than 25 percent of the children had low hemoglobin levels, an indication of anemia, while the percentage of children who were overweight was more than twice as high as expected, 10.5 percent.
Only 5 percent were expected to be overweight.
Preliminary 1997 figures, to be released in the next couple of months, suggest a slight decrease in the percentage of overweight children in WIC, but the numbers for low hemoglobin, short stature, and being under weight appear to be holding steady, Metallinos-Katsaras said in an interview.
ATLANTA (AP) --Americans are getting fatter, and the South -- where meals are often finger-lickin' good and steamy summers lead to days of lounging inside -- is leading the way.
A study released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the number of Americans considered obese --defined as being more than 30 percent over their ideal body weight -- soared from about one in eight in 1991 to nearly one in five last year.
In the Southeast, the obesity rate jumped 67.2 percent in that time frame.
Georgia led the nation with a 101.8 percent increase.
While traditional Southern cooking --fried chicken, potato salad, barbecue -- is often high in fat, experts say Southerners' diets are now not much different from those in the rest of the country.
The more likely reason for the increase in portliness below the Mason-Dixon line is a lack of exercise.
Southerners are less likely to hike, ride a bike, walk or join a health club than their counterparts in the rest of the nation, according to Georgia's Division of Public Health.
The lowest obesity rates were in New England and in the West, where people are more active.
Even there, though, obesity rates are on the rise.
Some blame Southern weather, saying the summers are too hot for people to get outside.
``If they don't get out in the morning, they don't exercise,'' said Harry DuVal, director of the University of Georgia fitness center.
``They go in and find air conditioning''.
Others, including Dr.
William Dietz, one of the study's co-authors, blame the design of modern suburbs.

The CDC study, announced Tuesday at the AMA's annual Science Reporters Convention, was based on telephone surveys of more than 100,000 participants each year between 1991 and '98.
Younger adults, people with some college education and Hispanics showed the most drastic increases.
But the study found ``a steady increase'' in all states; in both sexes; across age groups, races and educational levels; and regardless of smoking status.
Overall, the population of obese men and women in the United States increased from 12 percent in 1991 to 17.9 percent last year, according to the CDC survey, which said that figure might be conservative.

WASHINGTON (AP) --Obese women are six times more likely than thin women to have a silent, smoldering inflammation inside their arteries that may increase their already high risk of developing heart disease, researchers said Tuesday.
If the findings are verified, they suggest scientists should study whether the aspirin some heart patients take might also help overweight people reduce their chances of heart attacks.
Being overweight is an automatic warning sign for heart disease: The fatter people are, the more likely they are to have high cholesterol and clogged arteries, high blood pressure, diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors.
But no one knew if those extra pounds could cause yet another risk: low-grade inflammation inside a person's arteries.
In otherwise seemingly healthy people, scientists recently discovered that this low-grade inflammation can simmer for years and significantly increase a person's risk of a heart attack or stroke.
No one knows what causes the subtle inflammation.
One theory has been that it might be bacteria, and indeed, some research suggests that antibiotics may help fight heart disease.
On the other hand, doctors already frequently prescribe aspirin to certain people at high risk of heart attacks because it thins their blood --and aspirin also reduces inflammation.
Dutch scientist Marjolein Visser knew that fat cells themselves can produce a substance called interleukin-6 that causes inflammation when it seeps into the bloodstream.
So she studied whether obesity could be another culprit, using a U.S. database of 16,000 Americans.
The only way to measure this ``micro-inflammation'' is using a blood test that detects C-reactive protein, or CRP.
CRP levels skyrocket when people are sick, with colds, inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, even heart disease.
But lower levels, between 0.2 milligrams and 1 mg per deciliter of blood, are the ones that signal the simmering inflammation that has scientists concerned.
Visser discovered that obese women are six times more likely to have this low-grade inflammation than normal-weight people.
Obese men were twice as likely to have it, a gender difference Visser couldn't explain, except to say that women in the study were much more overweight than men studied.
``We were surprised'' the risk was so high, Visser said Tuesday, before presenting her findings at a biology meeting here.
If verified, ``it could have quite an impact''.
Visser, a weight specialist at Amsterdam's Vrije University, statistically controlled for other diseases that might have caused the study participants' CRP levels to rise.
She found equal risk when examining only healthy people under age 40.
Even ``at a young age, when you're obese there's this inflammation, and we know it's bad for you,'' she said.
The study isn't proof that obesity inflames people's arteries, cautioned Dr.
Richard J.
Havlik of the National Institute on Aging, which funded the research.
But the federal agency is intrigued enough that it is funding more research into the link --and probing whether obesity-caused inflammation might have ramifications for other diseases, too.
First, Visser is preparing to see whether losing weight causes CRP levels to drop immediately.
Her findings, however, raise the question of whether aspirin or any of the dozens of other anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen, could help obese people ward off heart disease, and she cautions that nobody has tested that yet.
``The best thing to do if you're obese is lose weight instead of hitting the aspirin bottle,'' she cautioned.
TRENTON, N.J.
(AP) - Some 97 million American adults, or 55 percent, are considered overweight or obese.
According to the National Institutes of Health, this epidemic of obesity, which is also a growing problem among children, costs nearly $100 billion annually.
That includes costs for weight loss treatment and treatment of many serious health problems caused by obesity.
Overweight people are at increased risk of illness from: -high blood pressure and other heart disease, -adult-onset diabetes, -stroke, -gallbladder disease, -osteoarthritis, -certain cancers, -lipid disorders, -respiratory problems and -sleep apnea, a disorder that primarily strikes overweight men, causing them to repeatedly stop breathing while sleeping.
Besides causing fatigue, it decreases the amount of oxygen and increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood and brain.
NIH says all those risks apply to people with excessive abdominal fat - meaning a waist circumference of more than 40 inches in men and more than 35 inches in women - and people with a body mass index of 25 or more.
Someone with a body mass index of 30 or more, the level considered obese, is about 30 pounds overweight - roughly 221 pounds in a 6-foot person or 186 pounds in a 5-foot-6 person.
And if we keep on eating the way we do now, by 2030 everyone in America will be obese.
The national epidemic of obesity is at such a crisis that it demands urgent attention by medical professionals, the government and the public.
That was the message repeated again and again this week by experts at the American Dietetic Association's annual meeting in Kansas City.
They came armed with statistics and a missionary zeal to enlist dietitians as front-line fighters in the war against obesity.
``We're the fattest we've ever been,'' said Sachiko Tokunaga de St.
Jeor, director of the nutrition research and education program at the University of Nevada.
``Obesity is the No.
1 malnutrition problem in the United States''.
The percentage of American adults who are overweight or obese has risen from about 43 percent in the early 1960s to about 55 percent today.
The average man now weighs 25 pounds more than men of his great-grandfather's generation.
The reasons for the obesity epidemic can be found in our culture of abundance and inactivity, said the experts on causes and treatment.
We live in a society in which people drive instead of walk, fast food is available 24 hours a day, children are bombarded with advertisements for junk food, and one-quarter of all the vegetables we eat are french fries.
``The average American, particularly children, recognizes `supersize' as a verb,'' said Yale University psychologist Kelly Brownell, referring to the term for ordering larger portions of french fries at McDonald's restaurants.
The health effects of obesity have been staggering.
The condition causes 75 percent of all diabetes cases in the United States and is responsible for half the high blood pressure cases and half the cases of abnormal cholesterol levels, according to figures cited at the meeting Wednesday.
The cost of treating obesity-related diseases adds up to $52 billion per year, according to estimates cited by the National Institutes of Health.
When indirect costs of obesity, such as lost productivity, are added in, the sum approaches $100 billion.
In the past many doctors did not consider obesity a medical problem and left its treatment to fad diet promoters, said Louis Aronne, clinical professor of medicine at Cornell University Medical College.
He was one of the speakers at the Dietetic Association meeting.
New research on the biological basis of obesity and the urgency of the epidemic have changed their perspective, he said.
For example, in June the American Heart Association put obesity alongside smoking, high blood pressure and cholesterol, and sedentary lifestyle on its list of major modifiable risk factors for heart attack and coronary heart disease.
Obesity treatment ``has been on the fringe on the infomercials; now it's moving into prime time,'' Aronne said.
Dozens of diet drugs are being developed so that one day doctors will be ``capable of controlling body weight completely,'' he predicted.
Until that time, however, doctors and their patients will have to give up the idea of turning overweight people into sleek hard bodies and settle for more modest and attainable weight loss, experts said.
&LR; brk:No quick cure &LR; tx:Obesity is a chronic disease that requires regular medical treatment and a lifelong commitment by patients to control their weight.
People who quickly lose large amounts of weight typically gain it all back in a few years.
``We all tried to get (obese patients) down to skinny little people, and that's impossible,'' said John Foreyt, a psychologist at Baylor College of Medicine.
``Keep patient expectations realistic....None of us is in the business of cosmetics.
We're in the business of helping patients improve their health''.
Losing 10 percent of one's weight is a realistic initial goal, said F.
Xavier Pi-Sunyer, director of the obesity research center at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York.
But even dropping five or 10 pounds can be beneficial.
``A small and achievable weight loss can have a major impact on health risks,'' said Pi-Sunyer.
Pi-Sunyer was chairman of a federal panel of experts that issued guidelines in June on the diagnosis and treatment of obesity.
According to the panel, people are considered overweight if their body mass indexes, a comparison of weight to height, are 25 or over.
Anyone with an index of 30 or higher is considered obese.
For example, a person who is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 164 pounds has an index of 25.
If that person weighs 197 pounds, the index is 30.
The report recommends that moderately overweight people should at least try to stabilize their weight.
If they have other medical conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes, they should lose weight.
For obese people, the report said, weight loss is essential.
Between the ages of 20 and 60, we gain an average of half a pound per year.
But being overweight is afflicting people of all ages.
Sixty percent of overweight children have a medical complication such as elevated cholesterol, triglycerides or insulin levels, a new study shows, said William Dietz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Children have been losing opportunities for physical activity because their parents are less likely to let them walk to school, and schools are less likely to emphasize physical education, Dietz said.
The more television children watch, the more likely they are to be obese, Dietz said.
And the TV-obesity relationship has grown stronger in the last 20 years.
The elderly also are joining the ranks of the obese in greater numbers.
``When many people think of elderly persons, they think of tiny, frail people,'' said Gordon Jensen, associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University.
``They're actually frail, big people''.
Jensen is conducting research on more than 12,500 elderly residents of rural Pennsylvania, about one third of whom are obese.
He has found that as their weight goes up, so does the likelihood that the person has trouble walking or climbing stairs, or even getting into and out of a car.
These elderly, he said, ``are often trapped in their homes, can't bathe themselves, can't dress themselves''.
People who are obese in old age tended to be overweight and sedentary in middle age as well and continued gaining weight into their 50s and 60s, Jensen said.
That doesn't bode well for the future, he said.
``Guess who's right behind them?
The baby boomers.
We're going to be looking at greater and greater numbers of obese elderly people,'' Jensen said.
``Vast numbers of older persons are going to suffer the consequences of obesity''.
&LR; brk:Often overlooked &LR; tx:Just as the overweight often face social discrimination, they also are slighted by government and by private health plans when they seek medical help for their condition, said Judith Stern, a nutrition professor at the University of California at Davis.
The National Institutes of Health spends $100 million per year on obesity research, she said.
But that amount is dwarfed by the $1 billion spent on cardiovascular disease research and the $2 billion spent on cancer research.
Insurance companies often will not cover obesity treatment, she said.
In many cases doctors helping a patient lose weight may have to seek reimbursement by treating the patient's obesity-related diseases.
Medicare and Medicaid do not cover obesity treatment, Stern said.
The armed services do not offer treatment for obesity, but the condition can lead to a less-than-honorable discharge, she said.
Obesity treatment is one of just two categories of medical care the Internal Revenue Service has ruled ineligible for tax deductions, Stern said.
The other category is cosmetic plastic surgery.
But however much medical treatment becomes available to individual patients, it won't stop the obesity epidemic, Brownell of Yale said.
To do that, there must be social action to change the country's ``toxic food environment,'' he said.
This environment has been created by a food industry that encourages people to eat too much of the wrong foods, Brownell said.
For example, fast food is being offered in school lunchrooms, Brownell said.
``Can we do anything worse in our schools?
This is second only to having cigarette machines in our schools,'' he said.
Brownell proposed changing America's eating habits by levying a tax on junk food and offering fruit and vegetables at a government subsidized discount.
He also called for regulating food advertising, particularly to children, the same way tobacco advertising is controlled.
``I don't think children should be exposed to Ronald McDonald any more than to Joe Camel,'' he said.
LOS ANGELES _ Americans are gobbling down more calories than ever, resulting in a 50 percent increase in the nation's obesity rate, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.
Young people, the more highly educated and Hispanics are leading the way.
The figures released by the federal agency in Atlanta show that 17.9 percent of Americans are obese.
In 1991 the proportion was 12 percent.
And 45 of the 50 states have rates of obesity of more than 15 percent, compared with just four states in 1991.
Federal guidelines define obesity as being at least 30 percent above ideal weight.
For example, a 5-foot-9-inch person who weighs more than 220 pounds is considered obese.
CDC officials said the results of the study, based on a large telephone survey of more than 100,000 people, are further evidence that more effort must go into public health campaigns to combat poor eating habits and encourage physical activity.
Obesity is linked to many chronic and life-threatening diseases, including heart disease, diabetes and hypertension.
Researchers from Tufts University School of Medicine in Medford, Mass.
, reported Monday that 280,000 deaths a year can be attributed to obesity.
The CDC data, to be published in Wednesday's edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association, revealed that obesity was increasing fastest among 18- to 29-year-olds, people with college educations and people of Hispanic descent.
The survey did not find any significant changes in the rates of physical activity, indicating that overeating was the cause of most of the increase in weight gain.
Also in the same issue of the medical journal: _ Researchers at Children's Hospital in Boston report that young people who ate more fiber were less likely to be obese and have high blood pressure and high levels of bad cholesterol.
Fiber outstripped lower fat intake as being correlated with those positive health results.
_ A researcher from Saint Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York found that injections of the hormone leptin increased weight loss for both obese and lean subjects.
Like other tests of leptin, which is linked to appetite regulation, the studies did not demonstrate a dramatic difference, although users did lose more than those who received injections of a placebo.
At the highest doses, obese patients lost an average of 15.6 pounds after 24 weeks.
They were also on a diet designed to give them 500 fewer calories per day than they needed to maintain their normal weight.
TROY, N.Y.
_ Americans are getting fatter and health specialists are getting frustrated.
``We don't make it a priority in our culture to eat well,'' said Anne Rogan, a professor of nutrition at the Sage Colleges.
That helps explain why the number of overweight adult Americans continues to grow.
Today, more than half of all Americans are considered too heavy, up from about 25 percent in 1980.
Those alarming statistics set the stage two weeks ago for the first Nutrition Summit in 31 years and the release of new federal dietary guidelines.
While no one is expecting any overnight miracles, the goal is to focus attention on the problem of obesity in this country.
Ironically, the first nutrition summit, in 1969, was aimed at reducing hunger and malnutrition.
``The scales aren't lying.
... We have a serious weight problem,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said at the opening of this year's summit.
Concern about expanding waistlines is also at the heart of new dietary guidelines published in May.
Revised every five years, the guidelines are meant to incorporate the latest advances in medical and scientific research while giving the country a dietary blueprint to follow.
For most Americans, the ``Food Guide Pyramid'' is the most recognizable symbol of those guidelines, spelling out the recommended number of daily servings of vegetables, dairy, grains, meat and fruit.
For the first time, the guidelines emphasize physical activity, recommending at least 30 minutes of daily exercise for adults and 60 minutes for children.
Stephanie DiBacco, the assistant director of patient services at the Albany Medical Center, especially likes those specific suggestions, as well as new language in the guidelines about the importance of eating whole grains, such as oatmeal, barley or brown rice.
``They make a far greater attempt this time to support whole grains, fruits and vegetables,'' she said.
Yet DiBacco, like most nutrition experts, is realistic.
She knows most people don't consult the guidelines before opening the refrigerator door, especially those recommendations that call for moderation in portion size and sugar intake.
``Moderation is such an ugly word for Americans,'' she said.
Not everyone, however, is happy with the new guidelines.
``They really aren't strong enough,'' said Patricia R.
Bertron, a New Jersey registered dietitian and a consultant with the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an advocacy group based in Washington that emphasizes preventive medicine and good nutrition.
``Americans, as a whole, are in the worst shape they've ever been''.
The group takes exception to the recommended daily servings of dairy and meat.
``They're the primary sources of saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet,'' she said.
``They really should be pushing the health benefits of a plant-based diet''.
Although PCRM encourages a vegetarian diet, not everyone has to make such a drastic change to reap the health benefits of eating more grains, legumes and vegetables.
One simple way to do that is to think of the 10 meals you make most often in your home.
Bertron proposes making at least three of those meals vegetarian.
For example, if you eat spaghetti with meat sauce, make it just spaghetti with tomato sauce.
Besides looking at three meals you can change, she also suggests coming up with three new vegetarian recipes.
Ultimately, guidelines are only guidelines, and the daily decision of what and how much to eat is an individual choice.
If anything, nutritionists hope people will think about those decisions before a health problem, like heart disease or obesity, comes up.
``Americans have to hear the message over and over again,'' DiBacco said.

CHICAGO (AP) --Obesity is not as dangerous for elderly people as it is for the middle-aged or young adults, according to a new study.
The findings are similar to those of a study reported last year that indicated being overweight shortens life expectancy up to age 75, but does not make much of a difference afterwards unless people are extremely obese.
``The absolute risk of dying gets higher and higher as you get older until you die, but the importance of obesity as a risk factor decreases,'' said Ralf Bender, an obesity researcher at the University of Bielefeld in Germany and principal author of the study published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
But researchers not affiliated with the study said the findings are not that meaningful.
``Obesity is a major public health problem at any age, and this study does nothing to suggest that that has changed,'' said Dr.
JoAnn Manson, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School.
In the latest study, researchers studied 6,193 obese men and women who ranged in age from 18 to 74, following them for an average of 14.8 years.
The patients, who were referred to an obesity clinic between 1961 and 1994, were grouped by their age and body mass index.
Body mass index, or BMI, is increasingly becoming the standard way of talking about obesity, since it is an easy way to compare the girth of people of different heights.
BMI is body fat in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
According to dietary guidelines issued by the Department of Agriculture, a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight and 30 and above is obese.
Researchers found that the mortality risk for a really obese person --with a BMI of 40 or more -- was highest for those age 30 or younger.
Moderately obese men and women --with a BMI between 32 and 40 -- who were age 50 or older had the lowest mortality risk, the study says.
Some researchers not involved with the study argued that BMI is a limited measure of obesity in the elderly because bone density declines with age.
They also noted that the study participants were recruited rather than randomly selected.
LOS ANGELES _ Despite its chic, sleek image, Los Angeles is fatter than you might think.
That's right: 47 percent of Los Angeles County adults are overweight, and 14 percent are severely overweight, according to an unprecedented county health poll released Thursday.
In between bites of a burger, 45-year-old Don Como, a former vegetarian, said the findings are alarming, but predictable.
``It's really not surprising when you think of all the fast food that's around that you can't help eating,'' said the resident of Woodland Hills, an L.A.-area suburb.
But while nearly half of Angelenos are carrying extra pounds and are at increased risk for health problems, we're not as heavy as Americans nationwide, 54 percent of whom are overweight.
``The good news is we're a little better than the nation as a whole,'' said Jonathan E.
Fielding, Los Angeles County director of public health.
``But I think the most important news is that one out of two California adults is overweight or extremely overweight.
And that is costing everybody in terms of health and in terms of dollars''.
Overweight people have a heightened risk for such ailments as diabetes, heart disease and cancer, Fielding said.
The survey was based on telephone interviews with 8,000 households last year, during which researchers calculated whether adults are overweight by using the body mass index.
The index measures the ratio of weight to height.
Using that formula, the National Institutes of Health recently revised its definition of obesity downward, putting more Americans in the overweight category.
Using the new standards, the county survey found that 55 percent of men and 39 percent of women in L.A. are overweight.
African-Americans have the highest rate of obesity at 58 percent and Asian-Americans have the lowest, 25 percent.
Latinos, 54 percent, and whites, 44 percent, fall in between.
African-American and Latino cultures attach less stigma to extra weight than does white culture, and men have long been immune from the thinness pressure applied to women, said Morton Maxwell, director of the UCLA University Obesity Center.
``All of us men love our big bellies sticking out, because no one tells us we don't look good,'' he said.
Joel Forte and Mark Smith, watching their children at soccer practice at Warner Park in Woodland Hills, said the overweight rate wasn't surprising.
``I'm surprised that it's that low,'' said Forte, 37, of Canoga Park.
Then he looked at an index chart and gasped.
``Wow! I'm overweight''! cried the 5-foot-10-inch, 188-pound, apparently fit soccer dad.
``They make everybody overweight,'' protested Smith, 30, of Woodland Hills.
To fall within acceptable bounds, said the 5-foot-9, 189-pound Smith, ``You'd have to be a string bean''.
Their surprise echoed the complaints of Sally Smith, spokeswoman for the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance in Sacramento, who said the survey results are likely to prompt ineffective ``yo-yo'' dieting.
``It's unrealistic of them to believe that by proclaiming people overweight, people will automatically become thin,'' she said.
Obesity and nutrition specialists acknowledge that the body mass index doesn't infallibly measure muscle mass or body fat levels _ the real gauges of health.
Nevertheless, they emphasized that it provides a good indication of obesity across a population.
If anything, Maxwell said, major health studies suggest the ideal weight should be below that dictated by the new standard.
``If it was based on scientific evidence,'' he said, ``it would be set lower''. &QL;
NEW YORK _ On a recent Friday, Tyshon Young, 13, and a nutritionist strolled the aisles at Fairway in Harlem for a little comparison shopping.
He picked up a box of butter cookies.
She pointed to graham crackers.
He picked out frosted flakes.
She said Special K was a better choice.
He picked ice cream.
She told him to get the low-fat brand.
He wanted a mango.
She said he could only have half of one, once or twice a week.
By the time they made their way to the dairy section, Tyshon turned defensive.
``I love cheese,'' he said, pointing to a package of sliced American.
``I usually eat a whole pack of crackers, about four or five slices of cheese, and a drink, like fruit punch''.
High-fat, high-carbohydrate snacks like that have made Tyshon obese, which has triggered a form of diabetes once considered rare among people his age.
The trip to the grocery store was part of an elaborate effort to coax him into a new regimen of exercise and healthy eating that could save his life.
At 5 feet 6 inches and 216 pounds, Tyshon represents an alarming new health trend: the sharp increase in the number of youngsters with Type 2 diabetes, also known as adult-onset diabetes, an incurable and progressively damaging disease that can cause kidney failure, blindness and poor circulation, which, in turn, can lead to amputation.
Doctors long believed the disease occurred only during middle age or later.
Although there have not been any national surveys documenting the rise of this form of diabetes in children, several small-scale studies have found that such cases have more than tripled in the last five years, and, anecdotally, doctors across the country say they have observed similar trends among their own patients.
In the last month, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a meeting to discuss the problem, and the American Diabetes Association has appointed a new task force.
``Ten years ago, we were teaching medical students that you didn't see this disease in people under 40, and now we're seeing it in people under 10,'' said Dr.
Robin Goland, co-director of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, which opened in October at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in Manhattan.
Dr. Goland said Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in 10 percent to 20 percent of the center's new pediatric patients, compared with less than 4 percent in the hospital's clinics five years ago.
``With the numbers we're starting to see,'' Goland said, ``this could be the beginning of an epidemic''.
Children with Type 2 diabetes look a lot like their adult counterparts.
Most are African-American and Hispanic, with a particularly high rate found among children of Mexican descent.
Most of the Type 2 children have close relatives with the disease, and almost all are obese.
In fact, doctors said, the spiraling rate of childhood obesity in America _ declared an epidemic last month by the U.S.
Surgeon General, David Satcher _ is the most significant factor in the rising numbers of children with this form of diabetes.
A common definition of obesity is when a child's weight exceeds 20 percent of ideal weight, based on age, height and frame.
According to the most recent statistics from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, the number of obese children has doubled in the last two decades.
One in five children in America is overweight, researchers found.
Poor, minority children, who often eat a lot of junk food and have few neighborhood recreation programs, are at greatest risk, doctors said.
Obesity, by itself, does not always lead to diabetes, doctors say, but it is a major risk factor.
``If you want to make someone a diabetic, then make them obese,'' said Dr.
Rudolph Leibel, head of molecular genetics at Columbia University and a co-director of the diabetes center.
Researchers speculate that the rise in reported cases of Type 2 diabetes in children results from both an increased incidence of the disease and an increased awareness of it by primary-care physicians.
Until the last few years, Goland said, the correct diagnosis was likely to have been missed in some children.
Diabetes, which affects about 16 million Americans and is the sixth-leading cause of death by disease in the United States, results from a breakdown in the body's system for absorbing sugar.
Most children with the disease have a form called Type 1, or juvenile diabetes, which develops when the pancreas, for no known reason, stops producing insulin, the hormone that controls glucose use.
These children must take daily insulin injections for the rest of their lives or face almost immediate death, while also limiting their sugar intake.
In Type 2, or adult-onset diabetes, the pancreas produces insulin, but the organs grow increasingly resistant to it.
Many people erroneously believe it to be a more benign form of the disease because it can occur in the body for years without symptoms.
If the disease is left undiagnosed or untreated, however, life-threatening complications, caused by damage to blood vessels, can develop within 10 years to 20 years.
``If we aren't detecting this disease in children because we aren't looking for it,'' Goland said, ``then we are going to start seeing complications in people in their 20s that we would normally associate with people in their 60s and 70s''.
At 38, Valeria Wilson of the Bronx has already had two heart attacks _ complications from Type 2 diabetes.
The diabetes has also caused such poor vision that she stopped working two years ago and hired a nurse to measure her insulin doses.
Ms. Wilson, 5 feet, 6 inches and 251 pounds, was told she had Type 2 during a routine pregnancy exam when she was 21, but doctors suspect she probably had the disease for years.
The delayed diagnosis, doctors said, likely contributed to her health problems.
``I got old too fast,'' said Ms.
Wilson, the mother of two daughters.
``My mother is 73, and she's not as sick as me''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn Like adults with Type 2, many children with the disease can control their blood glucose levels with weight loss and diet modification.
Eventually, however, most people require oral medication and insulin.
``These are children who likely would have developed the disease at some later time in their lives, but their obesity has brought it out early,'' said Dr.
Sandra Puczynski, chairwoman of the research advisory board for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.
``Losing weight will not cure them, but it would help significantly''.
Losing weight is a daunting goal for many children with Type 2 diabetes.
Often they have parents who work long hours and cannot be home to prepare balanced meals, and they live in neighborhoods where fast food restaurants and convenience stores outnumber supermarkets.
Within a block of 12-year-old Nuribel Reyes' home in Queens, there is a McDonald's and a Burger King.
``She used to eat at McDonald's every night,'' said her mother, Amancia Reyes, who runs two small beauty salons.
By the time she was 10, Nuribel, at 4 feet, 6 inches, weighed more than 145 pounds.
Mrs. Reyes said that when her daughter first began gaining weight, the doctors told her the girl would outgrow the ``baby-fat'' after she passed puberty.
That summer, Nuribel developed a severe yeast infection and began losing bladder control _ common symptoms of adult-onset diabetes _ and the disease was diagnosed by a different doctor.
By adhering to a strict meal plan, Nuribel maintained the same weight as she grew taller, and her blood glucose levels fell to normal range.
But this year, Nuribel started at a new school.
Her mother said her determination to lose weight has deteriorated, and with it, her health.
Embarrassed, Nuribel has not told classmates or teachers about her disease.
She refuses to take a lunch to school, and sometimes, Nuribel said, when her friends buy candy bars, so does she.
``The sugar in her blood is getting high again,'' Mrs.
Reyes said, crying.
``I worry all the time that one day she is going to be at school and eat something that will damage one of her organs''.
Several small studies in cities across the country _ including Cincinnati and San Antonio _ provided the first data about the rise in cases like Nuribel's.
A 1996 study, conducted at a Cincinnati diabetes center by the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, showed that among their pediatric patients, 16 percent had Type 2 in 1994, compared to 2 percent to 4 percent prior to 1992.
The researchers also found that Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in more than one-third of new diabetes patients between the ages of 10 and 19.
And Dr.
Kenneth Jones, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of California at San Diego, said clinics in his area report that the number of children with Type 2 diabetes has increased tenfold in the last five years.
``We used to maybe see one case a year,'' he said.
``Now we see one case a month, and some clinics are reporting two and three cases a month.
It's pretty scary''.
Identifying children who are at risk is relatively easy.
In addition to obesity and a family history of the disease, researchers said, many develop a condition called acanthosis nigricans, dark, irregular folds of skin around the neck, under the arms or behind the knees.
Symptoms of the disease include frequent urination and chronic thirst.
Nigel Estick, a 17-year-old senior at La Guardia High School of Music and Art and the Performing Arts in Manhattan, suffered these symptoms for years before the disease was diagnosed.
He had pains in his legs, a frequently dry mouth and deteriorating vision.
But, his mother said, doctors told her there was nothing seriously wrong with him.
They suggested that he was emotionally depressed, put him on Prozac, and urged her to insist that he stay in school.
``They tested him for leukemia, they tested him for sickle cell,'' his mother, Patricia Estick, grumbled, ``but no one tested him for diabetes''.
Then, Nigel, who is 5 feet, 8 inches tall and 250 pounds, began vomiting two or three times a day.
One morning, he could hardly stand and his vision was completely blurred.
Emergency room doctors discovered that Nigel's blood glucose level had soared to 8 times higher than normal.
He spent nearly a week in intensive care.
Today, Nigel is 40 pounds lighter.
He takes two insulin shots a day and tries to stay away from the Snickers bars he adores.
Pleased with his progress, doctors said they hope to get the teen-ager off insulin soon.
At times, Nigel said, he cannot enjoy his improvement because of worries about what lies ahead.
``This disease is probably going to really mess me up,'' he said.
``Eventually everyone succumbs to the disease''.
Adults with Type 2 diabetes often control the disease with oral medications and sometimes the same pills are used in children, however none of the drugs have been formally approved for pediatric patients.
In the next month, several clinics across the country will begin testing the drug metformin in children with Type 2.
In Manhattan, trials will be conducted at Mount Sinai Medical Center and at the Berrie Diabetes Center of Columbia's medical school.
Opened in October, the Berrie center is different from many other diabetes treatment centers in that doctors and nutritionists actively encourage a diabetic's family and friends to become educated about the disease and to help the patients stay healthy.
Nutritionists travel to schools to speak to patients' teachers and classmates, teammates and cafeteria staff.
They make house calls to examine foods in their patients' homes and to lead family discussions about the importance of exercise and healthy eating.
And they conduct regular supermarket tours, like the recent Friday afternoon trip with Tyshon.
``If we can get family and friends involved with the treatment, we will be much more successful in getting kids to be compliant,'' Goland said.
In addition to his nutritional and family counseling, doctors at the Naomi Berrie center have begun treating Tyshon with metformin.
At his last checkup, he had lost 25 pounds.
Tyshon, his mother and his nutritionist, Kira Almeida, were thrilled.
``Nothing is off limits to you,'' she said, urging Tyshon to stick with his new eating habits.
``But you have to eat in moderation.
Small changes can make a big difference.''
ATLANTA _ It's official: We're fat _ all over America, and particularly in Georgia.
More than half of all adults in the United States _ 54.9 percent _ are now overweight or obese, according to research being published today by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
And of all the states surveyed each year by the Atlanta-based agency, Georgia has had the most dramatic increase in the percent of adults who are obese, CDC said.
From 1991 to 1998, the proportion of Georgians who are at least 30 pounds over their ideal body weight doubled.
That means, according to state public health experts, that almost 900,000 Georgians are so overweight that they have gravely increased their risks of heart disease, gallbladder disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and high blood pressure.
Nationally, overweight and obesity have increased so dramatically, and will prove so costly to the health care system as the population ages, that they should be combatted as intensely as smoking has been, the CDC's director said Tuesday.
``Obesity is a serious health condition, and it is occurring at an epidemic level,'' Dr.
Jeffrey Koplan said.
``Overweight and physical inactivity account for more than 300,000 premature deaths each year, second only to tobacco-related deaths''.
Excess weight is increasing as rapidly in the population as an infectious disease might spread, and should be treated as seriously as an epidemic, Koplan said.
He presented new research by CDC scientists at a Los Angeles conference hosted by the American Medical Association.
The Journal of the American Medical Association publishes a special issue today devoted to obesity and overweight.
The problem is particularly acute in Georgia.
Although rates of obesity increased in 33 states between 1991 and 1998, they rose the most in Georgia, according to CDC's research.
In 1991, 9.2 percent of the state's adults were obese; in 1998, 18.2 percent were.
``We are aware that obesity and overweight have been increasing in Georgia over the past 10 to 15 years,'' said Dr.
Kenneth Powell, an epidemiologist with the state Division of Public Health.
``We're also aware that the proportion of Georgians who get no regular physical activity has been increasing every year, probably 2 percent every year for the past 15 years.
The combination of eating too much and not getting enough physical activity sends our overweight and obesity levels up''.
A statewide information campaign titled ``Take Charge of Your Health'' has been in preparation for two years and is scheduled to debut in November with billboards, public service announcements and community forums, according to Alice Trainer in the state's Office of Nutrition and Physical Activity.
The campaign will urge residents to ``Take five a day, take down fat, take action'' _ that is, increase fruits and vegetable servings to five a day, reduce fat in the diet and get regular exercise.
Researchers evaluate overweight and obesity using a measure called body mass index (BMI), which divides weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters.
BMIs of 30 and above are considered obese.
BMIs of 25 to 29.9 are considered to be overweight.
Last year, the National Institutes of Health set the standard for overweight lower _ in effect, reclassifying as overweight an additional 29 million Americans.
Under the old guidelines, men with a BMI of 28 and women with a BMI of 27 were considered overweight.
The conclusions by researchers from CDC and from Tufts University near Boston were based on two national telephone surveys conducted by the CDC: the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which surveys up to 100,000 American adults each year, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which talked to more than 33,000 Americans between 1988 and 1994.
The researchers found: _ Almost 55 percent of U.S. adults are overweight or obese, compared to 43 percent in 1962.
(Both percentages reflect the new weight guidelines; researchers recalculated weight data gathered over the past 30 years to make sure they were delivering an apples-to-apples comparison.
) _ Almost one-fifth of all adults are now obese, defined as being more than 30 percent above ideal weight.
_ Rates of obesity are rising fastest among young adults, college graduates and Hispanics.
_ If the trend of putting on weight cannot be reversed, the side-effects of overweight will become the greatest single cost on the U.S. health care system.
To reverse the trend, CDC's Koplan called for an information and prevention campaign with as much funding and energy as the nation has directed against tobacco in recent years.
``Both smoking and excess weight are risk factors for serious diseases, and both have behavioral components,'' he said.
``For both, we have to be very careful not to blame the victims of these conditions.
(But) it wasn't that long ago that smoking was considered a social issue, not a health issue.
Similarly, we need to move our society's concept of obesity from a cosmetic issue to a health issue''.
There is some good news on the weight front, according to JAMA.
Researchers reported that leptin, a hormone whose influence on weight loss made front-page news when it was discovered in mice in 1995, shows signs of working equally well in humans.
According to researchers from St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York, both lean and obese subjects who were injected with leptin lost significant amounts of weight during the trial of the hormone, compared to other participants injected with an inert placebo.
Moreover, the longer the study went on, the more weight the 100 participants lost.
The weight lost was almost entirely fat, as opposed to muscle tissue.
There appeared to be no adverse effects on major organs in the body over the 24 weeks of the study, which was partially supported by Amgen, Inc.
, a pharmaceutical company that synthesizes leptin.

An assortment of mice with mutant genes may be leading researchers toward the elusive goal of obesity treatments that are safe, effective and don't call for the will power of a Spartan.
In just a half-dozen years, scientists have captured a handful of genes that help regulate body weight in rodents, and which could point the way toward new drugs that can help people keep their poundage down while still filling up with food they like.
With obesity so rampant and traditional dieting such a bust, many scientists now believe the answer to obesity will emerge from work going on at a frantic pace _ and amid much secrecy _ in biotech companies that are homing in on genetic checkpoints in the body's weight control system.
While emphasizing that human obesity stems from a combination of genes and environment _ like America's abundance of tasty, fatty foods _ the biotech scientists believe that genes involved in weight regulation are the most promising targets of anti-obesity measures.
``I don't believe that social engineering (behavior change) is going to work'' to stem the soaring obesity epidemic, says David West, a genetics researcher at Parke-Davis Laboratories in Alamedia, Calif.
``We've been trying to change peoples' dietary habits for years and years, but we all like high-fat food, and our work style is such that many of us have sedentary jobs''.
Conventional diet drugs have had only modest effects in helping people lose weight and keep it off.
What's more promising, say West and other gene scientists _ are drugs targeted to specific genetic switches in the body's metabolic machine that keeps weight and energy in balance.
Such ``magic bullet'' therapies are a long way off, but the investment of money and scientific energy is enormous.
``It is quite a race,'' says Louis Tartaglia, a scientist at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a Cambridge biotech company heavily invested in obesity gene research.
Last week, Millennium scientists reported they had cloned a mutant gene in mice that enabled them to remain svelte even when eating a high-fat diet that makes normal mice corpulent.
The mutant gene, called mahogany, makes a protein that's involved in cell-to-cell signaling that helps determine how much fat the body stores.
The discovery brings to over a dozen the number of genes scientists have discovered over the last five years that influence an animal's weight-gaining tendencies.
It's not known exactly how the mutated mahogany gene protects the mice against diet-induced obesity.
But researchers are confident they will in time be able to trace the different biochemical pathways involved in weight control, and hope to be able to manipulate the genes or proteins that are turning out to be the important regulatory devices in this system.
``Because the desired effect is obtained when the mahogany gene is defective, we are optimistic about using the protein for obesity drug development,'' Dr.
Karen Moore, Millennium's director of genetic systems said when making the announcement last week.
``In developing a drug, it is always easier to decrease gene function rather than to try to increase it, The discovery of genes like mahogany stir excitement in the obesity research field.
Not only does it suggest that similar genes in humans may explain why some people eat all they want and stay thin, but it raises the prospect that such genes might provide clues leading to designer drugs for obesity that wouldn't require the person to go on a hard-to-maintain diet.
Even if counterparts exist in humans, however, it won't be that simple to pick apart the human weight control system.
``The majority of people are not defective in any one gene that would explain their obesity,'' says Tartaglia, the Millennium scientist.
More likely, he says, is that human weight is governed by a large number of genes, each one of which has only a modest effect, in combination with environmental factors.
The stakes are enormous, both in terms of improving the nation's health _ some 55 percent, or 97 million _ of Americans are overweight and obese _ but also gathering profits for biotech and pharmaceutical companies.
This new chapter in the age-old battle against overweight was touched off in 1994 when Jeffrey Friedman and colleagues at New York's Rockefeller University identified the protein made by a gene, called ob, which is mutant in a strain of mice that tend to be obese.
The protein, dubbed leptin, helps regulate weight and food intake by signaling the brain to create a ``full'' feeling in th person.
Researchers were quick to hypothesize that some, or perhaps many, obese people have too little leptin in their bodies and their brains fail to signal them to stop eating.
So, the reasoning went, give extra leptin to overweight people to curb their appetite and cause them to lose weight.
A leptin compound manufactured by Amgen, Inc.
, in California, was the first of the new gene-based drugs to go into clinical trials.
Reportedly the results have been disappointing, although the compound has worked for some of the volunteers.
Moreover, it's been found that most obese people actually have plenty of leptin: it may be that the problem is that the leptin signal isn't getting to the right receiving station.
Since the leptin gene discovery, scientists have found a number of other mouse strains with gene mutations affecting their weight and energy balance.
Each of these gene alterations provide clues to how mammals' weight is controlled, but none has led to a drug so far.
Still, the discovery of the ob gene was ``a real breakthrough, because it got people thinking about obesity as a disease,'' says Judith Stern, a professor of nutrition and internal medicine at the University of California in Davis.
How long until effective new weight control drugs reach the market is anybody's guess.
``We don't know the final chapter _ we're just learning about the puzzle'' of weight regulation, says Stern.
However, she says, ``we can't wait until we identify all the genes _ we have to do something now'' about the obesity epidemic.
Stern, a founder of the American Obesity Association, an advocacy group, says top health leaders like the surgeon general should make obesity a high priority for research and public policy.
Whether the biotech rush for gene-based obesity drugs yields dramatic results soon or not, says Stern, ``it's giving the disease of obesity some respect and allowing us to have a bit of compassion'' for the overweight.
LOS ANGELES, October 11 (Xinhua) --Two studies published this month in U.S. medical journals quantify for the first time the substantial health risks of obesity.
Both studies examined the individual risks and the benefits that even a modest amount of weight loss can confer for patients.
Obesity is increasingly being viewed as a chronic disease by medical professionals and has been established by the American Heart Association as a major, modifiable risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States.
Approximately 300,000 deaths a year are attributed to obesity.
According to Policy Analysis Inc.
, a health economic research firm, obesity increases the risk of several major diseases and that it costs the U.S. healthcare system as much as 50 billion dollars annually.
The studies are based on data relating to a person's degree of obesity to their risks of five major diseases --coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol.
In these studies, obesity was measured in terms of body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters.
The first study, published in Monday's issue of Archives of Internal Medicine, reports that persons with high BMIs have higher lifetime risks of obesity-related diseases.
For example, men 45-54 years of age who are moderately obese ( BMI of 32kg/m2) have more than twice the lifetime risk of developing high blood pressure of non-obese men (BMI of 22.5 kg/m2) of the same age, and almost three times the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
Risks are even greater among those who are severely obese.
Published in the October issue of the American Journal of Public Health, the other study examined the health and economic benefits of sustained moderate weight loss of 10 percent among persons who are overweight or obese.
The researchers reported that moderate weight loss would substantially reduce the expected number of years of life that people would have hypertension, type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
The likelihood of developing coronary heart disease was estimated to be reduced by 12 to 38 cases per 1,000 persons, and that of stroke by one to 13 cases per 1,000.
TEHRAN, June 7 (Xinhua) --Commander of Iranian Naval Forces Abbas Mohtaj said on Sunday that the forthcoming joint Iran-India naval game has nothing to do with Iran's stand towards nuclear tests carried out by India and Pakistan last month.
Mohtaj confirmed that two Indian vessels have arrived at Iranian territorial waters in the Persian Gulf to join a week-long drill with Iranian navy due to start on June 9, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
He added that the exercises are very elementary and of no operational significance because of the low number of vessels due to participate.
The Iranian commander said Iran has already voiced concern and transparent view about the nuclear tests of both India and Pakistan, adding that Tehran supports the comprehensive test ban treaty and believes that any action by any country to carry out nuclear test is provocative.
Iran has good relations with both Islamabad and New Delhi on diplomatic and defensive grounds, he added.
India donated five nuclear devices on May 11 and 13, threatening to spark a round of nuclear arms race in the subcontinent.
Pakistan, under great domestic pressure, conducted two rounds of nuclear tests in response two weeks later.
WASHINGTON (AP) --The Clinton administration expressed new worry Monday over Iran's nuclear program and whether that country has acquired the capability to make nuclear bombs and other weapons of mass destruction.
``We will continue to work hard to block those efforts,'' White House national security spokesman David Leavy said.
U.S. officials were not pleased with reports Friday from Moscow that Iran may order from Russia an additional three nuclear reactors for power generation.
Although Iran denies having a nuclear weapons program, and Russia insists its assistance is peaceful and legal, administration intelligence officials view the Russian-Iranian relationship with rising alarm.
The New York Times reported Monday that the Central Intelligence Agency has told senior Clinton administration officials that Iran might now be able to make a nuclear weapon.
CIA Director George Tenet has been briefing other U.S. policy-makers on the new assessment, the newspaper said.
National Security officials would not comment directly on the report but agreed that the possibility that Iran may be able to manufacture nuclear weapons has been a growing worry.
``We've said all along that we are concerned about Iran's efforts to develop ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction,'' Leavy said.
Intelligence and defense experts warned that Iran may be closer than previously believed to amassing a nuclear arsenal.
A senior intelligence official said the United States is watching closely the worrisome problem of availability of fissionable material to Iran, which could use it to make nuclear bombs.
There remains disagreement among intelligence officials on the pace of Iran's nuclear program and the degree to which Iran may be attempting to divert nuclear materials to weapons.
A reason for differing estimates, officials said, is the difficulty in monitoring Iran's acquisition of nuclear materials and technology.
As recently as last year, intelligence officials were telling congressional intelligence panels that Iran might be able to test a missile that could reach targets in the United States by 2010.
Officials now suggest the timetable might have to be shortened in light of the recent developments.
U.S. efforts to persuade Russia to stop providing nuclear technology to Iran have met with little success.
Russian engineers already are building a reactor at a site in southern Iran under an existing contract.
Iran also has become a top customer of Russia's ailing defense industry with purchases of fighter jets, missiles, tanks and submarines.
On several occasions, Congress has sought to impose sanctions on countries helping Iran develop nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, an intention aimed primarily at Russia.
Israel has accused Russia, China and North Korea of selling Iran technology and expertise for its arms program, including attempts to build nuclear weapons and missiles to carry them.
Pentagon officials as well as military-minded members of Congress have used the possibility of nuclear attacks from Iran, North Korea and other potential U.S. enemies as a major rationale for moving to develop a national missile defense.
TEHRAN, April 22 (Xinhua) --Iran on Wednesday strongly lambasted the United States for its accusations against Iranian-Russian nuclear cooperation, accusing Washington of supporting Israeli nuclear programs.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said the accusations indicated the U.S. hostile attitude toward Iran, adding that the United States has spared no opportunity to stop Iran's economic development plan.
"Iran's nuclear cooperation with Russia is fully for civilian application of nuclear energy and is taking place within the framework of international regulations," the Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted the spokesman as saying.
Mohammadi said that Iran and Russia have been committed to controlling the export of the nuclear energy from either country in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Russia is helping Iran build a 1,000-megawatt nuclear power plant in Bushehr, southern Iran.
U.S. officials repeatedly accused Tehran of seeking access to technology to produce nuclear weapons through building nuclear power plants.
Mohammadi also attacked Washington for providing financial assistance to Israel to modernize its military arsenal.
He said that by accusing Iran of attempting to acquire weapons of mass destruction, the U.S. has attempted to justify its dangerous plan to arm Israel "which possesses weapons of mass destruction and is the main threat to the security and stability of the region".
He reiterated that Iran always wants the Middle East free from weapons of mass destruction, urging the international community to pressure Israel to eliminate all its weapons of mass destruction and force the U.S. to abandon its dangerous policy of supporting the Jewish state.
Meanwhile, reports reaching here said that Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeni Adamov on Wednesday also stressed that the nuclear cooperation between Russia and Iran centers on peaceful application of nuclear power.
He noted that Moscow-Tehran cooperation fully observes the NPT and is under the supervision of Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
JERUSALEM (AP) _ The commander of Israel's armed forces said Monday that Israel has to be ready for a pre-emptive strike against Iran, should this become necessary.
Lt. Gen.
Shaul Mofaz was commenting on last week's military parade in Tehran in which Shahab-3 missiles capable of reaching Israel were shown.
Mofaz told Israel that the missiles, together with the nuclear warheads which Israel believes Iran is developing, pose ``a long-term threat to Israel's survival''.
Iran's Islamic regime has repeatedly called for Israel's destruction.
Lawmaker Ephraim Sneh from the opposition Labor Party said Sunday that Israel must consider a pre-emptive strike against Iran, using conventional weapons.
Other lawmakers criticized Sneh's statement as irresponsible.
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said there was no call for such declarations.
However, Mofaz said Monday that the concept of a pre-emptive strike against an imminent threat is ``part of the world view'' of the Israeli armed forces.
``I think...
a pre-emptive strike is something the armed forces should be ready for, and if it is needed they must be capable of carrying it out,'' he said.
At the start of the 1967 Mideast war, the Israeli air force destroyed most of the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian air forces in a pre-emptive strike.
In 1981, Israeli fighter bombers destroyed a nuclear reactor in Iraq shortly before it was to become operational.
Israel believed the reactor would be used to manufacture nuclear weapons.
Sneh said Iran's Shahab-3 missile will be operational next year, before the Arrow anti-missile system, a joint Israel-U.S.
project now in the testing stage, will be ready.
He said Iran is developing atomic weapons at the same fast rate.
Mofaz did not say how a pre-emptive strike against Iran would be carried out.
The Israeli air force recently took delivery of a new version of the American F-15 warplane which is capable of reaching Iran.

TEHRAN, July 22 (Xinhua) --Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said here today that Iran is committed to the human and Islamic principles and is not after the nuclear arms at all.
The 64-year-old president declared that his country decisively supports the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and elimination of the ominous phenomenon of the nuclear war.
Rafsanjani made the remark in a meeting with Hans Blix, Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
He said "Iranian nuclear programs are crystal clear and transparent and for humanitarian purposes.
We always welcome sharing experience with respective international agencies".
Blix appreciated the current cooperation between Iran and the IAEA, saying Iran allows the agency to inspect any nuclear center in Iran at any time.
He said the various inspections of Iranian nuclear installation conducted by the IAEA indicated that Iranian nuclear capability is for humanitarian and peaceful purposes.
Blix turned down the doubts by certain countries over Iran's purpose of developing the nuclear industry, saying the question is biased for political ends.
"It is the natural right of any nation to acquire nuclear technology for the production of electricity, the manufacture of medicine, its application in the humanitarian areas and the protection of the environment," he was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying.
Blix, who arrived in Tehran on Saturday, inspected a nuclear research facility in Bonab, in northwestern province of Eastern Azerbaijan.
He said "the activities of Bonab nuclear research facilities is completely directed toward peaceful purposes and toward the economic development of Iran".
Iran's nuclear industry is under constant scrutiny of the United States and Israel, which Tehran regards as two main rivals.
Both Washington and Tel Aviv maintain that Iran is seeking to use nuclear technology for military purposes.
The U.S. and Israel have even threatened to stage a preemptive air raid against the nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr, alleging that Iran plans to build an atomic bomb.
Iran is finishing the power plant with help from Russia.
Moscow has been under pressure from Washington and Tel Aviv to stop helping Iran finish the nuclear power plant which will be the first nuclear power plant in the Persian Gulf.
MOSCOW, July 18 (Xinhua) --Russia and Iran confirmed their commitment of non-proliferation and share an idea of creating a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a press release on Saturday.
Officials from the Russian and Iranian foreign ministries held consultations in Tehran on July 15-16 to discuss the problem of disarmament, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and export controls, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
The two sides emphasized the need for non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles for their delivery on the global and regional scale, the Russian ministry said.
It was reported that the two countries after the consultations adopted a joint statement on a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East.
They stressed that the creation of a nuclear-free zone in the region would strengthen global peace and security both at the international and regional levels.
The two sides proposed that the countries of the region should refrain from developing, producing, testing and acquiring nuclear weapons and from deploying them on their territory.
At the same time, Moscow and Tehran confirmed the inalienable right of all countries to acquire and develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes.
WASHINGTON _ Iran successfully tested a medium-range missile on Wednesday, a senior administration official said on Wednesday night.
The weapon, with a range of about 800 miles, is capable of hitting Israel and Saudi Arabia, and of altering the political and military balance of power in the Middle East, he said.
``This weapon would allow Iran to strike all of Israel, all of Saudi Arabia, most of Turkey and a tip of Russia,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Other officials said a U.S. spy satellite had detected the test on Wednesday morning, and that intelligence experts were still poring over data from the launching of the missile, which they believe Iran bought from North Korea.
The officials are certain that Iran successfully tested the medium-range missile, but could not provide immediate information on the location of the launching site or the area where it landed except to say both were inside Iran's borders.
A former intelligence official familiar with the spread of such weapons said: ``The major reaction to this is going to be from Israel and we have to worry what action the Israelis will take, because the Israelis clearly view the Iranians as their main threat in the Middle East''.
Israel is the only nuclear power in the region, and its missiles are believed to be capable of striking any nation in the Middle East.
Iran is working on developing a nuclear warhead but is believed to be years away from building and testing such a weapon.
But the United States is not certain of the size or sophistication of its programs to develop weapons of mass destruction.
The test on Wednesday comes as the United States and Iran have been making cautious overtures toward improving relations, after a long chill.
Just last month, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright praised President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate who took office last summer and who has confronted considerable resistance from religious and other conservatives.
But Ms.
Albright, in a speech devoted to steps for improving relations, also called on Iran to show evidence that it was not trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.
The Iranian test tells the world about Iran's abilities, but not its intentions, officials said.
``This is a demonstration of Iran's perceived need to have the capability to threaten targets outside the immediate Persian Gulf area,'' one official said.
``It's now clear that they have the political commitment to seek that kind of capability''.
The test ``will not come as a big surprise to the Israelis,'' he said, ``because they've been following Iran's missile program very closely.
``And they know, and we know, that ability to test-fire a missile and the ability to develop, produce and deploy a large-scale force are two very different things.
It could take years for Iran to achieve that capability and we have to do our best to retard that''.
Present and former intelligence officials said the missile came from North Korea, which has vowed to continue selling its weapons to any nation that can provide that cash-starved regime with hard currency.
The official North Korean news agency issued a statement last month saying that ``our missile export is aimed at obtaining foreign money we need at present''.
U.S. intelligence officials say millions of dollars that Iran has paid North Korean is invested in more missile production rather than in civilian needs.
Iran has long sought to launch a medium-range missile, and has bought technology from Russian and China as well as North Korea.
Tehran's foremost goal, a senior administration official said, is not to strike its enemies but to be seen as a political and military force to be reckoned with in the Middle East.
``There is some prestige element here,'' he said.
``We have long thought that the Iranians believe that such a weapon would give them a reach inside the region, and that they believe that it serves their interests in terms of being a strong power in the Middle East''.
U.S. intelligence agencies have worked for years to track the development of Iran's weapons programs, and have traced shipments of technology from Russia, China and North Korea as well as attempting to learn what local military and technological capability Iran had developed.
The former intelligence official said that government experts had expected a test by Iran, although the launch was not expected so soon.
He also said that the test held political significance as well as military meaning.
``My guess is they purchased a very small number of these missiles, and that this is as much a political statement as anything, and that the statement is to Israel, and that statement is: `You are now vulnerable.
You have to take us seriously'''.
But he said he doubted that the Iranians meant to be belligerent toward the Saudis, saying ``They want to co-opt the Saudis, not threaten them''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS).
The Iranians have purchased technology for several ballistic missile programs in parallel, buying Russian and Chinese technology as well as North Korean technology, for many years.
``The important point here is that they have very little indigenous internal capability to make a real missile, and they've required extensive outside technical support,'' this former official said.
``But they've been willing to spend the money.
I'd guess the Rodong would cost $10 million,'' referring to the North Korean missile.
Militarily, Iran's purchase of a handful of the missiles from North Korea does not give Tehran a major war-fighting ability, he said.
But it proves the Iranians have passed a milestone in military technology.
``In the long term,'' he said, ``the missile production assistance they've gotten from Russia and China will have the greater impact.
But the Rodongs are the attention-getters''.
Iran has a well-established Scud missile program dating back to the war with Iraq of the 1980s.
That war, a U.S. intelligence analyst said on Wednesday, ``gave them the experience of using missiles as a weapon of terror, both at receiving and delivering terror''.
In that war both nations attacked their opponent's major cities with short range missiles and Tehran was all but evacuated at times.
Iraq's missile capacity has been the subject of a seven-year U.N. effort to eradicate weapons of mass destruction.
U.S. officials said that they were certain only that Wednesday's missile test was successful, and the missile tested was similar or perhaps identical to the Korean Rodong missile.
Beyond that, they were struggling on Wednesday night to analyze the meaning of the test.
``Whether they fired a Rodong missile themselves or whether they assembled a missile by reverse-engineering a Rodong _ either way, this is a North Korean missile with another name''.
said the senior official.
The name Iran has give the missile, he said, is the Shahab-3.
Administration officials contend that they have had some success in limiting Russian and Chinese military assistance to Iran.
Russia said last week it was investigating nine companies for illegally providing weapons technology to Iran, and the United States imposed trade restrictions on those firms.
MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) --Russia reiterated Thursday that its cooperation with Iran in the nuclear industry fully conforms to all international commitments of Moscow and Tehran, including those on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.
Iran's activity in the nuclear sphere is being controlled by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has not reported any violations on the part of that country, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
Russian Nuclear Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov has just returned from a visit to Iran, which is a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), Rakhmanin said.
During Adamov's visit to Tehran, the two countries signed an agreement to accelerate the construction of a nuclear reactor in Bushehr and contemplate possible cooperation in building more nuclear power stations in Iran.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently criticized the Russia-Iran agreement as a threat to the entire region.
He expressed hope that Russia will revise this initiative because, he said, it contradicts attempts to achieve peace and stability in the region, Interfax reported.
JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a rare interview to an Israeli TV station, Pakistan's minister of information said Friday that his country was not cooperating with Iran on nuclear technology.
Israel has long feared Iran's growing weapons program and warned of ties between Iran and Pakistan after last months nuclear testing by Pakistan and India.
``Pakistan has no cooperation with any other country on the nuclear issue or the missile issue,'' Mushahid Hussein said in an interview with Israel's Channel 2 TV.
Israel has relations with India but not Pakistan, the first Muslim country to go nuclear.
Channel 2 however said that despite a lack of diplomatic relations, Pakistan was open to the station's request for an interview which was conducted with the help of a Pakistani broadcast company.
Hussein tried to calm concerns in Israel that Pakistan might share its capabilities and technology with other Muslim states.
``It is the view of Pakistan that bombs do not have religions it is unfair, unjust and wrong to qualify Pakistan's nuclear program in religious terms,'' he said.
He said that Pakistan did not know the status of Iran's nuclear program.``We have no idea about other countries' nuclear programs.
We have no idea what other countries in the region are doing, not Iran, Iraq or Israel,'' he said.
He said the recent visit of Iran's foreign minister to Pakistan following the tests had been scheduled in advance.
``We hope that no other country would feel threatened by Pakistan's nuclear program,'' he said.
Asked to comment on reports in Israel earlier this week that Pakistan had feared an Israeli air strike hours before going ahead with its nuclear tests.
Hussein replied:``We are not saying that.
There have been reports in the Western press and Indian press on that count but this is not Pakistan's official position''.

TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) --Iran has said that it's defense budget has remained unchanged over the past four years and actually had a drop if taking the inflation into account.
Keyvan Khosravi, press advisor to the Iranian defense minister, said on Sunday in an interview with the official news agency IRNA released on Monday that Iran's defense spending is driven by needs.
He said that Iran has been able to maintain a proper defensive capability in spite of the low spending in the sector thanks in part to the country's reliance on domestic resources for its defense needs.
Rejecting reports by some foreign media which claimed a 20 percent increase in Iran's defense budget, Khosravi said that "undoubtedly, Iran has the lowest defense budget among Middle East countries".
The official did not mention the figure of defense budget in the current Iranian year (starting from March 21).
But according to the budget approved by the Iranian Majlis (Parliament) in March, this year's defense budget stands at 2.89 trillion rials (1.65 billion U.S. dollars).
Khosravi also refuted the recent remarks by a U.S. naval commander on Iran's capability to build nuclear weapons, saying that the International Atomic Energy Agency has consistently confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programs.
Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the official said, adding that based on its convictions, Iran regards as inhuman the development of nuclear energy for non-peaceful purposes.
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will not build an atomic bomb despite nuclear tests by Pakistan and India that have forced ``a new security situation'' on the country, the defense minister said in comments published Monday.
``Just as the whole international and regional order has been affected by the present situation, Iran too has been placed in a new security situation,'' Rear Adm.
Ali Shamkhani said in an interview with Tehran's Jameah daily.
``Iran must take a new look at its security and strategic situations, but this does not mean entry into the age of nuclear (weapons) activity,'' Shamkhani was quoted as saying.
India tested five nuclear devices last month, which were followed by six explosions by arch-rival Pakistan.
But the tests do not put Iran under pressure to start its own nuclear weapons program, Shamkhani said.
``The present arena concerns only India and Pakistan,'' he was quoted as saying.
Iran denies repeated U.S. and Israeli allegations that it is close to building an atom bomb, saying its nuclear program is peaceful.
Just before he was toppled by Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, the U.S.-backed shah launched an ambitious nuclear program which he said was meant to guarantee future energy needs.
The program was abandoned after the revolution, but restarted in 1988.
So far, Iran is only known to have several small nuclear research facilities.
Russia is currently building a dlrs 800 million nuclear reactor in southern Iran despite opposition by the United States, which says the facility could provide Tehran with the means to build a bomb.
Iran has good military ties with China, which is believed to have helped Pakistan build its bombs.

WASHINGTON _ After India and Pakistan, what is next?
While the Clinton administration tried to stop the nuclear arms race in south Asia, senior officials turned their attention Monday to the next possible nuclear hot spot.
Officials and independent analysts agree that Iran and Iraq are both scouring international markets for nuclear weapon materials, although Iran, the leader in the competition, appears to be several years away from having devices that work.
The arms buildup on the Korean peninsula is less of a concern because North Korea, beset by financial problems, has curtailed its nuclear weapons program.
But the officials in Washington admitted that events of the past three weeks have shown that the United States cannot prevent the rise of other nuclear states.
A combination of threats and rewards did not stop nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
And economic sanctions will not sway Iran, which has no formal relations or trade with the United States.
Officials at the State Department and other agencies disagreed over the most pressing issue: how to prevent India and Pakistan from turning nuclear devices into completed weapons that can be delivered by missile.
While some in the administration are calling for the strongest sanctions possible, others argue that India and Pakistan need an incentive to stop their tests and join the community of nations committed to ending nuclear proliferation.
``We're at a loss over what to do,'' said an official familiar with the discussion.
``We have to show them that there's another avenue _ economic security instead of nuclear security''.
The debate has been complicated by federal laws requiring Clinton to impose rigid sanctions on countries that test nuclear devices.
The sanctions can be lifted only with the consent of both houses of Congress.
``Unless there are some positive steps that India and Pakistan can take to get out of the sanctions, there's no point in having sanctions,'' said Tom Collina, a director of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington.
At the same time, the Commerce Department argued Monday against fully applying economic sanctions against Pakistan, which said it conducted six nuclear tests last week.
The officials warned that the government in Islamabad would retaliate against American companies that are engaged in multi-million-dollar energy projects and other businesses in Pakistan.
Senior Pakistani members of Parliament also warned that prolonged sanctions might force their government to reconsider its allies.
Ghul Sarwar Cheema, a retired Pakistani general who was involved in Pakistan's clandestine nuclear program for more than a decade, has suggested that Pakistan might share its nuclear know-how with other countries.
``For the moment, nobody is even thinking of doing that,'' he said in an interview.
``But necessity is the mother of invention.
Don't force us, don't invite us, do not do it''.
For now, officials agree that both India and Pakistan should immediately stop testing nuclear warheads, halt missile tests, end the production of weapons-grade fuel, and join 149 other countries in signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
It all sounds quite logical.
And that's the problem: Logic has failed since India's tests rocked the western state of Rajasthan on May 11.
``The United States has articulated a series of steps that, if taken, could cap the crisis right now and contain the damage,'' said Joseph Cirincione, a specialist on nuclear proliferation at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
But, he added, ``I am personally pessimistic about the ability of rational actors to influence the process at this point.
Passions are running hot and heavy and there are many variables beyond anyone's control''.
Clinton cut short a trip to Texas to return to Washington to confer with Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright tomorrow morning before she joins foreign ministers of the five permanent United Nations Security Council members in Geneva to discuss the arms race in south Asia.
Michael Krepon, president of the non-profit Henry L.
Stimson Center, which studies arms control, said the turmoil in south Asia has overshadowed significant achievements of the past 15 years in halting the spread of nuclear weapons.
The United States and the former Soviet Union have dismantled thousands of nuclear warheads.
South Africa, a former emerging nuclear power, stopped its nuclear program before reaching weapon capacity.
In South America, Argentina, and Brazil pulled back from the brink of a nuclear arms race.
Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan have all agreed to rid their territories of nuclear warheads deployed during the Soviet era.
Iraq's nuclear weapons program has been largely destroyed.
Iran continues to raise the greatest concerns.
In a 1994 speech in Washington, James Woolsey, then director of central intelligence, warned that Iran could become a nuclear state by the year 2002 to 2004.
That estimate has been pushed back slightly, but Israeli intelligence services maintain that Iran might have a nuclear device as soon as 2001.
In Washington, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which opposes the regime in Tehran, said the government has been pursuing a nuclear buildup known as the ``great secret plan.''
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) --Stressing that it has no nuclear cooperation program with Ukraine, Iran Saturday expressed "surprise" at Kiev's announcement to cancel a nuclear contract with it, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
"Iran has no agreement with Ukraine on manufacturing turbines for (its) nuclear reactors and it is surprising that Ukraine has made such a claim," Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said at a press conference.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko said on Friday that Kiev has decided to annul a contract to supply turbines to the Russia-built Bushehr nuclear power plant in southern Iran.
Russia's assistance for Iran in the field has triggered accusations from the United States and Israel that Iran is seeking the technology for developing nuclear weapons.
It is noted Ukraine's move was made when U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was visiting the country.
Iran's nuclear activities are for peaceful means, Mohammadi said, stressing that it complies with international regulations and puts the nuclear activities under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The baseless ballyhoos of the U.S. and Israel are aimed at blocking the development of other countries, which is their legitimate right, he said.
He contended that Iran will not deprive itself of utilizing nuclear technology for its development drive.
TEHRAN, November 25 (Xinhua) --Senior Iranian officials on Monday assured Russia that Iran will use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and will pose no harm to any countries.
The assurance was made by Iranian Majlis (Islamic Consultative Assembly) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri and First Deputy Speaker Hassan Rouhani in their separate meetings with visiting Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeni Adamov.
It has become clear to the world that Iran, a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and a member of the Nuclear Disarmament Conference, is not after stockpiling nuclear weapons, Nouri said.
Russia signed a contract with Iran in 1995 to complete the construction of the Bushehr nuclear plant in southern Iran, defying pressures of the United States, which has repeatedly attempted to convince Russia not to cooperate on the project.
Washington warned that any kind of nuclear assistance to Iran could aid Iran's alleged nuclear weapons plans, but Russia argued that the plant is purely for peaceful purposes.
Nouri criticized the United States for its opposition to Tehran-Moscow nuclear cooperation, saying that Washington is against, through every possible means, those countries which resist its expansionist goals.
The Iranian speaker complained Washington's double standard in the nuclear non-proliferation issue.
No objection has been made to Israel, which has acquired nuclear weapons but refused to join the international disarmament convention, because of U.S. support for that regime, he noted.
Expressing satisfaction with Tehran-Moscow relations, Nouri said the two countries should strive for further expansion of their ties.
He named oil, gas, plane manufacturing and technical fields as suitable grounds for Iran and Russia to promote their cooperation.
In his meeting with Adamov, Rouhani said Iran is for a Middle East free of nuclear weapons within the framework of the NPT, expressing the hope that the agreements between the two countries will be implemented.
Adamov briefed Iranian officials on Russia's measures to complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
Since Russia is sure that Iran will use atomic energy for peaceful purposes, it resists pressures from a third country to cut cooperation with Iran, the Russian minister said.
Adamov, who arrived here on Saturday, said that Russian political and parliamentary officials are firmly determined to expand multi-faceted cooperation with Iran.
TEHRAN, July 17 (Xinhua) --Iran and Russia Friday urge all countries concerned to take "practical and urgent measures" to establish a zone free of nuclear arms in the Middle East.
The call was issued in a joint communique released here after two day talks between Iran and Russia on nuclear weapons, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
In the communique, the two countries acknowledged that the proliferation of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction constituted threat to international peace and security.
It said that the establishment of the nuclear-weapon-free zones, particularly in the Middle East, should be encouraged as a top priority.
The two sides demand the U.N. and other international organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), play a vital role in creating such zones.
They stressed that a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East region would considerably strengthen peace and security both at both regional and international levels.
Expressing concern over the existing nuclear facilities in the Middle East, the two sides urged all regional countries, prior to the establishment of a nuclear-free zone, to show thorough restraint and not to develop, produce, or test nuclear devices.
The communique called for the earliest possible accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of all states that have not signed it, particularly the countries in possession of nuclear facilities not subject to the IAEA safeguards.
Meanwhile, Tehran and Moscow reaffirmed the inalienable right of states to acquire and develop nuclear energy for peaceful purpose, saying peaceful use of nuclear energy by the NPT states under the IAEA control could not cause damage to any other country.
Russia expressed satisfaction with Iran's declaration that it was committed to the regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and had no intention of obtaining nuclear weapons.
The joint communique was apparently aimed at allying the fear among some countries, including the U.S. and Israel, that Iran is striving to acquire nuclear weapons and long-range missiles with the Russian assistance.
Under the Israeli pressure, the U.S.
Congress is considering to impose sanctions against Russian companies reportedly involved in transferring nuclear and missile technologies to Iran.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 24: Iran's test of a missile that can reach Israel, Saudi Arabia and Turkey is a disturbing and dangerous development.
Testing such an advanced weapons system, potentially capable of carrying biological, chemical and nuclear as well as conventional weapons to targets 800 miles away, heightens anxieties in an already tense Middle East.
It also raises new doubts about whether Iran, despite the encouraging words of its moderate President, Mohammad Khatami, is actually turning away from threatening its neighbors and from developing weapons of mass destruction, two conditions for improved relations with the United States.
Islamic conservatives strongly opposed to President Khatami's foreign and domestic policies still wield paramount power in Iran.
That was further demonstrated by the harsh sentence for corruption and mismanagement imposed Thursday on Tehran's mayor, an important Khatami ally, and the shutting down of the country's most influential pro-Khatami newspaper.
Washington must now try to divine what the missile test reveals about the power struggle in Iran and the ability of President Khatami to produce more moderate foreign policies.
The Clinton administration's efforts to renew a dialogue with Iran should be pursued, but they must also be realistic.
The administration also needs to initiate wider diplomatic efforts to curtail outside aid to Iranian missile programs.
The missile tested Wednesday is based on a design imported from North Korea.
But Russia and China have also repeatedly exported sensitive missile technology to Iran.
Washington should demand that Russia and China tighten their export controls and punish violators.
It should also press North Korea to end rogue missile exports.
The administration ought to devote some attention to reassuring Israel, which considers Iran its most dangerous enemy and feels newly vulnerable.
Syria already has missiles capable of reaching Israel; Iraqi Scuds did so during the gulf war, and now Iran may soon pose a missile threat.
The immediate dangers facing Israel, however, have not substantially increased, and Israel should not act precipitously.
Iran's new missiles are not yet operational, and Tehran remains at least five, and probably more, years away from developing nuclear weapons.
That allows some time for arms control and diplomacy.
Israel can also improve its regional security by pursuing efforts to negotiate peace with the Palestinians.
Iran's missile test is a warning of future danger that should not be ignored.
MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) --Iran has neither the technological capability nor the intention of making nuclear weapons, said Russian Nuclear Energy Minister Viktor Nikitovich Mikhailov on Friday.
Mikhailov was responding to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent remarks indicating that Iran is making atomic weapons, the Interfax Agency reported.
Iran is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mikhailov said, adding that the IAEA has inspected the nuclear facilities in Iran many times but discovered no problems.
And the minister stressed that the nuclear power station to be built by Iran with Russian assistance is purely for peaceful use.
The United States and Israel, which suspect that Iran may want to acquire nuclear weapons, have opposed the Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation.
Washington has repeatedly asked Moscow to abandon its plan to help Tehran build a nuclear power station under an agreement between the two countries signed in 1995.
Russia has so far refused to yield to U.S. pressure even though the U.S. has threatened to suspend economic assistance to Russia.
TEHRAN, June 19 (Xinhua) --Iran on Friday dismissed as "baseless" the Israeli claim that it had bought chemical weapons parts and technologies from an Israeli arms trader.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said that such baseless claims by Israeli officials indicated Israeli uneasiness over Iran's diplomatic efforts made at the international arena to curb the danger posed by Israeli nuclear weapons.
Mohammadi made the comments after an Israeli court convicted Wednesday Nachum Manbar, an Israeli businessman, of illegally selling biological and chemical weapons parts and knowhow to Iran for 16 millions U.S. dollars in the past years.
Manbar is expected to be sentenced to life sentence on this charge.
The spokesman accused high-ranking Israeli officials of spreading false rumors against Iran, saying Tehran is seriously trying to cleanse the Middle East from nuclear arms.
He noted that the Israeli accusation coincided with Iran's successful efforts to pressure Israel on the nuclear issue.
He added that Iran believes security would be restored in the Middle East region through controlling and curbing Israel's atomic efforts.
He stressed that Israel can not legitimize its occupation even through its nuclear weapons.
Mohammadi finally urged the International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct inspection of Israel's nuclear facilities.
Israel is believed to be the only Middle East country that has acquired nuclear capability.
Although western intelligence reports claimed that Israel has about 200 nuclear warheads, Israel has neither denied nor confirmed that it has nuclear weapons.
Worried that its leading enemy Iran could acquire nuclear weapons that will threaten its safety, Israel has been launching an aggressive campaign around the world to prevent Tehran from obtaining nuclear technologies needed to build a nuclear bomb.
TEHRAN, November 29 (Xinhua) --Iran has rejected as "unfounded" an allegation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Iran is seeking access to atomic warheads.
Hamid Reza Asefi, the spokesman of Iranian Foreign Ministry, said Sunday the allegation was fabricated by Israel with the mere objective to divert the public opinion from dangerous schemes of Israel, "which has turned the region into a depot of nuclear weapons".
Netanyahu voiced Israel's concern over Iran's nuclear programs after Tehran and Moscow signed a memorandum of understanding last Tuesday to promote their nuclear cooperation.
Under the memorandum signed at the end of a visit by Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeny Adamov to Iran, the two countries will form expert groups to discuss building more nuclear power plants in Iran.
"As the Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly announced, Iran-Russia nuclear cooperation is for peaceful purposes" and Iran carries out its peaceful atomic programs under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the spokesman said.
However, Asefi pointed out that Iran considers self-defense based on internationally recognized principles as its legitimate right.
Russia is helping Iran build a nuclear plant in Bushehr in southern Bushehr province according to a contract concluded in 1994 between the two countries.
TEHRAN, October 7 (Xinhua) --Iran on Thursday appealed the international community for practical steps to reinforce the treaty on disarmament and for elimination of nuclear arms.
The appeal was made by Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs Javad Zarif in Vienna, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
As long as nuclear arsenal exists in the world, the Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) will not succeed, said the minister who was attending a three-day conference on Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) which opened in Vienna on Wednesday.
The CTBT is a prerequisite for the NPT and the international community should take actions in safeguarding the peaceful use of nuclear technology, said the minister.
The NPT should be used to reinforce disarmament and the peaceful use of nuclear technology as well, he added.
Iran has long been accused by the U.S. of trying to gain nuclear capability, a charge repeatedly denied by Tehran.
Iran said it was pursuing peaceful use of nuclear energy in different fields, which is an inalienable right of any country in the world.
People in Israel are getting fairly perplexing bits of news about missile proliferation in their region.
These usually come from the American government rather than their own.
The biggest shock came in July, when the American Defense Department detected the test-flight of an Iranian rocket called the Shahab-3, whose 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) range could put Israel, and much of Saudi Arabia and Turkey, at risk.
Some, but not much, reassurance was provided by the later news that the Arrow-2 anti-missile missile, being developed in Israel with American help, had this month intercepted and destroyed a computer-simulated target.
For defense experts who are wrestling with the technical challenge of ``hitting a bullet with a bullet,'' the Arrow's success offered a ray of hope after a run of disappointments.
A separate, all-American effort to develop an anti-missile shield for overseas troops and bases --known as THAAD -- has been dogged by technical failures.
But even the Arrow's most enthusiastic advocates acknowledge that it will not provide Israel with an impenetrable shield.
And its success has done nothing to cool the tempers of Israeli strategists, arguing hotly about the system's price and purpose.
Reuven Pedatzur, an Israeli airman turned political scientist, reckons that Arrow will cost many times more than its list price of $1.6 billion, without providing any guarantee against what he says is the real threat of the next decade: the fact that some of the missiles within range of Israel will be nuclear-tipped.
He argues that instead of bankrupting itself with faulty shields, Israel should, if necessary, ward off the nuclear challenge by making public its own nuclear arsenal --and its willingness to use it.
Iran's test flight came as a nasty surprise to both America and Israel, indicating that the Iranians were at least a year further forward with developing missiles than hitherto believed.
Curt Weldon, a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who has championed the need for anti-missile defenses, believes the Shahab-3 may already be operational.
The previous, cozy assumption of defense experts that some time must elapse between testing and deployment no longer holds good.
Weldon also believes that as early as next year, Iran will be able to test (and presumably soon deploy) another system, the Shahab-4, with a 2,000-kilometer range that runs deep into Central Europe.
Yet, even for Israelis, the most troubling recent development in missile proliferation was the news on Aug.
31 that North Korea had launched a three-stage missile, known as the Taepo Dong, which is apparently capable of reaching the western fringes of Alaska.
On past experience, whatever rocket technology appears in North Korea will then spread rapidly to Pakistan and Iran.
There is, of course, no simple correlation between the range of a country's rockets and the fear it arouses.
For instance, the West is not particularly alarmed, at least for the moment, by the fact that Saudi Arabia has rockets that can go farther than any other in the region.
Saudi Arabia's missiles were quietly obtained, during the 1980s, from China --which, ironically, may have bought the technology from Israel.
The states whose arsenals keep western and Israeli security people awake at night are Iran and Iraq.
Although Iraq is banned under UN sanctions from deploying systems with a range of over 150 kilometers, it may have secretly saved a few of its old rockets from destruction --and might be able to rebuild a medium-range missile capacity fairly rapidly once sanctions are lifted.
After lobbying vigorously to stem the flow of Russian technology to Iran, Israel appears to have accepted that nothing is likely to stop the Shahab series of missiles from being developed.
But it stresses the point that other countries besides itself could be in Iran's sights.
``The threat is not only to us, but to many others in the region,'' said Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, on Sept.
21. He might have added that Israel is probably not even particularly high on Iran's list of concerns.
Iran has been impelled into missile-building by memories of its weakness during its war with Iraq in the 1980s, when it was unable to retaliate in kind to the Iraqi missiles that caused panic, and thousands of civilian deaths, among its urban population.
Its immediate enemy is the Taliban in Afghanistan who have threatened --albeit not all that seriously -- to deploy their Scud missiles against Iran.
Even so, Iran's defense minister, Adm.
Ali Shamkhani, is relishing the consternation that the missile test has caused.
``God willing, this will not be the only time that dedicated and mobilized workers of our defense industry surprise Israel's defense machinery,'' he gloated.
TEHRAN, June 9 (Xinhua) --Iran has dismissed as a "baseless claim by the Zionist (Israeli) circles" the allegation that Iran had asked Pakistan to transfer its nuclear technology, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Tuesday.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi in New York Monday said that Iran basically does not need such programs and has urged India and Pakistan not to involve themselves in nuclear test races.
Mohammadi's remarks came after Israel called the nuclear devices detonated by the Pakistanis late last month in response to India's nuclear tests as "Islamic bombs".
Iran, among the Islamic countries, has hailed the Pakistani nuclear explosions as Islamic world's deterrent Israel.
The tests in south Asia triggered serious concern about the proliferation of nuclear technology in the Middle East region.
Mohammadi said the real goal of Israeli accusations against Iran was to justify its dangerous nuclear capability and its ever growing stock of nuclear arsenal.
The spokesman said the Israeli move was designed to procrastinate supervision by the International Atomic Energy Agency of its nuclear installations and the signing of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Iran believes that the strengthening of the NPT without any discrimination to include nuclear powers and Israel, is the best way to guarantee global peace, he said.
Iran has repeatedly stressed the need to eventually make South Asia and the Middle East nuclear-free.
TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) --Iran's Defense Ministry and Armed Forces Logistics issued a statement here Saturday, dismissing a Turkish newspaper report that Iran intends to carry out nuclear tests.
Iran fully adheres to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on nuclear weapons, and all its atomic programs are based on "peaceful use of nuclear energy for medical, agricultural and energy-generation purposes" and "within the framework of the internationally-recognized absolute rights of any country".
Tehran has been accused by the U.S. of being ambitious in pursuing non-conventional weapons capabilities, a charge which Iran has repeatedly denied.
Iran is determined to stick to a principled policy of making Persian Gulf and the Middle East region free of non-conventional arms, including nuclear, chemical and biological weaponry, said the statement.
"Despite Iran's location in an area where there are mounting nuclear challenges, the Iranian armed forces do not have any research program on use of nuclear energy for military purposes," it said.
It attacked Israel for possessing a nuclear arsenal and refusing to subject it to international supervision.
TEHRAN, Iran (AP) --A day after test-firing a new long-range missile, Iran's regular army began its largest military exercises of the year Friday in mountainous terrain near the Iraqi border, state-run television reported.
The three-day maneuvers in the western Kurdistan province were being supervised by top Iranian military commanders and involved airborne units and ground troops using radar interception systems, the broadcast said.
The number of troops participating was not known.
''The maneuvers are aimed at testing the army's defense capability and its military might,'' the report said.
The war games, code-named Zolfaqar-3, began a day after Iran test-fired its first solid-liquid fuel missile, raising concerns in Israel and in Washington that Iran is developing its long-range offensive missile capacity.
Iran's Defense Minister Vice Adm.
Ali Shamkhani said the Shahab-3D missile would be used for nonmilitary purposes, such as launching satellites, the Islamic Republic News Agency said.
Shamkhani insisted Iran did not produce offensive weapons, the agency added.
But in Washington and Israel, the test caused serious concern.
''We regard their aggressive efforts to develop missile capability as a serious threat,'' a State Department deputy spokesman, Philip Reeker, said Thursday.
Israel's deputy defense minister Ephraim Sneh said that the missile development program, coupled with a parallel effort to build a nuclear warhead, spelled danger not only for Israel but for the rest of the world.
''This the second test in a short time.
It's now obvious that Iran embarking on a colossal effort to build a long-range missile capability,'' he said.
''It means that in a few years time, Iran will be able to threaten with a nuclear weapon, a very broad part of the world''.
Iran has built and tested a number of missiles, including the Shahab-3 which has a range of 810 miles.
Washington denounced a July test of the Shahab-3, which it said could reach Israel or U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) --The U.S.
State Department reaffirmed its opposition Monday to Russian participation in the construction of a nuclear reactor in Iran.
"We are opposed to any form of nuclear cooperation with Tehran, given its demonstrated interest acquiring a nuclear weapons capability," State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
Last week, Russia confirmed its intention to complete work on the Bushehr nuclear power project and strongly denied U.S. allegations the plant could help Tehran build an atomic bomb.
Russia said Iran's technological potential does not allow it to produce nuclear weapons.
Rubin credited Russia with not cooperating with Iran on projects that could be the most dangerous in terms of nuclear proliferation.
SOMERSWORTH, N.H.
(AP) --Sen.
Edward Kennedy will endorse Al Gore for president Wednesday in a move the Gore campaign hopes will help with voters in New Hampshire, next door to Kennedy's Massachusetts, and with wavering Democrats nationwide.
Kennedy normally does not endorse candidates before the party's nominating convention.
The decision to act now came after reflection over the Christmas holiday and a phone call between Kennedy and Gore since New Year's, according to people in the Kennedy camp.
Gore supporters had pushed for the endorsement.
Kennedy, brother of President Kennedy, remains a liberal hero to many Democrats.
He sought the presidency himself in 1980 and has served in the Senate not only with both Gore and rival Democratic contender Bill Bradley but with the vice president's father, Al Gore Sr.
, in the 1960s.
Kennedy and Gore planned to appear at a Boston middle school to talk about education policy on Wednesday before driving north to Portsmouth, N.H., to discuss health care with senior citizens.
The two issues are paramount to Kennedy and have been mainstays of Gore's campaign for the party's 2000 presidential nomination.
In recent months, the vice president has seen his once sizable lead in the polls diminish in the face of a strong challenge from Bradley, the former New Jersey senator.
That has caused some Democrats to wish out loud that Kennedy would announce an endorsement.
The Kennedy camp said the endorsement should not be viewed as a slap against Bradley, who has unveiled a health care plan that Gore has criticized.
Bradley suggested the development only bolstered his contention that Gore, unlike him, is a Washington insider.
``I thought all along he would have more of the establishment support,'' Bradley told reporters in Bedford, N.H.
``All I have are the people.
He has entrenched power, he has a president who is supporting him, loyal to him --as he was loyal to the president -- he's got most of the DNC (Democratic National Committee), he's got most of the big Democratic fund-raisers, he rides on Air Force Two.
That is entrenched power,'' Bradley said.
The Kennedy endorsement is sure to garner huge coverage in the Boston media --which spills into vote-rich southern New Hampshire.
It may also trigger other endorsements by the Massachusetts congressional delegation, which largely has held off endorsing in the primary.
The vice president, speaking with reporters after addressing students at the high school in this seacoast community, was clearly pleased by the development.
``I don't think anybody in the modern history of America has really accomplished more in the United States Senate over the course of a career than Ted Kennedy,'' Gore said.
On the eve of his 59th trip to California, Vice President Al Gore has released a list of new endorsements for his 2000 presidential bid from state congressional leaders _ including U.S.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
Gore's campaign had been the target of recent criticism from GOP leaders saying he lacks the thick roster of endorsements compiled by Republican front-runner Texas Gov.
George W.
Bush. But his two-day trip beginning Thursday, to include stops in Los Angeles, Fresno and San Francisco, is designed in part to showcase the formal endorsement of Gov.
Gray Davis _ who will tour California with him _ as well as other state Democratic leaders.
Gore will speak to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, visit a public high school and speak to labor leaders during his state trip.
Among the members of the California Democratic congressional delegation who announced their formal endorsements of Gore's presidential campaign Wednesday were Lois Capps of Santa Barbara, Gary Condit of Modesto, Julian Dixon of Los Angeles, Bob Filner of Chula Vista, Tom Lantos of San Mateo, Barbara Lee of Oakland, Bob Matsui of Sacramento, Ellen Tauscher of Walnut Creek and Mike Thompson of Napa.
``It shows they have seen the type of leadership that Al Gore has brought to this country and...
the working families of California,'' said Gore spokesman Roger Salazar Wednesday.
``They recognize the vice president has a serious commitment to standing up for the issues that are important to the people of California _ and he'll continue to do so as president''.
Gore has previously won the endorsement of U.S.
Sen. Barbara Boxer, as well as state Democratic U.S.
Reps. Xavier Becerra of Los Angeles, Howard Berman of Mission Hills, Cal Dooly of Hanford, Zoe Lofgren of San Jose, Matthew Martinez of Alhambra, Juanita Millender-McDonald of Torrance, Grace Napolitano of Norwalk and Lucille Roybal-Allard of Los Angeles.
Feinstein has long expressed her support of Gore's 2000 presidential bid, but made her endorsement formal Wednesday.
``Vice President Al Gore has demonstrated time and time again he is dedicated to the people of the United States _ be it reducing gun violence, protecting our environment, bolstering patients rights, safeguarding a woman's right to choose or reforming public education,'' said Feinstein in a statement released Wednesday.
She lauded Gore as ``a leader with a proven record of fighting on our behalf,'' saying, ``He has also demonstrated a strong commitment to my home state of California _ helping our schools, funding job programs, &LR; and promoting the development of high-tech industries that have fueled our economic growth''. &LR;
NASHVILLE, Tenn.
(AP) --Recalling an uncle who suffered poison gas exposure in World War I, Vice President Al Gore said his family is ``one of millions that knows firsthand'' about the Balkans' role in world stability.
``Will the 21st century be shaped and molded by thugs in ski masks with weapons in their hands and hatred in their hearts?
The answer given by the people of the United States of America is no,'' Gore said Friday night at his first Tennessee fund-raiser for the 2000 presidential election.
``We saw midway through this century the moral consequences of crimes against humanity that occurred with much of the world standing by, not doing much of anything about it,'' Gore said.
Speaking to about 450 Democratic supporters gathered at a $1,000-per-plate dinner, Gore promised to get Kosovar refugees ``back to their homes, with security and with justice''.
Gore is expected to spend this weekend campaigning in New Hampshire.
Gore hasn't officially announced his campaign for the 2000 Democratic nomination, but has raised $8.9 million, according to the Federal Election Commission.
MONTGOMERY, Ohio (AP) --Vice President Al Gore commiserated with those who lost their homes and businesses when a killer tornado tore through suburban Cincinnati earlier this month.
``I was truly inspired by the way everybody pulled together, neighbors helping neighbors,'' Gore said Monday.
``I was not fully prepared for how much damage there was''.
The vice president visited the areas worst hit when a pre-dawn twister with 200-mph winds carved a narrow path through affluent subdivisions in Montgomery, Blue Ash and other communities on April 9.
Four people died.
``I'm sorry for what you all have been through,'' Gore told Laurie Arshonsky, whose home in Montgomery was destroyed.
``You people have really suffered through a lot''.
Mrs. Arshonsky showed Gore a handful of jewelry and trinkets that she had recovered from the rubble of her home.
``What I'd like to do with my garden, I'd like to make it a tornado victory garden,'' she told him.
``Over the last several years, I have had the occasion to go to several different parts of our country to see the aftermath of disasters, and every one is unique and different,'' Gore said.
``But one comparison I would like to make is this: I don't know when I've heard more compliments in the aftermath for the response, the organization, the hard work, the long hours the way everybody has pulled together''.
``Those of you who lost family members and loved ones will be in our hearts and in our prayers,'' Gore said.
``Those who have suffered such devastating property losses --the business owners, the homeowners, apartment dwellers and others -- you are in our prayers''.
Insured damage has been put at $66 million by the Ohio Insurance Institute; the total uninsured damage has not been calculated.
Gov. Bob Taft last week asked President Clinton to approve assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for families, businesses and local governments in the tornado-damaged areas.
``It is under intensive review right now at FEMA.
There should be some kind of word on that early this week,'' Gore said.
Later, the vice president ate lunch with contributors to his 2000 presidential campaign and moderated a public forum on long-term health care.
About 80 people attended the fund-raiser for Gore, where a spokesman for his presidential campaign said the campaign expected to net about $150,000 from the visit.
MANCHESTER, N.H.
(AP) --Vice President Al Gore, in a show of political force to kick off his 2000 presidential campaign, secured the endorsements Monday of House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and party stalwarts from the early battleground states of New Hampshire and Iowa.
With onstage hugs from Gephardt, Gore implored a New Hampshire crowd to ``stand with me,'' then headed for Iowa and a later stop in his onetime rival's hometown of St.
Louis. ``We would all be proud to have him as president of the United States,'' said the Missouri lawmaker, who opted out of the presidential race Feb.
3 to focus his energies on becoming speaker of the House.
Gephardt's announcement reflects the desire of top Democrats to settle the presidential nomination early and set their sights on winning both the House and White House in November 2000.
President Clinton long ago pledged to help Gore get elected, guaranteeing his understudy an advantage not always bestowed upon vice presidents.
Former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley is the only announced challenger for the party's presidential nomination, though civil rights activist Jesse Jackson may enter the fray.
Lagging in polls, Bradley hopes to build a resurgent campaign that catches fire at the grass roots.
He is buoyed by evidence of potential Gore weakness in the general election.
``We've got to have a nominee who can win,'' Bradley said.
Gore plans to capitalize on the popularity of Clinton initiatives while at the same time distinguishing himself from his boss.
The difficulty of this balancing act was evident at a New Hampshire news conference.
Gore said he will ``face entirely new challenges, and we need new answers''.
Yet his answers sounded familiar: Reduce class sizes, make preschool available to all students and improve health care.
Clinton has pressed those ideas, but Gore promises to push them further.
``If you don't want to join us in bringing radical change to public education, stand out of the way,'' he told a crowd of 400 New Hampshire activists at a boisterous indoor rally.
With hardly a mention of his boss, Gore shouted again and again: ``Stand with me''!
Gephardt and Gore hugged after their speeches, raising their hands high.
The pair headed next to Iowa, hitting in one day the two states that cast the earliest votes in 2000.
In rolling out the endorsements on his first official political trip of the campaign, Gore hoped to develop a sense of inevitability about his nomination even before he formally announces his candidacy.
``It's a reflection of reality,'' David Rohde, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, said of Gephardt's endorsement.
``He and everyone else thinks Gore will be the nominee.
What Gephardt wants is to be speaker --and it's better to be part of a team than to hold back''.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Gore said he is taking nothing for granted.
``I welcome a spirited contest,'' he said.
``I always expect it''.
He promised to return to both states to campaign in living rooms and coffee shops.
During the three-state swing, Gore also locked down the endorsements of Bill Shaheen, husband of New Hampshire Gov.
Jeanne Shaheen, and prominent Democrats in Iowa.
The New Hampshire governor and Iowa Gov.
Tom Vilsack are still neutral, though Shaheen is said to be leaning heavily toward Gore.
The same polls that show Gore with a wide lead over Bradley offer hints at weakness.
The latest Wall Street Journal-NBC poll shows Gore 18 percentage points behind Texas Gov.
George W.
Bush, the early favorite for the Republican nomination.
Gore did not mention Bush but criticized his father's ``failed prescriptions of the past''.
A Pew Research Center survey found nearly half of independent voters and 16 percent of likely Democratic voters said they had ruled out voting for Gore.
The same poll showed that 76 percent of independents and 53 percent of Democrats said they would consider voting for Bush.
``If I were the Gore campaign I would be concerned,'' said Democratic consultant David Axelrod of Chicago.
``But I wouldn't panic''.
Last week, Gore worked from the White House to lay claim to a series of bite-size initiatives popular among suburban voters, such as promising to ease traffic jams.
Fine ideas, Democrats say, but he needs to leave Clinton's side to promote his own agenda.
``I'm not sure about that ribbon-cutting strategy.
That one makes me nervous,'' Axelrod said.
``I think it just underscores the second-banana thing''.
Republicans say Gore won't escape Clinton's policies or controversies.
``He is the Velcro to Clinton's Teflon,'' said GOP media strategist Alex Castellanos.
Gore proved last week that he can make mistakes.
He claimed that he created the Internet, giving Republicans reason to howl.
Shortly after announcing he would not be a presidential candidate, Gephardt told Gore over lunch that he would endorse him.
Gore's campaign saved the announcement until they could get the greatest attention for it.
Gore will formally declare his candidacy later this year.
WASHINGTON (AP) --Vice President Al Gore's 2000 campaign has appointed a campaign pro with local Washington connections as its political director.
Donna Brazile, chief of staff and press secretary for Del.
Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District of Columbia, was national field director for Rep.
Dick Gephardt's 1988 presidential campaign.
She also works as a consultant to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, as she did in the 1996 and 1998 campaigns.
Brazile is an at-large member of Democratic National Committee and an adjunct professor at the University of Maryland.
As Gore's political director and deputy campaign manager, she will be responsible for political outreach efforts, including lining up endorsements and delegates within the party.
Gore has been criticized within the party --mostly by women's groups -- for lacking more women in his inner circle of advisers.
Brazile will join Tina Flournoy, the campaign's finance chairwoman, as the second black woman in a senior role.
WASHINGTON (AP) --Vice President Al Gore, who continues to reshuffle his struggling presidential campaign, has selected Donna Brazile to be his new campaign manager, officials said today.
Brazile replaces Craig Smith, a longtime aide to President Clinton who did not want to move to Tennessee with the campaign.
Smith will head Gore's transition to Tennessee.
Brazile's appointment was to be announced by Gore today at a ribbon-cutting ceremony at his new Nashville, Tenn.
, headquarters, said two campaign officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Brazile is one of the Democratic Party's most experienced grass-roots organizers.
The appointment of Brazile, who is black, helps diversify Gore's inner circle, which has been criticized for being top heavy with white males.
Brazile, who is in her early 40s, is former chief of staff and political adviser to Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington, D.C.'s delegate to the House.
She is an adjunct political science professor at the University of Maryland, a member of Democratic National Committee and longtime associate of the Rev.
Jesse Jackson.
Brazile designed voter-campaign assessment program for the Democratic House campaign committee, which helped increase minority voter turnout.
A New Orleans native, she holds an undergraduate degree from Louisiana State University.
Brazile resigned as deputy national field director for Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign after making comments about the personal life of his Republican opponent, then-Vice President George Bush.
Bush is the father of George W.
Bush, the GOP front-runner in the 2000 presidential campaign.
Gore's campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, and media adviser, Carter Eskew, retained their jobs in the transition to Tennessee.
Gore ordered the move to shake up his campaign after rival Bill Bradley of New Jersey caught him in polls and money-raising.
He replaced his pollster, Mark Penn, and plans to thin out his campaign staff.
WASHINGTON (AP) --Vice President Al Gore received the endorsement of his boss' wife Tuesday as he sought to rally women behind his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
``Al Gore has been out in front for women, for families, for children, throughout his life,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton told several hundred women at a downtown hotel.
``Now is the time for all of us to be out in front for him.
He is my choice and I hope your choice for the next president of the United States''.
Gore will officially announce his candidacy for the nation's top job on June 16 in Carthage, Tenn.
, according to spokesman Roger Salazar.
That is the site of the Gore family farm.
Women are expected to play a pivotal role in the 2000 elections and Gore is seeking to inherit the support that President Clinton had enjoyed among them.
His focus on family issues helped him win the women's vote 55 percent to 37 percent in 1996.
But in a head-to-head matchup with Texas Gov.
George W.
Bush, the Republican leader in early presidential polls, Gore trails among women by 10 points --52 percent to 42 percent, according to a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll in late May.
Women were about equally split in that poll on whether Gore has the vision to solve the nation's problems.
By a 50 percent to 32 percent margin, they said they were less likely to vote for Gore if Clinton actively supports and campaigns for him.
At the rally, Gore talked about his pride in cosponsoring, as a senator, the bill that was the first signed into law under the Clinton-Gore administration --the Family and Medical Leave Act, which gives workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to take care of a new children, a seriously ill family member or personal illness.
He promised additional family-friendly policies as president.
``I have listened to working families and I know our work is not done,'' Gore said as the mostly female crowd waved ``Gore 2000'' placards or mini-American flags.
Gore said he wants to extend the family leave law ``so parents can meet with their children's teacher without fearing the loss of their job''.
He also talked about making preschool available to every child, reducing class sizes, allowing parents to pay for college tuition ``tax-free and inflation-free'' and using new technologies to tailor learning to individual children.
Tipper Gore noted the importance of women to her husband's campaign.
``As we know from past elections, when women vote Democrats win,'' she said.
``We need your help to share with the country his vision and we need your help to get the word out about his commitment...
on the issues that matter''.
A partial list of female supporters distributed by the Gore 2000 campaign names members of Congress, former governors, other state officials and mayors.
Among those on stage with Gore were Rep.
Sheila Jackson Lee of D-Texas; Del.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C; Maryland Lt.
Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency .
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua ) --U.S.
Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday that he is moving his campaign to State of Tennessee.
"I want to take this campaign for the presidency directly to the grass roots and directly to the American people," he told a news conference.
"I welcome the new shape of this campaign," Gore said.
"This is a hard, tough fight and I'm going to fight my heart out for every single vote".
The former Tennessee senator, who grew up in Washington, said he is taking his campaign "lock, stock and barrel" out of the nation's capital and to downtown Nashville in Tennessee State, where he will open his new headquarters in a week.
Gore's move is expected to cut his campaign staff, which Gore considered too big, too expensive and too slow to react.
Analysts said the move also will help distance Gore from President Bill Clinton, whose scandal-plagued administration has had a negative pull on the vice president's poll numbers.
Gore's announcement came with a growing concern within the Gore campaign about the threat from Democratic Bradley and Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush.
WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, accepting endorsements from hundreds of Latino leaders, warned Tuesday that Republican-sponsored tax cuts, the GOP's opposition to census sampling and Texas Gov.
George Bush's education proposals could wipe out economic gains made by Hispanics under administration policies.
Gore's warnings came as his presidential campaign launched ``Ganamos con Gore'' (''We win with Gore''), a nationwide effort to build on the political organizations of the nearly 600 Hispanic elected officials and community leaders who endorsed the vice president Tuesday.
Gore said federal tax credit payments to the poor have been the ``single most beneficial economic change'' for Hispanics and other working poor families over the last two decades.
But he noted that House Republicans are considering plans to delay billions of dollars in those tax credit payments in order to pay for other federal spending and to help finance a tax cut that Gore described as ``risky'' to the current economic expansion.
The vice president also said GOP-sponsored tax cuts could lead to reductions in federal aid to education.
And while he did not mention Bush by name, he noted that ``some Republican candidates stand and pretend to support public education while at the same time supporting this risky tax scheme that would devastate public education in this country''.
He also criticized the kind of education policy recently outlined by Bush, in which federal dollars would be diverted from failing public schools to private schools that are not required to admit all students.
``It's the strangest education I've ever seen because they are claiming they can add by subtracting and dividing,'' he said.
Gore also questioned how any GOP presidential candidate could stand by the efforts of House Republicans to stop the Census Bureau from using statistical sampling in order to avoid the kind of undercounting of minorities that has occurred in the last two census counts.
``How can anyone look at the extra problems and challenges facing the Latino community and come to the conclusion that...
they cannot support a fair and accurate census,'' Gore said.
``I don't think anyone can claim to be a friend of the Latino community while simultaneously supporting an approach to the census which is designed to intentionally undercount Latinos''.
The Hispanic community, which is expected to become the largest ethnic minority in the country by 2005, is keenly interested in the 2000 census.
The population count is used in the funding formulas of nearly every federal program.
The Hispanic endorsements of Gore may have taken some of the sting out of the decision by Friends of the Earth, an influential environmental group, to back former Sen.
Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's sole competitor for the 2000 Democratic presidential campaign.
Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.
, a senior member of the Democratic leadership in Congress, called Bradley, his fellow New Jerseyite, a ``great guy'' as he introduced Gore to the Hispanic leaders who crowded into a Capitol Hill hotel room for the ``Ganamos con Gore'' event.
But in reminding the crowd that Gore has stood against Republican initiatives that were widely viewed as anti-immigrant in the Hispanic community since the GOP takeover of Congress in 1994, Menendez asked, ``Where were those who want our votes now who should have been at our side defending us then''?
Bradley retired from the Senate in 1996, briefly mulled an independent run for president, then spent time lecturing at Stanford University in California before deciding to challenge Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Menendez also lashed out at Bush, the overwhelming favorite to win the 2000 GOP presidential nomination, suggesting that the Texan's campaign signature of ``compassionate conservatism'' insults Hispanics.
``Our community doesn't need compassion _ even talking to us in that way treats us as a stepchild,'' he said.
``We don't need compassion, we need educational opportunity ...
health care security (and) access to capital''.
California Lt.
Gov. Cruz Bustamante, a longtime Gore booster, used Bush to whip up the enthusiasm of the crowd.
``I don't get it.
What's all this talk about George Bush and the Latino community?
They talk about this guy like he's Ricky Martin or something.
Anybody who thinks that George W.
Bush is good for Latinos _ they are living la vie da loca''.
He added: ``I think he's just a little bit more sizzle than he is steak''.

WASHINGTON (AP) --Vice President Al Gore appealed to black members of Congress and their guests Wednesday night to help turn out voters next year to keep a Democrat in the White House and return control of the House to Democrats.
He noted that a turnover of the House from Republican to Democratic control in the 2000 election would put blacks in key committee chairmanships.
The country needs ``more political maturity,'' not attempts to eliminate affirmative action programs, Gore told about 500 people at a dinner sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus.
``We don't need more division in America,'' Gore said, adding that that his vision of the nation in the new millennium is that of a place ``committed to justice as well as prosperity''.
Gore already has formed committees for seeking the Democratic presidential nomination next year and named several key campaign officials.
Since the start of President Clinton's administration more blacks have become home and business owners as well as federal judges than ever before, he said.
Despite the achievements, too many are still without adequate health care or are forced to learn in crumbling, overcrowded schools buildings, he said.
Blacks also remain twice as likely to die at birth or from HIV/AIDS, or to be unemployed, he said.
CLEVELAND (AP) - Al Gore took off for a week of hopscotching states with big primary jackpots Friday, picking up liberal endorsements on his way.
Bill Bradley camped in Washington state, trying to wrest primary voters from Republican John McCain as well Democrat Gore.
McCain has gained support from independents and Democrats in his primary battles with George W.
Bush, and Bradley was trying hard to keep that from happening in Washington.
In campaign handouts and in his public remarks, Bradley was contrasting his record with McCain's on the environment, an important and emotional issue in the Northwest.
"McCain is a reformer and I'm a reformer," Bradley said.
"We both want campaign finance reform.
There's no question about it.
But when it comes to the environment there's a vast difference between John McCain and me".
He criticized McCain for calling a West Coast salmon project "pork barrel" spending, and he said he had an 84 percent vote rating from the League of Conservation Voters compared with McCain's 20 percent.
He didn't spare Gore, either, saying the vice president "never saw a dam he didn't like".
Bradley was endorsed by local environmental leaders as a champion of Pacific Northwest concerns such as pipeline safety, salmon restoration and prevention of oil tanker spills.
He was accompanied by Marlene Robinson, mother of Liam Wood, a teen-ager killed in a petroleum pipeline explosion in Bellingham.
Bradley's campaign strategy - ignore the delegate-rich states with March 7 primaries and hunker down for a symbolic victory in Washington's nonbinding Feb.
29 contest - confounded California-based Democratic consultant Bill Carrick.
"I think it's ridiculous.
He should be spending all his time here or New York," Carrick said.
Gore's smooth sail, buoyed by a growing lead in polls, was delayed only slightly Friday when the plane chartered for his campaign press entourage was grounded at Andrews Air Force Base because of hydraulic failure.
The vice president's Secret Service agents and military valets squeezed into the forward cabins on Air Force Two to make room for stranded reporters.
The mix of campaign and government showed up again when reporters were handed "Gore 2000" press releases bearing the stamp of the official fax machine in Gore's White House communications office.
One release trumpeted his endorsement by Sen.
Joe Biden, D-Del.
Another promoted Gore's campaign stop at Cleveland's Eliza Bryant Center, the first senior citizens housing center in Cleveland to accept black residents.
There, Gore pushed his plan for a huge, open-ended expansion of Medicare to cover prescription drugs.
"I'll bet you know some people who sometimes take out their prescriptions, put 'em out on the table and try to figure out which one they can cut back on or cut out," Gore told about 75 senior citizens.
"Has anyone here ever done that?
Have you"?
Biden breakfasted privately with Gore before he left Washington.
The vice president also was being endorsed by Jerry Brown, the Oakland, Calif.
, mayor and three-time failed presidential candidate.
Brown was expected to appear with Gore - but not definitely so, aides cautioned - at an Oakland longshoreman's union hall very late on Friday night.
Both endorsements were expected to help dampen some of Bradley's most barbed criticisms of Gore - that he's a closet conservative who pays lip service to campaign finance reform.
Brown, who left the Democratic Party to be independent, made campaign finance a principal cause as a presidential candidate.
Gore also was endorsed Friday by Colorado Rep.
Mark Udall, son of the late Mo Udall, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1976.
In the next week, Gore plans to visit Washington state, Colorado, Arizona, Georgia, New York and Massachusetts in addition to Friday's Ohio and California.
The latest New York poll released Friday showed Gore's lead widening among enrolled Democrats there but narrowing among those who definitely plan to vote in the state's March 7 Democratic primary.
The state's primary is considered a must for Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey who once starred for the New York Knicks basketball team.
Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion poll found that among registered Democrats, Gore led Bradley, 56 percent to 32 percent, up from the 15-point lead the vice president held two weeks ago.
Among those Democrats who said they will definitely vote on March 7, Gore's lead slipped to 53-38, down from the 25-point margin he enjoyed earlier this month.
Still, it was a far cry from December, when the Marist poll showed Gore and Bradley in a statistical tie in the state.
"If I were Gore, I would be spending a lot more time in California and the Pacific Northwest" than in New York, veteran Democratic campaign consultant Hank Sheinkopf said.
WASHINGTON (AP) --Rep.
Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I.
, on Friday endorsed Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2000.
Kennedy chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the fund-raising arm of House Democrats.
He is the youngest son of Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
, and nephew of President Kennedy and Robert F.
Kennedy. ``Al Gore has always stood up for what's right for America,'' Kennedy said in a statement.
NASHVILLE, Tenn.
_ Vice President Al Gore declared ``a new day'' in his presidential bid Wednesday with a symbolic homecoming and the opening of a new campaign headquarters far from the constant political intrigue and daily odds-making of Washington.
``Home is where we start from,'' Gore told the nearly 300 people who gathered in the asphalt parking lot of the office building that will serve as his campaign headquarters as he tries to rejuvenate a White House bid that has not gone according to plan.
With his wife Tipper and his 87-year-old mother Pauline at his side, the vice president said, ``Home is not only a place _ it's an idea...
Home is where we learn our values.
It's where we turn to remember ourselves in the best sense''.
Fittingly, the new headquarters building, across the street from Nashville's Centennial Medical Center, once served as a rehabilitation center.
And Gore 2000 officials readily acknowledged that the campaign needs rehabilitation in the wake of a stronger than expected challenge from former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley.
And what better place to do that, they said, than in Tennessee, the state Gore represented in Congress for 16 years before being elected vice president on the ticket with Bill Clinton in 1992.
``Tennessee has a tremendous amount of pride in Al Gore and he connects with people in Tennessee,'' said Tony Coelho, the chairman of Gore's presidential campaign.
``There will be a great deal of enthusiasm and support for him here''.
Indeed, newly appointed campaign manager Donna Brazile said Tennesseans will be recruited in the coming weeks to make political pilgrimages to Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states with the first voting in the Democratic presidential contest next year.
``The 'Tennessee Travelers' are going to tell everybody in Iowa and New Hampshire what Al Gore is all about,'' she said.
Jimmy Carter, a dark horse for the Democratic nomination in 1976, used a similar tactic, sending hundreds of Georgians to the early primary states.
They called themselves the ``Peanut Brigade,'' in honor of Carter's background as a peanut farmer.
That kind of enthusiasm for Gore was absent in Washington, 550 miles away, Coelho acknowledged.
``Inside the Beltway, they are a little jaded about presidential candidates,'' he added.
``That's why a lot of presidential campaigns are run from local areas''.
Until Wednesday, Gore's campaign had been run from high-rent offices on K Street in Washington, the corridor favored by the lobbying and law firms that wield so much influence in the nation's capital.
Last week, in one of the more dramatic actions of his campaign, Gore announced that he was moving the operation ``from K Street in Washington to the aisles of Kmart in Nashville'' in an effort to get the attention of average voters.
And at the Kmart near his new headquarters on the west side of downtown Nashville, Gore's decision to run his presidential campaign from Tennessee was widely praised by customers.
``Somebody has to stand up for the working families in this country,'' said William Moorman, a 48-year-old blue collar employee of British Petroleum, who was dropping off film at the Kmart.
``I guess that's what he's trying to do.
There's just too much money influencing things in Washington,'' added Moorman, who described himself as an ``independent'' voter.
Critics have suggested that the campaign move is little more than a stunt by a presidential candidate who, as vice president, senator, congressman and the son of a senator, has spent virtually his entire life in Washington.
But the Tennesseans who came to watch Gore cut the ribbon on his new headquarters have always viewed the vice president as one of their own.
``He's one of us, always has been,'' said Deedie Drake, an elderly woman from Murfreesboro.
Gore, who is often mocked for his formality, continued to project a more relaxed style at Wednesday's ceremonies, though he promised a ``rip-tootin' campaign'' against Bradley.
Gore was dressed in a blue sports shirt, khaki pants and cowboy boots.
Most staff members were similarly casual.
Nevertheless, the Gore campaign is anything but casual in trying to shift its massive political operation from Washington to Nashville.
Brazile said the Nashville site will not be fully operational until the middle of October.
Coelho, Brazile and Carter Eskew, the media consultant hired to help develop Gore's campaign message, are already working out of the Nashville office.
But there still is no final word on how many of the 90-member campaign staff in Washington would move to Tennessee.

WASHINGTON (AP) --Vice President Al Gore named a veteran of the Clinton-Gore presidential campaigns to be his campaign press secretary.
Catherine ``Kiki'' Moore, who worked for the 1992 and 1996 Clinton-Gore campaigns, will fill the empty press secretary slot at Gore 2000 starting Sept.
7, campaign general chairman Tony Coelho said.
Gore has been making efforts to add women to prominent positions on his campaign team.
Deputy campaign chairman Marla Romash and pollster Celinda Lake were recent hires.
Since acting as spokeswoman for President Clinton's 1997 inaugural, Moore was a partner with the Dewey Square Group, a Washington consulting firm that specializes in grass-roots and communications strategies.
CONCORD, N.H.
(AP) --Vice President Al Gore on Saturday took his presidential campaign to a living room that helped launch Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton into the White House.
Gore greeted about 70 people in the home of Democratic activist and former Mayor Martin Gross.
As he did throughout his two-day stay in New Hampshire --site of the first presidential primary in 2000 -- Gore stressed saving Medicare and Social Security, the environment, and education.
``No Democratic presidential candidate who has campaigned in this house has failed to get elected president at some point,'' Gross said.
Clinton visited the residence before placing a welcomed second in the 1992 state primary, and Carter came here before winning the 1976 primary.
Gore visited in 1988, when he failed to win the Democratic nomination, and now has a second chance, Gross said.
Gore addressed a forum on home health care in Portsmouth and spoke at a Democratic dinner in Conway on Friday.
He spent Saturday meeting with voters in homes in Concord, Manchester and Nashua.
During most of the trip, Gore did what his advisers have been wanting him to do: shed his stiff image and talk to people one-on-one.
``This is what he needs to do,'' said Bill Shaheen, his state campaign manager and Gov.
Jeanne Shaheen's husband.
``He's going into real parlors, meeting real people, hearing real questions''.
Recent polls have shown that while most Americans are pleased with Gore's performance as vice president, they don't see him as a strong leader.
He has trailed two Republicans, former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole and Texas Gov.
George W.
Bush, in head-to-head matchups.
But several voters who met Gore this weekend, including lawyer Sean O'Connell, said they found Gore more exciting than his reputation.
``People think he's a little wooden, but it's not true,'' O'Connell said.
``He really can connect''.
After jogging five miles through Concord --he runs at least three miles a day, according to the Secret Service -- Gore surprised customers with a Saturday stop at the Capitol City Diner.
He joined some diners in their booths and told them he wants to raise the minimum wage and help the homeless.
WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore emerges from President Clinton's impeachment struggle with his own presidential campaign strengthened by the disciplined Democratic unity that helped rescue the embattled chief executive.
But the vice president's campaign for the White House faces a fresh challenge from some Democrats in Congress who want Gore to criticize the president's conduct to help the party distinguish itself more effectively from Clinton on the hot-button issue of personal values.
Clinton, impeached by the House for perjury and obstruction of justice for trying to conceal his dalliance with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, was acquitted by the Senate on Friday.
``We've all condemned the president's personal conduct on an individual basis,'' said a prominent Democratic lawmaker who has been involved in national Democratic fund-raising efforts.
``But we need Gore to speak for all Democrats and make our stance more clear to help us reclaim the values issue''.
A senior official in Gore's presidential campaign, speaking on condition anonymity, said Gore may ``say something again'' about Clinton's personal conduct.
``I think the American people are tired of hearing about this,'' the official added.
``They want us to start talking about their problems and their future''.
Gore issued a statement Friday welcoming Senate acquittal of Clinton and urging the nation to ``heal the wounds of this impeachment debate''.
Gore added: ``I know that President Clinton is eager to work across party lines on these and other challenges.
And I know that his leadership will continue to be good'' for the country.
Aides said Gore plans to gradually highlight differences with Clinton on policies and programs later this spring as he shifts into campaign mode.
``We're going to talk about what we're going to do _ and not about what we did,'' his campaign aide said.
Jesse Jackson, the civil rights activist who has twice campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination, says that Gore emerges from Clinton's impeachment fight as a formidable candidate.
``He's stronger because he has the absolute support of a strong president, a robust economy and has made no outstanding mistakes,'' Jackson said.
Jackson added in an interview on CNN that he may compete against Gore for the Democratic nomination in order to ``broaden the base of our party''.
Gore must ``earn the nomination, not inherit the nomination,'' Jackson said.
Thomas E.
Patterson, a presidential campaign scholar at Harvard, says Gore has to distinguish himself from Clinton with considerable delicacy to avoid appearing disloyal.
Gore, a former senator from Tennessee, owes his shot at the White House to Clinton, the Arkansas governor who defied conventional electoral strategy in 1992 by naming a fellow southerner to join a baby-boom ticket.
Gore was born in 1948, Clinton in 1946.
Gore underscored his loyalty to Clinton in the depths of the impeachment fight at a Democratic pep rally on the White House lawn on Dec.
19, hours after the House voted to impeach a president for first time in 131 years.
Clinton has ``acknowledged that what he did was wrong,'' Gore said, adding that the nation must also ``acknowledge that invoking the solemn power of impeachment in the cause of partisan politics is wrong''.
Gore then introduced Clinton as ``my friend, America's great president''.
Patterson said that Gore must now ``look for an opportunity to express unhappiness with the president's conduct'' sometime over the next month.
``You do it; you say you've done it; and you move on,'' Patterson said.
Kathy Sullivan, incoming chairwoman of the Democratic Party in New Hampshire, the state planning to hold the nation's first presidential primary in 2000, warned that Democrats in New Hampshire aren't looking for Gore to condemn Clinton.
Gore ``scores a lot of points for loyalty to the president,'' Sullivan said.
Gore's fidelity and commitment to his family are so widely known that he doesn't need to highlight differences with Clinton on values, she said.
With impeachment behind Clinton, Gore is now free to confront his lone declared Democratic challenger, former Sen.
Bill Bradley of New Jersey, and to begin taking on potential Republican challengers such as Texas Gov.
George W.
Bush and former Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole, wife of 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole.
Gore's most formidable Democratic challenger has already stepped aside.
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri announced in early February that he would abandon a threatened bid for the Democratic nomination in favor of efforts to help Democrats reclaim political control of the House that was lost to Republicans in 1994 for the first time in 40 years.
Sens. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.
, and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.
, have also announced they will forego presidential campaigns in 2000.
Gore still could face challenges for the Democratic nomination from Sen.
John Kerry of Massachusetts, as well as Jackson.
Polls show Gore well ahead of all potential Democratic rivals.
The surveys also show that Gore's stature has barely dimmed as a result of six years of service in the White House.
A survey for ABC News in May 1994 found that 58 percent of American adults had a favorable impression of Gore; a survey for Time/CNN conducted last month found 58 percent of respondents had a favorable impression.
Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, said Gore has emerged from Clinton's travails largely unscathed.
``When you add it all up, I don't think that it's had a tremendous impact on Gore,'' Sabato said.
``Gore's popularity stems from the economy.
If we continue to have a good economy, he will continue to benefit''.
&QL; (STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS).
&QL; &QL; Gore, who opened a campaign headquarters in Washington in early February, is building his bid to succeed Clinton on powers of incumbency.
A Washington insider and son of a senator, he has served in the House, Senate and White House for 22 years.
Gore crisscrosses the nation on thinly veiled political missions to announce federal grants in early caucus or primary states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and California.
With Clinton's blessing, Gore increasingly steps forward to spotlight initiatives that court powerful Democratic constituencies including labor unions, women, African-Americans, Hispanics and liberals.
Clinton pointedly cited Gore's ``visionary leadership'' in his own nationally televised State of the Union address on Jan.
19 and followed up with praise the next day at campaign events in Buffalo, N.Y., and Norristown, Pa.
``I can say without qualification that no vice president in history has had so much responsibility or done so much good,'' Clinton told a boisterous rally in Norristown.
Gore is tapping into a network of loyal Democratic campaign donors whose contributions to the Clinton-Gore ticket and the Democratic Party in 1992 and 1996 enabled Democrats to mount the most expensive presidential campaign in American history.
Experts say that Gore will easily raise the $33 million by year's end that is permitted for presidential candidates accepting federal matching funds.
Attorney General Janet Reno last year cleared Gore of any wrongdoing in the Democrats' controversial 1996 fund-raising activities.
The presidential primaries are stacked early in 2000, playing into the hands of an elected official with a built-in platform.
Some 35 states are expected to have held their primaries by March 21, 2000.
Gore has history on his side as well.
Four of the five Democratic vice presidents who have sought the party's nomination since World War II have captured the nomination.
Five of the last 10 presidents first served as vice president.
Gore's delicate balancing act between loyalty and independence recalls challenges faced by Vice President George Bush as he prepared to launch his 1988 campaign to succeed Ronald Reagan and Vice President Hubert Humphrey as he sought to succeed Lyndon B.
Johnson in 1968.
Polls asking voters about a hypothetical race show Gore trailing two undeclared Republican presidential candidates.
A Los Angles Times survey completed Jan.
29 showed Bush, the Texas governor, topping Gore 57 percent to 39 percent.
The same study found Mrs.
Dole beating Gore 50 percent to 42 percent.
STAMFORD, Conn.
(AP) - A Stamford woman has become the official yarmulke maker of the Gore-Lieberman presidential ticket.
After hearing that Stamford-native Lieberman had been chosen as Al Gore's running mate, Marsha Greenberg decided to knit him a gift.
The end result was a blue yarmulke with red and white striped letters reading, ''Gore-Lieberman 2000''.
A yarmulke is a skull cap worn by Jewish males as a sign of humility before God.
''As the first Orthodox Jew who's gotten so far, I knew he would wear it if I could get it to him,'' she said.
''It's the campaign yarmulke''.
Greenberg called Harold Bernstein, a cousin of Lieberman and president of Congregation Agudath Sholom, which she attends.
Bernstein passed along the skull cap to one of Lieberman's aides at the Italian Center of Stamford, where the senator and Vice President Al Gore visited Wednesday night.
Greenberg was later told about a playful struggle between the two candidates over her handiwork.
''Senator Lieberman thought it was wonderful, but Gore just flipped and took it from Lieberman,'' Greenberg said.
''It was like two boys fighting''.
The next day, when it became apparent Gore really was intent on keeping the yarmulke, a Lieberman aide called Bernstein to ask Greenberg if she could make another for the senator.
Greenberg agreed.
Bernstein will take the yarmulke to the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles next week to present it to Lieberman.
Greenberg said it takes about eight hours of stitch-work to complete the cap.
''I start with six stitches in the center and keep making loops outward,'' she said.
''It's very tedious, but I sit in front of the television or take it with me on the train''.
Greenberg is a musician but said she has always made yarmulkes as a sideline for friends and family.
She said she was flattered that Gore wanted her yarmulke.
''Gore broke ground by selecting Senator Lieberman,'' Greenberg said.
''He's not shying away from Lieberman's religion.
He's embracing it.
It's wonderful to see.''
WASHINGTON _ Jose Villarreal, the San Antonio lawyer serving as treasurer of Vice President Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign, said Monday that he will work to make sure the Gore campaign's fund raising complies with the ``letter and spirit'' of the law.
Villarreal, a partner in the San Antonio office of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld, began his part-time duties as Gore's campaign treasurer on Jan.
1. He said he will ``assemble the resources necessary to wage this campaign and do so in an expeditious manner''.
Villarreal said he will supervise Gore's fund raising ``in a manner that fully complies with both the letter and spirit of the law,'' adding: ``We'll make certain to do that.
As treasurer, I'll do everything within my power to insure that happens''.
Gore's fund raising in the 1996 re-election campaign of President Clinton came under scrutiny of Congress and the Justice Department.
Attorney General Janet Reno later cleared Gore of any wrong doing.
Villarreal, a graduate of Purdue University and the Indiana University school of law, served as deputy campaign manager for the 1988 Democratic presidential campaign of former Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis and as deputy campaign manger for the 1992 Democratic presidential campaign of then-Arkansas Gov.
Bill Clinton.
He also served as associate director of Clinton's White House office of presidential personnel.
Serving as treasurer is a ``new area of responsibility for me,'' Villarreal said in an interview Monday.
``I have never been involved in this capacity before.
It's new''.
Villarreal will be legally responsible for the Gore campaign's filings with the Federal Election Commission.
Villarreal said he wanted to work for Gore's election as president because Gore has worked in concert with Clinton to lead ``one of the greatest peacetime economies'' in American history.
Craig Smith, the former White House political director who now heads Gore's presidential campaign, said Villarreal was chosen for the assignment as treasurer because he has extensive experience in national politics, ``he's well respected nationally and he's a big political player in Texas and the country as a whole.''
WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore will take his first formal step toward running for president in 2000 by notifying the Federal Election Commission that he has formed a campaign organization, aides to the vice president said Thursday.
The aides said papers would be mailed to the commission Friday as official confirmation so the organization could begin to raise money.
So far, only one other Democrat has signaled his intention to run for president _ former Sen.
Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
, who has created an exploratory committee.
Gore has decided to skip this preliminary step to an official announcement of candidacy.
But other prominent Democrats are expected to test the waters, as well, including Sen.
John Kerry of Massachusetts, Sen.
Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Rep.
Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader.
Earlier this week, Sen.
John McCain of Arizona became the first Republican to announce the formation of an exploratory committee.
Other Republicans, like former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander and publishing magnate Steve Forbes, have given every indication they also intend to run.
Craig Smith, a longtime aide to President Clinton, most recently as the White House political adviser, has been hired as Gore's campaign manager, a sign that he intends to draw heavily on people and grass-roots organizations that helped Clinton become the first Democrat since Franklin D.
Roosevelt to win successive terms as president.
An aide to the vice president said the campaign committee would also include Peter Knight, Clinton's campaign chairman in 1996 and former Gore chief of staff; another former vice presidential chief of staff, Jack Quinn; the current chief, Ron Klain, and former Rep.
Tom Downey, D-N.Y.
, who is one of Gore's best friends.
``This has been a Clinton-Gore operation for the last six years, not a Clinton operation and not a Gore operation,'' Smith, 40, said Thursday in an interview.
``The Clinton years will become the foundation for Gore to build on''.
Gore, who was on a skiing vacation with his family in Utah, was not available for comment, and the announcement by his staff included no statement from him.
In the view of many political experts, Gore will enter the 2000 campaign as the leading Democratic candidate, after a political career that spans eight years as a House member from Tennessee, eight years in the Senate and six years as vice president.
He was untouched by the Clinton sex scandal, and after a review by the Justice Department, Attorney General Janet Reno found no reason to investigate his fund-raising in 1996.
Beyond that, Gore has access to enormous amounts of money as a result of countless trips around the country for speeches, which exposed him to local political leaders and grass-roots organizations to cement his own ties for the future.
During the 1998 midterm election campaign, he stumped for hundreds of Democrats across the country, appearing in more than 30 states in just the final two months of the campaign _ chits that will no doubt make him the least likely candidate to encounter problems raising the federal spending limit for 2000, which is expected to be set at about $35 million.
The 1996 limit was $30.9 million.
But Gore, 50, is not without concerns as the campaign unfolds.
A speaker who often sounds wooden and looks stiff, he has yet to demonstrate consistently a folksy side that appeals to many voters.
Roxanne Conlin, the Democratic Party chairwoman in Iowa, where the first caucuses are held, said she expected Gore to be the front-runner.
``But Iowans are pretty sophisticated evaluators,'' she said.
``All candidates, no matter what their title is, have to sit down in living rooms and talk policy and issues''.
Jeff Woodburn, the outgoing state party chairman in New Hampshire, site of the first primary, and a Gore supporter said: ``His biggest negative, especially running in the small, early states, could be his person-to-person approach''.
In addition, Gore could find that many voters, including Democrats, are turned off by a candidate aligned so closely to a president who has encountered so many personal difficulties.
``I am certain that in a country of 250 million, somebody would say that,'' Smith said.
``The situation exists as it exists.
There are upsides and downsides.
But the president's job approval rating is at 72 percent, so there is a strong feeling that the upsides outweigh any downsides, if there are any.''
WASHINGTON (AP) --In what was billed as the capital's first presidential fund-raiser aimed at gays and lesbians, Tipper Gore scooped up more than $150,000 for her husband's campaign Thursday and promised contributors he would ``fight for your dreams''.
``All people, regardless of sexual orientation, should be able to be a part of a loving relationship in a family without fear of recrimination or discrimination,'' Mrs.
Gore said.
A Gore administration, she pledged, would ``stand against forces of hatred''.
Her husband, Vice President Al Gore, ``will fight for your dreams.
He will fight for OUR dreams,'' she added.
Mrs. Gore did not get into specifics of the gay policy agenda.
The wife of the vice president unflappably dealt with three AIDS demonstrators who, one by one, tried to disrupt her appearance among some 400 in a small hotel ballroom with cries of ``Gore's greed kills''!
The protesters, escorted out by Secret Service agents, accused Al Gore of siding with pharmaceutical companies in an international trade dispute and trying to block South Africa's access to cheap, generic AIDS drugs.
``We thought you might be here tonight,'' Mrs.
Gore said.
``That's certainly something we all have a great deal of appreciation for --free speech and a passion about issues''.
Outside the hotel, nine activists affiliated with the group called ACT-UP carried signs calling Al Gore a ``drug company puppet'' and mocking his campaign as ``Apartheid 2000''.
Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian political group, attended the reception as a ``gold level'' contributor to ``Gays and Lesbians for Gore''.
But he said he group's presidential endorsements were still a long way off.
``Solid and deep'' is how Birch described the vice president's record on matters important to the gay community.
Former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley, Gore's only rival for the Democratic nomination, has voted the right way on gay issues but ``is not a stand-out,'' Birch said.
WASHINGTON (AP) --Vice President Al Gore said Sunday his campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, is ``doing a great job'' and will stay on despite a government report that found questionable financial management while Coelho directed the U.S. pavilion at the 1998 world's fair in Portugal.
``He is staying, and I haven't seen this report, but I know him and he is going to continue doing the terrific job that he's been doing as my campaign chair,'' Gore said on CBS's ``Face the Nation''.
Gore called Coelho a ``close friend'' and said he did not think Americans would see the charges as relevant to the campaign for the 2000 Democratic presidential nomination.
``He's doing a great job as my campaign chair and he'll continue doing a great job as my campaign chair,'' Gore said, adding, ``People that I talk to are not interested in inside baseball''.
The State Department's inspector general found potential improprieties in Coelho's work as U.S. commissioner general for the world's fair in Lisbon in June 1996.
The job, with the United State's Information Agency, included fund-raising for, as well as the design, fabrication and operation of the U.S. pavillion at the fair.
A report by investigators, made public Saturday, found Coelho improperly used $210,000 in donated airline tickets, unnecessarily kept an expensive chauffeur-driven Mercedes and hired his niece for a $2,500-a-month job.
The report said Coelho also obtained a personal loan of $300,000 from a Portuguese bank for a private foundation to use for a memorial sculpture, listing it as a liability on the USIA's records.
The U.S. government could be responsible if the loan is not paid, the inspector general said.
WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore said Monday that his chief of staff, Ron Klain, was resigning to become a partner in the Washington office of O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, a law firm based in Los Angeles.
Gore named Charles Burson, a longtime friend and counsel in his office and former attorney general of Tennessee, his new chief of staff.
Klain's departure had been expected for several weeks, since Gore named Tony Coelho, a former California congressman, general chairman of his presidential campaign.
There were reports of rifts between Coelho and Klain at the time, and some Democratic operatives expected Klain to be forced out.
But by the time of Monday's announcement, Klain and others were saying that Coelho was trying to get Klain to stay.
``Tony was doing everything humanly possible to try to get me to stay,'' Klain said in an interview.
But, he said, he had already decided it was time to leave.
``You reach a point in time when you need to do something else,'' Klain said.
``My heart said stay, but my head told me to move on''.
Campaign workers said he told them in a staff meeting that he was ``like a milk carton, and milk cartons have an expiration date''.
Friends said Klain had realized that ``the center of gravity had shifted'' from the vice president's office to the campaign.
Klain was criticized by some Gore allies after President Clinton called a reporter for The New York Times in May and said Gore needed to loosen up on the campaign trail.
Klain was in the room when the president decided to make the call.
He was blamed later for what was perceived as a public relations disaster for Gore, although others in the room had not objected either.
Klain said Monday that he and Coelho still thought the phone call was a good idea.
``Tony and I may be the only people in Washington who believe that phone call was a good idea,'' he said.
Klain, 37, will serve as a senior strategist to the campaign and will not leave for a few months, he said.
He was chief of staff for Attorney General Janet Reno before becoming Gore's chief of staff nearly four years ago.
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) --U.S.
Vice President Al Gore Thursday named Commerce Secretary William Daley to take over his presidential campaign.
Delay will resign from the present office on July 15 to replace Tony Coelho, the former California congressman who was hired by Gore a year ago to lead the campaign.
Daley, 51, son of former Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and brother of the city's current mayor, has extraordinary connections in the Democratic Party, and is considered a political insider with ties to both President Clinton and Gore.
Daley, who chaired the 1996 Democratic convention in his native city of Chicago, helped Clinton win the White House in 1992.
He recently led a successful campaign for the White House to win passage of a legislation granting permanent normal trade relations status to China by the U.S.
House of Representatives.
A senior Gore official said Tony Coelho was leaving for health reasons and on doctor's orders.
After suffering stomach pains for three weeks, Coelho checked into hospital in Washington Monday night.
He called Gore Wednesday night with his resignation.
Coelho, a prominent Democratic strategist, was named general chairman of Gore's presidential campaign in May 1999 in the first major shakeup of Gore's presidential campaign.
WASHINGTON (AP) --Vice President Al Gore, criticized for not having enough women in his inner circle, has hired a veteran female strategist to be his deputy campaign manager for his 2000 presidential bid.
Stacie Spector, deputy communications director at the White House, will move over to the Gore campaign to assist campaign manager Craig Smith and be director of strategic operations, campaign sources, asking not to be identified, said Thursday.
The job will make Spector, 35, the lead Gore aide over the campaign's operation that responds to accusations from opponents.
Spector was deputy communications director of the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign and was involved in several national political campaigns before that.
Gore has heard criticism from his own party, particularly from women's groups, about his inner circle, which has been dominated by men.
The appointment was to be announced Friday.
ATLANTA, Ga.
(AP) --Newt Gingrich has asked a judge to settle his divorce by relying on a financial agreement he and his wife worked out during a six-year separation that began when the former House Speaker came back to an empty home.
``All she left was a television and a guest bed,'' Thomas Browning, Gingrich's divorce attorney, said.
Gingrich filed for divorce July 29 amid allegations he is having an affair with 33-year-old congressional aide Callista Bisek.
Documents related to the divorce filed Friday in Cobb County Superior Court include a separation agreement signed by the couple and notarized in December 1987.
There is no indication it was ever filed.
Browning said Marianne Gingrich called her husband on his birthday in June 1987 to tell him she was leaving him.
Gingrich, he said, came back to Georgia to find his home emptied out.
Browning said the pair maintained separate residences for six years before reconciling in late 1993 or early 1994.
The separation agreement called for Mrs.
Gingrich to get $2,000 a month for six months, control over money market and checking accounts and the couple's 1984 Ford Thunderbird.
It made Gingrich responsible for the couple's bank loans and a Hecht's department store account.
The couple also divided the furniture in Washington residence and in their apartment in Jonesboro.
Gingrich, who now runs a political consulting firm, filed his request after his wife asked a judge to freeze the couple's assets until their divorce is final.
Mrs. Gingrich claims her husband transferred ``substantial portions of certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce.
Gingrich has denied the allegation.
Mrs. Gingrich, a county planner and business consultant from Ohio, referred all questions pertaining to the divorce to attorney John Mayoue.
Mayoue was out of the office Monday and could not be reached for comment.
ATLANTA (AP) --A judge ruled Thursday that a congressional aide linked romantically with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich must testify in his divorce case.
Callista Bisek had tried to block the subpoena that called for her to be deposed by lawyers for Gingrich's wife, Marianne.
District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Brook Hedge found her arguments ``without merit''.
Ms. Bisek argued that her constitutional right to privacy would be violated by allowing Mrs.
Gingrich's attorneys ``to rummage through every aspect'' of her personal life.
Ms. Bisek also said she should not be required to testify about her relationship with Gingrich under the constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination, since adultery is a crime in the District of Columbia.
Gingrich, 56, separated from his wife of 18 years in May and filed for divorce in July.
Since then, lawyers for Mrs.
Gingrich have attempted to probe his finances, business dealings and his relationship with Ms.
Bisek. On Thursday, the former Speaker released a temporary financial agreement he and his wife signed last month that pays each about $10,000 a month.
The agreement gives Mrs.
Gingrich the couple's house in Marietta, Ga.
, and Gingrich their Washington apartment.
The financial agreement was submitted as part of a motion Gingrich filed a day earlier asking a judge to force his wife to turn over money he says she's hoarding.
ATLANTA _ A lawyer for Newt Gingrich says the former U.S.
House speaker and his wife have signed a final divorce settlement and are ready to take the agreement to a Cobb County courtroom.
``We're all done except for the formality of going to the judge and getting it approved,'' said attorney Randy Evans.
Cobb County Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson has set a hearing for Thursday morning.
Even if Robinson accepts the settlement, which is nearly certain, its terms will likely remain a secret.
Evans said both sides will ask the judge to sign an order sealing the agreement, which would keep it out of the public court file.
A lawyer for Marianne Gingrich could not be reached for comment about the settlement, which is the product of more than three months of negotiations.
``When you've got this much stuff, you just try to take your time and get it right,'' Evans said.
The Gingriches agreed to settle their divorce Dec.
16, 1999, during a court-ordered mediation session that lasted 12 hours and ended well after midnight.
The tentative agreement, which the Gingriches have kept private, ended what had become a bitter divorce process for Gingrich and his wife of 18 years.
The specter of potentially embarrassing depositions in the case led Gingrich, 56, to admit to a six-year affair with Callista Bisek, a 33-year-old scheduler for the U.S.
House Agriculture Committee.
Divorce attorneys watching the case predicted early on that Gingrich would settle the case, rather than allow his personal life to be examined in a public trial.
The Gingriches' divorce will be Newt Gingrich's second, and Marianne Gingrich's first.
The couple had no children together.
Gingrich filed for divorce July 19, 1999, six months after resigning the 6th District seat he held in Congress for 20 years, and from the speakership he won in 1994 after leading House Republicans to their first majority in 40 years.
Marianne Gingrich, 48, has remained in the couple's Marietta, Ga.
, home during the divorce proceedings.
Gingrich has spent most of his time in Washington, D.C.
Gingrich makes a living these days giving speeches, sitting on corporate boards, consulting and appearing as a political analyst on Fox News.
He also holds two fellowships and maintains a nonprofit committee devoted to his political ideals.

ATLANTA (AP) --Divorce lawyers for Newt Gingrich's wife have subpoenaed cards, e-mail, phone records and other documents from a woman who has been romantically linked to the former House speaker.
Callista Bisek, a staff member of the House Agriculture Committee, is scheduled to give a videotaped deposition Wednesday in the Gingriches' divorce case.
Gingrich filed for divorce July 29 from Marianne Gingrich.
The couple married 18 years ago.
Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers are trying to establish whether Gingrich gave Ms.
Bisek funds or spent the couple's money on her.
Earlier this month, the Gingriches reached an agreement on how to temporarily split their assets until the divorce is final.
The subpoena requests documents and other items dating to January 1995, when Gingrich was installed as House Speaker.
Those include: cards, letters, e-mail and other correspondence between Ms.
Bisek and Gingrich; gifts; Ms.
Bisek's home and cellular phone records; records of loans, payments or gifts from Gingrich; photographs showing the two together; and any audio or video recordings of the two.
The subpoena also requests any clothes or other personal items belonging to Gingrich that Ms.
Bisek has in her possession.
Neither attorney in the case was available for comment Friday, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in today's editions.
MARIETTA, Ga.
(AP) --Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is asking a judge to force his estranged wife to turn over money he says she is hoarding.
Randy Evans, Gingrich's attorney, filed a motion Wednesday in Cobb County Superior Court asking that Marianne Gingrich be forced to transfer the money to a joint account within 14 days.
It threatens a contempt action if she refuses.
The couple agreed last month to set up the joint account and transfer assets into it until their divorce is final.
Evans said he believes Mrs.
Gingrich still owes the account tens of thousands of dollars.
Gingrich has turned over about $35,000, while Mrs.
Gingrich has turned over only several thousand, he said.
Mrs. Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, has denied the allegations.
Harvey Cohen, the accountant hired to manage the joint account, said he was not aware of any improprieties by either party.
Wednesday's motion was one of a series filed by Gingrich this week in an effort to take the offensive against his wife, who has sought to force him to face formal questioning about his personal and financial affairs.
Mrs. Gingrich also wants to question Callista Bisek, a congressional aide to whom Gingrich has been romantically linked.
Gingrich separated from his wife of 18 years in May and filed for divorce in July.
ATLANTA _ Attorneys for former U.S.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his soon-to-be ex-wife expect a judge to approve the couple's divorce within a month.
A court-appointed mediator who spent 12 hours negotiating a settlement agreement between the Gingriches filed her report Friday, saying the couple came to a ``full settlement'' early that morning.
With the agreement, Newt and Marianne Gingrich end a tense legal standoff and avoid a potentially embarrassing public divorce trial.
The couple have agreed to keep the terms of the agreement confidential.
``Very intense negotiation,'' said Gingrich's business attorney, Randy Evans.
``I think both parties worked very hard''.
The settlement closes five months of bitter legal wrangling in the case, culminating with Gingrich's admission last month that he's had a romantic relationship with a Washington congressional aide for six years.
The harsh attention to his private life had begun to affect Gingrich's standing as one of the national Republican's primary ideologists and fund-raisers.
Several GOP members of Congress had raised objections to Gingrich's attendance at ceremonies in Washington this fall marking the fifth anniversary of the Republican takeover of the U.S.
House. Gingrich, 56, resigned as speaker just over a year ago, after severe losses in the November 1998 elections.
He maintains that his affair with 33-year-old Callista Bisek, a scheduler and secretary for the House Agriculture Committee, was not a factor in his resignation.
Though lawyers in the case wouldn't say so, divorce lawyers across the country speculated that Gingrich's future earnings were probably a major issue in the discussions.
While his finances were limited as a leader of Congress, as a private citizen Gingrich had begun to snag speaking fees and corporate positions.
Gingrich is now a political commentator for Fox News.
Going into Thursday's mediation, Gingrich said he was willing to pay his wife alimony.
Friday's agreement lays out how the Gingriches will split their property, money and other assets.
It came during a grueling court-ordered mediation session which began at 1:30 p.m.
Thursday and ended exactly 12 hours later.
The Gingriches, who hadn't seen each other in person since June, spent much of the session in separate rooms at the Cobb County law offices of John Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney.
The couple communicated through their $100-an-hour mediator, who was selected by the court.
The lawyers wouldn't say whether the couple met face-to-face, but the Gingriches could be seen briefly mingling in the hall once or twice.
At one point, the couple's lawyers left the Gingriches alone and took a walk.
After signing the deal, the Gingriches and their attorneys boarded an elevator together for the trip 22 floors down to the parking lot.
Gingrich shooed away several television cameramen that tried to get on with them.
``No, it's over,'' he said, declining to comment about the deal.
Marianne Gingrich, her eyes bloodshot, said she was exhausted.
When asked if she was happy with the settlement, the 48-year-old Ohio native would say only, ``It's been a long day''.
Mayoue answered the same question with raised eyebrows and an affirmative nod, although his words were more diplomatic: ``It's fair to everybody.
We're pleased''.
Hours later, Mayoue summed up his feelings this way: ``It's not exhilaration.
It's more a sense that this fight, that Marianne never wanted, is being put to rest''.
It was Newt Gingrich who filed for divorce July 29, although Marianne Gingrich subsequently asked for a jury trial.
A Washington, D.C., judge had also granted her the right to question Bisek under oath; that will not take place now.
Chuck Clay, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, said the divorce settlement will likely make it easier for Gingrich to return to the public eye in a political setting.
Clay said there are no plans for Gingrich to get involved with the state GOP, but that the party won't shut him out if he wants to lend his influence.
``Are there places that I could see utilizing Newt Gingrich in some capacity?
Yes,'' Clay said.
On a personal level, Clay was pleased to hear Gingrich's divorce was over.
``It's always both a relief and it's certainly the beginning of a healing process, to settle a case rather than drag it out in a public forum''.

Newt Gingrich's divorce moves to a courtroom for the first time today as lawyers argue whether 32 questions is really just 32 questions.
Attorneys for Gingrich say he will skip today's hearing.
His estranged wife, Marianne, plans to attend.
Marianne Gingrich has asked Judge Dorothy Robinson to force Gingrich to answer pages of questions designed to uncover evidence that can be used at trial.
Most of the questions concern the former U.S.
House speaker's finances and his admitted affair with Callista Bisek, 33, a scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee in Washington.
Gingrich contends his wife's multiple-part questions actually amount to as many as 150 questions.
Georgia law allows just one-third that many, so Gingrich wants his wife to pare them down.
The contentious divorce has been full of unusual turns, including Gingrich's deposition Tuesday in Virginia of Bisek, who admitted the two have carried on a six-year affair.
Such moves have left divorce attorneys outside the case shaking their heads.
Meanwhile, Bisek has refused to answer a Washington subpoena that requires her to sit for questioning by Marianne Gingrich's attorney.
The subpoena also requires Bisek to produce gifts and other documents that evidence her affair with Gingrich.
A Washington judge will decide that dispute after a Nov.
23 hearing.
Gingrich filed for divorce in July, just days before the couple's 18th wedding anniversary.
Months earlier, Gingrich had called his wife at her childhood home in Ohio to say he wanted out of the marriage and that he was having an affair with Bisek.
``I was shocked,'' Marianne Gingrich has said of that day.
``I had no idea about any of it''.

ATLANTA _ In a surprise move, Newt Gingrich has initiated his own deposition of the Washington congressional aide named in his divorce.
In a notice filed Tuesday in Cobb County Superior Court, Gingrich announced he will question Callista Bisek under oath Nov.
9. The deposition would come two days before he and estranged wife Marianne Gingrich are to make their first court appearance together since the former speaker of the U.S.
House of Representatives filed for divorce in July.
The move, which an opposing attorney called ``unique,'' comes weeks into an unresolved legal contest between Bisek and Marianne Gingrich over the same deposition.
Bisek has asked a Washington judge to block Marianne Gingrich's subpoena asking her to answer questions about her relationship with the former speaker.
The subpoena also asks for documents, such as letters, phone records and gift receipts, that could link the two romantically.
The judge's ruling is expected any day.
``This whole idea of us hiding the ball, I want to get rid of that real quick,'' Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, said Tuesday.
``We're not hiding anything''.
Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, characterized Gingrich's deposition notice as ``peculiar'' and pointed out that Bisek has not withdrawn her objections to Mayoue's request for a deposition.
While Bisek could conceivably object to questioning by Gingrich's attorneys, Evans said she has agreed to participate.
In fact, the deposition will be taken at her attorney's office in Washington, according to Tuesday's filing.
Bisek's attorney, Pamela Bresnahan, did not return a phone message seeking confirmation.
Gingrich's notice also instructs Bisek to bring with her records of any money he has spent on her, gifts he's purchased for her, and travel she's taken at his expense since he became speaker.
They are all documents Bisek already has agreed to turn over in the deposition dispute between her and Marianne Gingrich.
According to divorce experts, Gingrich wants to make it clear to the public and to the court that Bisek is an independent witness who is not under his control.
``They are trying to show the court that they are not trying to hide her,'' Atlanta divorce attorney Shiel Edlin said.
Other than as a public relations tool, Gingrich's move to depose Bisek offers little tactical benefit, Edlin said.
In a deposition, both sides are allowed to question the witness.
While Evans has scheduled Bisek's deposition for Nov.
9, his notice left open the possibility that a new date could be negotiated.
On Nov.
11, the Gingriches are due to appear before Judge Dorothy Robinson in Cobb Superior Court as their lawyers argue several discovery motions still in contention.
Both sides say they intend to follow through with the hearing.
Said Evans: ``We want to get this case resolved or tried''.

ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich and Marianne Gingrich will try to reach a divorce settlement today in their first face-to-face meeting since theirsplit.
The couple is scheduled to appear for a court-ordered mediation session in Cobb County, Ga.
The meeting will be held at the offices of Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue.
An agreement today may be a lot to ask, however.
Marianne Gingrich has yet to question under oath her estranged husband's admitted girlfriend, Callista Bisek.
Marianne Gingrich and Mayoue have considered the deposition a key element of their case.
Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, says Marianne Gingrich has refused to even discuss a settlement until she questions Bisek.
Last month, a Washington judge ordered Bisek to answer questions under oath for Marianne Gingrich and provide documents related to her affair with Gingrich.
The documents include cards, phone records and bank statements dating back to 1995, when Newt Gingrich became speaker of the U.S.
House of Representatives.
Gingrich and Bisek, a scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee, have admitted they've been seeing each other for six years.
Bisek has begun turning over the documents to Marianne Gingrich, but the two sides have been unable to agree on a deposition date.
It's uncertain now whether Bisek's deposition will be taken at all this month.
Mayoue said he needs time to examine Bisek's documents, although he originally demanded only that Bisek bring the documents to the deposition.
Mayoue has not returned phone messages left at his office for more than a week.
Evans said this week that Gingrich is prepared to split the couple's marital assets and pay his wife alimony.
He said he wasn't sure whether a settlement could actually be reached today, but he said Gingrich is going into the mediation with an open mind.
A standing judicial order in Cobb Superior Court requires all civil cases to be taken to mediation before they can be granted a trial date.
The Gingriches elected to use a mediator chosen by the court's Alternative Dispute Resolution division, so there would be no complaints later about how a mediator was selected.
After today's session, the mediator will report to the court whether the Gingriches have hit an impasse, reached a settlement or made progress toward a divorce agreement.
Said Evans: ``I would be surprised if the judge didn't order at least one more mediation session before it goes to trial''.

WASHINGTON _ Back in the mid-1980s, well before he was House speaker, Newt Gingrich used to take long walks around the National Mall, the great public square that ties together all of Washington's grand monuments.
The walks, which became less frequent with his rise to power, helped relieve bouts of early morning depression.
``I could never get further than the Washington Monument without becoming an optimist,'' Gingrich said last week.
``I would argue to anybody in this city, if you just get out and walk down the Mall you would be a healthier human being''.
Last week, Gingrich left his office twice to walk the Mall, once with a close aide and once with his wife, Marianne.
The walks, he said, were dedicated to thinking about ``the future, thinking about how I'm going to organize my life for the next year''.
Gingrich, 55, is already moving on.
He remains on the job until the new Congress formally elects a new speaker Jan.
6. But Gingrich already has become speaker in name only.
This past week, beginning with his return to Washington after the Nov.
3 elections and ending with an address to new members, was effectively his last in power.
Gingrich's power began slipping the instant he announced 10 days ago that he would not stand for re-election as speaker and would resign the House seat he has held since 1979.
By the time Gingrich arrived on Capitol Hill last Monday to a bittersweet welcome party organized by staff, House Republicans already had shifted their allegiance to Rep.
Bob Livingston (R-La.), the lanky chairman of the House Appropriations Committee who will be named speaker by his colleagues on Wednesday.
Staff members proclaimed their affection with posters saying, ``I love Newt''.
Across America, the post-election issue of Newsweek hit newsstands, featuring a vaguely anguished close-up of Gingrich and captioned simply, ``The Loser''.
The speed at which power shifts in Washington is both breathtaking and cruel.
In Livingston's office adjacent to the Capitol, it was standing room only as reporters, lobbyists and staff competed to get Livingston's attention.
Members trying to reach Livingston by phone got constant busy signals and were forced to walk to his office to get through.
Livingston emerged from a meeting with Gingrich Tuesday afternoon, noting there were ``just a jillion tasks, a jillion things to do''.
In contrast, Gingrich's office was quiet most of the week.
Inquiries to Gingrich's press office, which typically average 100 to 150 calls a day, dropped to fewer than 30.
There were no events to plan, no agenda to set.
Gingrich himself was busy planning his private, not public, life.
``It's the reality of this town,'' said Robert Walker, a former House member from Pennsylvania and a close friend of Gingrich's.
``This town flows toward power''.
Strategy for a new life For Gingrich, the emotional high of last week may have been Monday night when he addressed the biggest contributors of GOPAC, the political action committee he once led and the vehicle of his accession to power.
The ovations were frequent and thunderous, even though the remarks themselves were little changed from his stock campaign speech.
Gingrich seemed as if a ``great burden had been lifted from his shoulders,'' said Matt Glavin, director of the Southeastern Legal Foundation in Atlanta, who spoke to Gingrich the night he announced that he would not run for speaker and who was present at the Monday dinner speech.
The defining moment of the evening came not from what Gingrich said, but from what he did.
Before the speech, he embraced Livingston warmly, conferring his blessing on the next speaker for all to see.
By Tuesday, Gingrich's staff member were already adjusting to their new roles.
Gingrich himself set the tone, coming in to work after lunch with Marianne and daughters Jackie Sue Cushman and Kathy Gingrich-Lubbers at the Old Ebbitt Grill, a Washington institution near the White House.
Gingrich padded around his office, appearing unhurried and relaxed.
Midafternoon he bumped into Casey Weldon, the third-string quarterback for the Washington Redskins, who was getting a tour of the Capitol.
The Redskins, 1-8 for the season, are having their most disastrous year of the decade.
``He told me to hang in there, that it's been a rough year for all of us,'' Weldon said.
Later, Gingrich met with Livingston for more than an hour, the first formal meeting between the two men since Livingston announced he would run for speaker the Friday after the elections.
``He just couldn't be more gracious and helpful,'' Livingston said.
Gingrich was already ``strategizing his life''.
``Newt Gingrich doesn't think small thoughts,'' Livingston said.
``He thinks large and wide.
He's an incredibly gifted person''.
Marianne popped in and out of Gingrich's office all day Tuesday, appearing positively serene.
``Changes occur,'' she said.
``You say, `OK, what next'?
We weren't expecting this, but now this is an opportunity''.
Walker, who Gingrich once hoped would be his majority whip instead of Rep.
Tom DeLay (R-Texas), ate dinner with the Gingriches Wednesday night at the Capital Grille, another Washington institution.
``I have never known him to be happier, and I certainly have never known Marianne to be happier,'' Walker said.
``This is going to give them an opportunity to plan their lives together in ways that are going to be wonderful''.
Although Gingrich hasn't said specifically what he will do when he leaves office, Walker and others are betting that he will take his place on the lucrative lecture circuit.
The occupation will continue to give Gingrich visibility, and allow him to discuss ideas without the chore of trying to translate them into legislation.
``He'll be one of the hottest names on the lecture circuit for some time to come,'' Walker said.
King of a different hill Mel Steely, an old buddy of Gingrich's from West Georgia College, dropped in to see the speaker last week and also wasn't surprised to find Gingrich in good spirits.
``He's still king of the hill, it's just a different hill,'' Steely said.
``In Newt's mind, he's always king of the hill.
That's what you guys don't understand about him''.
On Wednesday, Gingrich received some retirement advice from former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.
``He'll be around a while,'' Dole said, leaving Gingrich's office.
``At 55, he's got a lot ahead of him''.
While Gingrich wasn't getting much attention inside the Capitol last week, outside the building was a different story.
When he took his late afternoon walk around the Mall Wednesday with Steve Wesbrook, his operations manager, Gingrich was recognized by virtually everyone.
Striding past the National Gallery of Art, Gingrich shook the outstretched hand of a tourist who said, ``Nice to see you, Mr.
Speaker''. Out of Gingrich's earshot, an associate of the tourist turned to his walking partner and said, ``Nice to see you?
Nice to see you go''!
More typical was the response of Joe Domenico, who wanted his picture taken with Gingrich.
``Thank you for everything,'' Domenico said.
At the Lincoln Memorial, Gingrich was nearly tackled by a breathless student from the University of Maryland who said she was studying Gingrich in college.
Holding a copy of ``To Renew America,'' Gingrich's 1995 book, the woman begged Gingrich to sign it.
``This is a library book,'' Gingrich exclaimed.
``I know, I know,'' said Rebekah Mayer.
``I'm going to buy it from them''.
``Now Rebekah, you have to buy this book,'' Gingrich said after signing it.
``I don't want to hear later that you didn't''.
Gingrich walked the Mall again Thursday, this time with Marianne.
Holding hands, fewer people seemed to notice the speaker, who was dressed in black slacks, white shoes and brown leather jacket.
``Good luck, Newt''! shouted a man from a passing car, his fist clenched.
Before he returned to Georgia on Friday, Gingrich performed perhaps his most meaningful official duty of the week, giving the opening greeting to the 40 newly elected members of the House at freshmen orientation.
Prior to the official welcome, Gingrich breakfasted with the freshmen members in the ``family room,'' a large wood-paneled room just off the House floor reserved for members and their guests.
At the breakfast, Gingrich told the new members that service in the House was a strain on home life, and he urged them to make a special effort to spend time with their families.
He told them that House service was an honor, but that they should also have fun.
Illinois state Rep.
Judy Biggert, a Republican elected from the Chicago suburbs, recalled how Gingrich had come to her district before the election and energized her supporters ``by what he had to say''.
Gingrich's remarks Friday were inspirational, Biggert said, but different.
``It was kind of bittersweet,'' she said as she hurried into her first orientation meeting.
``I think he will be really missed.

ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich's closest associate could become part of his divorce case as Marianne Gingrich attempts to drag out and nail down any personal and financial secrets her estranged husband is keeping.
Her attorney has asked a Cobb County judge for permission to depose Joe Gaylord, whom Gingrich once described as an advisor ``on all aspects of my life and career'' and one of his ``closest friends''.
Gaylord has worked closely with Gingrich and his campaigns since the early 1980s, and he served for a time as executive director of GOPAC.
Newt Gingrich used the powerful political action committee to train Republican candidates for Congress in his long effort to win a GOP majority in the U.S.
House, and he credits Gaylord for helping him do it in 1994.
According to motions released Tuesday, Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, also wants to take a deposition from unnamed representatives of GOPAC and the Friends of Newt Gingrich campaign committee, for which Gaylord also worked.
A fourth request among those filed late Monday asks to depose an unnamed representative from Private Enterprise Partners in Washington.
Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, said he knows only that Private Enterprise Partners was an entity set up by Gaylord.
Gaylord was reached at a Washington number for Private Enterprise Partners on Tuesday, but declined to comment on the request for his depositions.
He also declined to say what the company's purpose is.
``I'm not a part of this story,'' he said.
Mayoue won't comment on the organization either, and he won't say what information he hopes to learn from the depositions.
Mayoue needs Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson's permission to take the depositions because the subjects live out of state, in the Washington area.
``My best guess is they're just trying to pin down the finance pieces,'' said Evans, Newt Gingrich's attorney.
Now that the Gingriches have decided how to temporarily split their assets until their contentious divorce is final, lawyers for both sides have been freed up to concentrate on the next phase of the case _ discovery.
Sanford Ain, a Washington, D.C.-based divorce lawyer who makes a specialty of representing high-profile politicians, said depositions are particularly useful in the information-gathering phase of a divorce case, especially when it comes to assets.
``What you're really trying to find out is how much money and where it is,'' Ain said.
Depositions also allow lawyers to confirm information they already have, and force witnesses to commit to testimony they would give at trial.
Tactically, the threat of a deposition can increase ``pressure to come to a settlement,'' Ain added.
Marianne Gingrich has already won permission to take at least one deposition that could help pressure a settlement.
On Sept.
29, 33-year-old congressional aid Callista Bisek is scheduled to answer questions under oath about her relationship with Newt Gingrich.

ATLANTA _ The estranged wife of former U.S.
House speaker Newt Gingrich wants a Cobb County, Ga.
, judge to freeze the couple's assets until their divorce is final.
In her counterclaim to Gingrich's July 29 divorce petition, Marianne Gingrich accuses her husband of transferring ``substantial portions of certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce.
She also asks that Newt Gingrich be ordered to stop any ``further transfers or concealment'' of assets, and replace any assets he has already transferred.
Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randolph Evans, denied the allegation and said Marianne Gingrich has always handled the couple's money.
``When all this came down, she had all the assets,'' Evans said.
``He was so detached from anything that had to do with finances''.
Newt Gingrich didn't even have a checkbook, the attorney said.
Marianne Gingrich's counterclaim, filed Aug.
9 in Cobb Superior Court, is not specific about what assets the former speaker is accused of attempting to transfer.
Her attorney, John Mayoue, declined to elaborate on the filing.
Judge Dorothy Robinson will hear the counterclaim on Sept.
16. The fight over assets is yet another sign that the already contentious Gingrich divorce could prove embarrassing for the former 10-term congressman, who resigned his seat in January after 1998 GOP election losses.
In recent weeks, Mayoue has said that Marianne Gingrich is prepared to thoroughly investigate her husband's personal life and business dealings.
Gingrich filed for divorce last month, after 18 years of marriage.
Marianne Gingrich immediately served notice that she wanted to depose 33-year-old Callista Bisek of Arlington, Va.
, with whom Gingrich is alleged to have an affair lasting several years.
Bisek works as an aide for the House Agriculture Committee.
Mayoue has convinced Judge Robinson to allow him to take a video-taped deposition of Bisek.
Mayoue has said he intends to question Bisek about all aspects of her relationship with Newt Gingrich.
A date for the deposition has been tentatively set for Sept.
29. Evans said Tuesday that Newt Gingrich and Bisek ``had a relationship,'' but declined to define it any further.

WASHINGTON (AP) --Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and a congressional aide named in his divorce case are trying to keep lawyers for Gingrich's wife from finding out details of their relationship.
In the latest twist in the Gingriches' bitter divorce fight, lawyers for Marianne Gingrich charged in court papers Monday that Gingrich ``willfully failed and refused to answer virtually each and every interrogatory concerning his personal and professional relationships as well as the finances of his marriage''.
And in motions filed last week in Superior Court for the District of Columbia, Callista Bisek, a clerk for the House Agriculture Committee, asked a judge to overturn a Georgia court order requiring her to answer questions about her relationship with Gingrich.
No hearing has been set, but Ms.
Bisek's scheduled appearance Wednesday for questioning by Mrs.
Gingrich's lawyers likely will be postponed until her motions are resolved.
Court papers filed in Marietta, Ga.
, where the Gingriches lived, show that Mrs.
Gingrich's lawyers posed 32 sets of questions to Gingrich, including one about sexual relationships with other women.
He answered parts of only two sets of the questions that dealt with sources of his income and retirement plans.
Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers are trying to establish whether Gingrich gave Ms.
Bisek money or spent the couple's money on her.
Randy Evans, Gingrich's lawyer, said Georgia divorce law limits each side to 50 questions, and with the 32 questions and their subparts Mrs.
Gingrich's lawyers posed more than 150.
``We answered 50 and told them if they want more than that, they need to follow the rules,'' said Evans.
``There has been no refusal to answer.
It's just that we're going to go by the rules the best we can.
Otherwise, this thing will spin out of control''.
But John Mayou, attorney for Mrs.
Gingrich, said using the 50-question rule is simply ``a ploy not to answer legitimate questions''.
In his court filing, he described the position taken by Gingrich's lawyers as ``preposterous and unsupported by any authority''.
Evans characterized the accusations as ``litigation saber rattling''.
The dispute will be decided by a Superior Court judge in Marietta, after a hearing that has yet to be scheduled.
In moving to block her testimony, Ms.
Bisek argued that her constitutional right to privacy would be violated if Mrs.
Gingrich's attorneys were allowed ``to rummage through every aspect of her personal life without any meaningful restrictions or limitations of any nature''.
She also argued that she cannot be required to testify about her relationship with Gingrich under the constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination, because adultery is a crime in the District of Columbia.
The subpoena to Ms.
Bisek requests documents and other items dating from January 1995, when Gingrich became speaker.
They include cards, letters, e-mail and other correspondence between Ms.
Bisek and Gingrich; gifts; Ms.
Bisek's home and cellular phone records; records of loans, payments or gifts from Gingrich; photographs showing the two together; and any audio or video recordings of the two.
The subpoena also requests any of Gingrich's clothes or other personal items in Ms.
Bisek's possession.
Gingrich, 56, was separated from his wife of 18 years on May 10 and filed for divorce July 29.
The Gingriches reached an agreement this month on how to temporarily split their assets until the divorce is final.
ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich and Marianne Gingrich agreed Monday to keep their divorce out of a public arena _ for now.
The Gingriches have reached a confidential agreement on how to divide their income and assets while their legal separation proceeds, avoiding an open and potentially contentious hearing this week.
``It gives them both support to live off of,'' said Randy Evans, Newt Gingrich's attorney and longtime friend.
An assets hearing scheduled for Thursday before Cobb County Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson is now unnecessary, Evans said.
But by late Monday the judge hadn't canceled what was to be a first joint appearance in court by the Gingriches.
Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, confirmed that an agreement was reached, but would give no details.
The agreement is a sign that the Gingriches are willing to compromise to keep their private lives out of public view.
The Thursday hearing was expected to attract national media, whose reporting has been stoked by Newt Gingrich's relationship with a 33-year-old congressional aide, Callista Bisek of Virginia.
By avoiding a hearing, the Gingriches also avoid answering specific charges they've made against each other since Newt Gingrich filed for the divorce in July.
Marianne Gingrich filed court papers in August accusing the former U.S.
House speaker of attempting to transfer ``certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce.
She did not specify what the assets were, but she asked the judge to force her estranged husband to return anything he took and stop him from taking anything else.
``There was never any truth to that, so there was nothing to resolve,'' Evans said.
Newt Gingrich, 56, retaliated with his own court filing, saying his wife of 18 years held all the couple's personal liquid assets when they separated.
He further accused her of depleting ``a substantial portion'' of those assets.
The former 10-term congressman from Marietta, Ga.
, also submitted a 1987 separation agreement that paid Marianne Gingrich $12,000 in alimony over six months, and divided the couple's bank accounts, furniture and cars.
Newt Gingrich asked the judge to determine whether the agreement was still technically in effect, or whether the couple could structure a new separation agreement along the same lines.
Another Newt Gingrich attorney, Thomas Browning, said the Gingriches had maintained separate residences for six years before reconciling about late 1993.
That news took Washington insiders and Gingrich supporters at home by surprise.
Marianne Gingrich, 48, has admitted in the past that there was a separation years ago but has declined to say how long it lasted.
``I'm disappointed that Newt Gingrich has chosen such a hurtful strategy,'' said Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney, before Monday's agreement, ``especially considering his very public conduct that's at the heart of this action''.

ATLANTA (AP) --Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has reached an agreement with his wife on how to divide their assets as part of their divorce proceedings, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Tuesday.
The confidential agreement on who owns what between Gingrich and his wife, Marianne, was reached Monday and ``gives them both support to live off of,'' said Randy Evans, Gingrich's attorney.
Mrs. Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, told the newspaper that an agreement was reached, but would give no details.
The agreement was reached prior to a Thursday hearing that was expected to attract national media, especially after the disclosure of Gingrich's relationship with a 33-year-old congressional aide, Callista Bisek of Virginia.
By avoiding a hearing, the Gingriches not only end their 18-year marriage, but also avoid answering specific charges they've made against each other since Newt Gingrich filed for the divorce in July.

Gingrich, 56, said in a separate filing that Mrs.

He further accused her of depleting ``a substantial portion'' of those assets.
Phone calls to Gingrich's office and Mrs.
Gingrich's house went unanswered late Monday.
Washington _ Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has filed for divorce from his wife of 18 years, saying his marriage is ``irretrievably broken''.
Gingrich filed papers Thursday in the Superior Court of Cobb County, Ga.
, stating that he and Marianne Gingrich have been separated since May 10th and are working on a divorce agreement that would ``resolve all matters and controversies between them''.
The papers, filed by Gingrich's personal attorney J.
Randolph Evans, stated little else other than Gingrich has reserved his right to ``set forth additional grounds for divorce'' if the parties can not reach an amicable conclusion to the marriage.
A hint that the divorce was not desired by both Gingriches came by way of a one-sentence statement from Marianne Gingrich.
``Marianne is saddened and disappointed at Newt's decision,'' said Victoria Toensing, her personal attorney based in Washington.
This is Gingrich's second marriage.
He divorced his first wife, Jackie, two years after his 1978 election to Congress.
Attempts to reach the former speaker were unsuccessful.
Those who know the couple say there have been problems in the marriage dating back to Gingrich's unexpected resignation as speaker of the House last fall.
Gingrich is best known leading the Republican Party's takeover of the House in 1994.
During that so-called Republican Revolution, Gingrich emphasized that ``family values'' should be a core pillar in American society.
Friends in Georgia and Washington expressed sorrow, suggesting that the years in the spotlight might have been the cause.
``It's very sad, but it's a fact of life and a high price to pay (for being in public life),'' said Rich Galen, a longtime aide to Gingrich in Washington.
``The stresses of public life that occasionally become overwhelming''.
``I am heartbroken that this has happened,'' said former Georgia State Rep.
Matt Towery, a former campaign manager who has known both Gingriches for two decades.
``All I hope is that they will be able to resolve and end this relationship with the degree of privacy and discretion of anyone who is in private life''.

ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich is a bachelor again.
On Thursday, accusations of wrongdoing and the mining of dirt in the former U.S.
House speaker's divorce case gave way to a secret settlement between Gingrich and his wife of 18 years, Marianne Gingrich.
Cobb County Judge Dorothy Robinson made the Gingriches' divorce final and agreed to seal the agreement, which they signed early this week.
By doing so, the Gingriches spared themselves any embarrassment that could have come from trying their case in public.
``It's over,'' said Tom Browning, an attorney for Newt Gingrich, who was not present at Thursday's hearing.
A sedate Marianne Gingrich, who did attend the hearing, had only this to say about the often bitter eight-month-long divorce process: ``It's been a difficult period of time''.
Standing outside the courthouse after the hearing, Marianne Ginther Gingrich, 48, added that she will keep her ex-husband's last name.
``Most people know me by that name,'' she said.
``We've been married a very long time''.
Newt Gingrich, 56, who has admitted to having a six-year affair with a House congressional aide, filed for divorce July 29.
The couple and their attorneys spent nearly the next five months arguing over depositions and money, going to court twice.
But on Dec.
16, during a court-ordered mediation that ended after 12 hours, the Gingriches reached a tentative agreement.
The couple's attorneys took another three months to work out the details.
Thursday's short and relatively quiet hearing was in stark contrast to the posturing by both sides early on.
In his July divorce petition, Newt Gingrich said the marriage was ``irretrievably broken,'' a standard clause under Georgia's ``no fault'' divorce laws.
In her answer, Marianne Gingrich denied the claim, offering no explanation for why.
And she still won't say.
On Thursday, Marianne Gingrich told the judge that the marriage was indeed ``irretrievably broken''.
Here's what else the public likely will never know: _ Whether Newt Gingrich tried to transfer ``certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce, as Marianne Gingrich alleged.
_ The details of Newt Gingrich's affair with Callista Bisek, a 33-year-old scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee, and how he carried it on without Marianne Gingrich's knowledge.
Bisek was ordered to sit for a deposition with Marianne Gingrich's lawyers, but the case was settled before that happened.
_ What the couple's associates would have to say about the marriage and Gingrich's affair.
Newt Gingrich won permission to depose Marianne Gingrich's sister and a friend, both in Ohio.
Marianne Gingrich won permission to depose members of her husband's political and business associates, including his self-described closest adviser, Joe Gaylord.
None of those depositions occurred.
_ And what Newt Gingrich earns.
That information is sealed away in the settlement.
Since resigning as speaker and from the congressional seat he held for 20 years, Gingrich has been making a living giving speeches, sitting on corporate boards, consulting and appearing as a political analyst on Fox News.
Marianne Gingrich plans to continue her work with the Red Cross and various charity groups.
She indicated Thursday that she is evaluating several business opportunities as well, but would not elaborate.

ATLANTA _ As promised, Newt Gingrich kept the pressure on his estranged wife Wednesday by asking a judge to force her to turn over money he says she's hoarding.
In a motion filed in Cobb County Superior Court, Gingrich asked a judge to give his wife Marianne 14 days to transfer the money to a joint account the couple agreed to set up last month until their divorce is final.
The motion threatens a contempt action if Marianne Gingrich continues to stall.
Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, said Marianne Gingrich still owes the joint account tens of thousands of dollars, by his estimation.
So far she has deposited only several thousand, Evans said.
Gingrich, who has signed a sworn statement saying his wife controls most of their money, has turned over about $35,000 he has been paid for sitting on several boards.
Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but he has previously denied the allegations.
The CPA managing the account for the Gingriches said both sides have acted in good faith.
Wednesday's motion was among several filed by Gingrich this week in an effort to take the offensive against his wife, who has aggressively sought to question him about personal and financial matters outside their marriage.
Marianne Gingrich also wants to depose Callista Bisek, a congressional aide with whom the former U.S.
House speaker has a relationship.
Evans said Gingrich's new attack stance will continue through the week.
Coming motions will probe financial aspects of the divorce case.
Next week, Gingrich's motions will focus on what part Marianne Gingrich played in the breakdown of the marriage.
``It is going to be a most enlightening week,'' Evans predicted.
Gingrich's latest motion centers on a Sept.
10 agreement he and his wife signed that was supposed to temporarily resolve monetary issues between the divorcing couple.
Marianne Gingrich had accused her husband of attempting to transfer money before filing his July 29 divorce petition.
Gingrich had responded by saying his wife depleted a substantial portion of the accounts she controlled.
According to the ensuing agreement, ``All existing amounts as well as any accumulated compensation earned since the parties' separation, irrespective of location, in any account of any kind...
shall be transferred immediately into the account''.
Gingrich's motion accuses Marianne Gingrich of waiting 20 days to begin transferring her portion of the assets.
Cohen, the CPA managing the joint account, says some of Gingrich's speech money is still tied up in a business he and his wife own together.
Cohen expects to get that money once the necessary transfer paperwork is completed.

ATLANTA _ Last May, Newt Gingrich told his wife he was seeing another woman and wanted a divorce.
He didn't mention the affair had been going on for six years.
``I found out with the rest of the country,'' said Marianne Gingrich, who spoke publicly about her divorce this week.
The remarks are her most extensive since the days immediately after her husband's July divorce petition was filed.
The length of the relationship, which predated Gingrich's ascension to the speakership of the U.S.
House, surprised his wife.
And it jolted many of Gingrich's colleagues still in Congress, fueling an already bubbling debate over the impact of Gingrich's divorce on his unofficial role in the Republican Party.
Last week, Gingrich's attorneys said his ``intimate relationship'' with congressional aide Callista Bisek started in November 1993, about a year before the Republican takeover of the U.S.
House. The revelation was made before an impromptu gathering of reporters outside Washington _ and it stung, Marianne Gingrich said.
``This is about a marriage.
This is not about politics and another press conference.
This is about my life,'' she told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Marianne Gingrich said she heard about the news conference from a friend, who called her from a cell phone shortly afterwards.
She said her thoughts immediately went back to late 1993.
Newt Gingrich's attorneys have said he and Marianne were separated when the relationship with Bisek began.
But Marianne Gingrich says she and her husband were living together in a Marietta, Ga.
, condo.
And while he was in Washington, she was traveling between Ohio, where her mother was recovering from a diabetes-related illness, and Florida, where her brother was fighting cancer.
``In general, my family was in medical crisis,'' she said.
Her brother later died of lymphoma.
Marianne Gingrich says it's been hard to speak of the end of her 18-year marriage and her husband's affair.
``I don't have any way to express it without getting into some really deep emotions that I don't want to share right now,'' she said.
``However, it's been good for me to be involved in a number of community activities, including the Red Cross and Mission Specialties''.
Marianne Gingrich, 48, is chairwoman of the Red Cross' Northwest Metro Service Center.
She's also helping Mission Specialties, an international service organization, raise money to buy shoes for Russian orphans.
In a People magazine article that comes out today, Marianne Gingrich said she has lost 35 pounds, the result of stress and diet.
She plans to be in a Washington courtroom next week when attorneys for Bisek, 33, will try to persuade a judge to toss out Marianne Gingrich's demand that Bisek answer questions and turn over documents related to her relationship to Newt Gingrich, 56.
Meanwhile, the divorce is beginning to concern some of Gingrich's GOP colleagues.
Some Republicans in Congress are fretting over whether Gingrich should be invited to a January celebration of the fifth anniversary of the Republican takeover of Congress.
U.S. Sen.
Paul Coverdell (R-Ga).
said Wednesday that he expects Gingrich to be invited to the January event.
But U.S.
Rep. J.C.
Watts (R-Okla).
did not endorse an invitation when he and Coverdell discussed the event with reporters.
U.S. Rep.
J.D. Hayworth (R-Ariz).
argued that Gingrich's new job as a political commentator for Fox News makes it inappropriate to include him in political gatherings.
``Time marches on.
He's gone on to other pursuits,'' Hayworth said.
But, then, he added, ``If you're looking for a spirited defense of the speaker's private life from me, you'll not get one''.
Other Republicans in Congress, from Georgia and elsewhere, have jumped to Gingrich's defense.
``It's only right that we invite Newt Gingrich to return for any celebration.
His ideas and his vision put together the Contract With America,'' Rep.
Mac Collins (R-Ga).
said. ``His biggest problem was that he thought out loud''.
Last week, on the same day Gingrich's attorneys said his affair with Bisek stretched back six years, Republican House members who took office in 1995 held a reunion in Washington.
Gingrich's attendance at that gathering had been an issue, too.
As it turned out, he was in New Orleans and couldn't make it, organizers said.
``A scheduling conflict saved us from having to fight this out,'' said Rep.
Gil Gutknecht (R-Minn.), who helped put the reunion together.

ATLANTA (AP) --Newt Gingrich and the former aide with whom he acknowledged an ''intimate relationship'' while married are getting hitched this summer, his lawyer said Wednesday.
Gingrich will marry Callista Bisek on Aug.
18 in Alexandria, Va.
, said Randy Evans, the former House speaker's personal lawyer.
They're looking for a house in Virginia.
It'll be the former House speaker's third walk down the aisle and Bisek's first, Evans said.
Attorneys for Gingrich, 56, have acknowledged he had a relationship with Bisek, 33, while he was married to his second wife, Marianne.
They were divorced in December.
ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich's estranged wife hopes today will resolve a months-long quest for answers from her husband's lover.
Washington, D.C., Superior Court Judge Brook Hedge is set to hear arguments this morning about what gifts, records and other documents Gingrich's girlfriend, Callista Bisek, must turn over in his Cobb County, Ga.
, divorce.
Many of the records requested by Gingrich's wife, Marianne, date back to January 1995, when Gingrich was sworn in a speaker of the U.S.
House. Hedge also must decide how soon Bisek, a Virginia resident and scheduler for the House Agriculture Committee, will have to sit for questioning by Marianne Gingrich's attorney.
They have asked that a deposition be held within 30 days.
Marianne Gingrich says she'll attend the hearing.
Efforts to contact Bisek and her attorney have been unsuccessful.
Today's hearing is significant because Marianne Gingrich, 48, and her attorney appear intent on taking Bisek's deposition before they will talk settlement.
The Bisek deposition is among several disputes that have marked the contentious case since the twice-married Newt Gingrich filed for divorce in July.
Gingrich and Marianne have been married 18 years.
Bisek, a scheduler for the Agriculture Committee, has already testified under oath for Gingrich's attorneys that her affair with the former Georgia congressman began six years ago.
Attorneys for Gingrich, 56, also have admitted that he had an ``intimate relationship'' with Bisek, 33.
However, Bisek still refuses to answer Marianne Gingrich's questions under oath or respond to certain document requests.
Both areas could contain evidence that might be used during a divorce trial or to leverage a more favorable settlement.
Bisek has argued that many of Marianne Gingrich's questions are either too broad or vague.
Bisek has also expressed concerns that some of the questions infringe upon her constitutional right not to incriminate herself.
Adultery is a crime in Washington.
Last month, Hedge ordered lawyers for the Gingriches to try to reach a compromise on the subpoena.
While they agreed on certain items, they reached an impasse on others.
Bisek has agreed to reveal several gifts Gingrich gave her, including a pearl ring and a set of Callaway Golf clubs.
Bisek also is prepared to reveal money Gingrich has spent on her, or trips she's taken at his expense.
There's much more Bisek still refuses to turn over, including phone records for the past five years, correspondence between her and Gingrich, as well as photos, videotapes or audiotapes of them together.

ATLANTA _ The estranged wife of former U.S.
House speaker Newt Gingrich wants a Cobb County, Ga.
, judge to freeze the couple's assets until their divorce is final.
In her counterclaim to Gingrich's July 29 divorce petition, Marianne Gingrich accuses her husband of transferring ``substantial portions of certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce.
She also asks that Newt Gingrich be ordered to stop any ``further transfers or concealment'' of assets, and replace any assets he has already transferred.
Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randolph Evans, denied the allegation and said Marianne Gingrich has always handled the couple's money.
``When all this came down, she had all the assets,'' Evans said.
``He was so detached from anything that had to do with finances''.
Newt Gingrich didn't even have a checkbook, the attorney said.
Marianne Gingrich's counterclaim, filed Aug.
9 in Cobb Superior Court, is not specific about what assets the former speaker is accused of attempting to transfer.
Her attorney, John Mayoue, declined to elaborate on the filing.
Judge Dorothy Robinson will hear the counterclaim on Sept.
16. The fight over assets is yet another sign that the already contentious Gingrich divorce could prove embarrassing for the former 10-term congressman, who resigned his seat in January after 1998 GOP election losses.
In recent weeks, Mayoue has said that Marianne Gingrich is prepared to thoroughly investigate her husband's personal life and business dealings.
Gingrich filed for divorce last month, after 18 years of marriage.
Marianne Gingrich immediately served notice that she wanted to depose 33-year-old Callista Bisek of Arlington, Va.
, with whom Gingrich is alleged to have an affair lasting several years.
Bisek works as an aide for the House Agriculture Committee.
Mayoue has convinced Judge Robinson to allow him to take a video-taped deposition of Bisek.
Mayoue has said he intends to question Bisek about all aspects of her relationship with Newt Gingrich.
A date for the deposition has been tentatively set for Sept.
29. Evans said Tuesday that Newt Gingrich and Bisek ``had a relationship,'' but declined to define it any further.

ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich wants to know whether his estranged wife put him under surveillance shortly before he became speaker of the U.S.
House. And it turns out the former Georgia congressman no longer has a house to call home in Cobb County, at least for a while.
The revelations came from a flurry of court filings and documents released Thursday by attorneys in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., as the Gingriches' divorce case moves toward a threatened trial date.
In one of the more significant developments of the day, a Washington judge issued an order that puts Marianne Gingrich, 48, a step closer to questioning Callista Bisek, 33, under oath about Bisek's relationship with Newt Gingrich, 56.
Bisek is an aide to the House Agriculture Committee.
District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Brook Hedge ordered the attorneys for Bisek and Marianne Gingrich to meet by next Friday to discuss a subpoena ordering Bisek to be deposed and to produce a wide range of evidence.
The items include letters, gifts, phone records and other items Marianne Gingrich could use to prove Bisek was having an extramarital affair with her husband.
Bisek has asked the judge to block the subpoena, saying it was issued incorrectly and is too vague.
Bisek also argues that she is being asked to incriminate herself.
Adultery is a crime in the District of Columbia.
Hedge ruled Thursday that the subpoena was procedurally sound, but the Washington judge wants the attorneys to agree on the scope of the information that can be demanded of Bisek.
In Cobb County, Gingrich has asked his wife to respond to 26 questions and demands for discovery evidence by Wednesday, so his attorneys can prepare for a deposition of Marianne Gingrich scheduled for Oct.
19. Most of Gingrich's questions are an attempt to learn everything possible about the financial standing of his wife, who controlled the couple's assets.
And in most cases, Gingrich seeks financial documents dating back to 1987, when the couple signed a separation agreement splitting their possessions during a spat Gingrich says lasted six years.
Other questions in Gingrich's discovery notice seek to learn about any marital improprieties on his wife's part.
Still others seek to know what, if anything, she has learned about Gingrich's personal life.
One demand by Gingrich reads: ``Copies of any surveillance or investigation reports, notes, or memos from 1994 to the date of trial''.
This type of question is not uncommon in hard-fought divorce cases, where spouses often hire detectives to sniff out everything from finances to affairs, said Washington divorce lawyer Sanford Ain.
``It's almost always asked when infidelity is an issue,'' he said.
Thursday also brought the public release of a Sept.
10 temporary agreement the Gingriches signed splitting and securing their assets while they litigate their divorce.
The agreement gives Marianne Gingrich possession of the couple's Marietta, Ga.
, home.
Gingrich, who served metro Atlanta's 6th Congressional District from Marietta for six of his 20 years in office, will live in the couple's Washington apartment.
The agreement also pays the Gingriches a monthly stipend of $10,000 each.
That represents an annual combined income of at least $240,000.
Exactly how much money is at stake between the Gingriches is uncertain.
Even they are trying to figure that one, according to court records.

Gingrich divorce takes nasty turn By Duane D.
Stanford ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich is back to bomb-throwing again.
Frustrated by his estranged wife's attempts to probe his finances, business dealings, and his relationship with a Washington congressional aide, the former U.S.
House speaker has unleashed his divorce lawyers.
Gingrich, who rose to power by aggressively attacking Democrats in Congress, will now put the same energy toward proving that his wife shares the blame for the marriage's collapse, one of his attorneys said Tuesday.
In pleadings released in Cobb County Superior Court, Gingrich, 56, is demanding that Marianne Gingrich sit for a videotaped deposition on Oct.
19 _ just as she has demanded a videotaped interrogation of Callista Bisek, a House Agriculture Committee aide.
Gingrich also is asking that Marianne Gingrich be ordered to account for all the couple's cash and stocks.
Although the couple's accountant says otherwise, Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, said Marianne Gingrich has not complied with a Sept.
10 agreement that requires both to dump whatever money they have into a joint account managed by an independent accountant.
The arrangement temporarily secures the couple's assets until their divorce is final.
Evans said he'll file another motion today asking a judge to hold Marianne Gingrich in contempt.
``I'm confident that Newt Gingrich has not investigated this matter and knows more that anyone else that Marianne Gingrich has never done anything improper with the family money,'' responded Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue.
The new filings are part of a nasty turn in the Gingriches' split, as Gingrich takes the offensive for the first time since filing for divorce in July.
Evans has been filling in reporters across the country on the new strategy, telling them that Gingrich has wanted to settle the case without probes into his and Marianne Gingrich's personal lives and finances outside their marriage.
Such digging is costly and could harm both their earning potential, Evans said.
But Marianne Gingrich, 48, has insisted that her husband and Bisek answer questions about their relationship under oath.
She also wants Bisek to turn over any gifts, letters or other correspondence she may have received from Gingrich.
Bisek, 33, has asked a Washington judge to block the deposition, arguing _ in part _ that since adultery is a crime in the District of Columbia, she shouldn't be asked to incriminate herself.
A ruling is pending.
``As a result, we are forced to litigate,'' Evans said.
``We are going to proceed as quickly as we can to get this to trial''.
In the meantime, Gingrich is accusing his wife of not accounting for some of the public speaking money he has earned since the September financial agreement.
The fees for his speeches, which can be as high as $50,000, go directly to Marianne Gingrich, who manages all the couple's money, Evans said.
Gingrich says he's earned more than the $5,000 his wife has deposited in the joint account so far.
``I'm not aware of any improprieties on either parties' behalf,'' said Harvey Cohen, the certified public accountant hired by the Gingriches to manage the account under their agreement.
``I think both parties are showing good faith and moving forward as they should be''.
Cohen said the speech money is tied up in Gingrich Enterprises, the company the Gingriches set up jointly to manage the business end of Gingrich's speaking career.
Cohen said he is waiting for the proper paperwork to be completed so the funds can be transferred.

ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich and Marianne Gingrich spent Thursday afternoon with a mediator in their first attempt to resolve their bitter divorce.
It was unclear whether they were making any real progress.
For at least the first two hours of the court-ordered session, the Gingriches remained in separate rooms.
``Each party is in a conference room, and the mediator goes back and forth between each group,'' said Tom Browning, Newt Gingrich's divorce attorney.
``I call it Henry Kissinger shuttle diplomacy''.
But Browning said mediation generally includes a face-to-face meeting at some point.
Asked if the split would be settled Thursday, Browning said he was hopeful: ``You know, it's to their benefit.
Those who are able to settle their cases are going to save a lot of money''.
John Mayoue, Marianne Gingrich's attorney, also offered few hints about the mediation, which was being conducted in his law offices near Cumberland Mall in Cobb County.
``It's an extraordinarily complex and difficult case.
It's fraught with a lot of emotions,'' Mayoue said.
``We're using our best efforts today to get this matter resolved''.
Mediation is required of most civil cases in Cobb County Superior Court, where Gingrich filed for divorce in July.
The couple has been married 18 years.
Newt Gingrich's business attorney, Randy Evans, said the former U.S.
House speaker is ready to split all current assets with his wife and pay her alimony.
Marianne Gingrich hasn't said what her terms for settlement would be.
But she has been adamant about deposing Callista Bisek, the House employee with whom Gingrich has had a relationship for six years.
That deposition probably will be put off until early next year.
The Gingrich divorce so far has included a number of smaller fights over money, information and the testimony of Bisek.
The couple nearly went to court over a joint account set up to protect their assets while the divorce is being sought.
Much of the money was earned this year, after Gingrich left Congress in January.
That dispute settled on whether Marianne Gingrich had deposited all the funds from a joint company the couple had set up this year before their split.
On Nov.
9, Marianne Gingrich took her husband's lawyers to a Cobb County courtroom and successfully asked a judge to order him to answer 32 questions intended to dig up evidence about finances and infidelity.
On Nov.
23, Marianne Gingrich again went to court, this time in Washington.
There, a judge ordered Bisek to answer questions under oath and provide records that might document her relationship with Gingrich.

NEW DELHI, December 15 (Xinhua) --Two new drugs that e Press Trust of India while attending a symposium on transfusion associated hepatitis here.
Interferon-based therapy, however, works only in one-third of the cases, while about 70 percent of the patients do not benefit from it.
The two drugs --lamivudine and famciclovir -- can be given orally and are well-tolerated, Thomas said.
They are expected to have fewer side-effects compared to interferons that cause fever and lethargy.
The drugs have completed Phase I and Phase II trials for safety and efficacy, and are currently undergoing Phase III multi-centric trials in the United States, Europe and Southeast Asia.
The trials, being conducted by a team of 20 investigators, commenced a year ago and their results are expected to be out in 1997.
Experts are also working on an improved modified vaccine for hepatitis-B, Thomas said.
The Food and Drug Administration Wednesday approved the expanded use of Rebetron, a treatment already on the market for hepatitis C, a viral infection of the liver that can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure.
Hepatitis C infects an estimated four million Americans and kills 8,000 to 10,000 a year.
The disease, spread mainly by dirty needles and exposure to infected blood, is the leading reason for liver transplants.
Rebetron, made by the Schering-Plough Corp.
, was approved in June only for patients who had relapsed after taking interferon drugs, the only other approved treatment for the disease.
The expanded approval now means that Rebetron can also be given to patients who had not taken interferon.
The Rebetron treatment combines interferon injections with a second anti-viral drug, ribavirin, which is swallowed in capsules.
A six-month treatment costs $6,400 to $8,600.
By the end of October, Rebetron sales had totaled $46 million, according to IMS Health, a firm that tracks the pharmaceutical industry.
The FDA cautioned that Rebetron is not a cure and that it is not known whether the treatment can delay the progression of liver disease caused by the virus.
It suppresses blood levels of the virus far better than interferon alone.
But researchers say that not all hepatitis C patients need Rebetron, which can have severe side effects including flulike symptoms, anemia, depression and suicidal behavior.
It can also cause birth defects.
The expanded use was approved over the protests of patient advocates, who object to the way Rebetron is being sold.
Interferon and ribavirin are sold together as a kit, a practice known as bundling.
Patients cannot get ribavirin without purchasing the entire kit.
A Schering-Plough spokesman, Robert Consalvo, said Rebetron is sold in this way because ribavirin has been approved for use only in combination with Schering's brand of interferon.
But some patients say that their doctors would like to prescribe ribavirin with another brand of interferon.
And they accuse Schering of bundling the products in order to maintain the high price of the drugs and compel patients to use its interferon.
&QL; &QL; (STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS).
In another hepatitis treatment development, Glaxo Wellcome and Biochem Pharma said Wednesday that the FDA had approved their drug, lamivudine, as the first oral therapy for the treatment of hepatitis B.
In the United States, the drug will have a wholesale cost of $1,250 a year.
Lamivudine, also known as 3TC and marketed under the trade name Epivir, has previously been approved for the HIV virus, for which it is the most commonly prescribed drug.
Epivir for AIDS will generate an estimated $800 million in revenue this year.
Hepatitis B affects many more people than AIDS, perhaps as many as 350 million worldwide.
Most of those patients are in Asian countries, where the cost of the drug may be prohibitive, so analysts say it is difficult to estimate the potential market.
But there are an estimated one million hepatitis B patients in North America and about twice that many in Europe, where price is less of an issue.
One of the drugs used to control multiple sclerosis also sharply slows the rate at which people develop the crippling nerve disease, according to researchers.
The finding, from an international study halted early because the results were so strong, could help thousands of patients who currently don't get treatment until they have substantial brain or nerve damage.
''It's a very important finding because it really shows if one starts treatment early on, one can change the fate of a patient,'' delaying or even preventing the onset of the disease, said Dr.
Thomas Leist, director of the Comprehensive Multiple Sclerosis Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
''It opens up a new perspective about treatment of multiple sclerosis,'' said Leist, who was not involved in the study, which will be published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
Until now, people who suffer inflammation of nerves in the eye, spinal cord or lower brain --indications that MS might be developing -- have not been diagnosed with the autoimmune disorder, let alone treated.
The diagnosis only follows a second flare-up elsewhere in the central nervous system.
However, researchers at the State University of New York School of Medicine at Buffalo and about 50 other U.S. and Canadian sites concluded that giving patients a drug called interferon beta-1a within weeks of the first nerve inflammation cut the likelihood of developing MS symptoms within three years by 44 percent.
Only one-third of patients who gave themselves weekly thigh injections of the drug developed MS within three years, compared with half the patients who injected a harmless substance.
Dr. Stephen Reingold, vice president for research programs at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, said the findings will push doctors to promptly order magnetic resonance imaging in patients with an initial nerve flare-up.
If brain lesions --scarring that indicates past inflammation -- are spotted during the MRI, Reingold said, ''it should encourage treatment with this interferon''.
In multiple sclerosis, the body's immune system goes awry and attacks the nerves and brain, slowly stripping away the protective ''insulation'' coating nerve fibers.
That damage builds up over years to cause muscle weakness or paralysis, fatigue, dim or blurred vision, memory loss and other problems with thinking.
Some people merely suffer mild weakness for decades, while others steadily worsen from repeated attacks.
Along with giving patients steroids to reduce inflammation during each attack, doctors have offered three drugs that reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and slow the progression of the disease.
One of them, interferon beta-1a, known by the brand name Avonex, is a genetically engineered replica of a naturally occurring human protein, said the lead researcher, Dr.
Lawrence Jacobs, professor of neurology at SUNY-Buffalo and head of neurology at Buffalo General Hospital.
It works by reducing inflammation and quieting down the overactive immune system.
Along with delaying the onset of MS, Avonex cut the number of new or actively inflamed lesions detected by MRIs by more than half, compared with patients in the comparison group.
It also cut the total volume of such lesions in the nervous system by 91 percent over the comparison patients, Jacobs said.
European researchers recently came up with a similar finding on Avonex's effects when it is used early.
The 383 people in the latest study had suffered an initial nerve flare-up and had at least two brain lesions detected by an MRI, Jacobs said.
Until MRIs recently enabled doctors to see inside live brains, they would not begin treatment for MS until the second nerve flare-up confirmed the diagnosis; in about half the patients, something else, such as infection, caused the initial inflammation.
''In the meantime, half of them have lesions in the brain that are smoldering and doing further damage,'' Jacobs said.
About 350,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, and one-fifth of them are in this group with ''silent'' brain damage who could be helped by aggressive treatment.
Leist said its price tag of about $10,000 annually could limit use.
He also said that patients need to be followed for longer than three years to determine how long they need the interferon treatment and that other MS drugs should be studied to determine if there are similar benefits when given earlier.
----- On the Net: Journal: http://www.nejm.com National MS Society: http://www.nmss.org
A tiny mail-order pharmacy in Pennsylvania is preparing to do battle against drug giant Schering-Plough Corp.
for a stake in the burgeoning market for hepatitis C treatments.
Fisher's Specialized Pharmacy Services in Pittsburgh has announced plans to fill prescriptions nationwide for the anti-viral drug ribavirin, used by growing numbers of hepatitis C patients in combination with the drug interferon.
The hepatitis C virus, or HCV, is typically spread through contact with contaminated blood and now infects an estimated 4 million Americans, although only about 1 million have been diagnosed.
Chronic carriers often go decades without symptoms but may eventually develop severe liver damage.
The ribavirin-interferon combination generates a lasting response in fewer than half of those who try it, often at the cost of serious side effects.
Still, the combination is considered the best treatment now available for most patients.
Schering reported worldwide sales of $719 million for the two drugs last year, reflecting both a growing demand among HCV patients as well as some use for treating cancer and other conditions.
The company claims more than 80 percent of the HCV drug market.
But along with that success, the New Jersey-based drugmaker has also generated complaints of high prices and overly aggressive marketing tactics.
In the United States, Schering-Plough has been the sole source of ribavirin, sold only as part of a kit that also include's the company's proprietary brand of interferon, called Intron A.
Other forms of interferon are available from different manufacturers.
Some patient advocates charge that Schering's bundling strategy has made it difficult for people to experiment with different drug combinations and dosages.
``It's anticompetitive,'' said Brian Klein, a San Francisco leader of a national patients group called the Hepatitis C Action and Advocacy Coalition.
``It's delaying research and hurts patients''.
The group issued nationwide e-mail alerts this week announcing the new source of ribavirin, complete with the Pittsburgh pharmacy's toll-free phone number (888-347-3416) and Web site (www.spsdrug.com).
Schering's spokesman, Robert Consalvo, said the company is convinced that its package is the safest, most convenient way to make the drugs available.
Special ``compassionate use'' arrangements can be worked out for patients who need ribavirin alone, he added.
The HCV drug kit was specifically approved only as a combination product by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.
By contrast, European authorities have banned such practices, forcing Schering to seek approval to market each product individually.
That application was approved by European regulators just last month.
The Pittsburgh pharmacy said it holds all the necessary licenses to fill mail-order prescriptions as a so-called ``compounding'' pharmacy, referring to the specialized practice of preparing individual drug orders.
Betty Stein, one of three pharmacists at Fisher's, would not disclose her supplier of ribavirin, other than to say it is imported from abroad.
She said the product has been tested and found to be pure.
The pharmacy plans to fill capsules as individual prescription orders are received starting after midnight July 8, when certain U.S. patent rights Schering holds will expire.
The mail-order pharmacy is offering the anti-viral drug at $1.25 per 200-mg capsule.
That works out to about one-fifth the cost of the same drug obtained in the Schering-Plough combination kit.
Consalvo said the drugmaker has no plans to change its marketing practices or prices.
He also said that patients need to be wary of the possibility that other sources of ribavirin may not meet the manufacturer's standards for purity and other chemical factors.
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) --Hepatitis C is now being recognized as a major public health problem worldwide, an American expert said today in The Lancet medical journal.
In most developed countries, 1e to 2 percent of the population is infected with the virus, wrote Dr Adrian Di Bisceglie of Saint Louis University School of Medicine, in Missouri, the United States.
Infection rates are higher in some parts of eastern Europe and in Africa, and "Egypt seems to have one of the highest prevalence rates of all, approaching 15 percent of the general population".
he said.
Liver disease caused by hepatitis C is now the major reason for liver transplantation in adults in most countries.
In the United States alone, hepatitis C now causes 8,000 to 10,000 deaths a year.
"Furthermore, deaths are expected to more than triple over the next two decades, eventually becoming responsible for greater mortality than AIDS".
he added.
Hepatitis C is predominantly a blood borne disease.
Eighty-five percent of people infected with the virus in most cases will develop a chronic hepatitis and of these as many as 20 percent eventually develop cirrhosis.
Di Bisceglie said the antiviral drug interferon had reduced symptoms in up to 20 percent of patients with hepatitis C who were treated for six months.
In some cases the virus disappears from the blood and the inflammation of the liver is reduced.
Some studies also indicate that longer therapy lasting a year to 18 months may achieve a sustained response in as many as 30 percent of treated patients.
Once an avid cyclist who rode 40 miles a day to her job running a California bed-and-breakfast, Ward no longer could get out of bed.
Debilitating fatigue forced her to abandon the B&AMP;B.
For three to four months, she would feel well.
Then the fatigue would return with a vengeance, knocking her flat for two weeks to two months.
``It devastated me financially,'' she says.
She suffered chronic back problems, gastrointestinal disorders, recurrent yeast infections, fever and night sweats, excruciating muscle pain.
``I thought I was going crazy.
I thought I was insane,'' says Ward, 41, who now lives in Phoenix.
``You lay in bed and cry because your entire body hurts''.
She was treated for countless diseases but continued to languish.
For almost five months in 1994, she couldn't keep food down and lived on liquid supplements sipped a few tablespoons every hour.
Her weight slipped from 135 to 102.
When doctors treated her for reflux disease, she improved some and subsisted on a liquid diet.
She was still far from healthy.
&UR; The next year, a holistic doctor told her she had liver disease.
But she tested negative for what ultimately would be her diagnosis: hepatitis C, once known by the vague label ``non-A, non-B'' hepatitis.
For perhaps 20 years, she would learn, the hepatitis C virus had been preying on her body, causing chronic inflammation of her liver, an organ whose job is to detoxify and discard products produced in the body.
It also manufactures proteins, clotting factors and hormones.
A gastroenterologist finally diagnosed Ward in June 1996.
Hepatitis C, which experts say is reaching epidemic proportions, has become the leading reason for liver transplants.
Such celebrities as daredevil Evel Knievel and singer Naomi Judd _ a former nurse _ have hepatitis C.
Rock singer David Crosby underwent a liver transplant in 1994 after fighting alcoholism and hepatitis C.
How could Ward have contracted such a nasty disease?
Hepatitis C most often is passed from person to person by way of blood transfusions, intravenous drug use, unsterile needles used in body piercing or tattooing, accidental needle sticks by health-care workers, and, to a lesser extent, unsafe promiscuous sex.
Ward says that in her younger days, she dabbled in marijuana and cocaine.
Snorting cocaine can rupture tiny blood vessels in the nostrils and allow tainted blood to be passed when coke straws are shared.
She has a tattoo.
Ward also has discovered that several former friends who were patients of her dentist in California have come down with hepatitis C.
Did unsterile dental equipment convey the virus?
She may never know the cause of her disease, but her concern now is to keep it at bay and ward off the worst of liver ailments _ cirrhosis and cancer.
Cirrhosis produces scarring of the liver tissue and prevents it from performing its detoxification duties.
Ward has just finished a year of treatment on the only drug that works on hepatitis C: interferon.
She calls it her ``year in hell''.
Used alone, interferon results in remission in about 20 percent of cases.
Participating in an experimental program at Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, she has been giving herself injections of interferon three times a week.
She also has been taking a pill that may be a drug called ribavirin, which can boost the effectiveness of interferon and double its cure rate.
Because she is in a double blind study, she may have been taking a placebo.
For some people, interferon treat ment can be nearly as devastating as the disease it's meant to cure.
``You feel like you have the flu all the time,'' says Ward, who has battled lethargy, clogged saliva glands, chronic yeast infections, urinary-tract infections and depression _ all because of the treatment.
She believes that her illness is in remission.
If the interferon ultimately proves ineffective, however, she would begin a second course.
Treatment is a financial burden.
Ward lives with her elderly mother, who is blind and has cancer, and depends on public assistance.
She is hoping to find a job and obtain Social Security disability payments.
To bolster her emotional state, she attends a support group for hepatitis C patients but says that can be troubling.
Although she receives solace from group members, dealing, in turn, with their woes is saddening.
She would like personal counseling but can't afford it.
``I would give up anything to be able to speak one-on-one with a counselor once a week,'' she says.
Though her condition has improved, Ward fears a relapse.
``Since I'm in remission I feel I'm going to get better,'' she says.
``But what happens six months from now''?
&UR; At one time, Ward felt guilty about her disease.
``I thought I was a horrible person because I contracted hepatitis C,'' she says.
Family members have been emotionally and financially supportive, but some relatives refuse to visit her, believing they will become infected.
That is hurtful, Ward says, and adds to the stigma.
Now, noting how many other people have hepatitis C _ an estimated 4 million representing all walks of life _ she no longer feels shame, which has given her the courage to counsel others.
She even advocates for patients seeking transplants, though she has decided that she would not undergo transplant surgery herself if her condition deteriorated.
``It's a personal choice,'' she says.
``This is the way I came into the world, and this is the way I'll leave this world.
.. . ``I have this disease.
I didn't want it, but I have it, and I have to live with it''. &QL;
LONDON (AP) --Glaxo Wellcome PLC today released new data indicating its drug Zeffix may help prevent chronic hepatitis B sufferers from developing cirrhosis.
The data from three large clinical studies showed a smaller proportion of chronic hepatitis B patients treated with Zeffix progressed to cirrhosis, or liver scarring, compared with those treated with placebo or interferon-alpha.
The results were presented at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver in Naples, and supported by other data showing additional Zeffix benefits, Glaxo said.
Only 1.8 percent of Zeffix-treated patients progressed to cirrhosis, compared with 7.1 percent placebo-treated patients and 9.5 percent of those treated with interferon-alpha.
Glaxo said the results showed a continued increase in the incidence of e-antigen seroconversion --an immune response to the virus that is thought to predict long-lasting remission of the disease -- and a continued reduction in levels of viral replication.
Zeffix is available in the Philippines, Canada and the U.S. and approved in China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Pakistan and New Zealand.
Regulatory applications have been made in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Europe.
Hepatitis B is a potentially fatal liver disease --the ninth-most common killer worldwide.
About 350 million people are long-term carriers of the hepatitis B virus and nearly one-third are expected to develop progressive inflammation of the liver, leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Previously, therapies for chronic hepatitis B were limited to interferons, which are injected and can lead to unpleasant side effects.
&LR; &QL; Until now, there has been no truly effective treatment for hepatitis C, a blood-borne virus that is spread in the same ways as AIDS, and that is believed to infect about 4 million Americans.
A drug called interferon helps in 40 percent of cases, but the benefits are short-lived.
Only 10 to 15 percent of patients remain in remission, six months after treatment is stopped.
But two studies published in the current New England Journal of Medicine offer new hope.
One, led by researchers at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif.
, found that six months after treatment, a combination of interferon and a drug called ribavirin was 31 to 38 percent effective among patients being treated for the first time.
That's 3 to 5 times the response rate for people getting interferon alone.
The other study, led by researchers at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Gainesville, found that six months after treatment, the same combination was 49 percent effective in patients who had relapsed after previous treatment.
This is 10 times higher than treatment with interferon alone.
Together, the studies represent an ``important advance,'' says Dr.
T. Jake Liang, chief of the liver diseases section at the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health.
It is still not clear how long treatment should last.
In the California study, there was little difference in outcome whether people were treated for six months or 12.
But the studies are ``a big step forward,'' Liang said in a telephone interview.
&QL; &QL; &UR; Study shows Prozac fights panic disorder &LR; &QL; &QL; It's official: Prozac, like the antidepressants Zoloft and Paxil, has now been shown to work against panic disorder, a debilitating illness that affects 3 million Americans.
In a study led by Dr.
David Michelson of Eli Lilly, the maker of Prozac, the popular antidepressant proved safe and effective in reducing panic attacks and symptoms of phobia, anxiety, and depression in people with panic disorder, a syndrome in which a person suffers repeated attacks of panic.
The study is in this month's American Journal of Psychiatry.
In a separate study published in the current Journal of the American Medical Association, Brown University researchers showed that Zoloft, already used for acute depression, is also effective as an ongoing treatment for chronic depression.
&QL; &QL; &UR; Major lung surgery is small operation &LR; &QL; &QL; Minimally invasive surgery _ in which doctors operate through one or more small incisions, often aided by tiny TV cameras in fiber optic cables _ is clearly an idea whose time has come.
But is it really possible to remove an entire, intact lung this way and send the patient home the same day?
Yes, says Dr.
Eduardo R.
Tovar, a thoracic surgeon at St.
Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, Calif.
, who describes his technique in this month's issue of Chest, a journal of the American College of Chest Physicians.
Traditionally, surgeons have used one long incision _ from the shoulder blade, under the arm, around to the front _ to remove a cancerous lung.
In the last five years, they've also used minimally invasive surgery, which involves four or five small incisions between the ribs for viewing plus a 4-inch incision under the arm through which the lung is removed.
Now, Tovaro says he can remove a lung using only one small _ 3-inch _ incision on the patient's side.
In the five patients reported on _ he has also done four others _ Tovar occasionally uses a miniature TV camera inserted through the same incision to see ligaments that he needs to cut.
He anesthetizes nerves in the area by freezing.
One patient went home the same day.
Four others went home the next morning.
With standard minimally invasive surgery, patients stay in the hospital five to seven days.
``This is an eye-opening article,'' says Dr.
Joseph LoCicero, chief of general thoracic surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, though it's unclear how many patients can benefit.
It ``boggled my mind,'' adds Dr.
A. Jay Block, editor in chief of the journal.
But, he said, ``I doubt there are a whole lot of surgeons who could do this at the moment.''
BOSTON (AP) _ A standard AIDS drug appears to slow liver damage caused by hepatitis B.
A study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine looked at the effects of the drug 3TC on people with long-standing infections with the virus.
It found that after a year of treatment, signs of inflammatory injury fell significantly in just over half of those getting the medicine, compared with one-quarter of those on dummy medication.
The drug, also known as lamivudine or Epivir, is one of several that block production of an essential viral protein known as reverse transcriptase.
Both the AIDS virus and hepatitis B use this enzyme.
Worldwide, more than 300 million people are infected with hepatitis B, and three-quarters of them are of Asian origin.
The virus can cause cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Currently, the the only approved treatment is interferon alpha, which can cause flu-like side effects.
The researchers said 3TC is easier to take and may work better, although the two medicines have not been compared head to head.
The study was conducted on 358 patients in China.
It was directed by Dr.
Ching-Lung Lai of the University of Hong Kong and financed by Glaxo Wellcome, which makes the medicine.
In an editorial, Dr.
Masao Omata of the University of Tokyo noted that one year of treatment is unlikely to have an effect on people's health, and studies of longer use are needed.
A combination of two virus-fighting drugs has proved considerably more effective against chronic hepatitis C infections than the standard single medicine.
Nearly 100 million people worldwide, including 4 million Americans, are believed to be have hepatitis C.
The virus is blamed for about 10,000 deaths a year in the United States and is the leading cause of chronic liver disease and the No.
1 reason for liver transplants.
Until recently, interferon was the only treatment.
Typically, only 15 percent to 20 percent of patients who get interferon are rid of all signs of the virus.
Most patients treated with interferon eventually relapse.
Earlier this year, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration approved a new approach, a combination of interferon and ribavirin.
It is being marketed as Rebetron by Schering-Plough, which paid for two studies published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
In an accompanying editorial, Dr.
T. Jake Liang of the National Institutes of Health said the results show that ``combination therapy represents an important advance''.
However, Liang cautioned that questions remain about how long the benefits will last, as well as about such potentially serious side effects as anemia.
The combination can also produce birth defects, so all users must take birth control during and after treatment.
One of the studies, led by Dr.
John G.
McHutchison of the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, California, compared the effects of the combination with interferon alone in the initial treatment of 912 patients.
All signs of the virus disappeared in 38 percent of patients who had been given both drugs for 11 months, compared with 13 percent of those treated with only interferon.
However, more patients who received the new therapy suffered from side effects, which included difficulty breathing, sore throat, rashes, itching, nausea, insomnia and anorexia.
The second study, lead by Dr.
Gary L.
Davis of the University of Florida College of Medicine, looked at 345 chronic hepatitis patients who had already relapsed after interferon treatment.
They were randomly assigned to get either more interferon or the two-drug combination.
When treatment stopped after six months, all signs of the virus were gone in 82 percent on combination therapy, compared with half on interferon alone.
After another six months had gone by, the virus was still undetectable in half of the combination patients, compared with just 5 percent in the interferon group.
The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved a powerful combination of two antiviral drugs to treat chronic hepatitis C, a liver infection that can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure.
Four million Americans are estimated to have chronic hepatitis C, and 10,000 die from it each year.
The disease is the leading reason for liver transplantation.
The newly approved treatment, known as Rebetron, works far better than sole standard treatment.
But it is expensive, it poses serious side effects and works in only about half the patients who take it.
Although it can eradicate signs of infection, it cannot be called a cure.
And doctors say that not everyone with hepatitis C needs it.
The treatment consists of a six-month course of interferon injections and ribavirin capsules.
The full course of therapy will cost $6,400 to $8,600, depending on how high a dose a patient needs.
Rebetron, which is made by Schering-Plough Corp.
of Madison, N.J., has been approved for use only in people who relapse after the standard treatment for hepatitis C, which is a course of interferon injections.
That therapy eliminates the disease in only 10 percent to 20 percent of patients.
About half do not respond to interferon at all.
The remaining 30 percent to 40 percent respond to interferon and then relapse, and those are the patients for whom Rebetron has been approved.
Tested in such a group, Rebetron reduced the virus to undetectable levels in 45 percent, an effect that persisted when the patients were tested again six months after treatment ended.
In patients given interferon alone, only 5 percent had undetectable levels.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Dr.
Leonard Seeff, a senior scientist for hepatitis C research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, who was not involved in the study, said those results meant there was a good chance that the effects would last.
In studies of patients who responded to interferon alone, he said, those who were free of the virus at six months remained so at six years.
``But I'm not sure we won't find people with recurring disease as we go further out,'' Seeff said.
``We need a much longer time to follow all these people.
The proof will come 20 years from now''.
Even though Rebetron has been approved only for patients who have relapsed after trying interferon, doctors will be free to prescribe it as they see fit.
Seeff and Dr.
Jay Hoofnagle, director of the division of digestive diseases and nutrition at the national institute said they expected that many doctors would prescribe it for all hepatitis C patients, including those who have not taken interferon or who did not respond to it.
Hoofnagle said data had been presented at medical meetings showing that when the combination was given for one year to people who had never been treated before, the relapse rate was only 20 percent.
Given the poor response rate with interferon alone, he said, it seems reasonable to go straight to the combination.
But the drugs can have serious side effects.
While interferon alone is associated with flulike side effects, ribavirin can cause severe anemia that comes on suddenly, Hoofnagle said, and in people with cardiovascular disease that can touch off a heart attack or stroke.
It can also cause birth defects, so women must avoid pregnancy while they take it and for six months after.
Psychiatric problems have also been reported.
In addition, the interferon component of the treatment causes flulike symptoms.
Because of the risks of treatment, and its partial success rate, Hoofnagle said, doctors have tried to determine which patients truly need it rather than just giving the drugs to everyone with hepatitis C.
Only 20 percent to 30 percent of people with chronic infections develop cirrhosis, liver failure or cancer.
It is impossible to predict just which ones will become severely ill, but medical authorities now recommend treatment only for patients who have detectable viral levels and abnormal results on tests of liver enzymes.
Others can be monitored and treated later if the disease seems to be progressing.
``If it's mild, I say let's follow it carefully and wait it out until we have a little bit better therapy,'' Hoofnagle said.
``Some people don't want to be treated at all, but others are so anxious that they don't care what you tell them and they just want to be treated.''
PITTSBURGH (AP) --A pharmacy that has had to turn away hepatitis C patients who couldn't pay $1,400 a month for the only treatment available has started selling the drugs itself at half the price.
Fisher's Specialized Pharmacy Services, a drug store in Pittsburgh, began selling its version of the drugs this month.
Until now, they had to be purchased from Madison, N.J.-based Schering-Plough Corp.
``How would you like to have a disease and have insurance and still not be able to afford the drug''? said Don Kerrish, one of the three druggists who own the pharmacy.
Hepatitis C is spread by blood and affects an estimated 3.9 million people in the United States.
It can lead to chronic liver problems, including cirrhosis and cancer.
There is no vaccine against it.
Schering-Plough's treatment, known as Rebetron, consists of Ribavirin, which simply helps another drug, interferon, fight the virus.
The company uses a type of interferon called Intron A, the only type approved for use with Ribavirin for treating hepatitis C.
Fisher's is selling Ribavirin for $225 a month and, separately, an interferon not made by Schering-Plough for $420 a month.
The pharmacists said they have received about 10 calls a day from potential patients since they started the sales July 9.
For now, the Food and Drug Administration is letting both sell their drugs.
Brian Klein, an activist with the Hepatitis C Action and Advocacy Council, said Schering-Plough packages the drugs together just to make more money.
``Doctors and patients need to have the access and flexibility to make the choices they deem appropriate, not the drug company,'' he said.
Schering-Plough's president of U.S. marketing, Richard Zahn, denied the accusation: ``I think we're a company that cares about patients''.
Schering-Plough has asked the FDA to look into whether Fisher's is violating federal guidelines.
By promoting the drugs, the pharmacy is moving toward manufacturing, which is not allowed, Schering-Plough claims.
Kerrish said the pharmacy is meeting federal regulations and selling safe drugs.
Schering-Plough says its treatment --which earned $248 million in the 12 months ending May 1999 -- is the only one proven to work.
However, the company says it is effective in only about 40 percent of the people who take it.
Three years ago, when Patricia Buchanan, a 43-year-old woman living in Brooklyn Park, Minn.
, consulted her doctor about fatigue and a vague feeling of illness, she expected to be told that her problems were due to smoking and excess weight.
The diagnosis turned out to be much worse: She had hepatitis C, a viral infection of the liver.
She had probably been infected 15 or 20 years before, her doctor said, and, like 85 percent of all patients, she had developed a chronic infection.
The vast majority of people with chronic hepatitis C carry the virus indefinitely, apparently with few ill effects.
But about 20 percent develop cirrhosis and liver failure or cancer within 20 to 25 years of being infected.
The infection causes 8,000 to 10,000 deaths per year in the United States, and it has become the leading reason for liver transplants.
Mrs. Buchanan's lab tests and a biopsy revealed scarring of the liver, indicating that she might be one of the unfortunate ones in whom the disease would worsen.
Hoping to prevent further liver damage, her doctor recommended drug treatment to try to rid her system of the virus.
Mrs. Buchanan, who has four grown children and runs her own business, a ceramics studio, had never even heard of hepatitis C.
``I was terrified,'' she said.
During the next two decades, many more Americans are expected to find themselves in the same situation.
Most will be middle-aged people who feel fine now, but who will become ill, as Mrs.
Buchanan did, and find out they were infected years ago.
Others will receive letters from the government and blood banks as part of a program to inform 300,000 people who may have been infected by transfusions before 1992, when a test for the hepatitis C virus came into use.
For people like Mrs.
Buchanan, with clear signs of liver damage, doctors strongly recommend treatment.
But those who test positive for the virus but have no signs of disease will face difficult questions about whether to start treatment, because it is expensive, complicated by severe side effects and, in more than half of patients, unable to eradicate the virus.
Treatment is generally not recommended for those without signs of liver damage, but regular monitoring is, because in the early stages of infection it is impossible to tell whether the disease will progress.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that four million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, and most of them do not know they are carrying it.
Those who know they need treatment may find themselves caught in a controversy similar to the ones that have erupted over high-priced treatments for AIDS.
Their interests have collided with those of a pharmaceutical company eager to recoup its research expenses and turn a profit.
Meanwhile, some researchers say that the company, Schering-Plough Corp.
of Madison, N.J., is needlessly alarming Americans about the disease in its advertising.
Hepatitis C is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood.
There is no vaccine.
Before the test for the virus came into use, transfusions were the main route of transmission.
Since then, the number of new infections has plummeted.
But Schering has called the disease an epidemic and has featured on its Web site illustrations of people with the hideously yellow eyes of jaundice, a symptom of severe liver disease.
``To put it bluntly,'' the ads say, ``every living, breathing human being can get hepatitis C _ even you''.
The Lancet, a British medical journal, says the advertising campaign has ``breached the public trust''.
But in a telephone interview, Robert Consalvo, a spokesman for Schering, said the word ``epidemic'' was reasonable, given that hepatitis C infects 4 million Americans and is the leading blood-borne infection in the nation.
Dr. Leonard Seeff, a senior scientist for hepatitis C research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Diseases, said, ``The inference from the word `epidemic' is that people are getting infected like crazy, and that's not so''.
Seeff said he worried that fears about the disease, and the pressure to test and treat everyone, would lead people infected with the virus to take expensive drugs with potentially serious side effects, whether they need them or not.
He said more than 80 percent of those infected with the virus ``will survive with no disease whatsoever''.
But he added that people with the virus must never drink alcohol, because it accelerates liver damage from the infection.
Consalvo said Schering scientists believe that the earlier patients start treatment, the better their chances of getting rid of the virus.
Dr. Jay Hoofnagle, director of the division of digestive diseases and nutrition at the National Institutes of Health, said: ``There's no epidemic going on now of hepatitis C.
New cases have fallen precipitously since the discovery of the virus.
The epidemic, if it occurred, occurred during the '60s and '70s, when there was a lot of experimentation with drugs, and the virus got into the population that donated blood.
People infected then are now turning 50 and 60, at which point hepatitis C rears its head''.
Because some of those people will fall ill, a substantial increase is expected in the demand for liver transplants, though donor organs are already in short supply.
Hepatitis deaths are also expected to increase, possibly doubling or tripling to 20,000 or 30,000 a year within a decade or so.
But the number of deaths will probably peak and then decline again, because of the decline in new infections, Seeff said.
According to a CDC report issued in October, there were an estimated 230,000 new infections each year through the 1980s.
By 1996, the figure had dropped to 36,000.
Today, the most common means of transmission is the sharing of needles by drug users, which accounts for 60 percent of new infections in the United States.
Among those who have injected drugs for five years, 90 percent are thought to be infected.
The origin of the remaining 40 percent of infections is less clear.
Although sexual contact does not seem to spread hepatitis C efficiently (unlike the AIDS and hepatitis B viruses), 20 percent of infected people report no other means of exposure.
Another 10 percent are thought to have been infected while working at a hospital, undergoing hemodialysis for kidney failure, during birth, or by sharing a toothbrush or razor or being exposed in some other way to infected blood.
For the final 10 percent, there is simply no explanation for the infection.
Despite widespread warnings about tattooing and body piercing _ and the common-sense assumption that dirty instruments could spread the virus _ the CDC says there is no evidence linking those practices to the disease in the United States.
Similarly, many doctors suspect that people can transmit the virus by sharing straws used to inhale cocaine, but researchers are not sure whether that has occurred.
Mrs. Buchanan said she belongs to the ``no explanation'' group, having never received a transfusion or taken drugs.
Her husband and other family members all tested negative for the virus, she said.
In 1995, when she first learned she was infected, Mrs.
Buchanan enrolled in a study that provided six months of treatment with Schering-Plough's version of the drug interferon, which eliminates the virus in 10 to 20 percent of patients.
But half of patients do not respond to interferon at all, and Mrs.
Buchanan was one of those.
At the time, interferon was the only treatment available.
In June, a new treatment was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, a combination therapy that paired interferon with the antiviral drug ribavirin.
The combination, Rebetron, made by Schering-Plough, reduced the virus to undetectable levels in about twice as many patients as interferon did.
nn Even when it worked, Rebetron was not considered a cure, and it had terrible side effects, including anemia, depression, suicidal thoughts and severe flu-like symptoms.
Nonetheless, Mrs.
Buchanan wanted to try the combination treatment.
But because Schering-Plough's brand of interferon had not worked for her, she hoped to purchase the ribavirin alone and combine it with another form of interferon, a slightly different one made by another company.
She had researched it on her own, and thought it might work better for her.
Her doctor agreed it was worth a try.
She quickly found out that would not be possible.
Schering-Plough had ``bundled'' the two drugs, packaging them together as a kit.
Patients could buy Schering's interferon alone, but not ribavirin.
A company spokesman said the product was packaged that way because there was no approved use for ribavirin except in combination with interferon as a treatment for hepatitis C.
Because Schering-Plough had the exclusive right to market ribavirin in the United States, there was no other way to buy it.
Mrs. Buchanan did not want to purchase the entire kit _ a six-month supply costs $6,400 to $8,600 _ just to get the ribavirin.
A spokesman for Schering said the price of Rebetron reflected the hundreds of millions of dollars it has cost to develop the product.
The bundling of Rebetron, which might seem a stroke of marketing genius to a drug company, looked like a dangerous precedent to people with hepatitis C.
Many, like Mrs.
Buchanan, wanted to mix ribavirin with another company's interferon, and some, particularly people who had received liver transplants, needed smaller doses of interferon than the kit provided, but would be forced to throw away the extra medication because it was perishable.
The bundling also sent up a red flag among advocates for AIDS patients.
Some people taking a host of drugs to treat HIV also have hepatitis C, and want as much flexibility as possible in picking medications.
The AIDS groups began showing hepatitis patients how to do battle with big drug companies.
Jeff Getty, who is active in AIDS issues in San Francisco, said, ``The HIV and AIDS community is watching this and very much up in arms about it, because we know what it means for us''.
Getty said he feared that companies would similarly bundle combination treatments for AIDS, interfering with doctors' ability to prescribe different combinations for patients.
``Where does it stop''?
Getty asked.
``Do I have to buy their Kleenex taped to their nose spray, because they were tested together?
This is wrong''.
One AIDS group has begun buying ribavirin from Mexico, which imports it from a U.S. company.
The group provides it to hepatitis C patients at cost, which comes to less than half what ribavirin would cost in the bundled product.
Patients and advocacy groups asked the FDA to require that Rebetron be unbundled, but Dr.
Heidi Jolson, director of the division of antiviral drugs at the agency, said its lawyers had determined that it lacked the regulatory authority to do so.
Jolson did write to Schering-Plough, saying that the product did not have to be bundled and that the agency would cooperate if the company decided to sell the drugs separately.
Consalvo, said Schering-Plough has listened to the concerns of patient advocates and is developing a program to help provide ribavirin to hepatitis patients whose doctors can prove that the patients have a need for it.
The program will start in January, he said, though patients who need help sooner may get it if their doctors contact the company.
That was news to Mrs.
Buchanan, who said her letter to the company had never been answered.
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) --U.S. doctors said that a combination of two virus-fighting drugs has proved considerably more effective against chronic hepatitis C infections than the standard single medicine, said the Washington Post.
In the United States nearly 4 million people are believed to have hepatitis C, with about 10,000 deaths from the disease each year.
The virus is the leading cause of chronic liver disease.
For the time being interferon is the only treatment.
Typically only 15 percent to 20 percent of patients who get interferon are rid of all signs of the virus, and most will eventually relapse.
Sex at a molecular level is spawning an elite class of proteins.
Maxygen, a company in Santa Clara, Calif.
, has used a DNA shuffling technique to create interferons that are dramatically more effective against viruses than any produced naturally by the immune system.
It has also made ultra-efficient versions of an industrial enzyme.
When organisms reproduce sexually, the offspring end up with a mix-and-match set of genes inherited from both parents.
Maxygen's technique is similar, except the parents are a series of related genes.
These are cut into pieces, shuffled together and then assembled to form a new genetic generation.
Some of these daughter genes can manufacture proteins that are much better at certain tasks than nature's originals.
The best ones can be screened out and shuffled to produce whole lineages of superior descendants, in a process mimicking evolution by natural selection.
Maxygen's technique was described earlier this year in Nature (vol.
391, p.
288). Now its potential is beginning to be realized.
The parent genes are first broken into fragments by shattering their DNA with ultrasound, or cutting them up with an enzyme called DNAse.
They are reassembled into daughter genes, comprising fragments from several parents, using a variant of the DNA-building polymerase chain reaction.
Short template or ``primer'' sequences ensure that the fragments are stitched together in the correct order to produce a functioning gene.
The daughter genes can then be inserted into bacteria or fungi, where they begin making protein.
To make superior versions of an industrial enzyme, the identity of which is still secret, Maxygen's scientists isolated genes from 26 microorganisms which each make their own versions of the enzyme.
Using its system of DNA shuffling, Maxygen made 600 new daughter genes, 77 of which produced superior enzymes.
Screening showed up variants which functioned better than natural enzymes at high, low or intermediate pH.
Others were more resistant to solvents or heat.
``They're all highly significant commercially,'' says Pim Stemmer, Maxygen's vice-president of research.
Maxygen has also shuffled genes that make the 20 known human interferons.
This time they made 2,000 daughter genes _ and once again, the results were spectacular.
The best interferon produced by the genes was 285,000 times as potent as interferon alpha-2b, which is marketed as a drug, as measured by its ability to protect cultured cells against a mouse virus.
It could prove a major moneyspinner for Maxygen.
Sales of interferon alpha-2b, which is used to treat viral diseases and cancer, pull in $600 million each year for Schering-Plough of Berlin.
At present the most popular method of coaxing genes into making new versions of proteins is random mutagenesis, in which ultraviolet light or a DNA-disrupting chemical makes genes mutate.
But most of these mutations are damaging, with typically only 1 percent yielding genes that make improved proteins.
By comparison, 13 percent of the enzymes Maxygen produced through DNA shuffling were superior.
``DNA shuffling is a very powerful technology,'' says Andy Ellington of the University of Texas at Austin, who is currently comparing the technique with random mutagenesis.
It is not even necessary to know the identity of all the genes which might profitably be ``mated'' with one another, Stemmer says.
Fragments of DNA from a known gene can be used to trawl genomes of other species for related genes.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.
_ Hepatitis C.
Is this the disease that should scare the middle-age bejesus out of Baby Boomers for their dumb indiscretions 25 years ago?
Or is it a medical panic attack that will pass like a swine-flu scare?
Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention kicked off Hepatitis Awareness Month.
Watch out, the CDC said: The chronic, potentially deadly, liver disease infects 4 million of us, and half don't even know they have it.
The CDC is targeting two audiences: People who had blood transfusions before 1992, and a trickier group _ healthy, tax-paying, PTA-involved, soccer moms and dads entrenched in the suburbs.
Twenty or 30 years ago, they flirted with peace and love and pass the needle while trying cocaine, heroin or speed.
And they may have gotten hepatitis C.
Hepatitis C can kill liver cells and cause scarring, called cirrhosis.
It is the leading reason for liver transplants.
Last year there were 4,100 transplants _ with twice that many people waiting for a new liver.
Acting as the nation's ever-cautious school nurse, the CDC has labeled hepatitis C ``an emerging chronic disease of great public health concern''.
This month's Redbook magazine calls it ``the next deadly epidemic''.
Last month's New York magazine wondered if it was ``the new AIDS''.
TV's ER and L.A.
Doctors have climbed aboard with hepatitis C storylines.
But how worried should Baby Boomers really be?
Experts say hepatitis C is less an epidemic than ``an epidemic of discovery,'' says Dr.
Leonard B.
Seeff of the National Health Institute.
People infected 20 or 30 years ago are now discovering they may have a problem.
Disposable needles and blood screening for transfusions have cut new cases of the C virus from 240,000 a year through the '80s to less than 30,000 a year today _ but past undiscovered cases have prompted the CDC's current push.
``Once you say `epidemic,' the concern among the public is, `Good Lord, around the corner there's a virus lurking, and I'm going to get it'.
That's not the case,'' says Seeff, the NIH's senior scientist for hepatitis C research.
But the disease is, he says, ``a major problem''.
Visit Dr.
Eugene Schiff, one of the nation's top liver doctors, in his office at the University of Miami Medical School, and he lays out the facts: ``Let me tell you the typical case of hepatitis C right now,'' says Schiff, director of UM's Center for Liver Diseases.
``Between 40 and 50, often mainstream America, very successful people.
But go back in time, back when they were 16 or 17, and that person shared a needle.
``They didn't get sick at the time, they didn't even think about it.
As they got older, they went on to college, many were blood donors, wanted to help out the community.
Good people.
They were carrying the virus.
``Not until 1990 _ after some of these people had been giving blood for many, many years _ did they go into the blood bank and get a screening test.
They were told, `You've got hepatitis C'.
They didn't realize it.
``This is how it turns out when you really talk to these people, establish confidence.
``Some CEO of a company isn't going to tell you he ever played around with drugs''.
In one painful way, the hepatitis C scare resembles the early years of AIDs research _ so much hysteria, so few facts.
What if you got a tattoo with a dirty needle?
What if you got your ears pierced 25 years ago?
What if you had sex with a drug user?
Could these things cause hepatitis C?
The answer to all those questions: Probably not.
``This is not a mystical virus,'' Seeff explains.
``This virus is not breathed in, you don't swallow it.
It has to get in through a skin barrier or through some open cut.
It's a question of being exposed to infectious material.
``What is mystical is trying to define the actual, specific methods of transfer.
It has to be blood from A into blood from B.
The question is: How does that occur''?
No one, so far, is 100 percent sure, but the major risks remain needles and transfusions (before 1992) with tainted blood.
There is no data to show that piercings, tattoos or sex cause risks.
``We don't recommend anyone who had a tattoo be tested,'' says Dr.
Joanna Buffington, CDC epidemiologist.
``And it would be very, very, very unlikely that someone who got their ears pierced by a gun in a mall got hepatitis from that,'' says Buffington.
The CDC advises safe sex if one partner is infected until more facts arrive.
Only now is the CDC paying for a three-year study of 1,000 sex partners _ one infected, one not _ to see if sexual transmission is a risk.
And what about people who have the virus?
Will they die from it?
Again, probably not.
Of the 4 million Americans estimated to have been infected, it's estimated that 30,000 will die by 2010 because of liver disease caused by chronic hepatitis C virus.
That's 30,000 people out of a nation of 250 million.
For 15 to 20 percent of people infected with hepatitis C, the virus simply goes away.
The other 80 to 85 percent develop chronic hepatitis C, and it takes 20 years or more for 20 percent of them to develop cirrhosis _ and then the big problems can begin.
But less than 5 percent of people who develop cirrhosis eventually need a liver transplant.
``In the big picture, it isn't a huge number,'' says Buffington at the CDC.
``Many, many more people are dying of lung cancer''.
People with chronic hepatitis C have two choices if and when their livers begin to act up: treatment or no treatment.
Raymond Grasso, a 40-year-old Port St.
Lucie, Fla.
construction worker, chose treatment _ even though it makes him feel sicker than his hepatitis C ever did.
``I was always rundown and tired, like I always had a hangover,'' says Grasso.
``I drank enough alcohol to ruin my liver.
I was used to hangovers''.
Grasso, who quit drinking four years ago, had a liver biopsy.
His hepatitis C had not yet caused long-term liver damage, but his liver was inflamed.
He felt it was just a matter of time before he got liver disease.
``It's a question of whether you want to live or die,'' he says.
``I'm only 40, I have two children.
I want to be around a little longer.
There is no choice''.
His best option: A combination of two powerful drugs _ interferon and ribavirin _ taken for six months to a year.
His best odds: A 40-percent chance to rid his body of hepatitis C.
Three times a week, Grasso injects interferon under his skin.
``It's almost guaranteed the day after an injection I have flu-like symptoms, a fever.
It's all you can do to get through work.
It's bad''.
Each day, he takes six pills, ribavirin.
``I get headaches, insomnia.
I can go three days without sleeping''.
To offset the side-effects, he takes: a pain pill twice daily, a blood pressure pill and sleeping pill.
He also takes a handful of vitamins and herbal medicines that won't hurt him but might help.
For the interferon and ribavirin, Grasso's HMO paid $1,831 for a six-week supply.
Depending on results, he'll need the drugs for three months to a year.
``By the end of the week, I'm pretty much out of it,'' says Grasso.
``I don't want to get out of bed''.
For a 40 percent shot at getting rid of the virus, Grasso must endure months of suffering.
Judy Van Tuyl made a different choice.
The 54-year-old Fort Lauderdale woman was infected with chronic hepatitis C from a blood transfusion _ either after her serious car accident in 1966 or several hip operations before 1990.
She, like Grasso, burned up the Internet for hepatitis information.
She read about one of several new treatments being tested, PEG-Intron A, that may work faster with fewer side-effects than the two-drug combination that Grasso is taking.
Eventually _ in 10 to 15 years _ there may be a vaccine, experts predict.
``Am I nuts?
Or do I wait a year for PEG or something better to hit the market''? she says.
``This is a slow-moving disease, so maybe waiting a year is the thing to do.
Plus, I feel fine''.
She doesn't like the odds of success _ 10 to 40 percent _ with interferon and ribavirin.
And her neighbor, who unsuccessfully tried interferon, has told her about the gruesome side-effects.
Van Tuyl will wait.
With the hepatitis C hysteria comes another similarity to the dark days of AIDs _ shame.
``We're dealing with a tremendous stigma,'' says Thelma King Thiel, CEO of the Hepatitis Foundation International, based in Cedar Grove, N.J.
``People are losing their jobs, they're being ostracized.
With hepatitis C, there's such ignorance out there.
We have such a long way to go''.
It's common for doctors to advise patients not to tell anyone they're infected.
``We have to peel people off the ceiling all the time because of all the negative stuff that's out there,'' says Thiel.
Kicking off the controversy late last year was a drug maker's Web site calling hepatitis C an epidemic.
The Schering-Plough Corp.
featured pictures of ghastly jaundiced people with the message: ``To put it bluntly, every living, breathing human being can get hepatitis C _ even you''.
Schering-Plough is the maker of Intron A (interferon) and Rebetol (ribavirin), the drugs used together _ at a cost of about $300 a week _ to rid the body of the chronic C virus in some patients.
Also, the American Liver Foundation came under fire for a hepatitis warning billboard in Sacramento featuring a coffin with the message: This space reserved for victims of hepatitis C.
Overly dramatic _ and untrue, says Seeff of the NIH.
``Even without a vaccine and without good treatment,'' he says, ``most of the people infected are going to die from the diseases most of us will die from _ heart disease, lung disease, alcohol, trauma, gun shots and God-knows-what.
Some of them will die of liver disease _ but the figure is hard to define''.
The National Institute of Health has just awarded a contract for a wide-ranging, eight-year study of the hepatitis C virus and answers to many questions will be forthcoming as the research moves along.
But for now, there will be various opinions on what causes hepatitis C _ and uncertainty may fuel more hysteria.
Says Seeff: ``In medicine, different opinions mean we just don't know''.

BOSTON _ It started with an earache.
But in a scenario every parent fears, 5-year-old Jennifer LaChance's problem eventually proved to be a large, aggressive tumor in her jaw.
Jennifer's tumor technically was not cancer, yet it was so aggressive and resistant to standard treatment that it was almost as menacing.
Laced with a dense web of blood vessels that fed its growth, the tumor kept coming back within months after surgeons twice removed it.
At its biggest, the tumor kept her from closing her mouth, and her teeth were pushed out of place.
Surgeons resorted to removing half her lower jaw in hopes of getting it all, but still the tumor grew back.
``That was a tough time for us,'' said her mother of the period in 1994.
``We were thinking, now what''?
Radiation was one fallback treatment, but doctors feared it would stunt growth in one side of Jennifer's face while the other side grew normally.
Faced with this dilemma, their oral surgeon, Dr.
Leonard Kaban of Massachusetts General Hospital, consulted Dr.
Judah Folkman, head of the surgical research lab at Children's Hospital in Boston.
Folkman had pioneered the use of drugs that can treat tumors rich in blood vessels, called hemangiomas, in children by cutting off the ``private blood supply'' the tumors recruit from nearby tissues.
In a paper being published Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics, Folkman, Kaban, and colleagues describe how the tumor was finally beaten with a yearlong regimen of a drug, interferon alfa-2a, that knocked out the tumor's ability to recruit new blood vessels.
Folkman has discussed the case to rapt audiences at medical meetings, but had not previously identified Jennifer.
What broke the treatment impasse was Folkman's suggestion that Jennifer's blood be tested for the presence of a protein called basic fibroblast growth factor (basic FGF).
He suspected that Jennifer's tumor might be secreting FGF, a so-called angiogenic factor that the tumor puts out as a signal for nearby tissues to sprout new vessels to feed it.
And, Folkman knew, recent research had shown that interferon alpha, made by the body's immune system, could shut down overproduction of FGF.
The test showed that Folkman was right.
Her blood contained many times the normal amount of FGF.
``That was exciting, because now we had a treatment that could potentially help her'' without having the drastic side effects of radiation therapy, Kaban said Monday.
Folkman reasoned, ``You could give interferon alpha at a low dose every day'' without causing the side effects it can trigger in large doses.
``We started giving her small injections at night, and by four weeks'' the tumor was gone, he said.
Jennifer had few side effects, except early in the treatment when she had hallucinations ``and saw gummy bears running around the house,'' said her mother.
The doctors were gratified to see that as the interferon treatment progressed and the tumor shrank, Jennifer's blood levels of FGF fell.
That was strong evidence that the interferon was shrinking the tumor by shutting off its FGF signals in search of new blood vessels.
Twice during the year of treatment the doses had to be raised because the tumor was coming back, but both times it worked.
Tuesday, Jennifer is 9.
The tumor, called a giant-cell tumor, appears to be gone for good, and her missing jawbone has regrown, somewhat to the doctors' surprise.
Looking at her, says her father, Michael, ``If you didn't know it, you wouldn't think anything was wrong''.
The LaChances live in Lincoln, R.I.
It is believed to be the first time that a giant-cell tumor of the jaw has been cured with a drug that inhibits angiogenesis _ the growth of blood vessels that allow a tumor to enlarge and spread.
Since then, the treatment has been used successfully in about six other cases, says Folkman.
The half of Jennifer's jaw that had been removed grew back during her year of therapy: whether the interferon was responsible isn't clear, said Kaban.
She is still missing all her lower teeth on that side, but Kaban said it isn't a major problem and that she can have implants put in when she's older.
Angiogenesis inhibitors, pioneered by Folkman and his colleagues at Children's Hospital, are in the spotlight because they show enormous promise for treating cancer by starving it of its blood supply.
Interferon is one of the weaker angiogenesis inhibitors, Folkman says.
Yet it worked well in Jennifer's case by being given over a long period.
That's how Folkman believes newer and stronger angiogenesis inhibitors, like the promising drugs endostatin and angiostatin that have not yet been tested in people, may be able to control cancer.
OTTAWA, November 20 (Xinhua) --People infected with hepatitis C may have a better chance of a cure after researchers in Canada discovered a new combination of drugs to treat the disease.
According to this week's New England Journal of Medicine, six months after treatment, patients who received the two-drug combination were more likely to be free of hepatitis C than they would be if they accepted the traditional drug treatment of interferon.
"This is a major advance in the treatment of hepatitis C," said Morris Sherman, an assistant professor in medicine at the University of Toronto.
"Prior to these studies the success rate for treatment was somewhere around 15 to 20 percent.
With these drugs, with the combination, it is now approximately 40 percent".
The key drug involved --known as ribavirin -- has not been approved for official use in Canada, but it is available throughout the country.
The traditional drug, interferon, approved in Canada in 1991, has helped in 40 percent of the cases, but the benefits are generally not long lasting as less than 15 percent of the patients achieve complete remission after the treatment.
As part of an international group of researchers from the United States, Australia, Greece and Canada, Dr.
Sherman conducted his study with 832 patients in Canada.
Six months after treatment, 43 percent of those who undergone 48 weeks of combination therapy had undetectable levels of the virus, compared to 19 percent of those on interferon alone.
About 250,000 Canadians are infected with hepatitis C, a blood-borne virus spread in the same way as AIDS.
The early moments after patients are infected with the feared Ebola virus may be the most important to their survival, researchers report this week in the journal Nature Medicine.
A French team working in Gabon in West Africa have successfully taken and analyzed blood samples from 11 patients infected during outbreaks in Gabon and the Congo.
This is in itself a feat because outbreaks have so far only taken place in very remote areas and because those who contract the disease die swiftly.
Ebola is a rare viral disease, confined to occasional outbreaks in Africa since its first appearance in 1979.
But this exotic virus gets attention disproportionate to its human toll for two reasons.
First, the virus kills 70 percent of those it infects, and kills horribly, with the disease advancing from fever to massive bloody hemorrhaging in a space of 10 days.
Second, researchers worry that Ebola may not remain forever in its remote jungle confines, but may one day break out.
Led by Dr.
Sylvain Baize and Eric M.
Leroy of the International Center for Medical Research in Gabon, the team found a striking difference in the first days of the infection between those who would eventually die and those who would survive.
Of the 11 patients from whom blood was taken, four survived and are now believed immune to further Ebola infection.
The research focused on the differences between those who lived and those who died.
They discovered that the immune defenses in the two groups were quite distinct.
The immune system puts up two general types of defense against invading microbes.
In one, the humoral system, antibodies identify and latch on to the invading bugs.
In the other, the cellular system, defenders spot cells that the invading bugs have infected.
Among the surviving patients, the immune defenses were stable enough to produce a good humoral response, including antibodies to attack the virus, as well as a good cellular response, including a substantial number of ``killer cells'' (or cytotoxic T cells) and modest amounts of interferon, the body's own antiviral substance.
Thus, there appeared to be a balanced attack from both humoral and cellular defenses.
These patients were able to clear much of the Ebola out of their blood, then continued to produce both ``killer'' cells and interferon to suppress further multiplication of the viruses.
By contrast, the immune systems of the majority, those who did not survive the infection, failed to give a balanced defense within the first two to three days after infection.
They had a poor showing of antibodies, but at the same time apparently produced too much of the cellular kind of defense, as signaled by excessive production of interferon.
One possibility is that the too-strong response of one part of the immune system may be giving falsely strong signals, thereby passing information that would suppress the other side of the defense.
Or, possibly, the patient was infected by so much virus that it overwhelmed one half of the immune system's defenses.
The lack of one kind of defense and excess of another suggests that a good strategy to attack Ebola infection may be to intervene in the body to balance the two kinds of defenses by enhancing one or depressing the other.
Dr. Philip K.
Russell, emeritus professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, said the work represented an important step in understanding how Ebola works.
Dr. Pierre Rollin, of the Special Pathogens Branch at the federal Centers for Disease Control, said the work would help researchers test ideas.
For example, therapies that would suppress the interferon production and related cellular immune defenses might now be put at the top of the list to try, he said.
But therapies that used interferon as a treatment might be ruled out.
At least 2.7 million Americans carry the hepatitis C virus, making it the most common blood-borne infection in the United States, according to a study in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
The study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta represents the first look at the prevalence of hepatitis C in the United States.
``This is what we consider a conservative estimate,'' said Dr.
Harold Margolis of the CDC.
``This is everyday Mr.
and Mrs.
American who live in a household.
This doesn't include the homeless and the prison population.
The number could be higher''.
For reasons that aren't entirely clear, an estimated 1.2 million other people who were once infected no longer have any signs of the virus, Margolis said.
Scientists discovered the virus in 1989.
People who inject illegal drugs or engage in unprotected sex account for most people who carry hepatitis C, but people who had blood transfusions before mid-1992 also are at risk.
The disease and alcohol abuse rank as the leading causes of liver disease.
The infection can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer and results in about 1,000 liver transplants annually in the United States.
The standard treatment is the drug interferon or a combination of interferon and ribavirin.
In some patients, drugs can make all signs of the virus disappear, but it's unclear how long the effect lasts.
HOUSTON _ In a move that could save millions of dollars, health-care contractors for the Texas prison system are purchasing a drug used to treat hepatitis C from a small Pennsylvania pharmacy rather than from a pharmaceutical company whose marketing of the drug has been controversial.
Starting this week, the prison system's health maintenance organization will purchase the drug, called Ribavirin, from Fisher's Specialty Pharmacy Services in Pittsburgh, said Dr.
Jason Calhoun, the HMO's medical director.
Ribavirin is one of two components of a combination therapy approved last year by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of hepatitis C.
Prison system health-care officials decided in June to begin treating prisoners with the combination therapy after a study showed that 29 percent of the state's inmates, or about 42,000 prisoners, were infected with the potentially lethal liver virus.
Although many of those prisoners would not be candidates for treatment for various reasons, officials have expressed concern that the high costs of the two drugs could have a serious impact on the prison health-care budget.
Until recently, Ribavirin was available for treatment of hepatitis C only as part of a kit marketed by Schering-Plough Corp.
, a drug manufacturer based in Madison, N.J.
The other drug in the kit is Schering-Plough's brand of alpha interferon.
For a standard one-year course of treatment, the retail cost of the two drugs is almost $18,000 per patient, although Calhoun said the prison system was purchasing Rebetron for about $14,700.
By obtaining the Ribavirin from Fisher's and the interferon from another supplier, the prison system will reduce the cost of the combination therapy to about $5,000 per patient, Calhoun said.
``That means we can treat more than twice as many patients for the same cost,'' he said.
Some doctors and patient groups have criticized Schering-Plough for refusing to ``unbundle'' the two drugs, marketed as a product called Rebetron, so that patients could use Ribavirin with another brand of interferon.
Schering-Plough responded that the drug had been tested for this purpose only with its brand of interferon.
Then in July, Fisher's began ``compounding'' Ribavirin _ obtaining it from an overseas supplier and packing it into capsules, then selling it to patients based on a doctor's prescription.
The pharmacy is charging $225 for a month's supply, compared to $1,040 per month when the drug is purchased as part of the Schering-Plough kit.
Calhoun said only about 20 Texas prison inmates are receiving combination therapy, but that the lower costs will make it possible to provide the treatment to many more.
Bob Consalvo, a spokesman for Schering-Plough, said the compounded Ribavirin that Fisher's is selling has not been subjected to the rigorous tests necessary to demonstrate that it is safe and effective in combination with interferon.
An FDA spokeswoman said the agency could not comment on its response to Schering-Plough's complaint.
Calhoun said liver specialists at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, one of the partners in the prison system's managed health-care contract, said tests have established that the drug supplied by Fisher's is identical to Schering-Plough's version of Ribavirin.
Don Kerrish, a co-owner of Fisher's, said the pharmacy began looking for alternative ways to supply patients with Ribavirin after realizing that many patients, including some with health insurance, were unable to afford the Rebetron kit.
After the patent for Ribavirin expired recently, he said, the pharmacy's lawyers did some research and concluded that compounding the drug would be legal.
Kerrish also said he was contacted recently by an attorney in the Texas attorney general's office, who told him that the office was ``looking at investigating Schering-Plough'' for possible violations of anti-trust laws.
Kerrish said the attorney asked him questions about the drugs used to treat hepatitis C.
In an Oct.
17 article, The Newark (N.J).
Star-Ledger quoted an unnamed spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general's office as saying that an investigation of Schering-Plough was in the ``initial stages''.
Ted Delisi, a spokesman for the attorney general's office, said that the office's policy is never to confirm or deny investigations.
&QL; XXXX END OF STORY &QL;
Serono Laboratories Inc.
suffered a major blow Monday by failing to obtain permission from the federal government to sell its multiple sclerosis drug in the United States.
The decision by the US Food and Drug Administration marks a major victory for Biogen Inc.
, Serono's main competitor in the $500 &UR; &LR; million-a-year market for multiple sclerosis treatment.
Both Biogen, of Cambridge, Mass.
, and Serono, of Norwell, Mass.
, manufacture beta interferon, a drug used to slow down the debilitating neurological disease.
Biogen's drug is called Avonex and has been on the US market since 1996, while Serono makes Rebif.
Avonex and Rebif are chemically identical.
In its ruling delivered to Serono on Friday and disclosed Monday, the FDA said Biogen maintains the exclusive right to sell beta interferon in the United States until 2003 under the Orphan Drug Act, a law that grants marketing exclusivity to companies that develop drugs for certain, rare diseases, including multiple sclerosis.
``As today's FDA ruling makes clear, Rebif does not offer greater efficacy or safety and does not provide a significant addition to patient care,'' said Jim Vincent, Biogen's chairman and chief executive.
The decision, however, technically leaves the door open for Serono to obtain a waiver from the Orphan Drug Act by demonstrating that Rebif is clinically superior to Avonex.
So far, Serono has spent more than $100 million to develop the drug, which is only available in Canada and Europe.
Serono has tried to argue, so far to no avail, that Rebif is different from Avonex in three ways.
While Avonex must be mixed with a sterile solution before it is injected into the muscle, Rebif comes pre-mixed in syringes for injections beneath the skin.
More importantly, Serono said Rebif comes in several doses, while Avonex is only approved for one dose.
Serono executives have argued that stronger doses of beta interferon work better for patients with more advanced multiple sclerosis.
Its research, however, did not include head-to-head trials comparing Avonex and Rebif.
``Serono will continue its discussions with the FDA on the outstanding orphan drug issues to determine how it can make Rebif available to MS patients as soon as possible,'' said Hisham Samra, Serono Laboratories' president.
Serono is a subsidiary of the Geneva-based Ares-Serono Group, the world's largest fertility drug maker.
Biogen's stock soared 6 1/8 Monday on the Nasdaq to 102 1/4 on anticipation of the FDA ruling, which was not made until after the stock market closed.
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) --China has started to put into mass production a genetic engineering drug which can effectively treat liver diseases.
Chen Zhangliang, the 35-year-old vice-president of Beijing University, declared at a seminar here today that recombinant a-1b interferon was approved for production by the Ministry of Public Health in April this year and has become China's first genetic engineering drug to be put into mass production in the biotechnology section of the country's "863 Hi-Tech Plan".
China listed biotechnology among its top eight fields for scientific and technological development in 1978.
Biotechnology was listed among the top seven pioneering sciences in March 1986, when the "863" plan was introduced.
So far, China has put onto the market five genetic engineering drugs, and another dozen such drugs are under research.
Interferon is a protein isolated from human cells and internationally acknowledged as efficacious for the treatment of liver diseases, experts said.
In the early 1980s China's first interferon research lab was established under the directorship of Hou Yunde, a member of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine and a leading scientist in the "863" plan.
He discovered for the first time that the white blood cells of Chinese people, when attacked by viruses, will produce "a 1" type instead of "a 2" type interferons.
He subsequently succeeded in developing recombinant a-1b interferon --the first interferon expressed by a gene isolated from healthy Chinese leukocyte cells.
To put the interferon into mass production, the Shenzhen Kexing Bioproducts Co.
Ltd, China's largest genetic engineering medicine production base, was set up in 1993 under the State Science and Technology Commission.
NEW ORLEANS _ Responding to reports that the highly-touted anticancer drug endostatin has failed to impress in its first human tests, Dr.
Judah Folkman of Children Hospital in Boston told thousands of cancer specialists Monday that he was ``very pleased'' with the drug's early trials in Boston and hinted there will be more good news ahead.
Addressing a standing-room-only crowd at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, Folkman, who developed endostatin in Boston labs, urged specialists not to be discouraged if the drugs don't work right away.
``It doesn't matter if it takes a long time. . .,'' Folkman said.
Folkman was making the first public comments to cancer specialists about the drug's effectiveness since a National Cancer Institute official was quoted in the Globe earlier this month saying ``no dramatic benefits,'' have been seen in endostatin trials going on now in Boston and two other cities.
That report sent the stock in Maryland-based Entremed Inc.
, which makes endostatin, into a tailspin.
Investors have been closely following the development of endostatin and Folkman's progress ever since a scientist predicted in 1998 that Folkman would cure cancer within two years.
That hasn't happened but the enthusiasm of some investors and scientists has barely been dented as they await results of the endostatin trials.
Because patients began receiving endostatin in the Boston study in October, two months ahead of the other centers, Folkman seemed to hint Monday that the drug's effectiveness improves over time.
Folkman, however, does not directly oversee the trials, from which no official data has been reported, and cannot speak publicly about them.
However, he said Monday ``We are very pleased with the results at the Boston hospital''.
He also disclosed the results of other cases in which so-called angiogenesis inhibitors, of which endostatin is one, have proved to be powerful cancer fighters.
Unlike standard cancer drugs that attack tumors directly, angiogenesis inhibitors cut off the tumor's blood supply and slowly strangles them, or at least halts their growth.
Folkman said Monday that in about 80 cancer patients, mostly children, the drugs destroyed growths that would have killed them.
``If we'd given up in the first month or two, they wouldn't be around,'' he said.
One of the most dramatic cases was that of a Vermont teenager who in 1998 had a volleyball-sized pelvic tumor that resisted all therapies.
She had been ``sent home to die,'' Folkman said, but after months of treatment with an angiogenesis inhibitor, the growth began to shrink and today she is free of cancer.
The patient, Tonya Kalesnik, of Colchester, may be alive only because her doctor went to a Folkman lecture at a time when specialists had tried every treatment they knew but failed to halt her tumor's growth.
In a telephone interview Monday, Kalesnik said she was in constant and excruciating pain, incontinent, and her legs were increasingly numb as the tumor grew.
Kalesnik's doctor got in touch with Folkman and eventually prescribed interferon alpha, an infection-fighting substance that is a weak angiogenesis inhibitor.
It is also effective in blocking a substance some tumors secrete, which signal the body to grow more blood vessels.
Kalesnik's tumor, called a giant cell tumor, was of a type that doesn't spread through the body but kills through sheer size.
Folkman prescribed nightly injections of interferon alpha but it wasn't until three months had passed that doctors observed that the tumor seemed to have stabilized.
``It was the first time it had done something other than grow,'' said Kalesnik, who is taking a break from her freshman year at the University of Vermont.
Over the next 18 months, the tumor shrank by about 80 percent, and Folkman believes she may be able to stop taking the drug within a few months.
Because the anti-angiogenesis drugs work slowly, in small doses over along periods of time, Folkman said the standard way of conducting initial clinical trials may not be appropriate.
In other words, angiogenesis inhibitors might be thought not to be effective against tumors if they grow despite treatment, but treating for longer periods might eventually rein in the cancer, he said.
Interferon has also saved many children with life threatening growths, called hemangiomas.
Folkman showed slides of infants with enormous, disfiguring tumors that are made of thousands of blood vessels.
These life-threatening growths, which also produce substances that tell the body to create more blood vessels, also responded well to interferon treatment, he said.
Previously, no other anticancer treatment had worked.
Folkman said about 40 reports have been disclosed on tests of angiogenesis inhibitors in cancer.
Most have been inconclusive but some show promise that will be explored in wider testing .
UNDATED - Is the Age of Aquarius is coming back to haunt its flower children?
Young people who reveled in the hedonism of the 1960s and '70s are discovering that the legacy of those years is a devastating and sometimes fatal disease now reaching epidemic proportions.
Little did they know that intravenous drug use, tattoos and body piercing would be an invitation to a slow-growing virus that eventually would become the recently identified hepatitis C.
Like other forms of hepatitis, the C variety inflames the liver, causing debilitating symptoms or, even more frightening, virtually no symptoms until the disease is on the eve of destruction.
The risk of contracting hepatitis C continues today.
Foolhardy people still pierce, tattoo and inject themselves with unsterile needles.
Unsafe promiscuous sex can put partners in danger.
Health-care workers who suffer accidental needle sticks must be on guard.
In the future, these people, too, could begin to feel the effects of the insidious illness.
But it's patients who received blood transfusions before 1992, before testing of the blood supply was refined, who are the target of an intense public-education campaign spearheaded by the office of the U.S. surgeon general, Dr.
David Satcher.
Satcher's office has urged organizations such as the American Red Cross, hospitals and blood banks to notify pre-1992 blood recipients and recommend they be tested for hepatitis C.
Identifying and contacting that population will be a daunting but worthwhile task, doctors say.
Though critics have questioned the cost-effectiveness of alerting people to a disease that can be treated in less than half of all cases, health-care advocates insist patients have a right to know their health status and that withholding information is disgraceful.
``That is preposterous,'' says Dr.
Michael Altman, a Phoenix gastroenterologist, president of the Arizona chapter of the American Liver Foundation.
Although conceding that better treatments are needed, he says he can offer patients hope.
``Why would you not want to know''?
Only about 5 percent of patients refuse medication, he says.
Even those who cannot be cured must be informed on how to manage their disease and how to avoid transmitting it.
They should drink no alcohol, be scrupulous about protecting others from infection and maintain good nutrition.
How long hepatitis C has been around is anybody's guess.
It may have its origins in World War II, where unsterile battlefield blood transfusions could have spread the virus.
First called non-A, non-B hepatitis because its specific virus couldn't be differentiated from other strains, it wasn't identified until 1975.
A blood test wasn't developed until 1989.
That blood test remained unreliable until 1992.
Unlike hepatitis A (transmitted through unsanitary food preparation) and hepatitis B (spread through blood and sexual contact), for which there are vaccines and effective cures, the C strain becomes chronic in 85 percent of cases.
It is the leading cause of cirrhosis, which scars the liver and inhibits its function.
Estimates put the number of infected Americans at 4 million.
Cases of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, number only 1 million.
Although deaths from the human immunodeficiency virus are declining, fatal cases of hepatitis C are rising, expecting to triple in the next 10 years.
Yet HIV has enjoyed much more media and medical attention.
Doctors who work with hepatitis C patients are dismayed by such inequities.
``You see the furor raised over HIV,'' says Altman, the Phoenix gastroenterologist.
``(Hepatitis) C has been underpublicized''.
Consequently, three-fourths of all victims of hepatitis C are unaware they carry the disease.
Many show no signs of infection.
Yet when hepatitis C reaches its end stage, it becomes the leading reason for liver transplants.
More than 4,000 transplants are performed each year, and 10,000 names are on the waiting list.
About 1,000 patients will die while waiting.
Although diseased kidneys can be assisted by dialysis, no machine can perform the functions of the liver.
But at a hefty 4.5 pounds, the organ has a lot of reserve, says Dr.
David Leibowitz, gastroenterologist and chair of the department of medicine at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center.
Unfortunately, the liver's large capacity allows it to quietly harbor disease for many years without signaling its deterioration.
When the silence finally is broken, the patient may experience fatigue, malaise, flulike symptoms, weakness, jaundice.
More serious symptoms indicating advanced disease include fluid retention in the ankles and abdomen, confusion, increased risk of bleeding, intestinal bleeding.
Until a routine blood test picks up elevated liver enzymes, problems may go undetected.
Only a specific blood test will identify hepatitis C.
Early detection is crucial.
``Our goal is to catch hepatitis C early,'' says Dr.
David Douglas, a liver specialist at Mayo Clinic Scottsdale.
``We hope to catch people before they develop cirrhosis.
.. . It is a very silent, progressive disease''.
Douglas is director of the Mayo liver clinic and medical director of the liver transplant program, which is just getting under way.
Mayo is conducting several research protocols on hundreds of hepatitis C patients.
Age of the patients ranges from people in their 20s to those in their 80s and 90s.
Although doctors hesitate to call treatments for hepatitis C ``cures'' _ scattered bits of virus may remain, says Leibowitz of the Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center _ medication does offer some hope.
Currently, the drug of choice is interferon, which produces remission or suppression of the virus in about 20 percent of cases.
That means liver enzymes appear normal and the virus cannot be detected.
Interferon is delivered as self-administered injections three times a week for 12 to 18 months.
Some patients tolerate the drug well.
Some experience serious physical and emotional side effects, including depression.
In June, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration approved use of another drug, ribavirin, which in combination with interferon boosts recovery rates to 40 percent.
``That's significant,'' says Douglas of Mayo Clinic Scottsdale.
Such combinations of drugs, called cocktails, are proving to be sound methods of treatment for diseases such as hepatitis C and AIDS.
Douglas predicts that more drugs, including anti-viral agents, will be developed and used to battle hepatitis C in the next three to five years.
A research laboratory in California also is working on a vaccine, says Good Samaritan's Leibowitz, that could be used one day to immunize all newborns in the same way infants are currently vaccinated against hepatitis B.
So-called ``universal'' vaccines are ``the way to go,'' he says.
Education is the key to managing hepatitis C now, Douglas says.
``We've been trying to raise public awareness of hepatitis C,'' he says.
``People aren't aware of liver diseases in general''.
The dilemma with the current epidemic, says Phoenix gastroenterologist Altman, is ``how do we go about educating people without alarming or frightening them''?
The American Liver Foundation is committed to supporting research and informing the public about liver diseases.
The foundation lobbies Congress for funding and works with the National Institutes of Health.
In the Valley, the Arizona chapter of the Liver Foundation sponsors monthly support groups for patients, hosts seminars for patients and primary care physicians, and conducts programs in schools that alert children to the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse.
Altman, who also participates in research studies, is optimistic about the treatment of hepatitis C.
``It's a rapidly evolving therapeutic arena,'' he says.
``I tell my patients to call me every six months.
We're all frustrated by having a 20 percent cure rate (with interferon alone), but it's the best we've got right now.
``Stay tuned''. &QL;
ASHEVILLE, N.C.
(AP) --Federal investigators said Monday that they have no evidence connecting fugitive bombing suspect Eric Rudolph to an explosion at an abortion clinic over the weekend, but they aren't ruling him out, either.
The bomb partially detonated on Saturday morning outside the Femcare Clinic in Asheville, about 75 miles west of the mountains where agents have been searching for Rudolph for more than a year.
No one was hurt in the blast, which caused little damage other than leaving black marks on the outside of the one-story brick building.
``We have no evidence, at this time, that this bomb is the work of Eric Rudolph,'' U.S.
Attorney Mark Calloway said.
``It is too early, of course, to draw any conclusions.
Richard Fox, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the powerful bomb could have ``devastated the entire end of the building and gone into the building approximately 40 to 60 feet''.
Rudolph has been on the run since the January 1998 bombing of a Birmingham, Ala.
, abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and severely wounded a nurse.
He is charged in that bombing and three Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic bombing that killed one person.
ATLANTA _ After five and a half months in hiding, the man wanted for the fatal bombing of an Alabama abortion clinic emerged from the woods of western North Carolina last week, took a large amount of food and a pickup truck from a residence, then abandoned the truck and vanished once more, federal authorities said on Tuesday.
At a news conference in Andrews, N.C., Tuesday afternoon, federal investigators said that the team of agents pursuing Eric Robert Rudolph would be more than doubled from its previous size of 35.
Bloodhounds also were tracking the fugitive.
``We think we have the resources that we will find him,'' said Woody Enderson, the FBI agent who directs the multiagency Southeast Bombing Task Force.
The sighting last Thursday was clearly the most encouraging lead in a frustrating search that has taken investigators across hundreds of miles of mountainous terrain since Jan.
29, when a bomb exploded outside the New Woman All Women Health Care Center, in Birmingham, Ala.
The bombing killed an off-duty policeman who was working as a security guard at the clinic and seriously injured a nurse.
Witnesses saw a man acting suspiciously shortly after the explosion, and the North Carolina license plate on the man's truck was traced to Rudolph.
``This is a pretty significant step forward because we now know for sure that he's in this area and that we are able to focus in on a much smaller area than we have before,'' said Enderson.
Rudolph, a 31-year-old carpenter with ties to extremist religious groups, also is wanted for questioning in three bombings in the Atlanta area in 1996 and 1997, including the July 27, 1996, explosion at Centennial Olympic Park.
That explosion killed one woman and injured 111 people.
Seven people were injured in a pair of explosions on Jan.
27, 1997, outside a building housing an abortion clinic in the Atlanta suburbs, and five were injured in a Feb.
21, 1997, bombing at a gay nightclub in midtown Atlanta.
Although Rudolph has only been formally charged in the Birmingham bombing, forensic evidence suggests that he may have been responsible for the Atlanta bombings as well, investigators have said.
In early May, the FBI placed Rudolph on its list of the 10 most wanted fugitives and offered a $1 million reward for information leading to his arrest.
Enderson said that the man identified as Rudolph had appeared on Thursday evening at a residence near Nantahala Lake, not far from where Rudolph once lived.
He said the fugitive took a blue 1977 Nissan pickup truck from the occupant of the residence, whom he did not identify.
He said Rudolph also took a large amount of food from the resident, possibly enough to sustain him for five or six months.
The authorities said the resident provided a description that enabled them to produce a new sketch of the previously clean-shaven Rudolph, showing him thinner, bearded and sporting a ponytail.
He was last seen wearing camouflage fatigues, a camouflage jacket and gloves, they said.
Enderson declined to say specifically whether the resident knew Rudolph.
``Keep in mind that pretty much in this whole area, people know each other,'' he said.
``The extent of the association I'm not going to discuss''.
A law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the resident, who was described as the owner of a health food store, did not report the truck as stolen until several days later.
It was found, broken down and abandoned, at about noon on Monday at the Bob Allison Campground, a picnic area in the Nantahala National Forest, the official said.
The official also said that authorities found a note inside the truck explaining who it belonged to, and they identified the handwriting as Rudolph's.
``We are confident that we are dealing with Eric Robert Rudolph,'' Enderson said.
The law enforcement official said the truck apparently was not at the picnic area 18 hours before it was found, meaning that Rudolph has less than a day's head start on his pursuers.
Enderson said that his troops had been energized by the sighting of Rudolph.
And he sounded reassured by the discovery that Rudolph apparently spent the last five months in the hills of western North Carolina.
Federal officials had long said they assumed that Rudolph, an avid outdoorsman who has been described as a survivalist, was hiding in the familiar woods near his home.
``We've said all along that we had strong reason to believe that Eric Rudolph was in this area, had not left this area, that he was alive, that he was acting alone,'' Enderson said.
``We still believe that.''
ATLANTA _ The 31-month search for Atlanta Olympic bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph has cost the FBI an estimated $11.2 million, bringing the publicly acknowledged cost of the search to $24.6 million.
The total includes $13.4 million in state and federal expenses estimated previously, plus the new FBI estimate issued in response media requests.
The FBI has spent the most money during the intense search of the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, where Rudolph grew up.
FBI expenses include salaries, benefits, travel, transportation, supplies, services and equipment.
However, the agency's estimate spans only from Oct.
1, 1998, through Sept.
30, 1999.
Authorities began searching for Rudolph on Jan.
29, 1998.
That morning, officials charge, he detonated a nail bomb at the New Woman All Women Health Care Clinic in Birmingham that killed an off-duty police officer providing security at the abortion clinic and maimed a nurse.
Officials say Rudolph disappeared into a part of the dense Appalachians renowned for its hiking and whitewater rafting.
A heavily armed task force pursued him to Andrews, N.C., and hunkered down for two years.
The command post, a former textile mill leased from the town, cost $5,250 a month.
When leads cooled earlier this year, the Southeast Bomb Task Force retreated to a token presence and closed the command center.
Its lead agent was reassigned to Washington.
The last verified sighting of Rudolph was in July 1998 near Andrews.
Rudolph, 33, is charged in three Atlanta bombings: the deadly explosion at Centennial Olympic Park during the Atlanta Games on July 27, 1996, and the blasts in 1997 at an abortion clinic in the Atlanta area and The Otherside Lounge, a gay and lesbian nightclub.
In March, task force chief Steve McCraw said there was no reason to believe Rudolph was anywhere but in the forests of North Carolina.
``I don't know how you put a price tag on the investigation'' of such an important terrorism suspect, McCraw said.
``Moreover, I think it's imperative that would-be terrorists know that if they commit such an act, the combined resources of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies are going to be used to bring them to justice''.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala.
(AP) --A nurse who was seriously injured in the 1998 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic is suing fugitive suspect Eric Robert Rudolph, partly in an effort to block any profits he might receive from a book or movie, her attorney said.
Emily Lyons and her husband, Jeff, are also seeking damages in the suit against Rudolph, which they filed Thursday in federal court.
``She feels very strongly that he should never profit from his conduct involving the clinic,'' said her attorney, Scott Powell.
Lyons was arriving for work when a bomb exploded Jan.
29, 1998, outside New Woman All Women Health Care.
The blast killed an off-duty Birmingham policeman.
Lyons lost her left eye and has undergone numerous operations.
Rudolph is charged in six bombings, including the 1996 Centennial Park blast during the Olympic Games in Atlanta that killed one person and injured 100 others.
Law enforcement has searched for Rudolph for more than two years, focusing on remote areas in western North Carolina near his home.
Andrews, N.C.
_ The discovery of a pickup truck believed to have been stolen by Eric Robert Rudolph prompted federal investigators to double their force here and to hint that they could be close to finding the fugitive sought in the bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic and three Atlanta bombings.
Jack Daulton, head of the Atlanta FBI office, said Tuesday that a Macon County, N.C., man who reported his truck stolen knew Rudolph and had seen him in recent days.
What was unclear to investigators was why the pickup was not reported stolen immediately, giving Rudolph time to escape with another six months' worth of food, which he is believed to have stolen from the owner of the truck.
Investigators said this does not mean that the owner of the truck, identified by the Associated Press and WSB-TV as George Nordmann, operator of The Better Way Health Food Store, was trying to help Rudolph.
``We are dealing with an admittedly dangerous individual,'' said Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the U.S.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, referring to Rudolph.
``What would you do''?
Added Woody Enderson, head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force investigating the Birmingham bombing and Atlanta bombings: ``This is a witness of ours''.
Nordmann's 1977 blue Datsun pickup truck was recovered Monday shortly after noon at Bob Allison Campground, a heavily forested area near Andrews and Hayesville, N.C.
Investigators said Nordmann told them the pickup truck was stolen Thursday, along with a large amount of food.
ABC News reported Tuesday the man Rudolph took the food from was a friend.
And the network, citing FBI sources, said Rudolph left him money to pay for the supplies.
The man waited 24 hours before calling the sheriff, according to ABC, and Rudolph reportedly told this man that he has a great hiding place.
NBC News also reported that Rudolph left money for the food and a list of items he wanted but didn't get.
Killorin disputed early reports that Rudolph's fingerprints were found on the pickup.
``We don't yet have fingerprints, but we may,'' the ATF agent said.
Investigators indicated they believe they are closer to Rudolph than they have been since he was named in February as a suspect in the Jan.
29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic that killed a policeman working as a security guard and seriously injured a nurse.
At a Tuesday news conference in Andrews, Enderson of the bomb task force declared, ``We are confident that we are dealing with Eric Robert Rudolph''.
Investigators believe they may have missed the 31-year-old carpenter and experienced outdoorsman by just hours Monday.
``We're about 15 hours behind him,'' Killorin said.
The ATF official said a local law enforcement officer had passed through the area Sunday night where the pickup truck was found Monday and that the truck was not there.
``It was not in the location where it was found as of about 9 o'clock Sunday night,'' Killorin said.
Rudolph is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, and a $1 million reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest.
Enderson said Rudolph, who as a teenager moved with his mother and brothers to Nantahala and recently lived in nearby Murphy, is believed to have altered his appearance slightly by growing a beard and longer hair pulled back in a ponytail.
Investigators said the report of a recent sighting has re-energized the manhunt.
Rudolph had last been reported seen at a video store in Murphy on Jan.
30. A few days later, a pickup truck registered to Rudolph and seen near the Birmingham clinic the day of the bombing was found abandoned in a wooded area near Murphy.
Since then, federal agents have conducted wide searches of the forests in western North Carolina and maintained a headquarters in Andrews.
Agents have asked that anybody who may have seen the pickup truck found Monday during the past week to call the task force at 1-888-ATF- BOMB.
All along, Enderson said, investigators have believed Rudolph was hiding in the mountains of western North Carolina.
They also believed he was acting alone.
``We still believe that,'' Enderson said.
``The search has been intensified significantly''.
The number of agents in western North Carolina has been doubled to about 80.
Enderson said investigators had determined that Rudolph had about six months worth of rations on him when he first disappeared into the woods.
``He had stolen another six months worth, or at least as much as he had before,'' Enderson said Tuesday.
Investigators said they continue to assume that Rudolph is dangerous.
``We have reason to believe he has firearms and we are approaching it that way,'' Enderson said.
The truck, which was first approached as if it might be boobytrapped, was taken to the ATF office in Atlanta.
Cherokee County, N.C., Sheriff Jack Thompson said the terrain near the campground where the truck was found is rugged with peaks that reach 4,500 to 5,000 feet into the sky.
``The foilage is so thick you can't see...
you can't find anything,'' Thompson said.
``I said all along he was here and he'll be here until he's caught''.

WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) --Federal authorites charged Eric Robert Rudolph the elusive fugitive sought in the bomb of the Olympic park bombing of 1996 and two other Atlanta-area terroist attacks Wedensday.
"This warrant moves us one step closer to ending a campaign of violence," said John Magaw of the Bureau of Alcoho, Tobacco and Firearms.
In addition to the Olympics bombing, Rudolph was formally charged in last year's attacks against a north Atlanta abortion clinic and a local gay nightclub.
Nine people were injured in those explosions.
In Febraury, Rudolph was charged with this year's bombing of a clinic in Birminghan.
A police officer was killed and a nurse was seriously injuired in the blast.
Two people died and 100 were injured in the Olympics bombing.
Nails and steel plates recovered from the Olympic park and Atlanta clinic bomb sites were similar, authorites said.
The similarities helped authorities link Rudolph to the bombings, they said.
They would not elaborate.
His name was added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list this year, and a 1 million U.S. dollars award has been offered for information leading to his conviction.
In announcing the new charges, federal officials solicited the public's help in capturing Rudolph.
Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh released a photograph showing Rudolph in khaki shorts and a green T-shirt that investigators believe Rudolph was wearing in Atlanda the day of the Olympics blast.
Since January, Rudolph has been the subject of a massive manhunt focused in Nantahala National Forest in western North Carolina, near his hometown of Murphy.
At times as many as 200 agents beat through the rugged terrain searching for Rudolph, an experienced outdoorsman.
"Eric Rudolph is on the run," Reno said.
"Hundreds of agents are on his tail".
Authorities fear that Rudolph is getting help, possibly from anti-abortion sympathizers.
ANDREWS, N.C.
_ Eric Rudolph may be hiding in a cave just up the hill from this western North Carolina town that cherishes how far out in the wilderness it is.
Or he may be thousands of miles away.
There are about as many theories to the bombing suspect's whereabouts as there are potential hiding places.
Federal law enforcement agents have searched for Rudolph since shortly after the Jan.
29, 1998 bombing of a Birmingham, Ala.
, abortion clinic.
They think he's still somewhere around here, probably in an old mine within the 500,000-acre Nantahala National Forest.
A few dozen agents live and work in Andrews, continuing what is one of the nation's longest and most chronicled manhunts.
But not everyone thinks Rudolph, an experienced backwoodsman who would have just celebrated his 33rd birthday, is still hidden in these woods.
``I think he's been long gone for awhile.
He's not around here,'' said George Nordmann, during a recent interview in his Better Way Health Foods store in downtown Andrews.
Nordmann said he has no inside knowledge about Rudolph, but the 72-year-old navy veteran and former citrus farmer may be the last person to have seen Rudolph.
In July 1998, Rudolph took about six months' worth of supplies and a pickup truck from Nordmann.
The encounter happened on a Thursday, but Nordmann did not report it to authorities for two days.
The truck was found two days later near the entrance to a campground just east of here in Macon County.
Nordmann gave authorities a detailed description of Rudolph.
The suspect had apparently added a beard and a ponytail.
The information did not lead to a quick capture.
Instead, Rudolph, who is a suspect not just in the Birmingham bombing but also in three Atlanta-area bombings in 1996 and 1997 including a fatal blast at Centennial Park in Atlanta during the 1996 Olympics, remains at large.
He has survived one winter on the run, despite predictions a year ago at this time that once the leaves fell and the temperature dropped, he would be caught.
Other than Rudolph's connection with Nordmann and the discovery of buried trash with the suspect's fingerprints on it, federal agents have not disclosed much about their search.
With winter approaching, officials familiar with the search said that federal agents will continue to focus on the mountainous, rugged area around Macon County.
The task force heading up the search has had a change in leadership in recent months.
A spokesman in Atlanta said no briefings are planned to discuss any new events in the case.
Will Eric Rudolph be caught?
It's a question that many people here say they once were preoccupied with but now just don't care about.
Rudolph, a native of the area who attended Nantahala High School, has become as much a living part of folklore as a suspect on the run.
A year ago Andrews was engulfed by a national media circus as satellite TV trucks lined the streets, Hundreds of law enforcement agents saturated the area.
The TV trucks are gone and so is the ostensible federal presence.
Around Andrews and the small communities that lead into the mountains, the talk has turned to foliage ( a fairly spectacular season), high school football (the Brevard Blue Devils are ranked No.
2 in the state) and the tourists, who are the economic lifeblood of the region.
In interviews, residents said they occasionally see agents buying fuel for their trucks.
Otherwise, life goes on.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) ``They used to come in here and buy the fancy fanny packs and all the other stuff they could find.
We haven't seen any of them in awhile,'' said Mary Kelley, a clerk at the popular Nantahala Outdoor Center, which stands along the Appalachian Trail.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM).
It's easy to see how Rudolph might still be around.
Drive a few hundred feet into the woods, look to your left or right, and you could be lost in an instant.
Natives talk about hundreds, perhaps thousands, of underground caves and mines and the ability of an experienced outdoorsman to elude capture.
A restaurant near Nantahala Lake, about nine miles east of Andrews, declares ``Rudolph Eats Here'' on its marquee.
Inside, the signs proclaiming ``We Survived the Rudolph Manhunt 1998.
1999? 2000''? appear likely to still apply when the calendar changes in a few months.
The deer hunting season is under way.
Sitting under a tree silently waiting for a target, Eric Farley said he suspected Rudolph is in the forest, maybe even close by.
But Farley said he doubted searchers would find him.
It makes sense for Rudolph to stay in the area, Farley said.
``He doesn't know Mexico, he doesn't know the beach.
He knows here, and here is a big, big place,'' said Farley, a Graham County resident.
When Rudolph first escaped into the forest, some cheered his elusiveness and saw it as an indictment of the FBI and other federal agencies.
Anti-abortion sentiment and distrust of government is native to the mountains of western North Carolina.
But sharing a political view only goes so far.
An off-duty police officer died in the Alabama clinic bombing and a nurse was permanently maimed, and to many people, those human losses should not be forgotten in the saga of Eric Rudolph.
``I'm against abortion too _ it's just wrong _ but that's the wrong way to get there,'' Farley said.
``To me, he's just a criminal, and he broke the law, and they should catch him''.
The FBI has posted a $1 million reward for Rudolph's capture, and he has been placed on the agency's 10-most-wanted list.
The FBI will stay in Andrews until they find Rudolph, a spokesman said.
Those sentiments aren't all that pleasing to some in Andrews, who want to turn the corner.
Nordmann, who operates the health food store and knew Rudolph, said he suspected the federal agents actually came to Andrews ``so they could do surveillance on the militia folks out here''.
He's skeptical that several hundred law enforcement types would be dispatched to find just one person.
The area has had recent economic setbacks and hopes are high for a strong fall tourist season.
A Levi's jeans factory in Murphy just closed, and a Baker furniture plant in Andrews is leaving next summer, said Jackie Lancaster, Andrews Chamber of Commerce executive director.
``Our focus is on our economic development and getting people to take a look at us to come here.
At least, more so than `We have a suspected bomber in the mountains','' said Lancaster.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) As she spoke in the chamber headquarters, the five-car yellow and red Great Smoky Mountains Railroad train pulled up.
Lancaster also gives out train schedules and helps with reservations.
The four-hour round-trips from Andrews to the Nantahala Gorge end this month for the year, and the remaining trips are nearly filled.
On a recent day, a group from Georgia boarded the 10:30 a.m. train.
Most seemed intent on snapping pictures of downtown Andrews before the Great Smoky train pulled away and scribbling a few postcards.
A few said they were aware of the manhunt, but several expressed no knowledge of Rudolph.
Their charter bus driver, Dean Gilstrap of Gainesville, Ga.
, couldn't resist a bit of teasing.
``I told 'em not to wander off too far or he may get 'em,'' drawled Gilstrap.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM).
Living folklore legend, fugitive and mountain man, Eric Rudolph may fit all those roles.
But if he is indeed in the Nantahala forest somewhere, he probably won't be spotted in downtown Andrews.
He may be more likely by a creek where there's plenty of water and the trout are hefty.
Contemplating the situation, Sylva resident Steve Webb said he could see how the isolation of the forest would appeal to a man on the run.
Webb said he suspected Rudolph was either dead or in another country, but he keeps his eyes open _ just in case.
``Heck, I'd turn him in in a heartbeat even if there wasn't a reward, but for what he did in those bombings,'' Webb said.

ASHEVILLE, N.C.
(AP) --Authorities did not discount a possible connection between a bombing at an abortion clinic here and serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph, though they weren't discussing Rudolph on Sunday.
The clinic is about 75 miles east of the mountainous area where Rudolph is believed to be hiding.
A news conference is scheduled for Monday morning at the U.S. attorney's office in Asheville.
When asked Saturday about a possible link between the explosion and Rudolph, FBI spokeswoman Joanne Morley said: ``At this stage, we don't discount anything''.
On Sunday, several FBI agents worked the scene outside the one-story brick building that houses the Femcare Clinic, where the bomb exploded early Saturday morning.
Nobody was injured and there was little damage because the device only partially detonated.
``The investigation is still going on,'' said Asheville Police Sgt.
Randy Riddle, who escorted news crews closer to the bombing scene Sunday.
Femcare was one of several clinics nationwide last month that received packages said to contain the potentially deadly bacterium anthrax.
Nothing was found inside the packages sent to the clinics.
Most of the speculation centers on Rudolph, who has been on the run since the Jan.
29, 1998, bombing of a Birmingham, Ala.
, abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and severely wounded a nurse.
Since then, he has been charged in that bombing and in three Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing that killed one person.
ANDREWS, N.C.
_ Federal officials say they have ``additional evidence'' possibly linking Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph to a series of Atlanta explosions.
But they declined to say what the evidence was.
The FBI's Woody Enderson, inspector in charge of the Southeast Bomb Task Force, stopped short of calling Rudolph a suspect in the Atlanta cases.
During a news conference, Enderson was pressed on why federal law enforcement officers haven't named Rudolph a suspect or charged him with the July 1996 deadly pipe-bomb explosion in Centennial Olympic Park, the January 1997 double blast at a Sandy Springs abortion clinic or a February 1997 bomb at an Atlanta gay nightclub.
``That is a (U.S).
Department of Justice decision,'' he said.
Agents have said they want to question Rudolph in those bombings and that they are in no hurry to charge him in the Atlanta cases, because they have a warrant for him in the Jan.
29 bombing in Birmingham that killed an off-duty police officer and maimed a nurse.
Asked Monday if they had tied Rudolph to the Atlanta crimes, Enderson said, ``We've developed additional evidence'' since January.
Rudolph's truck was seen leaving the area of the Birmingham bombing, and the fugitive disappeared Jan.
30 into the western North Carolina mountains.
Sales receipts showed he had six months' worth of food, including BI-LO California raisins, BI-LO Harvest Choice Cut Green Beans, BI-LO Old Fashioned Oatmeal, Planters Peanuts and Star Kist Tuna.
Monday's news conference was called to display those items for bear hunters, in the hope their dogs will unearth the remains and wrappers when bear season begins Oct.
12. ``To us, these items and their packaging represent evidence,'' Enderson said.
``But to Eric Rudolph, most of this is now nothing but trash''.
Agents found trash in July after Rudolph came out of the woods to get six more months of food, NOW and Nature's Plus minerals and vitamins, supplies and a truck from George Nordmann, a 71-year-old Andrews health food store owner.
Nordmann was away when the truck was taken.
For the first time Monday, Enderson said Rudolph was ``given'' some of those items ``in an encounter with a local witness''.
Nordmann has not been charged with aiding Rudolph.
Rudolph also has a brown paper bag the texture of a dog food bag and Cayenne pepper that could be used to try to disguise his scent from bloodhounds, Enderson said.

ANDREWS, N.C.
_ Federal agents searching for Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph have found what they believe was an observation point where the fugitive watched the Nantahala residence of a man whose help he tried to enlist for food and other provisions.
They believe Rudolph watched the house of 71-year-old George Nordmann for several days before approaching the health food store owner July 7.
According to a federal document, Rudolph approached Nordmann, described as a ``nodding acquaintance,'' and presented him with a list of provisions and five $100 bills.
Investigators said the items requested included batteries, oatmeal, beans and raisins.
Rudolph, a 32-year-old itinerant carpenter who lived for a while in western North Carolina, is being sought in the fatal bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic and three Atlanta-area bombings.
At least 100 federal agents and scores of other law enforcement officers were searching the area Wednesday around where Nordmann's pickup was found Monday afternoon.
Agents of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation were involved in sealing off and searching the Apple Tree campground near Topton.
Investigators also brought in a U.S.
Customs helicopter equipped with infrared viewing equipment.
Although Nordmann did not report to authorities he had seen Rudolph or that his pickup was missing until Saturday, he is not believed to have supplied the suspected bomber with his truck or with food.
``We're not changing from what we originally said _ he (Rudolph) took it,'' said Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the U.S.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
Responding to media reports that explosive residue was found in the vehicle, authorities said they don't know where Rudolph went in the truck, but they have found no evidence of explosives.
``We are running forensic tests,'' Killorin said of the truck, which was taken to the ATF lab in Atlanta.
It could not be determined if Rudolph used the truck to haul the food to some lair or if he carried the load or stashed it.
The food, which included canned goods, is estimated to weigh up to 100 pounds, Macon County Sheriff Homer Holbrooks said.
``There are unlimited places to dump food around here,'' the sheriff said.
Killorin joined in a chorus of federal officials Wednesday in saying that Nordmann is not considered to have been aiding Rudolph in eluding capture.
``This is a small community,'' Killorin said.
``There is some militia activity up there, and this is where the guy lived.
Eric Rudolph is a dangerous fugitive and informing on him is a matter of concern.
But what did he do at the end of the day?
He did come forward.
He did the right thing''.

Andrews, N.C.
_ After four bombings in 19 months in Georgia and Alabama, the bombings stopped, and the chief of a regional bombing task force said Tuesday he believes the reason is that agents have kept fugitive Eric Robert Rudolph bottled up in North Carolina's mountains for a year.
The deadly nail bombings, which investigators have said are related, began with the Atlanta Olympics in July 1996 and ended with the Jan.
29, 1998, bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic.
As one of the most extensive manhunts in recent American history nears its one-year anniversary, Woody Enderson, the FBI special agent in charge of the multiagency Southeast Bomb Task Force, said authorities think the fact that there have been no more bombings since the fatal Alabama attack means that suspect Rudolph is their man.
``I feel very strongly that he is a bomber, and I feel very strongly that if we have done nothing else in the past year but keep him from doing another bombing, we've been successful,'' Enderson said at a news conference in Andrews.
``I have great fear that if we leave and just back away, someone else might die, and I don't want that to happen''.
Some 200 federal and state officers continue to search the rugged mountains of the 500,000-acre Nantahala National Forest for the former soldier and self-employed carpenter.
Rudolph, 32, who grew up exploring these mountains, is said by friends and family to be an expert outdoorsman.
Enderson said authorities think he may be hiding in a bunker, abandoned mine or cave.
In addition, he said, a number of burglaries of mountain cabins and sightings of unidentified persons by residents in recent months lead authorities to believe Rudolph is still in the mountains.
``We know an awful lot about Eric Rudolph from friends and associates.
From going into great detail about his background, we know he feels very comfortable in this area,'' Enderson said.
``Everything we know about him leads us to believe that he will not leave this area''.
Rudolph apparently fled into the wilderness the day after the Birmingham attack once he realized authorities were on his trail.
A gray Nissan pickup truck registered to Rudolph was seen near the clinic in Birmingham shortly after the attack.
That information led agents to his rented mobile home near Murphy, N.C.
Rudolph surfaced briefly in July to obtain food from a friend and again disappeared into mountains.
Enderson said agents believe the food is now running low and he will soon make a move to obtain more.
In addition to the Birmingham and Olympic bombings, Rudolph is charged with the 1997 bombings of a Sandy Springs abortion clinic and an Atlanta lesbian nightclub.
The Birmingham attack killed an off-duty police officer working as a security guard at the clinic and seriously wounded a nurse.
The Centennial Olympic Park explosion killed one person and injured 111.

ANDREWS, N.C.
_ The discovery of a pickup truck believed stolen by Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph has led federal investigators to double their force here and hint that they could be close to finding the fugitive who was last reported seen Jan.
30. Jack Daulton, head of the Atlanta FBI office, said Tuesday that the man who reported his truck stolen knew Rudolph and had seen him in recent days.
What was unclear to investigators was why the man waited at least two days to report the pickup stolen, giving Rudolph time to escape with another six months' worth of food, which he also allegedly stole from the man.
But investigators said that does not mean that the man, identified as George Nordmann, an elderly health food store proprietor, was trying to help Rudolph.
``We are dealing with an admittedly dangerous individual,'' said Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the U.S.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, referring to Rudolph.
``What would you do''?
Added Woody Enderson, head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force investigating the Birmingham bombing and three Atlanta bombings, ``This is a witness of ours''.
Nordmann's 1977 blue Nissan pickup truck was recovered Monday shortly after noon at Bob Allison Campground, a heavily forested area near Andrews and Hayesville, N.C.
Investigators said Nordmann told them the pickup truck was stolen from him Thursday, along with a large amount of food.
Killorin disputed early reports that Rudolph's fingerprints were found on the pickup.
``We don't yet have fingerprints, but we may,'' he said.
Investigators indicated that they believe they are closer to Rudolph than they have been since he was named in February as a suspect in the Jan.
29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic that killed a policeman working as a security guard and seriously injured a nurse.
At a Tuesday news conference in Andrews, Enderson declared, ``We are confident that we are dealing with Eric Robert Rudolph''.
Investigators believe they may have missed Rudolph, a 31-year-old carpenter and experienced outdoorsman, by just hours Monday.
``We're about 15 hours behind him,'' Killorin said.
The ATF official said a federal agent had passed through the area Sunday night where the pickup truck was found Monday and that the truck was not there.
``It was not in the location where it was found as of about 9 o'clock Sunday night,'' Killorin said.
Rudolph is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, and a $1 million reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest.
Enderson said Rudolph, who moved as a teenager with his mother and brothers to Nantahala and recently lived in nearby Murphy, is believed to have altered his appearance slightly by growing a beard and longer hair pulled back in a ponytail.
Investigators said the report of a recent sighting has reenergized the manhunt for Rudolph, who was last reported seen at a video store in Murphy on Jan.
30. A few days later, a pickup truck registered to Rudolph and seen near the Birmingham clinic the day of the bombing was found abandoned in a wooded area near Murphy.
Since then, federal agents have conducted wide searches of the forests in western North Carolina and maintained a headquarters here in Andrews.
Agents have asked that anybody who may have seen the pickup truck found Monday during the past week to call the task force at 1-888-ATF- BOMB.
There's a million dollar reward for information leading to Rudolph's capture.
All along, Enderson said, investigators have believed Rudoloph was alive and hiding in the mountains of western North Carolina.
They also believed he was acting alone.
``We still believe that,'' Enderson said.
``The search has been intensified significantly''.
The number of agents in western North Carolina has been doubled to about 80.
Enderson said investigators had determined that Rudolph had about six months worth of rations on him when he first disappeared into the woods.
``He had stolen another six months worth, or at least as much as he had before,'' Enderson said Tuesday.
Investigators said they continue to assume that Rudolph is dangerous.
``We have reason to believe he has firearms and we are approaching it that way,'' Enderson said.
The truck, which was first approached as if it might be boobytrapped, was taken to the ATF office in Atlanta.
Cherokee County, N.C., Sheriff Jack Thompson said the terrain near the campground where the truck was found is rugged with peaks that reach 4500 to 5000 feet into the sky.
``The foilage is so thick you can't see....you can't find anything,'' Thompson said.
``I said all along he was here and he'll be here until he's caught''.

ATLANTA _ Federal officials said on Monday that there was no evidence linking Eric Robert Rudolph, the North Carolina fugitive charged in four Southern bombings, to an explosion outside an abortion clinic in Asheville, N.C., on Saturday morning.
Questions about Rudolph arose immediately after the explosion because he is accused of bombing two abortion clinics, one in Birmingham, Ala.
, and one in the Atlanta area, and because he was last seen near Andrews, N.C., about 75 miles west of Asheville.
At a news conference in Asheville, federal investigators were careful to say that they had not definitively excluded Rudolph as a suspect.
But in that news conference and in subsequent interviews on Monday, the authorities suggested strongly that the bomb probably was not Rudolph's handiwork.
``We're saying at this time that we have no evidence that this is the work of Eric Rudolph,'' said Mark Calloway, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of North Carolina.
``But it's early in the investigation, and we're not drawing any conclusions at this time''.
Woody Enderson, the FBI agent directing the task force that is searching for Rudolph, said in a statement that ``there is no reason to believe'' that Rudolph has any connection to the Asheville attack.
Another federal investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was even more explicit.
``We see no linkage,'' the law-enforcement official said.
``This device is much different than the devices associated with Rudolph.
In a world where anything is possible, I can't slam any doors because we don't have Rudolph in custody and we don't know who did it in Asheville.
But there are a lot of differences''.
Investigators have painstakingly analyzed the components of the bombs Rudolph is accused of building, and have found numerous similarities between their parts and their design.
The bomb in Asheville exploded shortly after 7 a.m.
Saturday outside the Femcare Clinic, the only abortion provider in western North Carolina.
The clinic was scheduled to open at 8 a.m.
No one was injured, and the bomb caused little damage because it did not fully detonate.
There were no warnings before the blast, and no person or group has claimed responsibility.
The Femcare Clinic has never been hit by a violent attack, but it has been the site of regular protests by anti-abortion demonstrators.
It also received a hoax letter that purported to contain anthrax last month and a threatening telephone call last July, Calloway said.
If the bomb had fully detonated, the damage would have been severe, said Richard Fox, special agent in charge of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in North Carolina.
``It would have devastated that entire end of the building and penetrated into the building some approximately 40 feet or so to 60 feet, with fairly complete destruction,'' Fox said.
Because the bomb did not explode completely, investigators have gathered far more information about its components than is usually possible.
Rudolph, 32, a resident of western North Carolina, has been a fugitive since Jan.
30, 1998, the day after he allegedly bombed the New Woman All Women Health Care Center in Birmingham.
Rudolph has also been charged with the July 27, 1996, bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta; the Jan.
16, 1997, bombing of a north Atlanta building that includes an abortion clinic, and the Feb.
21, 1997, bombing of an Atlanta nightclub with a large gay clientele.
The attacks killed two people, including an off-duty police officer in Birmingham, and injured 124.
Rudolph remains on the FBI's list of the 10 most-wanted fugitives.
A reward of $1 million has been offered for information leading to his arrest.
ANDREWS, North Carolina (AP) _ The manhunt intensified again for abortion clinic bombing suspect Eric Rudolph after authorities said he took a truck and a six-month supply of food from a home last week.
Rudolph, on the run nearly six months following the Alabama bombing, was seen Thursday by the man officials say he robbed.
He disappeared after ditching the truck at a campground that leads into the mountains and areas honeycombed with caves, according to authorities.
Police said Rudolph stole the truck and the food from the man, who operates a health food store.
However ABC News reported Tuesday the man Rudolph took the food from was a friend.
And the network, citing FBI sources, said Rudolph left him money to pay for the supplies.
Rudolph's friend waited 24 hours before calling the sheriff, according ABC, and Rudolph reportedly told this man that he has a great hiding place.
NBC News also reported that Rudolph left money for the food and a list of items he wanted but didn't get.
Calls to authorities by The Associated Press seeking comment on the reports weren't immediately returned Tuesday night.
The area where Rudolph disappeared is at the southern tip of the Appalachians.
Members of the Southeast Bombing Task Force converged on this area near the tip of western North Carolina with bloodhounds and extra manpower.
Rudolph, a 31-year-old outdoorsman and carpenter, is charged in the Jan.
29 bombing of the New Woman All Women clinic, which killed an off-duty police officer and seriously wounded a nurse in Birmingham, Alabama.
He also is wanted for questioning three bombings in Georgia, including the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Park bombing.
The FBI placed Rudolph on its 10 most wanted list on May 6 and increased the reward to dlrs 1 million for anyone with information leading to his arrest and conviction.
Since he was named a suspect in the clinic bombing, Rudolph has evaded a nationwide search.
The reward for information leading to his capture has grown to dlrs 1 million.
Federal agents also want to question him about similar bombings in Atlanta, including the bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in July 1996 that killed one and injured more than 100.
The other attacks in Atlanta were at an abortion clinic in January 1997 and at a gay nightclub in February 1997.
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) --U.S.
Federal authorities on Wednesday charged Eric Robert Rudolph, one of the FBI's 10 most-wanted fugitives, with bombings including one blasted in the Centennial Park in Atlanta during the 1996 Olympics.
Attorney General Janet Reno said the criminal complaint charging Rudolph with the Olympic blast and the 1997 bombings of a gay bar and an abortion clinic was being filed with a federal court.
Reno said that Rudolph is on the run.
But she said, "We are going to keep searching until we find him and we're not going to rest until we bring him to justice".
Louis Freeh, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), said Rudolph "now is charged with six bombings," including three in Atlanta and the January 29 bombing of a Birmingham, Alabama, abortion clinic.
Rudolph was placed on the FBI's Most Wanted List last May, and a one million U.S. dollars reward was offered based on earlier charges that he bombed a Birmingham abortion clinic.
Rudolph was publicly linked to the Atlanta attacks last month when it was learned a Tennessee gun dealer identified Rudolph as the man who bought a special order of 50 pounds of smokeless powder four years ago.
Law enforcement official determined that powder has been connected to the 1996 bombing at Centennial Olympic Park.
The Olympic bombing killed one person and wounded more than 100 others.
An off-duty policeman working as a guard was killed and a nurse was injured in the Birmingham bombing.
ATLANTA --Federal law enforcement officers have settled into what they expect to be a slow and arduous search for Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph.
Tuesday, the searchers concentrated on an area of the Nantahala Forest near the house Rudolph's family moved into when he was 14, officials said.
Meanwhile, mechanics in Atlanta were examining a 1977 Nissan pickup truck, trying to determine how far Rudolph may have driven it.
The truck was taken from an elderly Nantahala man the night of July 9 and abandoned nearby with two flat tires on July 13.
''We're having experts examine it,'' said Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the U.S.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
George Nordmann, 71, reported the truck and about six months of food stolen on July 11.
Near Nordmann's home, which has been a focal point of the renewed searching in the past week, investigators found an observation point and a campsite.
They believe Rudolph watched Nordmann's residence for several days.
His thumbprint has been identified on a food wrapper at the observation point, investigators said Tuesday.
Investigators also were trying to determine if a boot print matched the Danner boots Rudolph bought from a Nantahala outlet, they said.
But the boots are a popular brand, worn by many hikers and even by searchers for Rudolph.
Rudolph had not been seen since Jan.
30, the day after the bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic killed an off-duty police officer and severely injured a nurse.
Agents are moving slowly, partly for fear of booby traps, officers said.
Agents want to question Rudolph in three bombings in Atlanta _ the July 1996 explosion in Centennial Olympic Park and the 1997 bombings of a Sandy Springs abortion clinic and a gay nightclub.
Investigators believe those bombs may have targeted police.
''We're working systematically very, very hard in arduous conditions,'' Killorin said.
''This is what we know.
The man is in the area.
We've confirmed that.
Absolutely, we're very careful because this person is wanted for a homicide bombing''.
Anyone with information about Rudolph can call 1-888-283-2662.

Despite large law enforcement numbers, Rudolph still eludesBy Jennifer Brett C.
1998 Cox News Service More than 200 state, local and federal agents continued the search in the mountains of western North Carolina for Eric Robert Rudolph Sunday, but the 31-year-old suspect in the fatal Jan.
29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic continued to elude his trackers.
``We're going to be here until the end,'' Southeast Bomb Task Force spokeswoman Celeste Armstead said.
``We'll be here until Eric Robert Rudolph is captured''.
Throughout the day, cars and trucks carrying heavily armed federal agents, search dogs and equipment rolled out of a search command post and staging area at a mountain campground east of Andrews, N.C.
``We rotate people to keep them fresh,'' Armstead said.
``We're not cutting back.
We're not scaling back at all''.
Despite some people's assertions that they would help Rudolph or keep his whereabouts secret if they spotted him, federal officials say they are getting good cooperation from local residents.
Armstead would not, however, say whether agents are any closer to capturing Rudolph.
Also, areas near the search site are swamped with reporters but not too many thrill seekers, as there isn't much a vacationer's camera could capture from outside the search perimeter, officials said.
Agents are keeping outsiders far from the 30 square-mile area where trackers, dogs, helicopters and sophisticated surveillance equipment are hunting for Rudolph, who is also sought for questioning about three Atlanta explosions at Centennial Olympic Park during the 1996 Olympics, a gay nightclub and a Sandy Springs abortion clinic.

ANDREWS, N.C.
(AP) --It was a year ago that serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph slipped through a police dragnet, loaded up on food and gear at an acquaintance's home and vanished into the rugged Southern Appalachians.
Since then, tracking dogs, 200 searchers and infrared-equipped helicopters have failed to find Rudolph in the dense mountain forests.
The trail has grown steadily cold, and now only a dozen police remain to follow up leads.
``All that's left up here are some investigators,'' said Macon County Deputy Kenny Cope, who knew Rudolph when they were growing up and later helped search for him.
``If they get a hot lead, they can call in the search teams''.
Rudolph has been charged in three Atlanta-area bombings, including the 1996 Olympic park bombing in which a woman died.
Investigators also suspect he was involved in a January 1998 explosion that killed a police officer and maimed a nurse at the New Woman All Women Health Care clinic in Birmingham, Ala.
Task force leaders said Rudolph watched local resident George Nordmann's ridgetop home 10 miles east of town for several days before approaching it on July 7, 1998, to take some food.
Two days later, he reappeared, collecting oatmeal, batteries, dried fruit, cayenne pepper and other items.
He left $500 and drove off in the truck.
Nordmann waited two days before notifying authorities.
His truck was found at a campground a few miles away with a note left on the front seat.
Nordmann, who continues to work behind the counter at a health food store in downtown Andrews, said his brief encounter with Rudolph changed his life.
``It's been a year since all this baloney started,'' he said in a brief conversation with a visitor to his shop last week.
He said federal agents leave him alone.
Rudolph put this small mountain community on the map early in 1998.
Hours after the Birmingham, Ala.
, clinic bombing on Jan.
29, 1998, a truck seen near the explosion site was traced to Rudolph.
Authorities set about tracking him down for questioning.
Rudolph rented a video in nearby Murphy that night, bought a large cache of food and supplies and vanished.
Searchers found his pickup truck outside Andrews several days later.
Scores of law enforcement officers converged on the area.
Rudolph quickly became the prime suspect when nails and other evidence were found in his home, pickup truck and a rented mini-warehouse.
Charges were filed.
Later, he was charged in three Atlanta-area bombings, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing.
Rudolph was placed on the FBI's 10 most wanted list and a reward of $1 million was posted for information leading directly to his arrest.
For weeks, search teams aided by tracking dogs disappeared into the thick forests, trying to pick up Rudolph's trail.
They explored caves deep in the mountains.
Helicopters cruised the ridgetops day and night.
By last July, the manhunt had ebbed as the thick summer foliage and heat rendered much of the task force's high-tech equipment useless.
Then Rudolph visited Nordmann, and everything changed.
Some 200 law enforcement officers soon returned to the woods.
In August, James ``Bo'' Gritz, the former Green Beret colonel and leader of the right-wing Patriot Movement, led about 40 volunteers into the woods to try to find Rudolph.
They left empty-handed.
In March, Woody Enderson, leader of the Southeast Bomb Task Force, said investigators were studying about a dozen break-ins over the winter in which food, toilet paper and other supplies were stolen.
Sometimes, the intruder wanted only a shower and shave.
Last week, a task force source said the mission will not be dismantled until Rudolph's capture or proof he has left the area.
Residents have learned to take it all in stride --the large task force command post behind the town hospital, the occasional helicopter flyovers, the federal agents in the restaurants and at weekend flea markets.
At the Bob Allison Campground, Pat Bonanno and Ronnie Davis were loading their two mules, Sadie and Daisy, and their horse, Sam, onto a trailer after camping about 200 feet from where Nordmann's truck was discovered.
Bonanno, who works for the Clay County Sheriff's Department, joked that they must have run into Rudolph while riding the horse trails leading to Nantahala Lake.
``I swear I've seen him before all this,'' said Bonanno, who works part-time at a barber shop in nearby Warren.
``I might have cut his hair once or twice''.
Cope wants Rudolph, 32, to get his day in court.
``All we have is one side of the story.
We don't know his side yet''.
Whether he is guilty or not, Rudolph has impressed Cope with his resiliency.
``Love him or hate him, I'd like to walk up to him and shake his hand,'' he said.
``I'd tell him he's done a hell of a job.''
ATLANTA _ Randy Weaver will be in the co-pilot's seat of Bo Gritz' Cessna today when it touches down in Andrews, N.
C., where the friends _ one a separatist and the other the highest decorated Green Beret commander from the Vietnam war _ will undertake their mission to hopefully escort Birmingham bomb suspect Eric Robert Rudolph out of the mountains and down a safe corridor through the federal justice system.
Weaver, of the infamous Ruby Ridge siege in Idaho, knows all too well what Rudolph is up against.
A missed court date in 1991 over a minor weapons charge led to an 18-month high-tech reconnaissance mission by federal agents that on Aug.
21, 1992, was whipped into chaos after an agent shot one of Weaver's barking dogs that was blowing their camouflaged cover.
The standoff ended 11 days later, with Weaver wounded and his wife and son dead.
Never again do federal agents want another Ruby Ridge.
They have said that once they find Rudolph's hiding place, it could take weeks, even months to negotiate him out.
Members of the Southeast Bomb Task Force say they know Rudolph is armed with long guns.
Investigators said tests conducted at the U.S.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) lab in Atlanta has detected dynamite residue in both trucks _ one was his and one he allegedly stole_ that Rudolph has driven since the Jan.
29 bombing of the New Woman All Women health care clinic in Birmingham.
Rudolph is wanted for questioning in connection with the deadly July 1996 bombing at Centennial Olympic Park, January 1997 double-blast at an Atlanta-area abortion clinic and a February 1997 blast at a gay Atlanta nightclub.
A $1 million dollar reward on his head has made information leading to Rudolph's arrest a hot commodity for bounty hunters.
His mother, Pat Rudolph, has released statements of concern for her son's life and the safety of the lawmen tracking him.
Weaver will appeal to Mrs.
Rudolph, who lives in Florida but is currently in North Carolina, that her son should give himself up, said Vicci Gritz, the former soldier's daughter-in-law.
``They (federal agents) feel like she might have some kind of contact with him somehow,'' Vicci Gritz said.
``Randy will reason with her so she can reason with him''.
Federal officials had no comment about the claim that Pat Rudolph talks to her son, probably by telephone.
``When they searched Eric Rudolph's home, he had some of our training videos,'' Vicci Gritz said.
``We have not had any contact with him''.
Gritz, 59, who has a daily radio show that can be picked up on shortwave, plans to muster at least 100 volunteers to go into the mountains this weekend.
Any participants must sign a waiver of the reward, because Gritz has promised it to Rudolph's mother to use for his defense.
That tactic had not been embraced by the FBI Wednesday, Vicci Gritz said.
But that's all Gritz may have to offer Rudolph, who could face the death penalty.
``I don't think these guys are going to be effective,'' said retired FBI Agent Robert Ressler, one of the original and most experienced profilers of criminals.
``(Gritz) cannot trust the government unless he gets something in writing.
Today they may say something and tomorrow say another, depending on which way the political winds are blowing''.
Doug Jones, U.S.
Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, said Wednesday no announcement has been made concerning Rudolph and the death penalty.
``Under Justice Department guidelines, we can't make that decision until he's in custody and indicted,'' Jones said.
``It's my understanding that that decision will be made in Washington.
There will be a recommendation from our office, but the ultimate decision will be left in the hands of the (U.S).
attorney general''.
Ressler said death by lethal injection will never deter some of today's new brand of terrorists.
``Using the death penalty to prevent acts of terrorism is a joke,'' he said.
``If you are mission oriented and willing to die for the cause....the death penalty is nothing more than a political football''.
Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta ATF office has said investigators believe Rudolph is on an unfinished mission.
Investigators said that might include hurting a group of agents or even media workers.
Investigators have said all along that Rudolph was hiding in the Nantahala where he spent his adolescence honing his skills in the woods. It's where he is the most comfortable.
A month ago, Rudolph proved their theory correct when he emerged in search of food and provisions from an elderly health store food owner.
Killorin has said it was not Rudolph's intention to run away or leave the country.
His intentions, investigators said they believe, are to finish the job he started.
``If his ultimate plan is to finish his mission, he's a very dangerous man,''Ressler said.
``Rather than negotiate, I think it's imperative to nail him and get him under control''.

Boots, possible fingerprint may give Feds new lead in Rudolph hunt By John Harmon C.
1998 Cox News Service ANDREWS, N.C.
_ Battling heat and occasional rattlesnakes, an army of law officers continued Monday to seek bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph foot by foot in rugged mountainous terrain.
In a sign that agents may have found fresh footprints of the Birmingham bombing suspect in the Nantahala National Forest, federal agents Monday returned to the store where Rudolph bought a pair of boots in 1994.
They came and asked if they could see the boot that Eric bought,'' said Kathy Jo Roper of Roper's Boot Store in the nearby rural community of Topton.
``They took the boot outside and made impressions in the sand and dirt outside''.
Agents visited the store in February during the early days of the now six-month-old manhunt for Rudolph.
At the time they purchased a pair of the same style and size of Danner insulated hunting boots bought by Rudolph.
It was unclear why agents returned for more boots, and U.S.
Justice Department spokesman Patrick Crosby declined comment.
Atlanta's WBS-TV, citing sources, reported Monday that searchers had found a fingerprint matching Rudolph's at an abandoned campsite.
At a press briefing Monday, the chief of the Southeast Bomb Taskforce said teams skilled in tracking are combing the surrounding mountains.
The teams include tracking dogs and heavily armed tactical units of the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said taskforce chief Woody Enderson.
They are searching an area known as the Tusquitee range, which has 5,000-foot-high peaks, dense hardwood forests and thickets of rhododendron that are virtually impenetrable.
``It's not impossible for a team to to cover 10 to 15 miles in a day,'' Enderson said.
``We've covered 10 square miles since last week...
It's progress as well as we could hope''.
Rudolph, 31, is charged with bombing a Birmingham abortion clinic Jan.
29, killing an off-duty policeman who was moonlighting as a security guard and severely wounded a nurse.
He also is wanted for questioning in three Atlanta bombings, including the 1996 Olympics blast that killed one and injured more than 100.
Until he emerged July 9 and obtained food, Rudolph had not been seen early February, when his abandoned pickup truck was found outside Murphy.

ANDREWS, N.C.
_ An old pickup truck federal investigators believe was stolen almost two weeks ago by Birmingham bomb suspect Eric Robert Rudolph was driven a ''few dozen miles'' over four days before it was abandoned in a remote Nantahala camp site, the head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force said Wednesday.
Experts examined the engine and other parts trying to determine a radius for the search for the fugitive, who may have used the 1977 Datsun truck to transport food and provisions to a hideout, investigators said.
The FBI's Woody Enderson appealed again Wednesday for help from anyone who may have seen the blue truck between the night of July 9 and about noon July 13 when it was discovered.
A note, believed to have been written by Rudolph, was found inside with instructions to return the truck to its owner, George Nordmann, 71, a health food store owner who is an acquaintance of Rudolph's.
''We already have some information from witnesses that during the time it was being driven by Eric Rudolph, the truck made a lot of noise,'' Enderson said at a news conference.
''It is possible that the truck may have been driven some distance out of the forest area, and later back in again to where it was found.
Again, the truck did not run well but still may have put on as much as a few dozen miles, so again we are asking anyone who may have seen or heard that loud-sounding blue. . . truck, please contact us''.
While investigators continued searching Wednesday, the widow of the police officer killed in the Birmingham bombing, and the host and a crew for the ``America's Most Wanted'' television show flew into town.
Rudolph is a suspect in the Jan.
29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic that killed Robert Sanderson and injured nurse Emily Lyons.
Felecia Sanderson said Wednesday she decided to come to the North Carolina mountains to appear on ``America's Most Wanted'' after watching news reports in which some residents said they would help Rudolph.
``Some people called him a folk hero,'' she said before being interviewed by the show's host, John Walsh, for a segment that will be broadcast Saturday.
``He's a murderer.
He's a terrorist''.
``We're going to bring in the pressure of a prime-time TV show,'' Walsh said.
``Someone may just see Eric Rudolph''.
Rudolph has been a subject of several previous shows.
During a routine briefing Wednesday, Enderson confirmed the existence of a ''number of small campsites'' in the search area, which has been focused around Nordmann's home, the campground where the truck was found and the Rudolph family's former home, where he spent most of his teenage years.
All are in the Nantahala Forest, and investigators have said their search area encompasses about 30 square miles.
''At one of those sites, we found trash buried in the ground, and Eric Rudolph's fingerprint was identified on one of the pieces of trash,'' Enderson said.
Jack Killorin, head of the Atlanta office of the U.S.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said the print was on a food wrapper at a site they where Rudolph is believed to have perched to watch Nordmann's house for several days before approaching Nordmann on July 7.
Sheriff Jack Thompson of Cherokee County, N.C., said Wednesday that the campsites were in rugged terrain.
''I don't know who else would be in the woods camping out in the wilderness other than marijuana growers,'' Thompson said.
''He may have a radio.
He's got batteries, I understand''.
A million dollar reward is being offered for information leading to Rudolph's arrest.
The federal information hotlines are 1-800-575-9873 or 1-888-ATF-BOMB (283-2662).
''This remains a difficult and potentially dangerous day and night search operation,'' Enderson said.
''We are still using every means available, including canine, aerial and electronic methods''.

CHARLOTTE, N.C.
(AP) --The FBI is paying outdoorsmen familiar with the remote mountains of western North Carolina to watch for signs of serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph, who has eluded a manhunt for more than two years.
It's the latest tactic employed by authorities, who have had no luck in tracking down the experienced backwoodsman.
However, since the FBI began paying the fees months ago, the scouts haven't been any more successful in finding Rudolph than anything else the agents have tried.
''I think it was worthwhile,'' said Lt.
Mike Stevens of the North Carolina Wildlife Commission, who was approached by federal agents last fall to help recruit hunters and other outdoorsmen to serve as part-time scouts.
''They were pretty much grasping for straws''.
Stevens said the scouts typically were paid between $15 and $20 an hour by the FBI.
''They wanted to find someone who was willing to go up on the ridge tops at night and listen,'' he said.
''They only wanted locals who knew the lay of the land''.
Rudolph, 33, is charged in three Atlanta-area bombings, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing in which a woman died.
Investigators also suspect he was involved in the 1998 explosion that killed a policeman and maimed a nurse at the New Woman All Women Health Care clinic in Birmingham, Ala.
Days later, Rudolph disappeared into the western North Carolina wilderness.
A $1 million reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest.
This is not the first time agents have turned to the public for help in the Rudolph manhunt.
In 1998, at the height of the search, the Southeast Bomb Task Force allowed hunters into the same woods agents were searching, in hopes the hunters or their dogs might find Rudolph.
More than 200 agents were searching the rugged landscape for Rudolph at the time, but now the operation is far smaller.
In March, the task force announced it was vacating its command post in the mountain town of Andrews.
Task force leader Steven McCraw insisted at the time the search would continue, but with agents investigating leads and not searching the woods.
The last confirmed Rudolph sighting was in July 1998, when he was said to have visited the home of a food store owner to stock up on provisions.
McCraw said investigators believe Rudolph may have been involved in a February 1999 break-in at a local restaurant, but no fingerprints or other evidence directly implicated him.
ANDREWS, N.C.
(AP) --The task force that has hunted serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph for two years will dismantle its command post in the rugged Southern Appalachians by the end of June.
''Eric Rudolph has not escaped justice, he has just delayed it,'' Steven McCraw, head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force, said Monday.
''The trail is cold, yet all evidence suggests he's here, he's alone and he's alive''.
Rudolph, 33, is charged in three Atlanta-area bombings, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing in which a woman died.
Investigators also suspect he was involved in the 1998, explosion that killed a policeman and maimed a nurse at a clinic that performs abortions in Birmingham, Ala.
Hours after the Birmingham bombing, a truck seen near the explosion site was traced to Rudolph.
Rudolph rented a video in Murphy, N.C., that night, bought a large cache of food and supplies and vanished.
His truck was found near here several days later.
But dogs, searchers and infrared-equipped helicopters have failed to find Rudolph, an Army veteran and survivalist, in the dense mountain forests.
Agents stopped actively searching in the woods in August, after McCraw took the job, he said.
McCraw said in his first public appearance since then that he's leaving North Carolina next month to return to Washington, D.C.
Agents will remain in Andrews, and a local coordinator will report to FBI officials in Atlanta, McCraw said.
There has been just one confirmed sighting of Rudolph since his disappearance, in July 1998.
McCraw said Rudolph may have been involved in a February 1999 break-in at a restaurant, but the perpetrator did not leave any fingerprints or other forensic evidence.
A $1 million reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest, but some people in the area have said they believe Rudolph may have gotten help from sympathetic locals.
Others say he might have left the region.
WASHINGTON (AP) --The FBI may reduce the number of agents assigned to the year-old hunt for a suspected bomber in a remote area of North Carolina, Director Louis Freeh said Wednesday.
About 100 investigative officers from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local sheriffs departments are hunting for fugitive Eric Robert Rudolph in the 530,000-acre Nantahala National Forest, a rugged area at the state's western tip.
The two federal agencies have a total of about 50 investigators on the case.
Some residents of the area, while grateful for the lengthy manhunt, nevertheless are feeling a little overwhelmed, said Rep.
Charles Taylor, R-N.C..
``My office gets complaints about helicopters flying over church and about being stopped by uniformed officers all the time.
They wonder how long the FBI is going to be in there,'' said Taylor, who serves on the House Appropriations Committee's panel on commerce, justice, state and judiciary.
Freeh, testifying before the panel, said: ``We are very sensitive to the community.
... We try to be as low-profile as you can be conducting a search like this.
We are looking to modify those resources to some degree in terms of downsizing''.
Investigators have not captured Rudolph, but the manhunt has had some positive results, Freeh told lawmakers.
``We do feel that our presence there has prevented him from committing more bombings,'' he said.
Rudolph has been charged in three Atlanta-area bombings, including the 1996 Olympic park bombing in Atlanta, in which a woman died.
Investigators also suspect he was involved in a January 1998 explosion that killed a policeman and maimed a nurse at the New Woman All Women Health Care in Birmingham, Ala.
There have been no reported sighting of Rudolph since July 11, when health food store owner George Nordmann told authorities Rudolph had come to his home in nearby Nantahala and taken six months' worth of food and supplies.
ANDREWS, N.C._Nine days after Eric Robert Rudolph walked out of the Western North Carolina mountains in search of food and batteries, law enforcement officials equipped with the latest in gadgetry still have not been able to track the Birmingham bombing suspect to his rugged hideout.
More than 200 local, state and federal officials from North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama were on the ground Thursday, searching a 30-square-mile area for the experienced survivalist.
The renewed search has rapidly expanded since Rudolph showed up at the Nantahala residence of an acquaintance July 7 with a list of provisions he needed and $500 in cash to pay for them with.
Although investigators found a spot where they believe Rudolph watched the home of George Nordmann, 71, for several days, the fugitive has vanished again, leaving no trail.
``Obviously, he's pretty good at it,'' Macon County Sheriff Homer Holbrooks said.
Bob Scott, a member of the North Carolina Civil Air Patrol and an experienced tracker, said searchers at times have spent months looking for a single lost airplane in the area.
``In one case, we lost a pretty good sized single engine Cessna airplane for 18 months and it was 50 yards from a main highway,'' Scott said.
``They bend the trees and make a canopy.
That's what he's got right now_a canopy''.
The dry weather also hinders the bloodhounds, investigators said.
Dampness holds in the scent.
Members of the Southeast Bomb Task Force had been ``re-energized'' after Nordmann came forward Saturday with his report of seeing Rudolph.
He told them Rudolph stole his 1977 Datsun pickup truck on July 9 and took about six months' worth of food.
Since that time, other ``solid leads'' have come in from the community, but Woody Enderson, FBI inspector in charge of the task force, would not characterize the tips.
``We are not going to talk about exact locations of the search, details about witnesses and what they have told us, or the exact operations that are going on right now,'' Enderson said.
``Eric Rudolph is still considered armed and dangerous.
He has specialized knowledge that makes him especially dangerous in the heavily wooded areas where we are looking''.

WASHINGTON, August 4 (Xinhua) --U.S.
President Bill Clinton said today he has not yet decided whether to strike out individual items in the comprehensive tax and budget bills awaiting his signature, noting that his new line-item veto authority ought to be used "somewhat sparingly".
Clinton is expected to sign the budget and tax-cut bills on Tuesday.
After signing them, he has five days to decide whether to cut out individual items.
Voicing his support for the line-item veto, Clinton told reporters during a photo session, "I think if we have it, it ought to be used.
I believe that it ought to be used somewhat sparingly".
Before the new law was passed last year, the only way presidents could reject spending laws was to veto whole budget bills.
Clinton is the first president to have line-item veto authority.
He said his aides were still reviewing the tax and budget bills to determine which items were open to the line-item veto, or whether any of them should be stricken.
Last week, House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said he doubted Clinton would veto specific items, saying that to do so would violate the spirit of the bipartisan negotiations between the White House and the Congress.
WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional a law giving the president a line-item veto, which let him cancel specific items in tax and spending measures.
Thursday's 6-3 decision said the law violates a stipulation in the U.S.
Constitution that requires every bill passed by the Congress to be presented to the president for his signature of approval or veto.
The court said the constitutional language does not allow what in effect would be partial vetoes.
The justices said that type of line-item veto could be authorized only by amending the Constitution, an arduous process done only 27 times in the document's 211-year history.
The line-item veto law was challenged by New York City and an Idaho potato growers' group after U.S.
President Bill Clinton vetoed provisions they sought that were granted by Congress.
Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, an authority sought by almost every president this century as a tool to limit wasteful politically based spending by Congress.
Congress enacted the veto in 1996, and Clinton used it 82 times last year.
WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from Thursday's Supreme Court decision striking down the presidential line-item veto.
The opinion in the case, Clinton vs.
City of New York, was written by Justice John Paul Stevens and joined by Justices William H.
Rehnquist, Anthony M.
Kennedy, David H.
Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Dissenting opinions, which are also excerpted below, were filed by Justice Antonin Scalia, with whom Justice Sandra Day O'Connor joined, and by Justice Stephen G.
Breyer. FROM THE DECISION By Justice Stevens &QL; The Line Item Veto Act. . . was enacted in April 1996 and became effective on January 1, 1997.
The following day, six members of Congress who had voted against the act brought suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia challenging its constitutionality.
On April 10, 1997, the District Court entered an order holding that the Act is unconstitutional.
Byrd vs.
Raines. In obedience to the statutory direction to allow a direct, expedited appeal to this Court . . . we promptly noted probable jurisdiction and expedited review.
. . . We determined, however, that the members of Congress did not have standing to sue because they had not ``alleged a sufficiently concrete injury to have established Article III standing . . . thus, ``in light of (the) overriding and time-honored concern about keeping the judiciary's power within its proper constitutional sphere,'' . . . we remanded the case to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.
Less than two months after our decision in that case, the President exercised his authority to cancel one provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 . . . and two provisions in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 . . . Appellees, claiming that they had been injured by two of those cancellations, filed these cases in the District Court.
That Court again held the statute invalid, . . . and we again expedited our review . . . We now hold that these appellees have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the act and, reaching the merits, we agree that the cancellation procedures set forth in the Act violate the Presentment Clause, Art.
I, 7, cl.
2, of the Constitution.
. In both legal and practical effect, the President has amended two Acts of Congress by repealing a portion of each.
``(R)epeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Art.
I''. There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.
Both Article I and Article II assign responsibilities to the President that directly relate to the lawmaking process, but neither addresses the issue presented by these cases.
The President ``shall from time to time give to the Congress Information on the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient''.
Art. II, 3.
Thus, he may initiate and influence legislative proposals.
(footnote 27) Moreover, after a bill has passed both houses of Congress, but ``before it become(s) a law,'' it must be presented to the President.
If he approves it, ``he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it''.
Art. I, 7, cl.
2. (footnote 28) His ``return'' of a bill, which is usually described as a ``veto,'' (footnote 29) is subject to being overridden by a two-thirds vote in each House.
There are important differences between the President's ``return'' of a bill pursuant to Article I, 7 and the exercise of the President's cancellation authority pursuant to the Line Item Veto Act.
The constitutional return takes place BEFORE the bill becomes law; the statutory cancellation occurs AFTER the bill becomes law.
The constitutional return is of the entire bill; the statutory cancellation is of only a part.
Although the Constitution expressly authorizes the President to play a role in the process of enacting statutes, it is silent on the subject of unilateral Presidential action that either repeals or amends parts of duly enacted statutes.
There are powerful reasons for construing constitutional silence on this profoundly important issue as equivalent to an express prohibition.
The procedures governing the enactment of statutes set forth in the text of Article I were the product of the great debates and compromises that produced the Constitution itself.
Familiar historical materials provide abundant support for the conclusion that the power to enact statutes may only ``be exercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure''.
Our first President understood the text of the Presentment Clause as requiring that he either ``approve all the parts of a bill, or reject it in toto''.
(footnote 30) What has emerged in these cases from the President's exercise of his statutory cancellation powers, however, are truncated versions of two bills that passed both Houses of Congress.
They are not the product of the ``finely wrought'' procedure that the Framers designed.
. . . The Line Item Veto Act authorizes the President himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing the procedures set out in Article I, 7.
The fact that Congress intended such a result is of no moment.
Although Congress presumably anticipated that the President might cancel some of the items in the Balanced Budget Act and in the Taxpayer Relief Act, Congress cannot alter the procedures set out in Article I, 7, without amending the Constitution.
(footnote 40) . . . If the Line Item Veto Act were valid, it would authorize the President to create a different law, one whose text was not voted on by either House of Congress or presented to the President for signature.
Something that might be known as ``Public Law 105-33 as modified by the President'' may or may not be desirable, but it is surely not a document that may ``become a law'' pursuant to the procedures designed by the Framers of Article I, 7, of the Constitution.
If there is to be a new procedure in which the President will play a different role in determining the final text of what may ``become a law,'' such change must come not by legislation but through the amendment procedures set forth in Article V of the Constitution.
. . . (EXCERPTS FROM DISSENTS FOLLOW IN 2nd TAKE) nn FROM THE DISSENT By Justice Scalia Insofar as the degree of political, ``law-making'' power conferred upon the Executive is concerned, there is not a dime's worth of difference between Congress' authorizing the President to CANCEL a spending item, and Congress' authorizing money to be spent on a particular item at the President's discretion.
And the latter has been done since the founding of the nation.
From 1789-1791, the First Congress made lump-sum appropriations for the entire government ``sum(s) not exceeding'' specified amounts for broad purposes.
From a very early date Congress also made permissive individual appropriations, leaving the decision whether to spend the money to the President's unfettered discretion.
. . . Examples of appropriations committed to the discretion of the President abound in our history.
. . . Had the Line Item Veto Act authorized the President to ``decline to spend'' any item of spending contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, there is not the slightest doubt that authorization would have been constitutional.
What the Line Item Veto Act does instead authorizing the President to ``cancel'' an item of spending is technically different.
But the technical difference does NOT relate to the technicalities of the Presentment Clause, which have been fully complied with; and the doctrine of unconstitutional delegation, which IS at issue here, is pre-eminently NOT a doctrine of technicalities.
The title of the Line Item Veto Act, which was perhaps designed to simplify for public comprehension, or perhaps merely to comply with the terms of a campaign pledge, has succeeded in faking out the Supreme Court.
The President's action it authorizes in fact is not a line item veto and thus does not offend Art.
I, 7; and insofar as the substance of that action is concerned, it is no different from what Congress has permitted the President to do since the formation of the Union.
FROM THE DISSENT By Justice Breyer In sum, I recognize that the act before us is novel.
In a sense, it skirts a constitutional edge.
But that edge has to do with means, not ends.
The means chosen do not amount literally to the enactment, repeal or amendment of a law.
Nor, for that matter, do they amount literally to the ``line item veto'' that the act's title announces.
Those means do not violate any basic separation of powers principle.
They do not improperly shift the constitutionally foreseen balance of power from Congress to the President.
Nor, since they comply with Separation of Powers principles, do they threaten the liberties of individual citizens.
They represent an experiment that may, or may not, help representative government work better.
The Constitution, in my view, authorizes Congress and the President to try novel methods in this way.
Consequently, with respect, I dissent .
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) --U.S.
President Bill Clinton today signed a 247.7 billion U.S. dollar military spending bill for the 1998 fiscal year starting October 1.
Clinton said the funding that Congress has added to the bill is excessive and threatened to veto some items by using the line-item veto power.
The bill contains about 3.2 billion dollars more in funding than was approved for the previous year.
It cuts off funding for U.S. combat troops in Bosnia after June 30, unless the president certifies that a continued U.S. presence there is necessary, says the bill in a cautious language.
The bill also provides for a 331 million dollars down payment for the purchase of new B-2 Stealth bombers, but leaves it up to Clinton to decide whether to procure more of the planes.
The spending in the new fiscal year was budgeted higher than the Clinton administration requested, and the president expressed "concern" over that, hinting that he may use the line-item veto authority to shrink the bill.
"The bill provides 4.2 billion dollars more than I requested in my 1998 budget, and 1.2 billion dollars more than the levels that my administration believes were agreed to in the bipartisan budget agreement" between Congress and the White House, Clinton said.
Clinton's emphasis on the 1.2 billion dollars by which the measure exceeds the bipartisan budget agreement may be a hint as to how much Clinton would target in a veto.
On Monday, Clinton used the law to veto 38 spending items in a military construction bill.
The "could-be" vetoed spending items include half a billion dollars in congressionally added spending on eight C-130J military transport aircraft not in either the Pentagon's budget request or in the request Clinton sent to Capitol Hill.
The planes are built in Marietta, Georgia, hometown of House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
Congress also added 100 million dollars for an LPD-17 amphibious assault ship, to be built near the hometown of Representative Bob Livingston, Republican from Louisiana and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee; and 720 million dollars for an Aegis destroyer built in the hometown of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Republican from Mississippi.
WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by vetoing single items of spending or tax breaks approved by Congress.
In a 6-3 decision, the court rejected a decades-old attempt mostly by Congressional Republican leaders to strengthen the hand of the president in struggles with Congress.
The court quoted George Washington, who presided over the Constitutional Convention and later wrote that a president must ``approve all the parts of a bill, or reject it in toto,'' but cannot modify the text of legislation presented to him by Congress.
The Supreme Court's reasoning Thursday was exceptionally simple.
``The president has amended two acts of Congress by repealing a portion of each,'' said the majority opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens.
``Repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Article I'' of the Constitution, which established ``a single finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure'' for enacting laws.
In 1996, Congress tried to improve on that procedure by allowing the president to cancel individual items of federal spending and tax breaks, arguing that such power, held by governors in many states, would help eliminate the budget deficit.
But the court said Thursday that such ``line-item vetoes'' were unconstitutional.
``The Line-Item Veto Act authorizes the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing the procedures set out in Article I,'' Stevens said.
President Clinton, traveling in China, said he was ``deeply disappointed'' with the ruling.
``The decision is a defeat for all Americans,'' he said.
``It deprives the president of a valuable tool for eliminating waste in the federal budget and for enlivening the public debate over how to make the best use of public funds''.
Clinton has used the line-item veto to rewrite 11 laws, eliminating 82 items, including money that would have gone to New York City hospitals and a tax break for Idaho potato growers.
Challenges to those vetoes led to Thursday's decision.
In a concurring opinion, Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy chided Congress for surrendering power to the president.
``Failure of political will does not justify unconstitutional remedies,'' he declared.
``Abdication of responsibility is not part of the constitutional design''.
The Line-Item Veto Act was passed as part of the Republicans' Contract With America.
Sixty-nine senators and more than 290 House members voted for it.
Kennedy said that the device ``compromises the political liberty of our citizens'' by concentrating power in the hands of the president.
``Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the branches seek to transgress the separation of powers,'' he said.
Justices Antonin Scalia, Stephen Breyer and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented, saying they would have upheld the line-item veto.
Scalia said ``there is not a dime's worth of difference'' between allowing the president to cancel a particular project, through the line-item veto, and allowing him to spend money on a particular item at his discretion.
Two champions of the line-item veto, Sens.
John McCain of Arizona and Daniel Coats of Indiana, both Republicans, said they would keep fighting for it.
They have proposed an alternative, under which each item in an omnibus appropriations bill would be submitted to the president as a separate piece of legislation for him to sign or veto.
Under this arrangement, the president would receive thousands of bills each year.
Stevens said the Line-Item Veto Act ``gives the president the unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted statutes''.
In exercising the power, President Clinton has infuriated members of Congress, including many who supported the device in principle.
Conservative Republicans joined Democrats in complaining that Clinton had killed worthy projects in their home states.
In February, Congress overturned the vetoes of 38 military construction projects worth $287 million.
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
, the foremost opponent of the line-item veto, was ecstatic after the ruling.
``This is a great day for the United States of America, a great day for the Constitution of the United States,'' Byrd said.
``Today we feel that the liberties of the American people have been assured.
God save this honorable Court''!
Byrd, who has served in the Senate for nearly 40 years, expressed dismay at Breyer's opinion.
Advocating a pragmatic view of the Constitution, Breyer said the line-item veto was an acceptable ``experiment'' that did not ``threaten the liberties of individual citizens''.
Byrd said this was ``a remarkable position to take''.
He quoted Sir William Blackstone, the 18th-century English jurist, who wrote: ``In all tyrannical governments, the supreme magistracy, or the right of both making and enforcing the laws, is vested in one and the same man, or one and the same body of men.
And wherever these two powers are united together, there can be no public liberty''.
Byrd led six members of Congress in challenging the constitutionality of the line-item veto last year, before Clinton had used the device.
In June 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no genuine ``case or controversy'' because the lawmakers had not suffered any ``personal, concrete injury''.
On Thursday, by contrast, the court said that the New York hospitals and the Idaho potato growers had suffered an ``actual injury''.
Justice Stevens said that the line-item veto, by creating a potential liability of at least $2.6 billion for New York, could harm the city's financial strength and borrowing power.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the majority opinion by Justice Stevens in the case, Clinton vs.
City of New York, No.
97-1374. (STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) As a result of the ruling, New York can keep all the federal money it received for the care of poor people under Medicaid, and Idaho potato growers can keep the tax break they received from Congress.
People affected by other line-item vetoes, including banks and insurance companies and military contractors, will also benefit, even though they did not challenge President Clinton's actions in court.
``Everybody who was a victim should be standing in line at the Treasury or some other agency to get their money or to file for a tax refund if they've already paid taxes,'' said Alan Morrison, a lawyer who filed a friend-of-the-court brief for three House Democrats opposed to the line item veto.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) Stevens said the court was expressing ``no opinion about the wisdom'' of the line item veto procedure.
But, he said, if Congress wants to establish such a procedure, it must amend the Constitution.
WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, in a historic ruling affecting the constitutional balance of power at the heart of the American political system, struck down legislation Thursday that permits the president to veto specific provisions of spending and tax bills.
The court's 6-3 decision against the practice, known as the ``line-item veto,'' restores the historic balance between the legislative and executive branches, removing from the president's political arsenal a weapon that Congress provided in 1996 and that President Clinton used 82 times last year.
The Supreme Court, especially sensitive to the separation of powers because of its own institutional role, took the unusual step of noting it did ``not lightly'' reach its conclusion.
Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the majority, said the issue was of ``profound importance''.
The court, Stevens wrote, ``has concluded that its duty is clear,'' and the line-item veto is ``not authorized by the Constitution''.
Though the line-item veto was provided to a Democratic president by a Republican Congress, the ability to strike out individual provisions of bills is a prerogative given to 43 of the nation's governors, sought 130 years ago by President Ulysses S.
Grant and desired by every modern president since Harry Truman.
In a statement released by the White House, President Clinton said he was ``deeply disappointed'' by the ruling, which he characterized as ``a defeat for all Americans''.
The decision, however, was hailed by constitutional traditionalists, especially those on Capitol Hill who guard congressional prerogatives, who argued that the line-item veto represented an erosion of legislative powers by permitting a president to pick and choose among congressional spending decisions.
``This is a great day, a great day for the United States of America, a great day for the Constitution of the United States,'' said Senator Robert C.
Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who has opposed the line-item veto for decades.
Many Supreme Court decisions set off ripples that disturb the pond of politics, but this ruling will shape the political environment in Washington intimately for years to come.
Thursday's ruling, coming on the next-to-last day of the high court's term, will affect not only legislative strategy but also legislative content, making it even more tempting for lawmakers to add special or local-interest provisions into spending bills.
Its influence will be felt immediately this summer, as the 13 appropriations bills make their slow passage from subcommittee all the way to the president's desk.
The ruling, moreover, provides a window into the high court's view of the relationship between the other two branches of government.
It affirms the very first word of the first sentence of the first section of the first article of the Constitution, where the framers wrote: ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.
''... The court struck down the measure by citing a clause deeper in the Constitution, where the framers stipulated that ``every bill'' that passed the House and Senate shall ``be presented'' to the president, who can sign it into law or return it to Congress if he objects.
The court found that the line-item veto violated this ``Presentment Clause,'' and the historical record provides ``abundant support'' for the notion that there should be no deviation from the process.
``If there is to be a new procedure in which the president will play a different role in determining the text of what may `become a law,' such change must come not by legislation but through the amendment procedures set forth in Article V of the Constitution,'' Stevens wrote.
He was joined by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy, David H.
Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Dissenting were Justices Antonin Scalia, Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen G.
Breyer. Scalia, writing for the dissenters, argued that the true intent of the line-item veto law was misread by the court majority.
``The title...designed to simplify... or perhaps merely comply with the terms of a campaign pledge, has succeeded in faking out the Supreme Court,'' he said.
&UR; &LR; The line-item veto struck down Thursday allowed a president to sign a statute into law, but then, within five days, cancel certain items in the legislation.
Congress could in turn reinstate the item by passing a separate bill, which it did in 38 of the instances in which Clinton exercised the power.
The court, however, found that the ``Presentment Clause'' was crafted in a deliberate fashion.
Constitutional scholars believe the framers intended both houses of Congress and the president to approve any law, a slow process that nonetheless frustrates factional interests.
The court's ruling in effect establishes, or restores, a firewall between the law-making function of Congress and the final approval function of the president.
``This legislative process was deemed so fundamental to our freedoms that the court didn't want to allow an exception, even for what might be deemed a lovable purpose like cutting federal spending,'' said David Schoenbrod, a law professor at the New York Law School.
Congress, in adopting the legislation, tried to get around the ``Presentment Clause'' by saying the president actually signed bills into law and, then, separately, went back and canceled specific budget and tax items.
``That's a highly formalistic approach, and the court saw through it,'' said Kate Stith-Cabranes, a Yale Law School expert on legislation.
``This really is a line-item veto, and it was not contemplated by the Constitution''.
Supporters of the line-item veto announced they would immediately offer legislation to circumvent the justices' decision by requiring each spending item approved by Congress to be listed as a separate bill for the president's signature or veto.
More than a dozen years ago, the justices prohibited a similar aggrandizement of power beyond those expressly mentioned in the Constitution, though that time, Congress benefitted instead of the president.
That ruling, made in 1983, struck down a law permitting either House of Congress to veto some executive branch decisions.
The line-item veto was apppealed to the Supreme Court shortly after it was approved by Congress, but the justices threw out the case, saying that the plaintiffs _ Byrd and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, and then-Senator Mark O.
Hatfield, the Oregon Republican _ didn't have standing for their complaint.
At the time, the justices said the senators' suit was largely a theoretical exercise since they were not harmed.
The justices ruling Thursday grew out of challenges to the law filed by parties in Idaho and New York directly harmed by specific line-item vetoes.
Now, &UR; &LR; however, it is clear that the line-item veto has resulted in a significant shift in the balance of power to the president, changing the way lawmakers sought funding for favored spending programs.
The impetus to create a line-item veto came less from politics than from economics, and the momentum gathered force as the federal budget deficit grew in the 1980s and the early 1990s.
In the past as in modern times, its earliest adherants viewed it as a tool of thrift.
In his landmark commentary on American government written 110 years ago, Lord Bryce said the line-item veto was ``desired by enlightened men'' and would ``save the nation millions of dollars a year''.
Those who criticized Thursday's ruling, including Clinton, emphasized the line-item veto's role in keeping government efficient and inexpensive.
``The line-item veto act was a vital force in restoring the appropriate balance of power, and eliminating wasteful, unnecessary pork-barrel spending,'' said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.
``Unfortunately, pork-barrel spending is alive and well''.
The case is Clinton v.
City of New York, 97-1374.
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) --U.S.
President Bill Clinton today vetoed a congressional rejection of his line-item veto on 38 military construction projects.
Last month Clinton for the firs time used the line-item authority, a power that the president can use to veto individual spending items in bills, to delete 38 projects in 24 states worth 287 million U.S. dollars from the fiscal 1998 military construction spending bill.
Clinton said, "The projects in this bill would not substantially improve the quality of life of military service members and their families".
Then the Senate voted to disapprove of Clinton's veto of 36 of the projects and the House voted to restore all the 38.
As a congressional version to kick the ball back to the president, the Senate then agreed with the House to fully restore the projects.
The Republican-dominated congress will not let the matter over.
It can still override his veto with two-thirds votes in the House and Senate when it resumes session next year.
WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court struck down on Thursday what Sen.
John McCain had hoped would be part of his legacy: a law giving the president expanded veto power to harness ``pork-barrel'' spending by Congress.
In a 6-3 decision, the court declared unconstitutional a McCain-sponsored law giving the president authority to wipe out wasteful programs contained in larger spending bills.
Before the law's enactment in 1996, the president could veto an entire spending measure but not individual items.
The court ruled that such a specialized veto can be authorized only through a constitutional amendment.
But McCain, R-Ariz.
, and other line-item veto backers, vowed to push instead for a slightly different measure in Congress that, this time, would pass constitutional muster.
Several senators feared the court's ruling would usher in a new era of the sort of bloated, special-interest spending that Congress was long known for _ such projects as microbreweries, boat marinas and other ``pork''.
``This defeat means that we will return and retreat to the practice of loading up otherwise necessary legislation with pork-barrel spending,'' said Sen.
Dan Coats, R-Ind.
``The Supreme court has resurrected a pig, or pork, that we thought was dead''.
The court's decision was a defeat for McCain, who forced a vote on a line-item veto nearly every year for a decade until its approval two years ago.
``I'd like to point out that it's been a wonderful two weeks for me,'' a droll McCain told reporters after the decision.
``I haven't had quite this much fun since I was last interrogated in Hanoi''.
McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, lost his bid to pass a sweeping anti-tobacco bill last week and was criticized for telling a crude joke at a fund-raiser about the president's daughter.
Passage of the line-item veto by the Senate after so many failures had been considered one of the crowning achievements of McCain's career.
House Republicans made the line-item veto a part of their Contract with America, the agenda they credited for electing a GOP majority to Congress in 1994.
But the court said the law violates that part of the Constitution requiring every bill to be presented to the president for his approval or veto.
The court said the Constitution does not allow for what, in effect, are partial vetoes.
Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens cited the ``profound importance'' of the issue and said that ``the procedures authorized by the line-item veto act are not authorized by the Constitution''.
``If there is to be a new procedure in which the president will play a different role in determining the text of what may become a law, such change must come not by legislation but through the amendment procedures set forth in Article V of the Constitution,'' Stevens said.
Stevens was joined in his opinion by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who is a former Arizona state lawmaker, dissented, along with Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer.
The law was challenged by New York City and an Idaho potato growers' group after President Clinton vetoed provisions they sought. &QL;
WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by vetoing single items of spending or specific tax breaks approved by Congress.
In a 6-3 decision, the court rejected a decades-old effort to strengthen the hand of the president in struggles with Congress.
The court quoted George Washington, who presided over the Constitutional Convention and later wrote that a president must ``approve all the parts of a bill, or reject it in toto,'' but cannot modify the text of legislation presented to him by Congress.
The court's reasoning Thursday was exceptionally simple.
``The President has amended two acts of Congress by repealing a portion of each,'' said the majority opinion, by Justice John Paul Stevens.
``Repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Article I'' of the Constitution, which established ``a single finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure'' for enacting laws.
In 1996, Congress tried to change that procedure, and reduce the budget deficit, by allowing the president to cancel individual items of federal spending and tax breaks.
But the court said Thursday that such line-item vetoes were unconstitutional.
``The Line Item Veto Act authorizes the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing the procedures set out in Article I,'' Stevens said.
President Clinton, traveling in China, said he was ``deeply disappointed'' with the ruling.
``The decision is a defeat for all Americans,'' Clinton said.
``It deprives the president of a valuable tool for eliminating waste in the federal budget and for enlivening the public debate over how to make the best use of public funds''.
Clinton has used the line-item veto to rewrite 11 laws, eliminating 82 items, including money for New York City hospitals and a tax break for Idaho potato growers.
Thursday's decision came in lawsuits filed by New York City, the Greater New York Hospital Association, two unions of health-care workers, the Snake River Potato Growers and one of its officers.
In an opinion concurring with Stevens, Justice Anthony Kennedy chided Congress for surrendering power to the president.
``Failure of political will does not justify unconstitutional remedies,'' Kennedy declared.
``Abdication of responsibility is not part of the constitutional design''.
The Line Item Veto Act was passed as part of the Republicans' ``Contract With America''.
Sixty-nine senators and more than 290 House members voted for it.
Presidents since Ulysses Grant have sought the line-item veto, and Ronald Reagan popularized the idea.
Kennedy said that the device ``compromises the political liberty of our citizens'' by concentrating power in the hands of the president.
``Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the branches seek to transgress the separation of powers,'' he said.
The dissenters _ Justices Antonin Scalia, Stephen Breyer and Sandra Day O'Connor _ would have upheld the line-item veto.
Scalia said that ``there is not a dime's worth of difference'' between allowing the president to cancel a particular project, through the line-item veto, and allowing him to spend money on a particular item at his discretion.
In addition to Kennedy, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices David Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the majority opinion by Stevens in the case, Clinton vs.
City of New York, No.
97-1374. Two champions of the line-item veto, Sens.
John McCain, R-Ariz.
, and Daniel Coats, R-Ind.
, said they would keep fighting for it.
They have proposed an alternative, under which each item in an omnibus appropriations bill would be submitted to the president as a separate piece of legislation for him to sign or veto.
Under this arrangement, the president would receive thousands of bills each year.
Stevens said the Line Item Veto Act ``gives the president the unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted statutes''.
In exercising the power, Clinton has infuriated members of Congress, including many who supported the device in principle.
Conservative Republicans joined Democrats in complaining that Clinton had killed worthy projects in their home states.
In February, Congress overturned the vetoes of 38 military construction projects worth $287 million.
The amount of money saved by Clinton's line-item vetoes is difficult to calculate, but members of Congress said it was less than 1 percent of the total federal budget of $1.6 trillion.
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
, the foremost opponent of the line-item veto, was ecstatic Thursday.
``This is a great day for the United States of America, a great day for the Constitution of the United States,'' Byrd said.
``Today we feel that the liberties of the American people have been assured.
God save this honorable court''!
In a dissenting opinion, Breyer said the line-item veto was an acceptable ``experiment'' that did not ``threaten the liberties of individual citizens''.
Byrd, who has served in the Senate for nearly 40 years, disagreed.
Byrd quoted Sir William Blackstone, the 18th century English jurist, who wrote: ``In all tyrannical governments, the supreme magistracy, or the right of both making and enforcing the laws, is vested in one and the same man, or one and the same body of men.
And wherever these two powers are united together, there can be no public liberty''.
Byrd led six members of Congress in challenging the constitutionality of the line-item veto last year, before Clinton had used the device.
In June 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no genuine ``case or controversy'' because the lawmakers had not suffered any ``personal, concrete injury''.
On Thursday, by contrast, the court said that the New York hospitals and the Idaho potato growers had suffered an ``actual injury''.
Stevens said that the line-item veto, by creating a potential liability of at least $2.6 billion for New York, could harm the city's financial strength and borrowing power.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
, rejoiced at the decision.
``In the history of Congress,'' Moynihan said, ``we have never had an issue of such importance for the powers of the executive and legislative branches.
Liberty has prevailed''.
As a result of the ruling, New York can keep all the federal money it received for the care of poor people under Medicaid, and Idaho potato growers can keep the tax break they received from Congress.
Under the Line Item Veto Act, the president could cancel tax breaks that benefited fewer than 101 people.
People affected by other line-item vetoes, including banks and insurance companies and military contractors, will also benefit, even though they did not challenge Clinton's actions in court.
``Everybody who was a victim should be standing in line at the Treasury or some other agency to get their money or to file for a tax refund if they've already paid taxes,'' said Alan Morrison, a lawyer who filed a brief for three House Democrats opposed to the line-item veto.
One of those Democrats, Rep.
David Skaggs of Colorado, said, ``The Supreme Court has saved Congress from itself''.
More than 40 governors have some form of line-item veto, but the power is usually granted by state constitutions, not just by state laws.
Stevens said the court was expressing ``no opinion about the wisdom of the procedures authorized by the Line Item Veto Act''.
But, he said, if Congress wants to establish such procedures, it must amend the federal Constitution.
WASHINGTON, October 6 (Xinhua) --U.S.
President Bill Clinton today used his line-item veto power to strike out 38 projects worth 287 million U.S. dollars from a military construction bill.
"Government must continue to live within its means," Clinton said in cutting the military outlays from the 9.2 billion U.S. dollar bill.
The vetoed projects include a 19.9 million dollar plan to build a new wharf for ship repair at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Virginia; a 17.9 million dollar pier improvement project at Florida's Mayport Naval Station; a 16 million dollar railroad project at Fort Carson, Colo.
four projects in California and three in Texas.
Clinton's use of the line-item veto is likely to generate an angry reaction from some in Congress, where military construction projects have long been designed to benefit the home districts of specific congressmen and senators.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's home state was spared, although six Mississippi projects were added to the military construction bill.
Moody Air Force Base in Georgia, home state of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, will lose a 6.8 million dollar combat search and training center if the president's veto is upheld.
The line-item veto, sought by U.S. presidents for more than a century, gives the president the ability to cancel special interest tax breaks as well as specific spending items that he deems wasteful while avoiding killing the entire measure.
It was only the second time Clinton had exercised the line-item veto authority, which went into effect in January.
WASHINGTON _ Government and hospital officials in New York state praised the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the president's line-item veto power Thursday, saying that it would preserve a set of state hospital taxes that help finance health care for the poor.
The decision settles in New York's favor a longstanding disagreement between the state and federal government over the legality of some of those taxes, which raised $2.6 billion for health care programs from 1992 to 1996.
State and city officials had been concerned that if they lost the dispute, the Clinton administration would require the state, city and many hospitals to reimburse some of that money, with potentially devastating consequences for patient care and government budgets.
``I'm very gratified we won this because I realized the impact this would have had, not only on the city, but in particular on the ability of hospitals to care for those people who are the weakest and in the most vulnerable positions, people without medical insurance,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
The city, where most of the state's Medicaid recipients live, was a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the line-item veto, along with hospital groups and unions for health care workers.
At issue were taxes New York state has levied on hospitals for many years to finance health care programs for the poor, including health insurance for children in low-income families, AIDS services and poison control centers.
Under Medicaid, the federal health care program for the poor, Washington matched much of the revenue raised by those taxes.
But in 1995, the Clinton administration raised concerns about whether some of the taxes were legal under a 1991 federal law intended to prevent Medicaid abuses by states.
New York requested a waiver from the 1991 law, but after much haggling, the administration declined to grant one.
Frustrated with the stalemate and concerned that the administration would eventually demand repayment of some of the federal matching funds, New York state officials and city hospital officials asked New York's senators, Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, to insert language in a 1997 budget bill declaring the taxes legal and absolving the state of responsibility for repaying any of the Medicaid matching funds.
The senators complied and the measure was approved by Congress.
At the same time, White House officials were searching for budget provisions that would be appropriate for Clinton's inaugural use of the line-item veto.
Last August, the president selected three, one of which was the Moynihan-D'Amato amendment, contending that the measure would set a damaging precedent.
The veto almost immediately became a political headache for the administration, as New York Democrats joined labor unions, hospital officials, advocates for the poor and Republicans in assailing the president for jeopardizing programs for the indigent.
Yet it was never really clear that the administration was on the verge of declaring the state's hospital taxes illegal.
And even had it done that, many federal officials said, it would have been unlikely for the administration to demand that the state, with its large pool of Democratic voters, or its hospitals reimburse any of the Medicaid funds.
Still, hospital officials declared Thursday that the Supreme Court had rescued New York's hospital system from a potential disaster.
``If we had to pay this money back, it would have come at inducing a crisis in the health care system,'' said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a hospital trade group.
WASHINGTON, November 8 (Xinhua) --The United States House of Representatives today voted 352-64 to reject President Bill Clinton's line-item veto of 38 military construction programs in fiscal 1998.
The Senate also voted 69-30 last month to restore funding for 36 of the 38 projects.
Both the votes were well above the two-thirds needed to overturn a presidential veto.
But it was unclear whether the two chambers can come up with a unified bill before they recess for the year, possibly on Sunday.
Last year, Clinton gained the line-item veto power to veto individual spending items in bills while signing the bills to ensure the administration moving in a new fiscal year.
Last month, the president exercised his new authority by killing 38 military construction projects in 24 states worth 287 million U.S. dollars.
So far the White House has vetoed 163 line-items against six bills, mostly affecting military projects.
The White House said that the president used his authority to cancel projects that were not requested in the budget and would not substantially improve the quality of life of military service members.
The House today also completed work on seven other bills to finish its work and leave for its year-end recess Sunday.
It passed by voice vote the Reading Excellence Act, which authorizes 260 million dollars over three years to help teachers, tutors and parents to learn how to teach children reading.
It also passed by a vote of 291-125 legislation to authorize agricultural research and education programs through 2002.
WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Congress violated the principle of separation of powers when it gave the president the power to cut individual projects from tax and spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation.
In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress.
The court also said the 1996 measure authorized the president to issue what were, in practical terms, partial vetoes.
In passing the law, Congress said the president could cancel individual items in tax and spending bills within five days of signing them into law.
Congress, however, was allowed to try to reinstate the items by having both houses pass them in separate bills.
Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, an authority sought by nearly every chief executive this century as a tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
But Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said the law ``authorized the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing Article 1 procedures''.
Article 1 of the Constitution established the principle of separation of powers among the three branches of government.
Stevens concluded that the 1996 act ``may or may not be desirable, but it is surely not a document'' that is constitutional.
A year ago, the justices heard a challenge to the act brought by six members of Congress, but it dismissed their suit, saying they had no standing to sue because they had not suffered any injury because of the veto, which at that point Clinton had not exercised.
Since then, the president has canceled 82 items in 11 laws.
One was a Medicaid tax benefit to New York City, which challenged the law, claiming it was injured by the veto.
The Snake River Potato Growers and an officer of the Idaho group also sued, saying they were injured by Clinton's veto of a tax measure that would have allowed agricultural processors to defer capital-gains taxes when they sell their plants to farmers' cooperatives.
In February, a U.S.
District Court here ruled the line-item veto unconstitutional, saying Congress violated the Constitution's separation of powers clause by delegating such authority to the president.
On Thursday, the high court agreed.
Stevens acknowledged the ``profound importance'' of the case, saying, ``The court expresses no opinion about the wisdom of the act's procedures and does not lightly conclude that the actions of the Congress that passed it, and the president who signed it into law, were unconstitutional''.
In their arguments before the court, lawyers for the challengers said that no matter when a president changes the spending bill or for what reasons, the bottom line is that what takes effect was not passed by both chambers of Congress, as required by the Constitution.
In his argument for the Clinton administration, U.S.
Solicitor General Seth Waxman contended that a line-item veto would not actually repeal part of a law but would be a presidential exercise of spending authority delegated by Congress.
Stevens was joined in his opinion by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Justices Stephen Breyer, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia dissented.
Breyer's dissent said that while the Line Item Veto Act ``skirts a constitutional edge...
it does not violate any basic separation of powers principle''.
In other major decisions Thursday, the court ruled: By a 6-3 vote that the attorney-client privilege does not end with the death of the client.
It thus blocked Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's attempt to obtain notes taken by James Hamilton, the lawyer for deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster Jr.
nine days before Foster committed suicide in July 1993.
That the government can deny cash grants to artists because their work is considered indecent, saying the policy does not violate artists' free-speech rights.
The 8-1 decision said the National Endowment for the Arts can consider decency, as well as artistic merit, in deciding who gets public money for the arts.
That HIV-infected people are protected by a federal ban on discrimination against the disabled even if they suffer no symptoms of AIDS.
The 5-4 ruling ordered a lower court to reconsider whether a Maine dentist violated the Americans With Disabilities Act when he refused to fill an HIV-infected woman's tooth in his office .
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) --A U.S. district judge Thursday declared the president's line-item veto authority unconstitutional.
Judge Thomas Hogan ruled that the law --which gives the president the power to strike items from tax and spending measures without vetoing the entire bill -- violates the traditional balance of powers between the various branches of government "The Line-Item Veto Act is unconstitutional because it impermissibly disrupts the balance of powers among the three branches of government," said Thomas Hogan.
However, Hogan's ruling will likely not be the final word in the case.
The issue is likely to be decided ultimately by the Supreme Court.
The line item veto, strongly supported by President Bill Clinton and a number of his predecessors, was passed in 1996 under the Republican Party's "Contract with America" policy document.
Clinton became the first president to use the power by vetoing a series of small items last August, exercising the veto power 82 times last year, striking 1.9 billion dollars in spending projected over five years.
Clinton said he was disappointed in the court decision but, "It is my belief that ultimately the line-item veto will be ruled constitutional by the U.S.
Supreme Court".
The case was initiated by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, challenging the president's unprecedented authority to reject specific sections of spending bills without vetoing the entire measure.
Hogan ruled that Congress may not "delegate its inherent lawmaking authority".
New York City maintains it was unfairly targeted by Clinton when he canceled a section of the federal budget bill that would have let the city and state raise taxes on hospitals and pass those charges along to the federal government in the form of Medicaid billings.
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) --The U.S.
Justice Department Friday appealed the Supreme Court a federal judge's decision striking down the presidential line-item veto.
The Supreme Court is expected to accept the appeal, hear argument and rule on the line-item veto's constitutionality before the end of the term in late June or early July.
The line-item veto law, which took effect in January 1997, allows the president to veto selected budget items five days after signing a bill.
Congress may override a line-item veto by a simple majority vote.
But if the president vetoes the simple majority override, a two-thirds majority is needed to override after that.
The law was challenged last year by a group of mostly Democratic senators, but the Supreme Court dismissed the challenge, saying President Bill Clinton had not yet used the selective veto and therefore the group had no standing to bring suit.
But another group of challengers, led by New York State, filed suit, contending that the line-item veto is unconstitutional.
New York had standing because one of Clinton's line-item vetoes struck out extra Medicare funding for the state.
Earlier this month, U.S.
District Judge Thomas Hogan struck down the line-item veto law, saying it "impermissibly upsets the balance of powers so carefully prescribed by (the Constitution's) framers".
In its appeal, the Justice Department argues that the new challengers also do not have standing to challenge the law, and that in any case the law is in line with the historic relationship between Congress and the president.
WASHINGTON, April 11 (Xinhua) --U.S.
President Bill Clinton said Friday he will appeal a federal judge's ruling that struck down a law giving the president the power to veto specific items in bills passed by Congress.
Clinton said that he was "disappointed".
"I intend to appeal it," Clinton said of the ruling.
"We ought to give the Supreme Court a chance to have their say on it".
"I think the line-item veto is very important in helping to preserve the integrity of federal spending and I hope very much we can sustain it and we have to appeal it," Clinton told reporters as he was leaving a meeting with newspaper editors from around the nation.
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his decision late Thursday overturning the Line-Item Veto Act, a new and still-unused law that carried enormous significance for federal spending and the balance of power in government.
The law, passed by Congress last year, allowed the president for the first time to veto particular items in spending bills and certain limited tax provisions passed by Congress.
Previously, the president could only veto entire bills.
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) --The Justice Department is planning to appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court after a federal judge struck down the line-item veto Thursday as unconstitutional.
President Bill Clinton said he was "disappointed" by the ruling, but expressed confidence the line-item law eventually will be upheld by the Supreme Court.
Under the law, which took effect in January 1997, the president has five days after signing a bill to cancel some of its appropriations, or cancel special tax breaks seen as applying to small numbers of people.
Congress could overturn all or some of the line-item vetoes on a majority vote in a "disapproval bill," but if the president then vetoes that bill, it would require a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and Senate to override.
In his Thursday ruling, U.S.
Judge Thomas Hogan struck down the law as unconstitutional on the basis of the separation of powers among the three branches of government.
New York, among others, had brought this latest challenge to the law when a line-item veto by Clinton last year deprived the state of extra federal funds for Medicaid --the federal health insurance program covering poor, elderly and disabled Americans.
The White House later worked out an agreement giving New York much of the money.
The state was joined in its challenge by Idaho potato farmers, who also lost out on funding because of a line-item veto.
Clinton joined congressional Republicans in campaigning for the line-item veto authority, but he used it relatively sparingly in its first full year.
In a brief written statement Thursday, Clinton said, "The line-item veto provides an important tool for the president to strike unnecessary spending and tax items from legislation."
UNDATED: Many of the tears being shed on Capitol Hill after the Supreme Court's rejection of the presidential line-item veto may be crocodile tears.
As fiscal experiments go, it may have cost even its staunchest supporters more in political capital than it saved in tax money.
Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies for the Cato Institute, estimates the savings from presidential line-item vetoes at $2 billion over five years.
Given that federal spending will be about $9 trillion during this time, $2 billion hardly amounts to a rounding error in Washington's grand fiscal scheme of things.
It wouldn't, for that matter, amount to more than a small percentage of the net worth of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.
To be sure, most Americans consider $2 billion a lot of money.
Most, however, don't think about such a huge sum in the context of how many taxpayer-hours must be worked to generate $2 billion in tax revenues.
The magnitude of federal spending is so large that average folks can't relate to the size of its expenditures in a practical way.
Moreover, as Moore points out, the savings achieved so far has been mostly from pork appropriations.
This makes the political calculus of the line-item veto a tricky proposition.
On the one hand, pork-barrel spending is traditionally reviled as the most cynically deployed and least utilitarian form of largess.
On the other hand, it's immensely popular with those who get it.
This is why legislators on both sides of the aisle use it to buy votes and reward allies.
Moore laments the fact that the president won't get to wield the item veto on this year's highway bill, which he sees as a monument to both pork and the need it creates for the line-item veto.
The bill contains a record 1,500 pork projects, Moore says, or about ``three slabs of bacon'' for each congressional district.
One person's pork, however, is another's economic sustenance, which is why so many Americans enthusiastically embrace this particular form of wealth redistribution, even though they profess contempt for it.
Although the line-item veto was a priority in the GOP's ``Contract With America,'' enthusiasm for it probably has waned even among its hard-core Republican supporters.
The degree of residual support will become more evident when congressional champions of the concept begin their push to try to change the law in a way the courts will find constitutional.
The response will be a good gauge of how many in Congress think it's a luxury they can afford and still get re-elected.
Have you ever wondered what forms the more egregious examples of pork take?
Moore lists a few worth pondering.
This year's budget, for instance, contained nearly $300,000 for research on how to enhance the flavor of roasted peanuts and $150,000 for the National Center for Peanut Competitiveness.
Some $250,000 was appropriated for research on pickles.
New Orleans got $2 million to refurbish a streetcar named Desire.
Some may find this outrageous, but remember: The areas where such money will be spent hail the winning of such largess as a boon to the local economy.
Business, civic and political leaders in Kansas City and elsewhere put a high premium on their legislators bringing home the bacon.
This is why some fiscal conservatives may be secretly breathing a sigh of relief and thanking the Supremes.
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) --U.S.
President Bill Clinton today used his line-item veto authority to have trimmed 144 million U.S. dollars from a 248 billion dollars defense spending bill.
Clinton vetoed 13 relatively obscure research and spending programs, almost all the military spending increases approved by Congress.
The new vetoes came weeks after he vetoed 287 million dollars from a separate 9.2 billion dollars military construction bill.
The cuts included 39 million dollars that would have kept the remaining three SR-71 Blackbird spy planes flying.
Pentagon said that the SR-71 was no longer needed because of the capabilities of spy satellites, improved U-2 reconnaissance aircraft and unmanned robot planes.
Other cuts included 30 million dollars that would have financed research on tracking and intercepting asteroids before they collide with earth, 3 million dollars for microsurgery research and 3 million dollars for an underwater noisemaking device.
The veto list names five Republican congressional districts as being affected compared to two Democrat.
Lawmakers added 750 projects to the defense appropriations bill that were not in Clinton's original defense spending plan.
All but 13 of those survived the line-item veto.
The veto list names five Republican congressional districts as being affected compared to two Democrat.
Some lawmakers now threatened to consider repealing the line-item veto law, passed only last year as a budget-balancing measure.
President Clinton lost one and won one at the U.S.
Supreme Court on Thursday.
The Line Item Veto Act was struck down.
And the court upheld the principle that death does not unravel the confidentiality of communication between attorney and client.
The American people won in both cases.
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion for a court divided 6-to-3 in the line item veto case (Clinton vs.
City of New York).
Stevens focuses solely on the Presentment Clause _ Article I, Section 7 of the U.S.
Constitution: ``Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the president of the United States; if he approves he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with objections to that House in which it shall have originated ''....
Returning a bill is a veto.
Congress can only override a presidential veto by a two-thirds majority vote in each house.
Stevens notes that the act has allowed the president to amend laws passed by Congress by repealing portions of those laws.
He writes: ``There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the president to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes''.
Stevens is deferential to Congress and the president in the opinion: ``... we express no opinion about the wisdom of the procedures authorized by the Line Item Veto Act.
... ``The text of the act was itself the product of much debate and deliberation in both Houses of Congress and that precise text was signed into law by the President.
We do not lightly conclude that their action was unauthorized by the Constitution''.
The high court found it unnecessary to address a second issue raised by the lower federal court when it found the act unconstitutional _ that the line item veto disrupts the balance of powers between the legislative and executive branch.
Stevens writes: ``... our decision rests on the narrow ground that the procedure authorized by the Line Item Veto Act are not authorized by the Constitution''.
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a stinging dissent in which he was joined by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and in part by Justice Stephen Breyer.
In short, Scalia doesn't think that the Line Item Veto Act violates the Presentment Clause of the Constitution.
Scalia is a master sophist; he plays word games.
Under the act, after both houses of Congress have passed a bill, the president can sign it and then cancel portions.
To Scalia the chronology of events is pivotal, not the central meaning of the clause.
He writes in his dissent: ``It was only after the requirements of the Presentment Clause had been satisfied that the president exercised his authority under the Line Item Veto Act to cancel the spending item''.
Fortunately, Scalia is in the minority on this issue.
Under any reading of the Constitution, the act is unconstitutional.
A president's authority to amend or repeal a law is neither enumerated nor implied by the Constitution.
Quite simply, such presidential powers do not exist _ unless Congress chooses to amend the Constitution to give presidents that power, and three-fourths of the state legislatures agree.
The current problem, however, is that the 82 spending items that Clinton cancelled using the unconstitutional law are no longer cancelled.
New York City can now expect $2.5 billion in federal funds for its Medicaid program.
And what was once a balanced budget with a surplus is no longer.
In the attorney-client confidentiality case, Clinton won.
Back in July 1993, White House aide Vincent Foster Jr.
met with his attorney James Hamilton for two hours regarding the controversy concerning the White House travel office and firing employees there.
Hamilton took handwritten notes during the meeting.
Nine days later Foster committed suicide.
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr wanted those notes to further his investigation into allegations that White House aides or first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had lied under oath.
Starr claimed that when Hamilton's client died, the confidentiality of the attorney-client privilege died with it.
Fortunately for everyone, Starr lost.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the opinion for the 6-to-3 majority (Swidler &AMP; Berlin and Hamilton vs.
United States): ``Knowing that communication will remain confidential even after death encourages the client to communicate fully and frankly with counsel.
While the fear of disclosure, and the consequent withholding of information from counsel, may be reduced if disclosure is limited to posthumous disclosure in a criminal context, it seems unreasonable to assume that it vanishes altogether.
Clients may be concerned about reputation, civil liability, or possible harm to friends or family.
Posthumous disclosure of such communications may be as feared as disclosure during the client's lifetime''.
Starr had argued that the attorney-client privilege should not prevent disclosure of confidential communications if the client has died and the information is relevant to a criminal procedure.
Not so, according to Rehnquist.
Only two lower court decisions support Starr's argument.
Most assume the privilege.
The chief justice concludes, ``... the independent counsel has simply not made a sufficient showing to overturn the common law rule embodied in the prevailing caselaw''.
Starr was looking only at his target and not the implications for society.
This privilege is too significant to be eroded by the independent counsel's suspicions of wrongdoing.
Had the high court's decision gone the other way, think of the ambitious prosecuting attorneys who might feel free to rifle through communications between dead defendants and their attorneys fishing for accomplices and other crimes.
Think of what the erosion of this privilege might do to the weaker privilege of confidentiality between doctor and patient, or to the necessary confidentiality between priest and confessional.
Then consider the likely impact on our society.
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) --The U.S.
Supreme Court Thursday struck down as unconstitutional the line-item veto law that lets the U.S.
President strike out specific items in tax and spending measures.
The high court's 6-3 decision said the law violates that part of the Constitution requiring every bill to be presented to the president for his approval or veto.
The court said that type of line-item veto can be authorized only through a constitutional amendment.
The line-item veto law was challenged by New York City and an Idaho potato growers' group after provisions they sought were vetoed by President Bill Clinton.
Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, the authority sought by nearly every president this century as a tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
Congress voted in 1996 to give the president such authority, and Clinton used the veto 82 times last year.
A federal judge ruled the line-item veto unconstitutional in February, saying Congress could not delegate such authority to the president.
The line-item veto law let the president sign a bill and within five days go back to reject specific spending items or tax breaks in it.
Congress then could reinstate the item by passing a separate bill.
Opponents of the line-item veto argued that once a law is signed by the president, it can be changed only in the way prescribed by the Constitution for enacting a law --a congressional vote followed by the president's signature.
Once the president has exercised a line-item veto, the final law would not be the same as the measure approved by Congress.
The Clinton administration contended a line-item veto would not actually repeal part of a law, but would be a presidential exercise of spending authority delegated by Congress.
The Supreme Court said the administration and the veto law's backers in Congress were wrong.
Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens concluded that "the procedures authorized by the line-item veto act are not authorized by the Constitution".
In ruling the line-item veto law unconstitutional last February, U.S.
District Judge Thomas F.
Hogan said it amounted to a surrender by Congress of an "inherently legislative function" to the president.
Once a bill becomes law, the president's sole duty is to carry it out, the judge said.
The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld that ruling.
WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Thursday dealt a blow to the power of U.S. presidents, striking down as unconstitutional a law that enabled chief executives to delete individual funding items from massive budget legislation.
In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act violated the constitution's separation of powers between Congress, which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it into law or vetoes it.
The president, however, has no authority to erase individual provisions in legislation, the justices said.
``Although the Constitution expressly authorizes the president to play a role in the process of enacting statutes, it is silent on the subject of unilateral presidential action that either repeals or amends parts of duly enacted statutes,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the majority.
``There are powerful reasons for construing constitutional silence on this profoundly important issue as equivalent to an express prohibition''.
President Clinton issued a statement saying he was ``deeply disappointed'' by the Supreme Court's ruling, which he called ``a defeat for all Americans.
``It deprives the president of a valuable tool for eliminating waste in the federal budget and for enlivening the public debate over how to make the best use of public funds,'' Clinton added.
However, Rep.
David Skaggs, D-Colo.
, who joined House and Senate colleagues in waging an unsuccessful challenge to the law last year, said he feels vindicated.
``Thank goodness the Supreme Court has saved Congress from itself,'' Skaggs said.
``The court has restored an absolutely central provision to our constitutional balance: that Congress writes the laws and can't give that power and responsibility away''.
Under the controversial statute, a president could _ after signing a budget bill into law _ unilaterally strike individual funding sections of the measure.
Congress could create a separate bill to restore the deleted provisions with a majority vote of both the House and Senate.
However, the high court said the law violates the Constitution's ``single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure'' for the enactment of laws.
That process requires the president to approve or reject legislation in full, whereas the Line Item Veto Act impermissibly allowed him to strike legislation piecemeal, the justices added.
``If the Line Item Veto Act were valid, it would authorize the president to create a different law _ one whose text was not voted on by either house of Congress or presented to the president for signature,'' Stevens wrote.
``If there is to be a new procedure in which the president will play a different role in determining the final text of what may become a law, such a change must come not by legislation but through the amendment procedures set forth in...
the Constitution''.
Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony M.
Kennedy, David H.
Souter and Clarence Thomas joined Stevens' opinion.
Kennedy, in a concurring opinion, took a swipe at Congress for what he characterized as its cowardly attempt to surrender to the president by statute its primary authority to raise and spend federal funds.
``Failure of political will does not justify unconstitutional remedies,'' Kennedy wrote.
``Abdication of responsibility is not part of the constitutional design''.
Dissenting Justice Antonin Scalia, taking the unusual and intense step of reading part of his dissent from the bench, defended the law as a legitimate exercise of Congress' constitutional prerogative.
Lawmakers who dubbed the law the Line Item Veto Act ``succeeded in faking out the Supreme Court'' because the statute does not give the president new veto authority, Scalia said.
Instead, the law merely allows presidents to continue what they have always done by exercising executive discretion to spend or not spend money Congress has appropriated.
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen G.
Breyer joined Scalia's dissent.
The case the high court decided, Clinton vs.
New York City, marked the second time the justices considered the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act, which went into effect in January 1997.
Last year, the court rejected a challenge from senators and representatives who said the statute violated the authority of Congress to write laws.
The high court said the lawmakers lacked standing to bring the challenge because they suffered no injury as a result of the law's enactment.
In this year's case, the court _ over an objection from Scalia _ said New York City and Idaho potato farmers could challenge the law's constitutionality after Clinton eliminated sections of funding legislation that would have benefited the city and farmers.
&QL; (STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; &QL; In New York's case, Clinton struck a section of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act that would have relieved the city's Health and Hospitals Corp.
of having to pay millions of dollars in retroactive tax liability.
With regard to the Idaho group, the president eliminated a provision of the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act that would have given potato farmers a capital gains tax break in purchasing a processing facility.
&QL; XXXX END OF STORY &QL;
WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Congress violated the principle of separation of powers when it gave the president the power to cut individual projects from tax and spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation.
In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress.
The court also said the 1996 measure authorized the president to issue what were, in practical terms, partial vetoes.
The only way such vetoes can be authorized is through a constitutional amendment, the justices said.
In passing the law, Congress said the president could cancel individual items in tax and spending bills within five days of signing them into law.
Congress, however, was allowed to try to reinstate the items by having both houses pass them in separate bills.
Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, an authority sought by nearly every chief executive this century as a tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
But Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said the law ``authorized the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing Article 1 procedures''.
Article 1 of the Constitution established the principle of separation of powers among the three branches of government.
Stevens concluded that the 1996 act ``may or may not be desirable, but it is surely not a document'' that is constitutional.
A year ago, the justices heard a challenge to the act brought by six members of Congress, but it dismissed their suit, saying the)i~ZY/ZW xRT}Zma-TRrq &AMP;W:uY P;u;8\xj3'6jC
The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 26: In a sound and much-needed decision, the Supreme Court has rejected the line-item veto as a departure from the basic constitutional requirement that presidents accept or reject bills in their entirety.
The 6-3 decision, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, firmly cast aside government arguments that in canceling specific lines of the budget the president was merely exercising authority delegated to him by Congress.
Instead the court found that the line-item veto violates the ```presentment clause'' of Article I.
That clause establishes the process by which a bill becomes law.
It is unfortunate that the majority opinion rests solely on the procedural problem, never reaching the more profound constitutional defect.
The line-item veto is an affront to the separation of powers and an abrogation of responsibility by Congress.
That issue, however, did get addressed eloquently in Justice Anthony Kennedy's concurring opinion.
``By increasing the power of the president beyond what the Framers envisioned,'' Kennedy wrote, ``the statute compromises the political liberty of our citizens, liberty which the separation of powers seeks to secure''.
In contrast to this solid constitutional reasoning, the court veered off course with a dangerous 8-1 ruling that found no First Amendment violation in congressional efforts to control the National Endowment for the Arts.
The law in question ordered the NEA to consider ``general standards of decency'' when making grants.
Conveniently misinterpreting the statue, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor deemed its restrictive instructions to be merely ``an advisory opinion''.
In a powerful dissent, Justice David Souter scorched that unrealistically benign view of what he aptly called ``a statutory mandate to deny recognition to virtually any expression capable of causing offense in any quarter''.
Some of the justices who joined the majority may have been motivated by a desire to help protect the NEA from further congressional attacks.
But in all likelihood this ruling will simply embolden enemies of government funding for the arts. &QL;
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) --The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to hear argument and decide the constitutionality of the president line-item veto.
Earlier this month, a federal judge struck down the line-item veto law as unconstitutional, but the administration has appealed that ruling directly to the Supreme Court, as mandated by Congress.
The highest court's review will yield by late June what could be a momentous balance-of-powers ruling.
The case is scheduled to be argued before the justices on April 27.
In 1996, the Republican-led Congress voted to provide the president with the unprecedented power of canceling specific items in spending and tax legislation, considered a key to fighting wasteful "pork-barrel" projects.
The law took effect in January 1997, and Clinton used the line-item veto 82 times last year, but Congress is expected to restore 38 of those items with two-thirds majority votes in both the House of Representatives and Senate.
U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan said the 1996 law wrongly "crosses the line between acceptable delegations of rule-making authority and unauthorized surrender to the president of an inherently legislative function; namely, the authority to permanently shape laws and package legislation".
In the appeal acted on Friday, Justice Department lawyers argued that Congress did not let the president unlawfully usurp its power.
The line-item veto was challenged last year by a group of mostly Democratic senators, but the challenge was dismissed by the Supreme Court.
This term's challengers are led by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Idaho farmers.
Giuliani is seeking to restore a provision of last summer's budget-balancing bill that would have let the city and New York state raise taxes on hospitals and use the money to attract federal Medicaid payments.
The Snake River Potato Growers sued over a Clinton veto of farm cooperative subsidies.
ELLICOTT CITY, Md.
(AP) --Maryland's wiretapping case against Linda Tripp came to an official end Wednesday as a Howard County judge dismissed the indictment of the central figure in the impeachment of President Clinton.
State prosecutors said last week they would ask Circuit Court Judge Diane Leasure to dismiss the case because of insufficient evidence.
Tripp was indicted last July for illegally taping phone conversations with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
The tapes were used in the investigation that led to the impeachment of the president.
Leasure ruled in December that only one tape could be used in the case because of immunity granted to Tripp by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
Then, in May, the judge ruled that most of Lewinsky's testimony was tainted and inadmissible.
That left prosecutors unable to prove that the call took place before Tripp's immunity took effect.
WASHINGTON _ They were close friends, so close that the younger woman could confide in the older woman some of her most intimate secrets about a dangerous affair she was having with a married man.
And the older woman did not hesitate to pass on some motherly advice.
It was Linda Tripp who recommended to Monica Lewinsky that she hang on to the now infamous blue dress stained from an encounter with the president, Lewinsky testified.
``And she told me that I should put it in a safe deposit box because it could be evidence one day,'' Lewinsky said.
``And I said that was ludicrous because I would never _ I would never disclose that I had a relationship with the president.
I would never need it''.
Although no transcripts of her tapes or testimony were included in Monday's document release, Tripp recorded more than 40 telephone conversations with Lewinsky, 38 times on her own and twice while cooperating with the FBI.
Copies of some e-mail messages between the two friends were included in the 2,800 pages of material released Monday with the videotape of Clinton's testimony.
In chatty, even schoolgirlish electronic messages, Lewinsky and Tripp shared laughs and then lunched regularly as Lewinsky came to rely on Tripp's advice in trying to deal with the ups and downs of her relationship with Bill Clinton.
Once, early in 1997, when Clinton ignored Lewinsky for a time, Lewinsky e-mailed Tripp of her worries about the relationship.
``Thank God for you''! she wrote to Tripp.
``I don't know what I'm going to do.
I just don't understand what went wrong, what happened?
How could he do this to me''?
Tripp wrote back with reassurance: ``Do not despair, there is most definitely light at the end of this tunnel''.
Tripp also collected newspapers containing a Valentine message that Lewinsky wrote for the president.
``It read beautifully,'' Tripp complimented Lewinsky.
``Placement was great, typeface totally effective and text superlative. . . good job''.
When Lewinsky returned from a vacation shortly after the ad's publication, she wrote to Tripp, ``Hi.
I missed you''!
(with four exclamation points).
On another occasion, Lewinsky complained that Clinton failed to call even though ``the Babba,'' her name for Hillary Rodham Clinton, was out of town.
``HHHEEELLPPP''!!!! she wrote to Tripp.
But it was during these intimacies when Tripp may have been plotting to turn on the younger woman, according to Lewinsky.
Tripp has said she did not set out to betray Lewinsky and was only trying to do the right thing.
But Tripp had already befriended book agent Lucianne Goldberg to peddle an account of Tripp's last moments with Vincent Foster, the deputy White House counsel who shot himself in 1993.
(Tripp was the last of his co-workers to see him alive).
Tripp took copious notes on her phone conversations with Lewinsky in handwritten pages torn from a small, spiral notebook.
One notation Tripp made reads: ``6:00 ()? night he called at home _ come over.
romantic. If I win in Nov.
I'll have you back like that! fooled around.
phone call from Dick Morris _ (oral sex) on phone.
Harold came in _ she went out and never (got a) goodbye''.
Even when they had a falling out over what to tell investigators in the Paula Jones lawsuit, Lewinsky tried to maintain the friendship and, unaware of the depth of Tripp's betrayal, ask for her help in concealing the affair.
In her testimony, Lewinsky repeatedly refers to Tripp's intention to ``rat on me'' to lawyers for Paula Jones.
By January of this year, she had become suspicious of Tripp, Lewinsky testified, but thought she still had a chance of persuading her to keep mum about the affair with the president in any testimony in the Jones suit.
They arranged to meet for lunch at a mall.
Tripp was beginning to see Lewinsky's point of view, or so she thought.
``She was late.
I saw her come down the escalator.
And as I, as I walked toward her, she kind of motioned behind her and (two government agents) presented themselves to me,'' Lewinsky testified.
Tripp had set her up, claiming it was for her own good, Lewinsky said.
``She said that they had done the same thing to her and she tried to hug me, and she told me this was the best thing for me to do''.
Afterward, Lewinsky made it plain in her testimony to the independent counsel how she feels about Tripp.
At the end of her Aug.
20 testimony, Lewinsky is asked by a grand juror if there is anything she wanted to add or clarify.
Lewinsky said she wanted to make sure jurors knew that no one asked her to lie and that she was not promised a job for her silence.
``And that I'm sorry,'' she added, beginning to cry.
``I'm really sorry for everything that's happened.
``And I hate Linda Tripp''.

WASHINGTON (AP) --A federal judge ordered the White House on Monday to retrieve e-mails from President Clinton and the first lady and 31 presidential aides concerning the FBI files controversy, Linda Tripp and presidential accuser Kathleen Willey.
In a lawsuit brought by a conservative group, U.S.
District Judge Royce Lamberth ordered e-mails produced within 20 days in the case of hundreds of appointees from the Reagan and Bush administrations whose FBI background files were gathered by the Clinton White House.
While calling for a search of White House computer archives, Lamberth said he will deal later with the problem that 100,000 or more e-mails were not archived and are being reconstructed from computer back-up tapes.
The conservative group, Judicial Watch, is trying to prove that the Clinton administration routinely attacked its political enemies by using confidential material protected by the Privacy Act.
The judge is allowing the conservative group to delve into two side issues --the use of information from Linda Tripp's personnel file at the Pentagon and the White House's release of personal letters of presidential accuser Kathleen Willey.
ANNAPOLIS, Md.
(AP) --A prosecutor does not have to release a summary of documents and witnesses he used to persuade a grand jury to indict Linda Tripp on wiretapping charges, the state's highest court has ruled.
The Court of Appeals on Tuesday overturned a judge's order involving State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli.
A conservative legal group, Judicial Watch, had argued for the material to be made public alleging that political pressure from the Clinton administration drove the grand jury to investigate whether Ms.
Tripp broke Maryland law by recording phone conversations with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
However, public information law ``does not trump or override the traditional rule of grand jury secrecy,'' according to the opinion written by Chief Justice Robert Bell.
Tripp was indicted in July on charges of illegally taping a December 1997 phone conversation with Ms.
Lewinsky and for illegally directing her attorney to disclose its contents to Newsweek magazine.
No trial date has been set.
The Tripp tapes were the basis for Kenneth Starr's investigation into President Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
WASHINGTON (AP) --Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr came under increased criticism Wednesday as a Democratic senator questioned his conduct of the Monica Lewinsky investigation.
The Justice Department also has advised Starr it intends to investigate the actions of Starr's office, including the Jan.
16, 1998 offer to Ms.
Lewinsky of an immunity deal conditioned on her not discussing it with her lawyer, Frank Carter.
Another possible area of inquiry: Starr's failure to inform the department that he and others on his staff had contact with lawyers working on Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against President Clinton.
Democrats have suggested a possible conflict and misrepresentation when Starr's prosecutors told the Justice Department they hadn't had any contact with Mrs.
Jones' lawyers.
Those comments by Starr's prosecutors are memorialized in notes taken by participants at a meeting in January 1998 at the Justice Department, when Attorney General Janet Reno was trying to decide whether Starr's office should handle the Lewinsky investigation.
``We've heard a lot about the rule of law recently'' in the impeachment trial, said Democratic Sen.
Tom Harkin.
``How does'' the rule of law ``apply to Ken Starr and the Office of Independent Counsel?
Honesty and truthfulness and the rule of law also applies to those who are cloaked with the authority and the responsibility of enforcing those laws''.
One area that may be of concern to the Justice Department is the contact between Paul Rosenzweig, who is a member of Starr's office, and Philadelphia lawyer Jerome Marcus, who assisted Mrs.
Jones' legal team.
Four days before Linda Tripp's first contact with Starr's office on Jan.
12, 1998, Marcus spoke with Rosenzweig about the Lewinsky allegations, a contact that Starr confirmed in his testimony Nov.
19 to the House Judiciary Committee.
Starr said his office did not act on it that he did not believe the information on Jan.
8, 1998 included any mention of Linda Tripp's name.
In addition, The New York Times has reported that there were several conversations between Marcus and Rosenzweig from November 1997 to January 1998.
There also are questions about the contact between Starr law partner Richard Porter and New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg.
When Mrs.
Tripp was looking for a new attorney, Goldberg called Porter on Mrs.
Tripp's behalf.
The question is whether, through his contact with Goldberg, Porter ended up representing anyone, including Mrs.
Tripp, involved in the case who went to the prosecutor's office.
Depending on precisely what Porter did, Starr could have been barred from taking on the Lewinsky probe because of a conflict-of-interest provision in the law governing appointment of independent counsels.
Excerpts of deposition testimony by Monica Lewinsky and Vernon Jordan, introduced by House prosecutors Thursday: Q: ``... your meeting with Vernon Jordan on Dec.
31, 1997.
Was that to go back and talk about the job again''?
Lewinsky: ``A little bit, but...
for me, the point of that meeting was I had gotten to a point where Linda Tripp wasn't returning my phone calls, and I felt I needed to devise some way ...
to ...
cushion the shock of what would happen if Linda Tripp testified all the facts about my relationship, since I had never disclosed that to the president.
So that was sort of my intention in meeting with Mr.
Jordan, was hoping that I could give a little information and that would get passed on''.
Q: ``And that was at a meeting for breakfast at the Park Hyatt Hotel''?
Lewinsky: ``Yes''.
Q: ``Did you discuss other things, other than Linda Tripp and your job search''?
Lewinsky: ``I think we talked about what each of us were doing New Year's Eve''.
Q: ``Specifically about some notes that you had at your apartment''?
Lewinsky: ``Oh, yes.
That was really in relation to discussing Linda Tripp''.
*----- Jordan: ``There is no question but that through Betty Currie I was acting on behalf of the President to get Ms.
Lewinsky a job.
... ``I think, congressman, if in fact the president of the United States' secretary calls and asks for a request, that you try to do the best you can to make it happen.
... ``I interpreted it as a request from the president.
... ``There was no question that he asked me to help and that he asked others to help.
I think that is clear from everybody's grand jury testimony''.
*----- Jordan: ``The fact is I was running the job search, not Ms.
Lewinsky, and therefore, the companies that she brought or listed were not of interest to me.
I knew where I would need to call''.
*----- Q: ``You're acting in behalf of the president when you are trying to get Ms.
Lewinsky a job, and you were in control of the job search''?
Jordan: ``Yes''.
*----- Q: ``And on either of these conversations that I've referenced, that you had with the president after the witness list came out, your conversation on 12-7 and your conversation sometime after the 11th, did the president tell you that Ms.
Monica Lewinsky was on the witness list in the Jones case''?
Jordan: ``He did not''.
*----- Q: ``Would you have expected the president to tell you if he had any reason to believe that Ms.
Lewinsky would be called as a witness in the Paula Jones case''?
Jordan: ``That would have been helpful''.
Q: ``...
So it would have been helpful, and it was something you would have expected''?
Jordan: ``Yes''.
Q: ``...
And yet, according to your testimony, the president did not so advise you of the fact that Ms.
Lewinsky was on the witness list despite the fact that he had conversations with you on two occasions, on 12-7 and 12-11''?
A: ``I have no recollection of the president telling me about the witness list''.
*----- Jordan: ``I was keeping him (the president) informed about what was going on, and so I told him.
... He was obviously interested in it''.
*----- Jordan: ``Mr.
President, she signed the affidavit, she signed the affidavit''.
*----- Jordan: ``It is clear, based on the evidence here, that I was at the Park Hyatt on Dec.
31. So I do not deny, despite my testimony before the grand jury, that on 12-31 that I was there with Ms.
Lewinsky, but I did testify before the grand jury that I did not remember having a breakfast with her on that date, and that was the truth''.
*----- Jordan: ``I am certain that Ms.
Lewinsky talked to me about notes''.
*----- Q: ``(So you) talked to her both about the job and her concern about parts of the affidavit''?
Jordan: ``That is correct.''
WASHINGTON, November 17 (Xinhua) --U.S.
House investigators on Tuesday made public Linda Tripp's secretly recorded tapes of Monica Lewinsky's tales of her affair with U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
The House Judiciary Committee released 22 hours of the tapes, which triggered independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation into the Lewinsky case and led to his report to Congress alleging impeachable offenses by Clinton.
Prior to this, an edited transcript of the tapes was made public in October.
House audio technicians went through the tapes line by line to take out the same material removed from the transcripts.
Tripp secretly recorded the tapes of Lewinsky, talking about her affair with the president, and took the tapes to Starr, sparking his eight-month investigation.
The Judiciary Committee voted in October to launch an impeachment inquiry against Clinton, and Starr will be its first witness on Thursday.
Tripp is now being investigated by a Maryland grand jury for allegedly violating a state law that requires all parties to a conversation to consent to any taping.
ELLICOTT CITY, Md.
(AP) --Maryland prosecutors have asked the federal judge overseeing a grand jury investigation of President Clinton for access to Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings of Monica Lewinsky, a newspaper reported.
State prosecutors filed the request with U.S.
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, unidentified sources told The (Baltimore) Sun on Saturday.
A Maryland grand jury is considering whether Mrs.
Tripp broke Maryland law by recording conversations with Ms.
Lewinsky. If tried and convicted, she could get five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
Ignorance of the law is a valid defense.
Mrs. Tripp turned over the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, triggering the investigation into the former White House intern's affair with President Clinton.
In return, she received a federal grant of immunity from prosecution.
State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli has tried unsuccessfully since July to obtain the tapes, which remain in Starr's custody.
Montanarelli must establish independently that Mrs.
Tripp made the tapes and knew that taping Ms.
Lewinsky without her knowledge was illegal.
Mrs. Tripp has declined to acknowledge publicly whether she made them.
NEW YORK (AP) --Linda Tripp, whose taped conversations with Monica Lewinsky sparked President Clinton's impeachment crisis, has agreed to interviews with NBC's ``Today'' show and CNN's ``Larry King Live''.
Mrs. Tripp's ``Today'' interview, a pre-taped talk with correspondent Jamie Gangel, will air Friday morning shortly after 7:30 a.m.
EST. She'll talk live with King in prime time the following Monday, Feb.
15, CNN said on Monday.
Mrs. Tripp, who worked in the White House counsel's office before being transferred to the Pentagon, befriended Ms.
Lewinsky and got her to talk about her relationship with Clinton while secretly taping their talks.
She's yet to give an extensive interview about the case.
Gangel repeatedly requested the interview over an eight-month period, ``Today'' executive producer Jeff Zucker said.
It was Mrs.
Tripp's choice to do the interview on tape instead of live, and Gangel will speak to her on Thursday, he said.
``I think we're interested in what her thoughts are now that the trial is almost over and how this has affected her life,'' Zucker said.
It's the second big interview on this story landed by ``Today''.
The top-rated morning program featured a Matt Lauer interview with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton shortly after the scandal broke.
Ms. Lewinsky has agreed to speak to ABC's Barbara Walters first, but that interview can't be done until Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr grants permission.
ABC had been hoping to run the interview during the February ``sweeps'' period.
Mrs. Tripp's spokesman, Philip Coughter, was not available for comment.
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) --Former White House intern Monica Lewinsky appeared Thursday in a court in Maryland state of the United States and testified against his former confidant Linda Tripp.
Lewinsky testified that she felt violated to learn Tripp had secretly recorded her intimate conversations about her affair with President Bill Clinton and the telephone talks appeared in a magazine.
"It terrified me," Lewinsky said at a pretrial hearing for Tripp.
"I was concerned about the privacy of my relationship being revealed".
The tapes that revealed her relationship with Clinton had led to the impeachment of President Clinton.
Lewinsky's testimony will determine whether Tripp stands trial on state wiretapping charges.
Lewinsky said she was sure the taped conversation actually took place on December 22, 1997.
The date is crucial to the case against Tripp as she is charged only with making the tape on that date and allowing it to be played for Newsweek magazine although she made more than 20 hours of tapes.
Tripp is charged with one count of making a tape recording of conversation with Lewinsky on December 22 after she had been informed that it was illegal to do so in Maryland and another count of turning that tape to a Newsweek reporter.
If convicted on the two criminal charges, Tripp could face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of 20,000 dollars.
Thursday's testimony was Lewinsky's opportunity to get back at her former friend Tripp.
As the investigation of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr on Cliton's sex scandal wrapped up in 1998, Lewinsky said tearfully that "I hate Linda Tripp" at a federal grand jury testimony.
Tripp, a Pentagon employee, did not appear at the hearing but her son, Ryan Tripp, watched Lewinsky testify.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec.
19: The attempt by a Maryland prosecutor to try Linda Tripp on state wiretapping charges for secretly tape-recording her telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky has revived passions that have been dormant since President Clinton's impeachment trial.
On one side are those who view the pursuit of Mrs.
Tripp as a vindictive selective prosecution designed to punish her for exposing White House misconduct.
On the other side are those who take a dim view of her betrayal of the young woman she befriended and of Kenneth Starr's independent counsel office.
They see her current legal troubles as a matter of poetic justice.
Remove this emotional overlay, however, and the case seems more mundane _ a valid effort to enforce Maryland's privacy law, which prohibits recording telephone conversations without the consent of the person being recorded.
Ignoring such a well-publicized violation would have weakened the statute's deterrent value and made it harder for the state to justify prosecutions of less notorious violations in the future.
As for accusations of political revenge, the case was brought by a special state prosecutor, Stephen Montanarelli, who has a reputation for being nonpartisan.
It remains to be determined whether Mrs.
Tripp's immunity agreement with Starr's office leaves room for the state prosecution.
The prosecutor must show that none of his evidence against her was the result of work by the independent counsel's office after immunity was granted.
That task was made easier last week when the presiding judge ruled that Mrs.
Tripp's immunity applied only to evidence she gave to federal prosecutors after Feb.
19, 1998, rather than a month earlier.
The judge based that decision on a failure by Starr's office to get a court to ratify the agreement immediately.
The timing of the immunity is one of several legal issues that will affect the judge's decision on going to trial.
In fairness to Mrs.
Tripp, an administrative error by Starr's office, if there was one, should not be the determining factor.
&UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR; &QC; ``It was so weird.
It was really weird.
Like really weird''.
_ Monica Lewinsky's vivid description to Linda Tripp of an encounter with ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson.
This is ridiculous.
They're ridiculous.
We're ridiculous.
Why was I so fascinated by the excerpts of conversations between confidante Linda Tripp and blabbermouth Monica Lewinsky as they scrolled across the newswire Friday?
Why was I eagerly sifting through the garbage of these transcripts and then sending choice snippets to colleagues and friends?
TRIPP: Just because you wear a red sweater does not mean you have to wear red lipstick.
LEWINSKY: I understand that.
TRIPP: OK.
I'm just trying to...
LEWINSKY: I wouldn't ever wear red lipstick to see him.
TRIPP: Good.
It ain't exactly Nixon and Haldeman discussing hush money and cover-ups, now is it?
Let's put this in another context.
If you were sitting in a restaurant and Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky were at the next table, having these exact conversations, you'd be rolling your eyes and yelping: ``CHECK''!
Picture it now.
Two unpleasant people, dominating and dragging down the room.
Tripp, sucking on a Marlboro Light and making a circular hand-motion to the waiter, indicating she'd like another vodka tonic for herself and a cosmopolitan for her friend; Lewinsky, seething quietly because they were supposed to share the creme brulee as a split dessert, but Linda totally monopolized the plate.
And they're yapping.
Loudly discussing Monica's older, married boyfriend, the one she calls ``the creep,'' among other nicknames.
They're obsessed.
Pathetic. Annoying.
Obnoxious. Juvenile.
LEWINSKY: And then I'm gonna wear the navy dress I wore to the radio address that still has the (REDACTED) on it for Thanksgiving.
TRIPP: Well, how _ you're what, you're gonna get it cleaned?
LEWINSKY: Yeah.
TRIPP: Oh, God.
LEWINSKY: Well, I mean, like I haven't worn it for a year, you know?
TRIPP: Yeah.
LEWINSKY: It's about time.
Out with the old, you know?
TRIPP: Oh, that's too bad.
LEWINSKY: I know ...
TRIPP: See, I think I would suggest another outfit for the radio address that makes you _ I mean, for the radio address _ for the Thanksgiving that makes you look so beautiful.
LEWINSKY: Well, that dress _ I don't care about pretty; I care about thin.
That's all I care about.
``Check PLEASE''!
I feel as if the entire country should be calling for the check right now, trying to escape as quickly as possible from the hellish feeding trough known as Washington, D.C., where they continue to work themselves into a dither over this stupid affair.
Enough! The legality of the conversations surreptitiously recorded by Tripp still hasn't been established, but the ``public's right to know'' has once again prompted the release of reams of supposed evidence in Kenneth Starr's shameful investigation of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair.
Once again, expect the Clinton camp to emerge as the beneficiaries as the strategy backfires.
Once again, expect an odd groundswell of sympathy and support for the president and especially the first lady in the wake of this release.
Tripp's plotting and Lewinsky's whining does nothing to enhance the argument of those who favor impeachment.
In fact, that prospect seems increasingly ludicrous.
What, the country should be put on hold while government leaders hold hearings in which they'll rehash the minute details of stained dresses, cigars and sexual quirks _ and now these chirpy conversations about lipstick and ``beard burn''?
All those in favor of this entire mess going away forever, say ``Aye''.
All those opposed, drive to the nearest food pantry, unemployment office and/or under-equipped public school and explain to the people there why this Starr investigation is so important.

It seems like everybody has an opinion about Linda Tripp.
Some of the opinions are favorable.
Most are not.
It would appear that Tripp's claim that she's a victim of the Clinton-Lewinsky sex scandal didn't win her much sympathy.
And Tripp's assertion that she epitomizes the ``average American'' didn't go over with average Americans.
I discovered this after writing an anti-Tripp column that found its way into a number of newspapers around the country; reader reaction has been vociferous, to say the least.
The letters and phone calls are still coming in, but readers so far have sided with me by a 3-to-1 ratio.
Actual ``average Americans'' clearly don't have much use for somebody who would tape-record private conversations with a friend and use the tapes to make the friend a target in a criminal investigation.
Which is what Tripp did to Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern who says she had a sexual relationship with President Clinton.
Tripp and New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg _ who said she urged Tripp to record her conversations with Lewinksy _ teamed to expose the matter to the media, to independent counsel Ken Starr and to lawyers representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment lawsuit against the president.
Starr's investigation of sex-and-lies allegations involving Clinton and Lewinsky _ not to mention the accompanying media frenzy _ directly resulted from Tripp's decision to tape her conversations with Lewinksy.
Tripp was one of the instigators of the situation that is supposedly victimizing her.
She set out to implicate her ``friend'' Lewinsky and the president, even going so far as to brief Jones' attorneys to help them ambush Clinton with questions about Lewinsky when the president gave his sworn deposition in the sexual harassment case.
And yet Tripp stood on the steps of the courthouse after testifying before Starr's federal grand jury last month and declared: ``I never, ever asked to be placed in this position''.
Describing herself as ``an average American who found herself in a situation not of her own making,'' Tripp whined about her treatment at the hands of TV comics and ``legions of paid prevaricators''.
I opined that Tripp not only asked to be in the position she's in, she demanded it.
One reader left a message on the voice mail informing me that the column was ``way off base''.
One said the column was ``very bad''.
Tripp is ``taking a very bad rap,'' another said.
``After reading your opinion on Linda Tripp,'' wrote a Pennsylvania reader, ``it is obvious to me you are one of the 90 percent liberal media, reporting things your way and the hell with right, wrong or the USA''.
The naysayers were in the minority, however.
``This was one of the rare times that I've ever agreed with you,'' one like-minded citizen said.
``Right on,'' said another.
``Write more articles like that''.
``I have to agree _ Linda Tripp is no victim by any means,'' wrote a reader from Highland, Ind.
``And this is an average American's point of view: President Clinton is on my time, right now.
Let him do his job.
I don't care who he sleeps with''.
And there was this from a reader in San Luis Obispo, Calif.: ``I thoroughly enjoyed your column on Linda Tripp.
Ken Starr was searching for a deceitful person to help him in his endeavor and he most certainly found one''.
A retired Air Force veteran from Trinity, N.C., added that Tripp ``deserves everything that is thrown at her _ her security clearance should have been pulled, she should be run out of the Pentagon, fired, and barred from ever working for the government again.
... All this taping was about a multimillion-dollar book deal, not the security of this country''.
Goldberg says that Tripp is not hawking a book.
But it's hard to believe that there won't be one, sooner or later.
So here's a question: If she writes a book, who's gonna buy it?

WASHINGTON, October 23 (Xinhua) --A Maryland grand jury investigating Linda Tripp subpoenaed one of her lawyers Friday, demanding that he produce any tape recordings Tripp made of former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Joe Murtha said he would fight the subpoena issued in the Howard County, Maryland, grand jury inquiry being conducted by Maryland prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli.
He is examining whether Tripp broke the state wiretapping law.
Montanarelli does not have any tapes that Tripp made.
They are in the custody of Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
In order to build a wiretapping case, Montanarelli would need to pursue gaining custody of the tapes.
"This is an invasion of the attorney-client privilege and we're going to fight this all the way," The Associated Press quoted Murtha as saying.
The subpoena demands that Murtha appear before the grand jury and produce originals or copies of any tapes containing the voice of Lewinsky.
Tripp's other lawyer, Anthony Zaccagnini, said, "This is another attempt by the prosecutor in Maryland to intimidate Linda Tripp and her lawyers and this latest step is further evidence of the political persecution of our client".
Tripp also is under scrutiny by Starr.
He is investigating whether Tripp lied when she denied making copies of the tapes which triggered Starr's probe of alleged perjury and obstruction in President Bill Clinton's affair with the intern.
Zaccagnini said his client is still cooperating with Starr, as she has been since last January 12, but that cooperation would end immediately if Starr's office targets Tripp.
It was one of those moments that burrows deep into the memory but readily scurries to the surface whenever we hear the name.
Who can forget Linda Tripp standing in front of the TV cameras and assuring the American people: ``I'm you.
'm just like you''.
Just like who?
Not me.
No way.
Frankly, I don't know anyone who's just like Linda Tripp.
I am exceedingly grateful for that.
Linda ``Just Like You'' Tripp now stands accused of a crime, a minor one to be sure: tape-recording a telephone conversation without the other party's knowledge or permission.
But the ramifications were far more serious.
By illegally taping her conversations with ex-friend Monica Lewinsky _ and blabbing about the contents of the tapes to Newsweek magazine and independent counsel Ken Starr _ Tripp almost brought down the president of the United States.
Almost, but not quite.
Which must have been a tremendous disappointment for Tripp and her Clinton-hating pal, New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg.
It was Goldberg, as devotees of the White House sex-and-lies scandal surely recall, who advised Tripp to record those telephone heart-to-hearts in which Lewinsky revealed her sexual encounters with Bill Clinton.
The tapes bought Tripp 15 minutes of fame, a federal immunity deal with the independent counsel's office, an extended visit with Starr's grand jury _ and a long-term role as a punch line in Jay Leno's ``Tonight Show'' monologues.
They also bought her this criminal charge in the state of Maryland, which took exception to her violations of its laws against wiretapping.
A court hearing is being conducted this week to determine if Maryland authorities have sufficient grounds to put Tripp on trial.
Tripp, oddly enough, has been saying that she wants to stand trial because she remains convinced that she did the right thing when she pushed the ``record'' button on her tape machine.
Tripp's son, Ryan Tripp, attended Thursday's court session and was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that he wanted his mom to be tried so that she ``can be completely vindicated''.
Vindication, it would seem, is in the eye of the beholder.
Linda Tripp didn't attend _ ``She's got to work for a living,'' Ryan said _ and so she missed the opportunity to stare down Lewinsky as the president's former, uh, girlfriend testified for the prosecution.
Tripp may get another chance to confront the former White House intern.
Lewinsky will be a key witness if the case goes to trial.
If the case goes to trial is a decision to be made by a judge, as we know, but just about everyone else is allowed to weigh in on another question: Should the case go to trial?
Tripp has her partisans _ I know this because I heard from most of them the last time I disparaged her in print _ and they insist that the criminal proceedings in Maryland amount to nothing more than retaliation for her participation in Starr's investigation of Clinton.
Can't argue with that.
But is the retaliation deserved?
Should Tripp pay some sort of price for breaking an obscure law en route to touching off a scandal that virtually paralyzed the U.S. government for more than a year?
Should she be held accountable for what may have been a massive betrayal of a friend's trust but was merely a technical violation of law?
Tripp is a despicable character, to be sure.
For my money, she's guilty of felonious audacity for making that ``just like you'' comment after her grand jury testimony last year.
Calling herself an ``average American'' was an affront to average Americans, most of whom would never dream of selling out a friend the way that Tripp sold out Lewinsky.
But only the most vengeful Clintonista could believe that Tripp ought to face criminal charges.
The scandal is over.
Clinton beat the rap.
Why dredge it all up again just to prosecute Tripp for, in effect, being a jerk?
I say we'd all be better off if the judge would sentence Tripp to one more year of Leno jokes and let it go at that.

SAN FRANCISCO _ Because she is the coauthor of a best-selling book about women's friendships, people ask Tamara Traeder what she thinks of Linda Tripp and her secret phone tapes.
``When that news got out, you could hear women gasp all over America,'' Traeder said.
``It was and still is a hair-raising thought: your trusted friend taping your phone conversations.
Most women consider their girlfriend relationships as sacred as a confessional''.
Traeder and her coauthor, Carmen Renee Berry, have learned a lot about women's values since ``Girlfriends'' (Wildcat Canyon Press), quietly invaded female America in 1995.
Now in its 27th printing, the paperback just passed the one-million-books mark and has spawned ``The Girlfriends Keepsake Book'' as well as a sequel, ``Girlfriends For Life,'' which will be published this spring.
``One thing you never know as a publisher _ unless you're producing someone like Tom Clancy _ is what book will take off,'' said Roy Carlisle, of Wildcat Canyon's mother ship, Circulus Publishing Group Inc.
in Berkeley, Calif.
``Books that do become really big sellers always articulate some very powerful feeling that is right below the surface of the culture, something not quite in the consciousness.
``That pretty clearly is what happened with `Girlfriends'.
This thing of women's deep friendships is not a kind of fad; it's a serious reality for women in this culture''.
Before they collaborated on their book of essays, interviews and featured quotations, Traeder and Berry ``thought they were special'' because of the high quality of their female friendships.
Both women had been through periods of crisis, loss and change in the early '90s and believed they might not have survived without the love, understanding and support of their closest ``girlfriends''.
Doing the book _ and riding its amazing wave of success _ has shown the authors that they are not at all unique.
``Almost every woman has at least one woman she feels this way about: She's my support; she doesn't judge me; she's always there for me; I trust her completely; I tell her everything,'' Traeder said.
``The letters we've received about the first book just amazed us.
That's why we decided to do `Girlfriends For Life'.
People have written tomes, some five and six pages long, about their friendships.
They're really quite moving''.
Divided into dozens of mini-chapters such as, ``She's As Crazy As I Am'' and ``Helping Us Change (Even When We'd Rather Not),'' ``Girlfriends'' is not a deep book.
But it is as wide as the sea and just as accessible.
Reading anecdotes from other women tends to start a recall-and-analysis process for even the casual peruser.
``Everywhere we go, women keep thanking us for making them think about their friendships and see how blessed they are to have them,'' Traeder said.
Why, given the significance of our female friendships, has so little attention been paid them?
``I think it's because they're usually such easy relationships,'' Traeder said.
``We tend to focus our attention and energy on relationships that are more trouble _ the ones with men, our families, our kids, our co-workers.
When something goes wrong with a girlfriend, it's rare and it's really bad''.
Something like when your girlfriend secretly tapes your most intimate phone conversations, then turns them over to the feds?
``I can't imagine how Monica Lewinsky could ever reconnect or put herself out there again to trust,'' Traeder said.
``For many women, their girlfriends are the healers, the people who help them recover from life's blows, from dramatic changes and problems and bad relationships.
And Linda Tripp wasn't just a girlfriend, she was a mentor, an older woman Monica looked to for help and advice''.
As Traeder and Berry wrote in ``Girlfriends'' in 1995: ``By telling our stories, we learn about relationships.
These stories tell us how to treat each other _ what is acceptable, what is honorable and what is not...
With our girlfriends we peel back many layers of our personalities.
This process is an intimate and, we believe, sacred undertaking.
Anyone who has shown that willingness to expose their darkest secrets or greatest fears to another woman understands the treasure of a trusted girlfriend''.
And anyone who violates that sacred undertaking ought to be impeached _ from the human race.

WASHINGTON _ The woman who alienated all America when she stood on the steps of the Washington District courthouse and said: ``I'm you...an average American,'' emerged Friday from half a year of obscurity to start rebuilding her shattered image.
Linda Tripp, whose clandestine taping of Monica Lewinsky's most intimate confessions won her the label ``most reviled woman in America,'' was back as suddenly as she had vanished.
But it was a new Linda Tripp, so comprehensively ``made over'' as to be almost unrecognizable.
The heavy, clumsy, boxy woman whose ponderous frame inspired Linda Tripp look-alike contests in gay bars across the country has lost weight (a lot), softened her hair and her make-up and revamped her wardrobe.
She is fragile _ breaking down in tears, reportedly, during a two-hour interview with the New York Times _ but largely unrepentant.
Her deepest regret, she said, was the pain she had caused her young friend, Monica.
She said she saw Monica ``as a kid'' and wanted to save her.
``I always saw her as a lost soul,'' she told the paper.
``I believe she and the country will never understand that I believed this was in her best interest, and that makes me very sad''.
By revealing the tapes, she says, she wanted to ``sever'' Monica's relationship with the president once and for all.
``This was a young girl who...fell head over heels in love with the president.
He clearly did not share those feelings, and his callous abuse in discarding Monica Lewinsky made it look as if he thought of her as a servicing contract''.
``As a mom, especially with a daughter close in age to Monica (her daughter is 19),'' she said amid tears, ``I would hope some other mom would do for my daughter what I did for Monica, despite the fact that it looks horrible, that it looks like betrayal''.
The New York Times interview, which appeared Friday, was the first of three, so far announced.
She also appeared Friday on the NBC morning ``Today'' program, and will be on CNN's Larry King Live on Monday.
She insists, however, that she has no plans to write a book, though it was her idea for a book-length expose of scandal in the Clinton White House that inspired her to record her conversations with Monica.
As she told the New York Times, she blames the New York literary agent whom she contacted _ Lucianne Goldberg _ for prompting what are perceived as some of her more egregious acts of betrayal.
It was Goldberg, she said, who suggested she passed her tapes to the independent prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, and Goldberg, who suggested she talk to lawyers representing Paula Jones, the woman suing Clinton for sexual harassment.
(Goldberg had no comment).
Tripp, 49, remains employed by the Pentagon but has worked from home since the Lewinsky affair broke.
The announcement of her ``relaunch'' on the metropolitan media circuit was the surest sign that the 13-month scandal was drawing to a close.

WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) --Linda Tripp, whose secret recording of phone conversations started a White House sex scandal investigation, entered the federal courthouse Tuesday for her third day of testimony.
Mrs. Tripp is reportedly providing a federal grand jury a detailed account of her contact with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Phil Coughter, a spokesman for Tripp's lawyers, says he doesn't know whether this grand jury appearance will be her last in the investigation of possible perjury, obstruction and witness tampering.
Independent counsel Kenneth Starr is investigating an alleged presidential affair and cover-up.
Starr's spokesman, Charles Bakaly, said over the weekend that the grand jury has been asking a lot of questions and that Starr is moving the probe along as quickly as possible.
Tripp testified last Tuesday and Thursday before the grand jury.
The probe was triggered by Tripp's 20 hours of secretly recorded phone calls with Lewinsky in which the former intern confided an alleged affair with President Bill Clinton.
Linda Tripp was a lot easier to take when she was slinking around in Ken Starr's shadow and refusing to comment on his investigation of the president.
She was also a lot easier to ignore, because her self-imposed silence prevented her from standing in front of TV cameras and making statements so outrageous and insulting that they required a response.
But all that changed on Wednesday, when Tripp emerged from her final session of grand jury testimony in the Great Clinton Sex Probe of 1998 and tried to engender public sympathy by passing herself off as a victim.
``I never, ever asked to be placed in this position,'' Tripp declared.
There are any number of people who could honestly claim that they never asked to be involved in the Great Sex Probe.
Bill Clinton never asked.
Monica Lewinsky never asked.
The Secret Service never asked.
Even Starr never asked _ at least not before Tripp took her trash heap of tape-recorded gossip to the independent counsel and left him little choice but to investigate.
The fact is, just about no one asked to be involved in the sex-and-lies scandal that has dominated public discussion in this country for six months.
But Tripp not only invited herself into this mess _ she started it.
It was Tripp who decided to secretly tape conversations with Lewinsky in which Lewinsky talked about an alleged affair with Clinton.
It was Tripp who ultimately tipped off Starr and the news media to the existence of the tapes.
It was Tripp who reportedly baited the perjury trap by providing information about Lewinsky to lawyers in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton.
Tripp didn't ``ask'' to be involved?
Maybe she's right.
She ``demanded'' to be involved.
There are undoubtedly some among the American people who look upon Tripp as a great public servant, or even as a hero, for her role in exposing alleged misconduct by the president and others.
These folks are entitled to their opinion, of course.
And maybe her admirers agreed when Tripp stood on the steps of the federal courthouse in Washington and declared herself the embodiment of the ``average American''.
``I understand that there has been a great deal of speculation about just who I am and how I got here,'' she said.
``Well, the answer is simple.
I'm you.
I'm just like you.
I'm an average American who found herself in a situation not of her own making''.
``I'm you,'' she said.
She's us?
She's an average American?
Here's a news flash.
Average Americans don't tape private conversations with people who are supposed to be their friends; they don't egg friends on when they consider doing something illegal; and they don't encourage federal prosecutors to root through their friends' sex lives.
The average American is not a scheming, back-stabbing, double-dealing creep who would rather indulge some perverse hatred for a politician than help a friend who's clearly in need of help.
Tripp devoted much of her post-testimony statement to whining about the vilification she has endured at the hands of Clintonian spinmeisters, show-business jokemasters and ``legions of paid prevaricators''.
She obviously doesn't think she asked for all that, either.
But she asked for it the minute she set out to discredit a president she despised _ and to do it by betraying the friendship of a young woman who trusted her.
Tripp surely must understand that she volunteered to be a target for vilification.
No one who is inventive enough to touch off a scandal that some say could topple a president could possibly be so naive as to underestimate the price she would pay for doing so.
Linda Tripp is many things _ and those things are good or bad, depending on your point of view _ but one thing she is not is an average American.
And she is not a victim, though she has victimized others.
She would do herself and the rest of us a favor if she would retreat to her previous status: seldom seen and never heard.

COLUMBIA, Md.
(AP) --Linda Tripp is passing the hat to raise money for her legal fees.
Mrs. Tripp, whose recordings of conversations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky led to President Clinton's impeachment, is sending about 20,000 fund-raising letters ``urgently'' asking for contributions to her defense fund, The Washington Post reported Friday.
Her legal bills are already more than $325,000 and ``growing every day,'' Mrs.
Tripp said in the 12-page letter.
She describes herself as ``David up against Goliath'' in fending off the attacks of Clinton's ``disciples'' and ``henchmen''.
Mrs. Tripp, who lives in Columbia, is being investigated by a Maryland grand jury for taping her phone conversations with Ms.
Lewinsky. Maryland law forbids taping another person without their knowledge and consent.
Mrs. Tripp earns $90,767 a year in her Pentagon public affairs job, according to The Post.
WASHINGTON (AP) _ Linda Tripp, whose tape recordings of Monica Lewinsky triggered a criminal investigation of President Bill Clinton, was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury next week, one of Tripp's lawyers said Thursday.
Word of her scheduled appearance comes as special prosecutor Kenneth Starr tries to negotiate agreement for the cooperation of Ms.
Lewinsky, a former White House intern who alleged in conversations with Tripp a presidential affair and cover-up.
Joe Murtha, a Tripp lawyer, said the grand jury subpoenaed Tripp on Thursday.
Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly would not comment.
&UR; MORE
WASHINGTON (AP) --Under criminal investigation in Maryland, Linda Tripp is returning to the Pentagon to a different job than the one she had a year ago when her secret tape-recordings triggered the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
Mrs. Tripp will be a public affairs specialist in the Defense Department's Manpower Data Center, two people familiar with the matter said Monday night.
Mrs. Tripp was informed of the change Monday at the Pentagon in a meeting with her supervisor, Doug Wilson, the principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for public affairs.
Army Col.
Richard Bridges, the Pentagon's director of defense information, confirmed the meeting, but said he had no other information.
Philip Coughter, a spokesman for Mrs.
Tripp, declined to comment.
Until her tapes launched the probe of President Clinton, Mrs.
Tripp was director of the high-profile Joint Civilian Orientation Conference.
The program for the secretary of defense brought together opinion leaders from across the nation to familiarize them with activities of all the military services.
Working from home since the scandal erupted, the 19-year federal employee has had a difficult relationship with her employer, declaring she wanted to remain at her work station at the Pentagon.
The Pentagon concluded her presence would be disruptive to the Defense Department, so she was assigned to put together a training manual from home.
She worked in the White House during the Bush and early years of the Clinton administration.
Mrs. Tripp's tape-recorded phone calls of Ms.
Lewinsky discussing a planned cover-up of her affair with Clinton are the focal point of a probe by a Maryland prosecutor of whether she broke the state wiretapping law.
She says the probe is politically motivated.
Mrs. Tripp's federal immunity from prosecution from independent counsel Kenneth Starr may not save her from the Maryland prosecutor, who is gathering evidence independent of the tapes and her sworn testimony to Starr.
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) --Nearly half of Americans think Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has gone too far investigating President Bill Clinton, while about the same number feel the White House, too, has gone overboard by leaking details on people involved.
A poll by Newsweek magazine released Saturday says 48 percent of the nation believes Starr has exceeded his mandate and should be removed.
The poll also says, however, that 46 percent agree the Clinton administration is obstructing justice and has spent too much time leaking negative information about investigators and witnesses.
Fifty-six percent of those polled believe Linda Tripp's main motivation in secretly taping her conversations with Ms.
Monica Lewinsky was to get attention or make money through a book deal.
WASHINGTON _ Linda Tripp returned to the grand jury room here Thursday and spent nearly seven hours behind closed doors, apparently explaining her motives for secretly recording 20 hours of phone conversations with her ex-friend and former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.
Mrs. Tripp's lawyers and supporters presented the public with a freshly burnished image of Mrs.
Tripp as an honest person motivated only by the truth.
In refuting the suggestion that Mrs.
Tripp betrayed the trust of a vulnerable woman half her age, a person close to Mrs.
Tripp's legal team suggested that Mrs.
Tripp had tried several times last fall to end her friendship with Ms.
Lewinsky, who would sometimes call and e-mail Mrs.
Tripp ``20 times a day''.
Mrs. Tripp, 48, a Pentagon employee, had grown tired of Ms.
Lewinsky's ``constant talk'' of her alleged relationship with President Clinton, the person said.
``Please give me a break,'' Mrs.
Tripp wrote in an e-mail that she sent to Ms.
Lewinsky last October, according to one person familiar with it.
``I can't take this''.
The portrait suggests that Mrs.
Tripp was a reluctant confidante who had grown weary of Ms.
Lewinsky's attempts to discuss her relationship with Clinton and the attempts by lawyers for Paula Jones to quiz both women under oath.
Earlier this week, Mrs.
Tripp told The Washington Post, ``I did not cultivate Monica _ she cultivated me.
Monica is a very worldly person.
She educated me''.
Two people close to Mrs.
Tripp said she is disgusted by the suggestions in the media that she recorded her conversations with Ms.
Lewinsky to try to write a book.
Shortly before 9:30 a.m., Mrs.
Tripp, who was accompanied by two lawyers and a family friend, arrived at the federal courthouse here, saying nothing as she headed to the third floor grand jury room.
Her appearance was met with far less hoopla than her first day on Tuesday, when she was greeted by 300 reporters and a crowd of tourists and onlookers.
After the grand jury recessed for the day, one of her lawyers said that Mrs.
Tripp was ``very encouraged by the quality and the content of the questions presented by the grand jurors and by the prosecutor''.
The lawyer, Joseph Murtha refused to say what questions Mrs.
Tripp had been asked, but said that she would return, at a still-unscheduled date, to continue testifying.
``Over the past several days, many of you have asked the question, how is Linda doing''?
Murtha told reporters on the steps of the federal courthouse.
``Well, if there is any truth in the adage that an honest person's pillow is her peace of mind, I can assure you that Linda Tripp will sleep very well tonight''.
Mrs. Tripp is seen as one of the most important witnesses to appear before the grand jury in the five-month-old inquiry led by independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
Mrs. Tripp brought the 20 hours of tape recordings to Starr's prosecutors on Jan.
12, and told them that Ms.
Lewinsky had encouraged her to lie under oath.
Commentators have said that her appearance is intended to send a message to Ms.
Lewinsky that time is running out for her to strike an immunity deal and cooperate with Starr's inquiry.
If she does not, they say, she almost certainly will be indicted.
Mrs. Tripp, who has very low approval ratings in public opinion polls, is seeking support on her own web site.
``The Official Linda Tripp Web Site'' (http://lindatripp.com) includes an address for Mrs.
Tripp's legal defense fund, reprinted news articles and a chance to send in for the ``I Believe Linda Tripp'' bumper sticker.
In a note accompanied by her smiling photograph, Mrs.
Tripp said, ``In the end, this investigation is not about left or right, it's about right and wrong''. &QL;
WASHINGTON _ The tapes that Linda Tripp secretly made of telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky may not be released next week with other evidence given to Congress by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said Thursday.
Rather than the actual tapes, the Illinois Republican said, the committee may release an edited transcript.
In a series of conversations last year, Lewinsky told Tripp about her White House affair with President Clinton and, allegedly, about attempts to cover it up.
It was Tripp's decision to give Starr the tapes that spurred an eight-month investigation that is now likely to lead to hearings on impeachment.
``Linda Tripp's tapes are very long.
They are very garrulous.
There is a lot of information that really does not pertain to this investigation,'' said Hyde.
``There is information there that really could be embarrassing to innocent people, third parties''.
``We don't want to alter tapes,'' he explained.
``On the other hand, there is information that should be released.
We can redact transcripts of the taped material and release those.
That, so far, seems to be the best way''.
Democrats on Hyde's committee questioned whether the real Republican motive was to withhold evidence that was damaging to Tripp's motives and methods.
``My suspicion is that if Republicans thought the tapes hurt the president, they wouldn't hesitate to release them,'' said Rep.
Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.
Nadler said he hadn't heard the tapes and noted that Starr's report indicated they may have been altered.
If there are questions of authenticity, the FBI should verify the tapes, he said.
``But it makes no sense to release the transcript and not the tape,'' Nadler said.
``You either release both or you don't release either''.
``Can anyone think of a principled justification for releasing the videotape of the president but not the audio tape of Linda Tripp''? asked Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass.
``The Republicans started out saying they were going to treat the president like everybody else.
Well, apparently, Linda Tripp isn't everybody else''.
However, Frank noted that the committee Democrats had opposed last week's massive release of evidence and ``are going to be consistent.
I don't think we're going to be for releasing those tapes either, although obviously the transcript ought to be released''.
(Story can end here.
Optional add follows).
Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla.
, said withholding the Tripp tapes would continue the pattern of partisanship by the committee's majority Republicans.
Although he hadn't heard the Tripp tapes, Wexler said he wants the evidence released but all at once, in a fair manner, rather than being dribbled out.
Both Tripp and Lewinsky had been exiled from White House jobs to the Pentagon, and the tapes reportedly recount Lewinsky confiding her most intimate thoughts with Tripp.
``I'm really sorry for everything that happened,'' a tearful Lewinsky told the grand jury as she finished her testimony.
``And I hate Linda Tripp''.
Indeed, the grand jury testimony, e-mail and other evidence already released by Congress indicates that Tripp practically assembled the case before going to Starr.
It was Tripp, Lewinsky told the grand jury, who was at least partly responsible that the semen-stained Gap dress was never cleaned, thus preserving genetic evidence of the sexual relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky.
Lewinsky said Tripp ``told me that I should put it in a safe deposit box because it could be evidence one day''.
Lewinsky testified that she told her friend that would never happen.
But then ``she told me I looked fat in the dress'' and loaned her a jacket to wear to an event instead, Lewinsky recalled.
Lewinsky also said Tripp urged her not to sign an affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit denying both the affair and obtaining presidential assistance in securing a job.
Lewinsky said she had already signed and misled Tripp about the timing.
Starr has raised suspicions about the audio tapes, noting that some seem to have been altered or copied.
Tripp has denied duplicating or altering the tapes.
It is illegal to tape someone without their knowledge in Maryland, and a state grand jury is investigating the case.
Hyde said that probe would not affect the decision on whether to release the tapes.
``I, frankly, think an impeachment inquiry takes precedence over the grand jury in Maryland,'' he explained.
``The information that should go out should go out, but there's an awful lot there that shouldn't go out''.

NAIROBI, July 22 (Xinhua) --The General Assembly of African Women Educators Forum (AEF) will open in Nanyuki, 200 kilometers north of Nairobi, capital of Kenya on Tuesday.
AEF's 43 members from 26 countries and African education ministers are expected to attend the five-day meeting at Kenya's equatorial town.
The meeting will be preceded by a media workshop involving about 20 journalists and editors who will discuss the role of the media in the effort to educate girls and women in development.
In a statement, the AEF organizer said the AEF is to enhance political commitment towards the goal of "education for all" and urge government donors and non-governmental organizations to invest more in the education sector especially in the education of girls.
NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) --The Kenyan government has launched the phase two of the Strengthening Primary Education (SPRED) project in a bid to increase enrollment rate in primary schools.
The Project was jointly developed by the Kenyan and British governments, and the Overseas Development Authority (ODA) of Britain is scheduled to provide about 30 million U.S.
Dollars to support the project.
At the launching ceremony held on Friday, Kenyan Education Minister Joseph Kamotho said that the enrollment rate in primary schools standing at 95 percent in 1989 declined to about 87 percent last year.
The minister attributed the decline to ineffective teaching methods, wide-spread poverty and poor management of schools.
On the same occasion, British Minister for Overseas Development Lynda Chalker noted that the situation in Kenya's education sector is so critical that only 35 percent of the current seven million school-age children can expect to complete primary education.
She pointed out that "this is a tragic waste of the tremendous potential which every girl and boy has within them".
The project is one of the largest projects ever undertaken by the ODA in the primary education sub-sector throughout the world, the minister stated.
During the phase one already completed, the ODA provided more than seven million Dollars to buy textbooks and science equipment for primary schools in arid and semi-arid areas.
The phase two is aimed at improving the quality of primary education including the training of primary school head teachers throughout the east African country.
According to Kamotho, the training program has already begun and about 800 head masters are undergoing management training courses in various teacher-training colleges.
NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) --A four-day education exhibition, the first of its kind in Kenya, opened here Wednesday at the Kenyatta International Conference Center.
The exhibition, dubbed "Education Expo '99", is aimed at providing a showcase to players in the education sector for their products and services in order to promote the country's educational undertakings.
Exhibitors across Kenya participating in the show include suppliers of educational equipment, publishers, printers and booksellers and others involved in the sector.
On display at the event are books, state-of-the-art training and presentation equipment, audiovisual equipment, classroom facilities and office utilities as well as equipment related to school health care, etc.
French Embassy to Kenyan and the Australian Educational Center also participate in the exhibition and present their products.
During the event, the sponsor will also hold a number of seminars on such topics as drug abuse in school, the youth and AIDS.
NAIROBI, September 18 (Xinhua) --The Kenyan Government has launched a project worth of 34 million U.S.
Dollars for early childhood education program for over one million children, and their parents, a Government official said.
Education Permanent Secretary Simon Lesrima said, "The program targets about 1.5 billion Kenyan pre-school children below the age of six and three million parents, who are below the poverty line".
Simon Lesrima was addressing the launching of the Early Childhood Development Project at the kenya Institute of Education in Nairobi on Tuesday.
Lesrima said the objective of the project which will have five components including teaching training, community capacity building and mobilization, is to improve the health of children in poor households and enhance their access to education.
He directed District Education officers to form District Early Childhood Development Implementation Committees by October 30 to coordinate the project at the grassroots level.
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) --The Kenyan government will provide family life education to children and youth so as to make them ready for responsible parenthood, according to No.
1 Sessional Paper of 1997.
The government will strengthen existing child-youth programs and formulate new plans to deal with reproductive health, adolescent fertility, education and employment, said the paper.
The move aims to help Kenyans under age 24 to solve problems facing them, which are identified as sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS, teenage pregnancies, abortion and drug abuse.
As many as 55 percent of Kenyans are under 18 years old and the Kenyan youth, defined between age 15 and 24, accounts for one-fifth of the total population.
According to the paper, Kenya would make the population problem central to all national development agenda because its population is the greatest asset in the development of natural capital.
NAIROBI, September 22 (Xinhua) --The Kenya government is worried that the high drop-out rates in schools may frustrate its efforts to achieve education for all by 2050.
Daily Nation Newspaper Wednesday quoted a top education official as saying that more students have dropped out in the past decade despite a "substantial increase" in budgetary allocations.
Out of the pupils enrolled in Standard One, only 47 percent complete the primary education; out of these, only 17 percent survive to complete the secondary schooling, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology Wilfred Kimalat said Tuesday.
He said that only seven percent of high-school graduates are lucky enough to go to public universities, which means that only 1.2 percent of those who begin the education cycle make it to university.
According to Kimalat, the education allocations have more than tripled over the past eight years.
NAIROBI, September 1 (Xinhua) --Kenya will launch sex education program in primary and secondary schools and teacher training colleges when schools reopen next Monday, with an initial 400 teachers trained for the exercise, local media reported Friday.
Officials at the Ministry of Education said the program is a product of joint efforts by local and international donors, anti- HIV/AIDS groups and the government through the National AIDS Control Council.
AIDS is widespread in the country, claiming 500 lives daily.
NAIROBI, December 11 (Xinhua) --Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has challenged investors to consider investing in higher education in Kenya, the state-run Kenya Times newspaper said Saturday.
Addressing the United Nations International University in Nairobi Friday, Moi said out of some 30,000 students who qualify for university education in the country each year, less than 30 percent get admission to public universities.
He noted that another five percent of those get admission in private universities while the rest seek university education outside the country.
Presently, there are about 20,000 students studying abroad whose expenditure is estimated to be 16 billion shillings (214 million U.S. dollars) per year.
The president urged private university to take advantage of the quest for university education in Kenya by expanding their facilities in order to enroll more students.
He also mentioned that his government is in the process of revising the University Act of 1985 and the university rule of 1989 with a view of creating a more conducive environment for private sector involvement in higher education.
Moi said the academic programs offered by the country's institutions of higher learning should be market driven and called on private universities to diversify their programs to include basic and applied sciences.
NAIROBI, October 7 (Xinhua) --The talks on teachers' pay dispute between the Kenyan government and the Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) has reached a deadlock, the Daily Nation reported today.
The paper said that the teachers' union vowed to continue with the four-day-long strike until the Kenyan government meets its demands.
The government issued a statement last night, advising all teachers who started a nationwide strike on October 1 to report to their duty stations by 8 a.m. tomorrow or face unspecified punishment.
The statement signed by Kenyan Education Minister Joseph Kamotho was issued when the talks aimed at ending the strike was going on under the chairmanship of Labour Minister Philip Masinde.
After learning this development, John Katumanga, Chairman of the Teachers Service Commission said that "it is unfair, immoral and against all known labour laws to make prejudicial statements when the talks were going on".
The striking teachers are demanding a salary increase ranging between 150 and 200 percent, but the government has agreed to give a 10 to 28 percent salary increment.
The KNUT Secretary General Ambrose Adongo noted that "we went to the talks with an open mind" and prepared a proposal of spreading the salary increase over a three-year period.
However, he stressed, the Kenyan government has not offered anything new to the teachers at the talks and kept on saying there is no money.
Sources here said that the talks had to be adjourned to facilitate "further consultations at the political level" and to "give the parties time to see whether all grounds were acceptable to them."
NAIROBI, September 24 (Xinhua) --The Kenyan government has published the University Bill 2000 to allow foreign universities to establish constituent campuses in the east African country, the Sunday Standard newspaper reported.
Kenyan Education Minister Kalonzo Musyoka was quoted as saying here on Saturday that the bill will be submitted to the parliament for debate when it resumes next month.
Under the new bill, only foreign universities recognized in their mother countries will qualify to operate campuses in Kenya, he said.
According to the minister, foreign constituent colleges will save Kenyans much in school fees and foreign exchange.
"Kenya has the capacity for more universities," he said.
Musyoka also praised private universities in Kenya, saying they complement the government's efforts to provide higher education.
Earlier, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said the number of Kenyan students who want a university education has far outstripped the places at public universities and colossal amounts of money is spent each year on education abroad.
NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) --Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi today ordered schools from primary to university level to furnish environmental conservation education among other subjects.
He said this education should emphasize that the survival of human, animal and plant life depends on the environment.
President Moi was speaking to Maseno University College students on his way to Kisumu from Vihiga, western Kenya,the Kenya News Agency reported.
He said it is alarming that Lake Victoria and other water masses in the country are about to dry up because of the current wanton destruction of the catchment area.
Noting the situation, the president said he will vigorously enforce conservation measures through the relevant agencies.
He called on all communities in Kenya to embrace environmental conservation as part of their cultures.
NAIROBI, July 13 (Xinhua) --Kenya is ranked the 136th in the 174 countries according to the human development index contained in a report released by the U.N.
Development Program Monday.
The ranking is arranged according to how people live, factoring in health care, life expectancy, education and income, the East African Standard newspaper reported Tuesday.
According to the report, Canada, for the sixth consecutive year, ranks the first among best places to live, while Norway, ranking the second, treats women better than any other country.
In the overall index, the United States is in the third place, followed by Japan, Belgium, Sweden, Australia, the Netherlands, Iceland, Britain, France and Switzerland.
At the other end of the list, the 10 least developed countries in human development terms are, from the bottom up, Sierra Leone, Niger, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau, Eritrea, Mali and the Central African Republic.
Kenya lies at number 136, with Libya leading the African pack at number 65, South Africa 101, Tunisia 102 and Algeria 109.
The 260-page report, stuffed with tables and statistics, shows that stark and ever widening gap between rich and poor with 80 countries having less revenue than they did a decade ago.
NAIROBI, January 4 (Xinhua) --Only 47 percent of the students who passed last year's Kenya Certificate of Primary Education Examination will have the opportunity to enter secondary schools, the Education Minister, Joseph Kamotho, has said.
Joseph Kamotho said out of the 401,649 candidates who sat the Primary Education Examination, only 189,187 have been selected to join secondary schools.
The other will miss the opportunity.
The minister made the remarks when he launched the national schools Form One selection exercise at Kenya Science Teachers College in Nairobi on Wednesday.
The intake number is an improvement of 0.8 percent over the previous year, he said.
Candidates selected to join secondary schools are expected to report between January 23 and February 9.
DAR ES SALAAM, October 8 (Xinhua) --Plans are underway to establish a regional apex body for a women's organization in East Africa, according to a news dispatch from Arusha, northern Tanzania.
This was disclosed by Magaga Alot, a senior member of the East African Commission at a gender workshop in Arusha on Tuesday.
Presenting a paper "Role of Women in the East African Cooperation (EAC)", Alot said when full fledged, the evisaged women's regional organization will among others, serve as a center for articulation, harmonization, and promoting of women's rights and roles within the framework of the EAC and regional integration.
Alot said that the apex body will also address issues such as women's participation in decision-making at all levels and access to social resources, including education, employment, health and population services.
He stressed, "Women account for roughly 50 percent of the combined population of the three (EAC) member states of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania" and the EAC cannot ignore the plight or contribution of half of its human resource while pursuing regional integration and development.
Alot noted that what women need and deserve is nothing more and nothing less than the affirmation of their equal rights and opportunities under the law and in the society at large.
NAIROBI, April 2 (Xinhua) --Kenya's Ministry of East African and Regional Cooperation has called for the harmonization of education in the east African region, including similar curricula and certification.
Permanent Secretary Samuel Ambuka said the move would help attain a state of singularity in the region's economic management and social organization, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
Ambuka noted Thursday that Kenya's 8-4-4 education system, which means eight years of primary school, four years of high school and four years of university, was different from the 7-4-2-3 structure in both Uganda and Tanzania, which made regional integration difficult.
"It brings in the problems of differences in the basic skills and knowledge a student ought to have to acquire at the various levels of education, and the question of assessment of points and credits in the three countries," he noted.
He suggested that the three east African nations set up joint teams to study curricula, examination and certification of primary, secondary and college education as a basis for harmonization of curricula and certification.
On Kenya's 8-4-4 curricula, Ambuka admitted that it emphasized a wide range of subjects at the expense of in-depth analysis.
NAIROBI, June 25 (Xinhua) --Kenya has a shortage of over 200 science subjects teachers in secondary schools in the country, Kenyan Minister for Education Joseph Kamotho said today.
Kamotho said this when he presented a total of 300,000 Kenya Shillings (about 5,000 U.S.
Dollars) to schools in Mathioya Division of Muranga District.
The minister appealed to students to join state universities and learn science subjects especially physics and chemistry in order to bridge the gap.
He also announced that his ministry will soon increase salary of science subjects teachers in secondary schools in the country as directed by President Daniel arap Moi so as to attract more teachers to the career.
Kamotho, who is also the ruling KANU secretary general, appealed to parents to join hands with the government and contribute to the development of schools in order to lay a firm foundation for their children.
NAIROBI, September 4 (Xinhua) --About 240,000 teachers around Kenya will go on strike on October 1 if the government fails to meet their salary hike demands within 28 days, local press reported today.
The Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) sent the strike threat to Minister for Labor and Manpower Development Philip Masinde Wednesday following a crisis meeting of the KNUT national executive council.
The union is demanding a salary increase ranging between 150 and 200 percent as recommended by the remunerations committee, instead of 10-to-28 percent announced by Education Minister Joseph Kamotho Monday.
"The teachers have resolved that they will not accept anything sort of the full implementation of the recommendations" made by the committee, said KNUT Secretary-General Ambrose Adongo Wednesday.
According to the recommendations, the lowly paid teacher should get a minimum of 5,640 Shillings a month, with a top bar of 7,079 Shillings.
The highest paid teacher (chief principal) is to get a minimum of 42,240 Shillings, with a top bar of 52,246 Shillings.
Currently around 62 Shillings equal to one U.S.
Dollar. The remunerations committee also recommended automatic house allowance for all cadre of teachers, with the lowest being 4,700 Shillings a month up from 640 Shillings.
A chief principal is to get 35,200 Shillings a month, up from 8,700 Shillings.
Others are motor vehicle, transfer, hardship, commuter and accommodation allowances.
In contrast, under the Kamotho's announcement, the lowest paid teacher will start at 2,405 Shillings a month, up from 1,880 Shillings.
The highest starts at 21,000 up from 19,115 Shillings, with a ceiling 25,840 Shillings.
The KNUT has described Kamotho's package as an insult to the teachers in charge of about seven million children in the country's primary and secondary schools.
Meanwhile, Kamotho argued that the government is unable to give the hefty pay rise and lucrative benefits the committee had recommended because of inadequate budgetary allocations.
NAIROBI, October 5 (Xinhua) --The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has urged Kenya's Education Ministry to include sex education in the curriculum.
The UNICEF country representative Chrispin Wilson said Monday that it was essential to provide information about HIV/AIDS to the youth in order to curb the spread of the killer disease.
"Using schools as the means to reach children aged between five and 14 to induce behaviour change through HIV/AIDS education are some of the best methods to try to stop the spread of the virus," said Wilson.
Kenya will have about 850,000 AIDS orphans by the year 2000, according to Wilson.
The newly infected were young people in Kenya, where the HIV infection rate has reached 13 to 14 percent, said Wilson.
He observed that the age group most at risk was between 15 and 24 and girls aged between 15 and 19 were at a much higher risk of contracting the virus than boys.
Kenya's Catholic church leaders and some politicians are strongly against adolescent sex education citing it would mislead young people.
NAIROBI, January 26 (Xinhua) --The United States will give 350,000 U.S. dollars to a Kenyan project aimed at linking the east African country's universities to the Internet, a U.S. official has said.
With the new grant, the Kenya Education Network is expected to connect 20 universities and research facilities to the Internet within a year and 600 primary and secondary schools within three years, Vivian Derryck, assistant administrator of the U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID), said in Nairobi Tuesday.
The network was established last year by the Kenyan government and universities, with the support of the country's private sector and the USAID, the East African Standard newspaper reported Wednesday.
NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) --Top Kenyan education official has requested the international community to assist it in raising 11 million shillings (about 160,000 U.S.dollars) to implement the HIV/AIDS awareness courses in schools in the east African country.
The Kenya Times newspaper Saturday quoted the Education Minister Stephen Musyoka as saying that the money would be used to facilitate the effective implementation of the syllabus and the printing of the pamphlets and posters.
In early December 1999, Kenya launched a national anti-AIDS strategy which included compulsory education of AIDS risks in all Kenyan schools starting from the year 2000.
Musyoka said that the syllabus about AIDS courses has been sent to all primary schools, secondary schools and colleges.
Around 20 percent of Kenyan youngsters aged between 14 to 17 are HIV- positive, according to a recent report by the ministry.
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) --The Kenyan government has decided to introduce enterprise education in primary schools to inculcate a business culture among children in the eastern African country.
The new subject, Entrepreneurship Education, will focus on practical aspects of business management and industrial development, Education Minister Joseph Kamotho announced on Tuesday in a statement.
"The intention is to inculcate a business and enterprising culture in the minds of learners at an early age," he claimed.
However, it is just an additional one to the 13 subjects taught in primary schools and will be non-examinable.
The move is one of the eight strategies for training and human resource development in preparation for the country's industrialization, said Kamotho.
Other strategies include strengthening of educational and training programs for the disabled, ensuring street children get access to education and offering a second chance to drop-outs to improve their literacy and get short-time career training.
Training in the country's institutions would be harmonized with the labor market requirements to correct the mismatch between labor supply and demand, he stressed.
NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) --The annual gross enrollment in Kenya's primary schools fell by two percent to 55 percent this year mainly due to the introduction of cost-sharing in schools, which has locked out children from poor background.
Moreover, 23 percent of the pupils enrolled in the country's 16,000 primary schools dropped out before reaching grade five between 1990 and 1995, according to a lastest Human Development Report.
The decline was also a result of lack of adequate teaching facilities and qualified teachers in many schools in the eastern African country, the local press quoted the report as saying today.
The requirement that children must go to school in uniform, buy a variety of textbooks and pay numerous levies and fees have also contributed to the drop in school enrollment, said the report.
However, Kenya's adult illiteracy rate was sharply down to 21.9 percent in 1995 from about 35 percent in previous years, said the report.
Earlier, Kenyan Education Director Sammy Kyungu said the government has drafted guidelines to liberalize the education sector in the next century.
Under the guidelines, procurement of textbooks, supply and distribution would be school-based rather than dependent on the Kenya Institute of Education, he said on Thursday.
NAIROBI, October 15 (Xinhua) --Kenya's controversial 8-4-4 education system is to be replaced with a new school program by January 2001, according to a report submitted by the country's Education Commission of Inquiry.
The Daily Nation reported Friday that Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi Thursday asked the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology to appoint a task force to implement the proposals put forward by the commission.
Details about the report were not available, but the commission is believed to have called for changes to the 8-4-4 system, which means eight years of primary school, four years of high school and four years of university.
The current system, introduced 14 years ago, has been widely criticized by parents and teachers for its heavy workload.
It is too broad, too expensive and too troublesome, they complained.
NAIROBI, October 19 (Xinhua) --The World Bank has decided to issue a 1.6-billion-Shilling (26.66 million U.S.
Dollars) grant to help Kenya develop early childhood education in the next three years.
The program aims to improve pre-school teacher performance, and enhance community capacity building and mobilization, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Monday.
Garcia Marito, a World Bank official in charge of regional Early Childhood Development Project, said that other targets include health and nutrition, community support grant, pre-school to primary school transition, and sound early childhood education monitoring and evaluation.
World Bank's intervention has been necessitated by a strong need for well-trained pre-school teachers in this east African country, said Marito.
This has also been necessitated by the need to harmonize pre-school education programs to accord near uniform pre-school to primary school transition, he said.
Currently, the sub-sector has a teaching force of 36,129.
Out of them, only 16,500 are fully trained.
According to the data from the Kenyan Ministry of Education and Human Resources, the enrollment rose to the current 1,064,053 pupils from 844,796 in 1980.
KAMPALA, June 1 (Xinhua) --Uganda has launched on Thursday a national strategy for girls' education, calling upon the government to scrutinize and harmonize its roles and activities in educating girl children.
Addressing the launching ceremony at the International Conference Center in Kampala, Vice-President Specioza Wandira Kazibwe said that one of the obstacles to girls' education is lack of physical facilities like laboratories especially in girls schools.
This has hindered girl students from excelling in science subjects, she added.
Kazibwe said the strategy of action for girls' education compels the government to establish a girls school that is well facilitated with a laboratory and a computer center in every district in the east African country so as to provide life skills to the girl child.
Of the 146 developing countries rated on the Gender Human Development Index, Uganda is relegated to 132nd place compared to Kenya's 112th and Tanzania's 123rd position.
At the primary level, it put girls' enrolment at 47 percent compared to 53 percent for boys, and it widens to 32 percent for females and 68 percent for males at the secondary level.

WASHINGTON (AP) --Legendary entertainer Bob Hope is in Washington to attend the opening of the permanent Bob Hope Gallery of American Entertainment in the Library of Congress.
''He's anxious to be here,'' Hope publicist Ward Grant said today.
''We're anxious to get him here and get some photographs at the exhibit''.
Hope and wife, Delores, arrived Saturday, Grant said.
Hope is scheduled to attend a private reception Tuesday evening at the library.
Hope's son Anthony, daughter Linda, and singer Connie Stevens spoke at a press preview of the exhibit today.
''I'm looking forward to going through this collection myself and reliving and resharing those times and I hope the public feels the same way,'' Anthony Hope said.
Added Stevens, ''He taught me more than anything to make the stage my home and the audience my family''.
The exhibit includes 88,000 pages of jokes given to the library by Hope as well as countless other letters, photos, videos and other momentos.
''His career pretty much parallels the history of American entertainment.
He excelled in all the mediums,'' said Library of Congress spokesman Craig D'Ooge.
''It's both a history of Bob Hope and a history of American entertainment''.
The Hope family has donated $3.5 million for the upkeep of the items.
Hope turns 97 on May 29.
I am no expert on history CD-ROMs.
In truth, I have consciously shied away from them, seeing digital tools as a frivolous assault on scholarly standards.
After spending a week playing with The Library of Congress: Eyes of the Nation, a new CD-ROM exploring the American experience through documents selected from the world's largest archive, I've been partly converted, much like the wayward Puritan of the 1650s who made a ``halfway covenant'' with his faith.
Used in conjunction with more traditional methods, the CD-ROM may well revolutionize the way we teach history.
The Eyes of the Nation CD-ROM is divided into five parts.
All provide a glimpse of the treasures to be found in the Library of Congress' fabulous special collections.
(The DVD-ROM version has 19 additional exhibits, more than 1,000 additional images and three hours of full-screen video).
Part One introduces the viewer to the world of rare books, maps, prints and photographs, including the first known slave narrative published on American soil (1760), a detailed sketch of the Gettysburg battlefield by a Confederate topographer (1863), and a poignant photo of two black women on their knees, decorating the grave of a black soldier in the segregated Arlington National Cemetery (1943).
Parts Two and Three divide the 3,000 images on this CD-ROM along chronological and thematic lines.
Following a concise and beautifully crafted overview of the American experience by the historian Alan Brinkley, the images are placed into categories like Arts, Entertainment, Transportation and War.
Each category contains a time line covering the course of American history.
A journey into The African-African Experience, for example, elicits a dozen images from the years 1947 to 1957, including those of Charlie Parker playing the alto saxophone, Marian Anderson performing with the New York Philharmonic, Rosa Parks being fingerprinted by the police in Montgomery, Ala.
, and social psychologist Kenneth Clark performing the doll study that swayed several Supreme Court justices in Brown vs.
Board of Education.
All the images are accompanied by crisp commentary.
Part Four, my favorite, contains a series of multimedia exhibits created specifically for Eyes of the Nation.
These include things like the step-by-step construction of the U.S.
Capitol and the satirical cartoons of the Gilded Age (1875-1900), in which politicians, capitalists, immigrants and reformers are savagely lampooned, in lavish color, by a rising class of American artists.
Carefully narrated, these exhibits demonstrate the ability of archivists to create a powerful sense of time and place through the creative use of primary sources.
Part Five links the CD-ROM to the Library of Congress' American Memory Web site, providing instant access to hundreds of thousands of historical documents.
Eyes of the Nation is billed as user-friendly, and it partly succeeds.
All the images can be individually retrieved, filed in portfolios created by users, and printed.
All contain a written commentary.
The viewer can also enlarge the image and zoom in on the contents _ a good idea when reading an old letter or studying battlefield maps.
Yet the search function is confusing and incomplete.
While including all the images, it does not search the larger text.
So my attempts to locate J.
Edgar Hoover, Barry Goldwater and Donald Duck turned up nothing.
Are they somewhere on this CD-ROM?
I have no idea.
There also appears to be no cross-referencing.
Using the word ``tennis,'' I could find no match for Billie Jean King.
She is categorized under ``feminism, women's liberation,'' and a viewer seeking more information about her is given the image of that noted athlete Bella Abzug.
Worse, my search for Dwight D.
Eisenhower turned up a single image, although I'm certain from my own browsing that there were at least two.
There are other problems.
After 1970, the project clearly loses momentum.
The scenes become predictable: space shuttles, presidents and first ladies, Michael Jackson performing ``Thriller''.
There is little about the major changes transforming the nation, like the extraordinary influx of immigrants from Asia and Latin America.
At certain times, the project veers down a slippery political road.
You could easily come away from the images and commentary on Vietnam with the feeling that every single American, with the exception of the Pentagon planners, deeply opposed the conflict.
Nine images appear on the time line for War between 1970 and 1991.
One covers the shooting of student protesters at Kent State; another focuses on ``Apocalypse Now,'' the ultimate anti-war film.
A third shows a CIA map of South Vietnam, but the commentary ignores that image in favor of a diatribe against ``the military-industrial complex''.
There are five separate images of the Vietnam Memorial, emphasizing heartache and loss.
The ninth image takes on the Persian Gulf war.
It shows a wall of death at the University of Rochester, representing the thousands of Iraqis who were killed in the conflict.
There is no mention of how the war began or who bears responsibility for the carnage.
Given the extraordinary scope and beauty of this project, however, these are minor quibbles.
Eyes of the Nation is not meant to be a textbook.
It is a compendium of sights and sounds, celebration and protest, pop culture and seminal ideas, reminding us of the richness and diversity of American life.
On that level, it is a stunning success.

WASHINGTON (AP) --As an idea goes, this one was small caliber, just one of many administrative details that Congress had before it in the spring of 1800 as it prepared to move to a new capital city.
The seed of the idea that would become the Library of Congress lay in the fact that while there were sufficient libraries in Philadelphia, where the U.S. government had resided for a decade, there were none in Washington, where the government would soon be.
That the library would grow into a pre-eminent world institution was beyond imagination.
On April 24, 1800, President John Adams approved an appropriation of $5,000 to purchase ''such books as may be necessary for the use of Congress''.
Books, mostly on history, economics and law, were ordered from London.
They arrived in 1801 and were shelved in the new U.S.
Capitol. The collection consisted of just 740 volumes and three maps.
Next Monday, millions of books and much history later, the Library of Congress celebrates its 200th anniversary as an institution that grew, in the words of one of its biographers, into ''a symbol of American democracy and faith in the power of learning''.
The celebration includes a major exhibition, ''Thomas Jefferson,'' featuring the first-ever reassembly of Jefferson's 1815 library in one place, arranged by the system he devised.
A commemorative stamp and two coins will be issued.
A new Web site for families, ''America's Library,'' will be introduced.
When it still amounted to little more than a few books on a few shelves the library had the good fortune to capture the interest of the one American with perhaps more interest in books than any other.
''I cannot live without books...
,'' Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1815.
As president in 1802, Jefferson approved the first law setting out the role and functions of the new library.
While the law gave Congress the authority to set the library's budget, it awarded the appointment of the Librarian of Congress to the president.
That gave the new institution a government-wide reach.
In August 1814, an invading British army intervened.
It seized Washington and burned the White House and the Capitol.
The Library of Congress, which by then had about 3,000 volumes, was destroyed.
With one act, Jefferson became the founder of the Library of Congress as it now exists.
''I learn from the newspapers that the vandalism of our enemy has triumphed at Washington over science as well as the arts, by the destruction of the public library with the noble edifice in which it was deposited,'' Jefferson wrote in a letter that September.
By then retired to his home at Monticello, Jefferson offered Congress the opportunity to buy his private library which then totaled nearly 6,500 volumes.
The purchase was approved.
The price was almost $24,000.
Jefferson called it the ''choicest collection of books in the U.S''.
He voiced hope it would have a permanent influence ''on the literature of our country''.
Acquiring Jefferson's books was a step in that direction.
It offered the Library of Congress the chance of establishing a comprehensive, universal collection.
When delivered in a caravan of horse-pulled wagons, Jefferson's library expanded the breadth of the collection dramatically.
It added books on architecture, the arts, science, literature and geography.
''He believed that the American legislature needed ideas and information on all subjects and in many languages in order to govern a democracy,'' writes library historian John Y.
Cole in ''Jefferson's Legacy, A Brief History of the Library of Congress''.
Anticipating the argument that his collection might be too comprehensive, Jefferson argued that there was ''no subject to which a member of Congress may not have occasion to refer''.
Commenting editorially on July 15, 1815, ''The National Intelligencer,'' Washington's first newspaper, said: ''In all civilized nations of Europe there are national libraries ...
In a country of such general intelligence as this, the congressional or national Library of the United States (should) become the great repository of the literature of the world''.
At Monticello, his hilltop home in Virginia, Jefferson quickly began to restock his own empty shelves, telling John Adams that now he was retired from public life he was reading more for amusement and pleasure than for practical use.
By the time he died in 1826, he had more than 1,000 volumes.
The institution he rescued also never stopped collecting.
''Jefferson gave us the rationale for today's library,'' says Cole who is also director of the Library's Center for the Book.
''Today the library is a world library,'' he said.
''We serve the world and we collect the world''.

BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) --About 100 librarians and information science specialists from China and the United States gathered here today for the opening ceremony of the first China-United States Library Conference.
The conference is sponsored by the China Society for Library Science, the National Library of China, the American Library Association, the Chinese American Librarians Association, the Library of Congress, and the US National Commission on Libraries and Information Science.
The three-day conference is expected to promote co-operation and technology and information exchanges between the two countries' libraries, an organizer said.
Participants will discuss national and global information infrastructure, information technology, library information science education, and book and copyright protection.
The organizers say they believe the conference will lay the foundation for long-term cooperation between the libraries of China and the United States and have a positive impact on cooperation and development in this area.
WASHINGTON _ Growing congressional concern about copyright control over the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s private papers is hampering negotiations to buy the collection from the slain civil rights leader's family.
House Republicans and Democrats say that if federal funds are used to purchase the papers for $20 million, then the Library of Congress should own the copyright of the collection.
The King family has expressed an interest in retaining at least partial copyright control, which would result in lucrative royalty fees if the papers are used in a commercial fashion.
Under such an agreement, if the collection of 80,000 documents is used to create an educational computer program or to write a book, royalties for the use of the King papers would go to the King family.
The King family would not comment directly about negotiations over the copyright.
Robert Vickers, a family spokesman, said a statement by Dexter Scott King, the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s son, on Oct.
27 still stands.
King said then that by accepting a payment that is far below the $30 million appraised value of the papers, the family was ``meeting our fiduciary responsibility to the estate of Dr.
King while making a substantial gift to the nation''.
Jill Brett, public affairs officer at the Library of Congress, said that 99 percent of its collection is donated and therefore the library accepts donor requests for copyright control in certain circumstances.
``The library traditionally makes an effort to retain certain rights when we obtain a collection, but we have allowed reasonable restrictions on a case-by-case basis on donations in the past,'' Brett said.
Reasonable restrictions would include copyright control on literary works of noted authors and historical figures.
But the purchase of the King papers is different, lawmakers say, because the collection would be purchased, not donated.
``If we are going to purchase or acquire the papers, we ought to have full control over the papers,'' said Rep.
John Boehner (R-Ohio), a senior member of the House Administration Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Library of Congress.
Behind the scenes, Rep.
Jim Clyburn (D-S.C).
and Rep.
John Lewis (D-Ga).
are working to bring legislation to the floor authorizing the Library of Congress to purchase or acquire the papers through private donations.
The Senate passed such a measure, but the authorization is stalled in the House over the copyright issue and over a sense among members that the papers should be donated.
``I don't know a president or any national figure who hasn't donated their papers,'' said Rep.
Johnny Isakson (R-Ga).
``The papers are important, but this is unprecedented''.
Members of the civil rights movement agree.
``I think this contradicts directly what Dr.
King stood for and believed in: that there are more important things than material wealth,'' said Gilbert Jonas, a chief NAACP fund-raiser for 30 years who donated his own papers to the Library of Congress.
``The man who stood for the spiritual values of this country is being exploited''.
Jonas said he cannot think of any members of the civil rights movement who sold their papers to the Library of Congress or other institution.
But it is not just the commercialization of the King legacy that has prompted concern.
Historians are equally worried about the collection that will be left behind at the King Center in Atlanta.
Louise Cook, former director of the King Library's archives and museum in Atlanta, said the papers that Congress wants to buy include documents from King's involvement with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
But Cook said those papers were separated from another collection of SCLC papers donated to the King Center in 1977, because Coretta Scott King kept them at her house.
The two collections should be kept together for historical purposes, Cook said.
``Any scholar would consider them to be inseparable,'' Cook said.
``They are two separate collections, but had the documents held by Mrs.
King been available at the time, they would have been considered as one''.
Both collections contain similar documents, including handwritten notes, drafts of speeches, reports and correspondence with major civil rights leaders such as Andrew Young.
Cook left the King Center in 1987 over a fundamental disagreement with the way the papers were being stored and concern over the King estate charging fees to use the papers.
``I am gravely concerned about the future of the SCLC collection, as it has a very significant historical value for our nation and for scholars,'' Cook said.
``Because Dr.
King was the founding president of SCLC, I don't know how to distinguish what was his and what was SCLC's''.
David Garrow, a historian at Emory University and King biographer, agrees with Cook's assessment.
``The most important question right now is what does this mean for the SCLC papers and the SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) papers''?
Garrow said.
Brett, at the Library of Congress, said that the other papers had not been considered as part of the negotiations.

JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) --Libraries are still a more accurate source of information than the Internet, thus students should not confine their research only to the Net, according to a Bar-Ilan University researcher in Israel.
David Schwartz, a researcher of the university's school of business administration, compared materials on various subjects found in the world's three major libraries, the U.S.
Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, and the British Royal Library, to Internet researches he carried out on the same topics.
In each case, Schwartz said, the representation of the topics on the Internet was inferior to that in the three libraries.
Many Internet sites are profit-oriented, so one can not always trust the information provided by vested interests, he added.
"The Internet has opened up a treasure of information for researchers and seekers of knowledge throughout the world, and it has become common practice to turn to the Internet as a convenient source of information," he said.
He questioned the effectiveness of Internet int is presenting knowledge.
It is a foregone conclusion that the Internet will become the infrastructure for a global digital library, he continued, "but this is still years away from happening."
WASHINGTON (AP) --Newly developed digitalized baseball cards are presenting the Library of Congress with new problems in preserving the nation's heritage.
The world's biggest library --over 119 million items -- has high-quality housings for its collection of cardboard baseball cards going back more than 100 years, including one that shows Ty Cobb stealing third base.
''Not too hot, not too cold; not too moist, not too dry,'' curator Harry Katz describes the conditions for assuring they don't deteriorate into paper mache or dust.
''It's the same problem as preserving the Gutenberg Bible or Ansel Adams photos, though the parameters are different, depending on the materials''.
But the new digital trading cards on three-inch CD-ROMs will require also preserving what will inevitably become antique computer technology to read them.
''One problem is the hardware,'' Katz said.
''Technology moves so fast that in a few years today's computers may be obsolete.
No use keeping the disks if they can't be read.
How much equipment do we have to preserve, too''?
As society becomes more digitalized, the library is increasingly looking at computer capacity as much as warehouse space in planning its future needs.
''How many gigabytes should you have''?
Katz asked.
Many archives now exist only on the Internet, and it's not just archives.
''A lot of artists --increasingly -- don't work on paper.
Their work is just images you can see on a monitor,'' Katz said.
By law, the Library of Congress gets two copies of books and other printed materials that are copyrighted.
It doesn't keep all of them because it doesn't have the warehouse space.
It now faces the same problem with cyberspace: which artists and which works to preserve.
''We have to identify the best people and the work we want to keep,'' Katz said.
''We've been bandying a lot of names around, but we don't have a list yet''.
Mark Roosa, chief of the library's conservation division, divides the problem into two areas: material that is ''born digital'' and information that is ''reborn digital''.
The ''born digital'' includes art, electronic books, scientific journals, music and multi-media presentations.
''For instance, some of the music never resides in any format unless the end user decides to do it,'' said Roosa.
''Reborn digital'' material is taken from crumbling paper documents, wax cylinders like those Thomas Edison used for the first recordings, early television programs recorded on two-inch videotapes that can only be read by a few remaining pieces of equipment.
''There were 80 or 90 different formats for videotapes,'' Roosa said, ''You can't get the manufacturers to go back to old technologies and make the spare parts.
We have to be sure when we get information in new forms that we can migrate it forward''.
The library has a lot of conservation problems.
Microfilm, a relatively low-tech device, has been preserving newspapers for decades.
Not satisfied with that, the library wanted to keep the actual pages of The New York Times special supplement of April 28, 1912, on the sinking of the Titanic.
The ZFB Co.
in Leipzig, Germany, had an experimental paper-splitting process.
It smoothed each page, covered it gently with a transparent tissue attached by a gelatin adhesive and inserted a sheet of acid-free paper between them.
The acid in newsprint makes it crumble in a few decades.
Then the experts encapsulated each page in a polyester film.

Boston was threatened by smallpox, and from his nearby headquarters in Cambridge, Mass.
, George Washington ordered his troops to stay out of the city.
It was March 19, 1776, and the orders were written by hand.
This letter and hundreds of others in their original form can be read on the Internet at the American Memory site of the Library of Congress, one of the libraries leading the way in a quiet revolution that is changing the way knowledge is shared around the world.
From papyri to Civil War letters and diaries, from old baseball cards to photographs of Buffalo Bill and Sitting Bull, millions of unique items in libraries, archives and museums are being digitized and made available in facsimile on the Internet to anyone, not just scholars with the time and money to travel.
Many items can be located through an automated system of finding aids developed over the last five years by a group that has included university librarians, the Society of American Archivists and the Library of Congress.
Finding aids describe what is in the folders and boxes in which libraries and archives keep their collections.
``It really is going to change the whole organization of knowledge,'' said Timothy Hoyer, head of technical services at the Bancroft Library of the University of California at Berkeley, which has been in on the cutting edge of the changes.
The numbers involved are huge: The Library of Congress, which has 117 million items in its archives, hopes to have 4 million items digitized and accessible on the World Wide Web by the turn of the century.
The Denver Public Library expects to put 95,000 photographs of the old West online.
California has linked 35 universities and museums into one online archive.
In the Public Records Office in London, archivists are creating a catalog of all British public records dating to the Domesday Book of the 11th century.
With help from experts at New York University, the New-York Historical Society is trying to digitize one of the great American history collections.
No one place is available online where Web users can search the finding aids for all these collections.
But the Research Libraries Group, an international alliance of 160 institutions, including universities, libraries, archives and museums, has set up an Archival Resources service that is moving toward this.
``The vision goes back to the Enlightenment,'' said Daniel Pitti, project director of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia.
``It was the dream of the scholar to go to one place and find out what exists, where it is, and what they need to get access''.
``It's an illusion to think we'll digitize everything out there _ we're talking about hundreds of millions of items,'' he added.
Copies of items that have been digitized have occasionally been more interesting than the originals.
A digitized photo of the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, for example, can be manipulated to see paintings on the walls of buildings that cannot be seen in the original photograph.
A piece of papyrus, enlarged on a computer, does not have to be viewed under a microscope.
It was papyrus that led some archivists to think of constructing digitized collections so that valuable, fragile materials would not be harmed.
``We have 1,500 pieces of papyri dating back to 4,000 B.C.,'' said Steven Hensen, director of planning and project development in the rare book, manuscript and special collections library at Duke University.
While Duke was photographing and cataloguing its collection, he said, ``the World Wide Web burst upon the scene, and we had this flash: Why make photos?
Why not scan them and see if we can put them up on the Web and make them accessible worldwide''?
Dr. Roger Bagnall, professor of classics and history at Columbia University, is heading an effort by Duke, Columbia, the University of Michigan, Berkeley, Yale and Princeton to build a virtual collection of 50,000 pieces of papyri that could eventually be linked to collections in Europe.
``We are, ultimately, going to have translations for everything that's actually been read,'' Bagnall said, ``and anything with a Greek text will also have an English text''.
What has happened in papyrus could happen with other unique collections, said Stephen Griffin, head of the division of information and intelligent systems at the National Science Foundation.
A collection of photographs, maps and texts at a University of Virginia Web site called ``The Valley of the Shadow,'' an archive of two communities, Staunton, Va.
, and Chambersburg, Pa.
, on opposite sides of the Mason-Dixon line during the Civil War, has been visited by 2 million people.
``I wanted to tell the story of the Civil War on a human level,'' said Edward Ayres, a history professor who first thought of the project.
First on a computer and then on the Internet, he and a colleague, William Thomas, tried to see ``if we could put out all the raw materials out of which historians construct the past in ways people who are not historians could explore,'' Ayres said.
``My dream is that you'll slowly see, in your own mind, a three-dimensional world emerge,'' he said.
``If you read the census entries and see that a soldier is 48 and has left three young children at home, and he's a widower, all of a sudden the lines in his letters have a different meaning''.
The National Endowment for the Humanities has supported this and other projects throughout the country to make cultural resources available on the Internet.
``It would gain the country little if we spent millions to preserve materials and no one knew where they were, or if we spent millions to gain access to materials that couldn't be seen because they were too fragile,'' said George Farr, director of the division of preservation and access at the endowment.
At the Library of Congress, the manuscript division is closed to high school students and most university undergraduates.
Even scholars can only look at presidential manuscripts on microfiche.
But at the American Memory site, the Washington letters can be seen in their original form.
The site gets 10 million to 12 million visits a month.
``Suddenly we have clients who couldn't come through our doors,'' said Hoyer, who helps direct the online archive of the California Digital Library.
Lisa Yesson, manager of the California Heritage project at the Berkeley library, has been helping elementary school teachers use the California Heritage Web site.
``A fourth-grade class in Oakland did a unit on the gold rush and went to Sutter's Fort,'' she said.
``Then they went to the California Heritage site to see what it looked like back in the gold rush''.
An unexpected result, she said, was the students' relationship with the university.
Once teachers explained what an archive was, the students wanted to come to campus to see the real thing.
``This is one of the few times that archivists have found themselves leading the parade,'' Hensen said.
``We're used to sweeping up behind the elephants.''
WASHINGTON _ A renowned letter by Thomas Jefferson, which is the highlight of a traveling Library of Congress exhibition intended as a historical survey of religion and the founding of the nation, has been seized upon by conservative Christian leaders as support for their campaign for classroom prayer, taxpayer-financed vouchers for religious schools and posting the Ten Commandments in courtrooms.
Some conservative groups and scholars say the Library's analysis of Jefferson's letter is authoritative evidence that could be used in the courts to knock down the barrier between religion and government.
At the heart of the exhibition _ and of the controversy _ is a famous letter written by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802.
In it, the nation's third president coined the phrase ``wall of separation between Church and State''.
Jefferson's letter has been used in Supreme Court cases for more than a century to describe the proper relationship between religion and government.
The Library of Congress' analysis of the Jefferson letter, released at a news conference in May and written by James Hutson, chief of the library's manuscript division, asserted that Jefferson never meant his letter to be used as the foundation for law, but instead was aimed at winning political favor with New England constituents.
Hutson's analysis said: ``The Danbury Baptist Letter was never conceived by Jefferson to be a statement of fundamental principles; it was meant to be a political manifesto, nothing more''.
The conservative leaders said this was proof that Jefferson's ``wall'' metaphor should never have been interpreted as an overarching principle.
The Christian Coalition immediately issued a news release headlined ``Library of Congress Skewers `Wall of Separation' Myth,'' and said the library's findings should bolster the campaign for the ``religious freedom amendment''.
The magazine of Focus on the Family, a multimedia ministry, called Jefferson's wall ``flimsy''.
Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council wrote that Jefferson's words had been ``twisted by liberals''.
And last month the controversy ricocheted from Christian radio to the ivory tower, when 24 legal scholars and historians sent a letter to the library complaining that its interpretation of the Jefferson letter was misleading and ``unbalanced''.
``We are concerned for really one fundamental reason,'' said Robert Alley, professor emeritus of humanities at the University of Richmond and one of two scholars who drafted the letter to the library.
``If you're going to be the keeper of the precious documents of the nation, you ought not to put them on display with biased analysis, and certainly not with a paper that has not been read by its peers and judged for its qualities, and with as many egregious observations of opinion''.
In an interview at the Library of Congress, Hutson, caretaker of the library's manuscripts for 16 years, said he was amazed that a brief paper he wrote as a ``press primer'' without footnotes had been caught up in a tug of war with national policy implications.
``The last thing we want to do here is offer opinions on constitutional law,'' Hutson said, his face flushing.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn Hutson is 61, a Presbyterian churchgoer, a Yale graduate and an expert on Benjamin Franklin.
He said he was chagrined that the uproar had overshadowed the 211 other documents and artifacts he painstakingly collected for the exhibition.
He said he would not repudiate the thesis of his paper, but added, ``Maybe I should have been more careful, but I really did try to guard against anything like this happening''.
The tempest began when Hutson set out to decipher the blotted-out lines in the first draft of Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptist Association.
The final version says that ``religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &AMP; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &AMP; not opinions''.
Jefferson restated the First Amendment's religion clause, and followed with the words ``thus building a wall of separation between Church and State''.
Hutson asked the FBI to use its computer laboratory to uncover the inked-out words in Jefferson's letter, just as the bureau had done with a diary of Theodore Roosevelt's.
In doing so, Hutson was performing excavation on a document that is a touchstone of American history.
The ``wall of separation'' metaphor, though not found in the Constitution, is often invoked as shorthand for the religion clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution, which says that ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof''.
The import of the ``separation'' language has been argued over by scholars and cited in at least 50 Supreme Court cases dealing with the relationship between government and religion.
The Supreme Court declared in Reynolds vs.
United States in 1878 that the ``wall'' metaphor was ``almost an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect'' of the First Amendment.
Since then, justices like Potter Stewart and William Rehnquist have argued that Jefferson's words were misused.
The FBI discovered that Jefferson had crossed out the word ``eternal'' preceding ``separation of Church and State'' _ as some scholars had correctly guessed years before _ and inked over ``the duties of my station, which are merely temporal''.
That last word meant secular, as opposed to spiritual.
In his essay, Hutson surmised that Jefferson removed these phrases because they might sound ``too anti-religious to pious New England ears''.
Jefferson's letter, dated Jan.
1, 1802, was meant to reassure the Baptists of Connecticut, who were suffering persecution from the Congregationalists in control of that state.
Jefferson also wrote that as president, he would not proclaim national feast days and thanksgivings.
But Hutson said that Jefferson omitted that section because his advisers warned that it might offend potential political allies.
Two days after writing the Danbury Baptist letter, Jefferson attended church services held in the House of Representatives, Hutson wrote, which was ``his way of offering symbolic support for religious faith and for its beneficent role in republican government''.
Conservatives like Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition, embraced Hutson's findings, saying, ``Some in the American elite would love to exclude all semblance of religious expression in the public square, and I think that runs counter to what Thomas Jefferson meant''.
David Barton, president of WallBuilders, a group that says it aims to restore biblical values in public policy, said, ``The library has confirmed what a lot of us have already been saying, that that letter was never meant to be a national policy paper''.
The backlash followed.
In June, Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, an advocacy group in Washington, asked the library to declare Hutson's research ``merely one opinion,'' with which Lynn said most scholars disagree.
The letter from the 24 scholars, written by them but faxed to the library by Americans United, lambasted Hutson's basic contention that Jefferson's letter was a matter of politics and not principle.
Robert M.
O'Neill, director of the Thomas Jefferson Center and a professor of law at the University of Virginia, who helped draft the scholars' letter, said, ``The fact that there may have been a political context for Jefferson's letter hardly disqualifies it as an assertion of principle, especially since it is so consistent with everything else he did or said on this issue''.
The controversy may reverberate in the courts, said Daniel Dreisbach, an associate professor of justice at American University.
``I'll bet you my house,'' he said, that some judges, faced with a case on school vouchers or creches on city hall steps, will say, ``We shouldn't be basing constitutional law on the Danbury letter''.
The exhibition is now closed in Washington, and will soon travel to Dallas, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and southern California.
The library, whose staff members say they are not accustomed to such controversy, is now trying to calm the furor.
In a letter in response to the 24 scholars, James Billington, the librarian of Congress, said that ``the library has no control whatsoever over the use that is made of, nor of the interpretation given to, the many materials that it presents to the public''. &QL;
WASHINGTON _ In 1990, James Billington, the librarian of Congress, persuaded Congress to provide the first $1 million to start building a national library without walls.
The idea then was to duplicate much of the Library of Congress' huge holdings in electronic form so people in other parts of the country could have access to the material without traveling to Washington or even leaving home.
At that time, said Laura Campbell, a Library of Congress official, the only media suitable to the task were the video disk and the CD-ROM.
``We're not in the distribution business,'' Ms.
Campbell said.
``How could we get this out''?
Of course, Ms.
Campbell said, those were ``the days before the Internet''.
By 1994, the World Wide Web had evolved, making it easy for even casual computer users to gain access to information on the Internet.
The Library of Congress saw it as the answer and sought contributions to help put its holdings on line.
The library solicited a donation from David Packard, the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, who knows something of computers.
``He said he loved the idea of getting this information out,'' Ms.
Campbell said.
``He gave us our first $5 million''.
Metromedia chairman John Kluge gave $5 million, and the W.K.
Kellogg Foundation contributed $3 million.
The $13 million in donations gave the Library of Congress such a jump start that it has reached its goal of raising $45 million for the project from the private sector, while Congress has added $15 million.
The gateway to the collection, which is stored on a server at the library, is the Library of Congress' American Memory site (memory.loc.gov/ammem/amhome.html).
It drew 132,000 unique visitors, or people who went to the site at least once, during February, said a spokeswoman for Media Metrix, an Internet measurement company.
By comparison, the Library of Congress' main government page, Thomas (thomas.loc.gov), which provides access to every part of the federal government, got 249,000 unique visitors that month, according to Media Metrix.
``Our competitive strength,'' Ms.
Campbell said, ``is that we have these unique and rare treasures to offer''.
A person skimming through the offerings the other day clicked into World War I material.
First there was a recording of George M.
Cohan's ``Over There,'' sung by Billy Murray in 1917.
Then came a recording from the U.S. commander in France, Gen.
John J.
Pershing, who recorded a 33-second speech called ``From the Battlefields of France'' in which he said: ``Three thousand miles from home, an American army is fighting for you.
Everything you hold worthwhile is at stake.
Only the hardest blows can win against the enemy we are fighting.
Invoking the spirit of our forefathers, the army asks your unshrinking support, to the end that the high ideals for which America stands may endure upon the earth''.
From there, it was easy to navigate to a collection of World War I photographs, one of them showing a German zeppelin brought down in an English field.
Ms. Campbell, who is director of the library's National Digital Library and directs a staff of 100 people, said there were now 1.7 million items on the Web site.
The goal is to have 5 million by next year, the library's bicentennial.
The eventual target is to make available 80 million items from the Library of Congress' collection that cannot be easily obtained elsewhere.
A complete set of Mark Twain is available at just about every American library, so books like that will not be made available on the Internet.
What will be made available are materials like the earliest movies and sound recordings, maps, manuscripts, the papers of 23 presidents and photographs.
Fragile rare books are also being put online; less handling means that they will probably last longer.
Theft from libraries is also reduced when users go digital.
One such rare item is Ralph Waldo Emerson's 1855 letter praising Walt Whitman's ``Leaves of Grass,'' in which the established Emerson called the little-known Whitman's work ``the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed,'' according to the site.
Without asking permission, Whitman used Emerson's testimonial in advertising for later editions of his collection of poetry, including some in which he added erotic elements.
Emerson was not pleased, the entry adds.
With the Library of Congress site, a teacher of a history course on the American Revolution will be able to have students study not only the final Declaration of Independence but also an earlier draft by Thomas Jefferson with corrections in the margin by Benjamin Franklin and John Adams.
The American Memory site has Civil War photographs by Matthew Brady and others (a picture taken by Alexander Gardner shows Confederate dead at Antietam in 1862), the earliest authenticated daguerreotype portrait of Abraham Lincoln (taken by Nicholas H.
Sheperd in 1846 or 1847), turn-of-the-century films of New York street scenes (in one a horse-drawn fire engine races around a corner) and Alexander Graham Bell's 1876 sketch of the telephone, without which none of this would be possible.
&QL; nn The shift from video disk and CD-ROM to the Internet has also meant that the Library of Congress has been able to shift its potential electronic audience from schools, universities and school libraries to the desk of any person with a computer and modem.
The Library of Congress can get its material in the most unexpected ways.
A collection of early baseball cards, which can be seen on the American Memory site, was gathered by Benjamin K.
Edwards, who left it to his daughter, who gave it to the poet Carl Sandburg, who donated it to the library.
The Edwards collection includes 2,100 baseball cards, produced from 1887 to 1914, and depicts the likes of Ty Cobb, Cy Young, Connie Mack, Walter Johnson and Christy Mathewson.
In those days, most of the cards were distributed with cigarettes and were used for both advertising and for stiffening the packages.
To spread the word, the Library of Congress has begun a program to show teachers how to use its collection in their classrooms.
The program, called American Memory Fellows, sends 50 teachers to Washington for a week each summer and trains them.
``They agree to spend six weeks on line before coming here,'' Ms.
Campbell said, ``and then give a commitment to continue to work with us and make primary sources available in the classroom''.
The teachers who have participated in the program's first two years, Ms.
Campbell said, ``are spreading the word'' about the library on the Internet.
Susan Veccia, project manager for the National Digital Library, said that the fellows for this year had been selected already.
``If money is available, we will have it in years ahead''.
Information about applying for the fellowships can be obtained by selecting the Learning Page on the American Memory home page and then clicking on Educators' Program.
Asked how the fellows were chosen, Ms.
Veccia said that the Library of Congress sought teachers ``who come with an idea of how they are going to use it, who have some facility with the technology _ we really can't be teaching technology skills at this point _ and who are leaders in their fields''.
The fellowship pays for transportation to Washington and accommodations while here.
Ms. Veccia said here was not a clear picture of how much of the Internet was being used in the classroom for educational purposes and how much the Internet was simply being used to exchange e-mail messages.
Besides its own collection, the Library of Congress plans to put other institutions' materials on the American Memory site.
It has received $2 million from Ameritech to start doing this with material from the New-York Historical Society (which has provided its Civil War collection) and the Chicago Historical Society (the holder of the archives of The Chicago Daily News, a defunct newspaper with a notable sports collection).
For most of its 200 years, the Library of Congress has been notable for its collection of books.
Does this emphasis on electronic media mark a basic shift in emphasis?
No, answered Robert Zich, the director of the project's electronic programs, it is really a way to whet the appetite.
Speaking of the Librarian of Congress, he said, ``Billington's goal is to drive kids back to the libraries and reading books.''
To experience black history in progress, just step out the front door.
Look and listen.
Almost every mode of pop music is grounded in African American music forms.
Everyday fashion statements such as baggy jeans, flashy boxers and big, fat sneakers are direct lifts from hip-hop couture.
And much of our most fashionable non-techie slanguage _ the kind that eventually makes it into Webster's Dictionary _ hails from black America, not old Europe.
When we stop to think, we remember these things.
But we don't stop to think often enough.
That's where Black History Month comes in.
This four-week holiday of learning has been around since Carter G.
Woodson established it on Feb.
19, 1926 _ it was known then as ``Negro History Week'' _ but the possibilities for exploring its richness have never been more diverse and accessible than they are today.
That's because the Internet has opened the door to new ways of researching the cultural contributions of African Americans.
In fact, there's so much information and so many resources out there that it's easy to get lost.
To help you on your way, we've provided a starter list of sites documenting the black American journey.

&QL; &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients) &QL; &LR;
WASHINGTON _ The Library of Congress has reached a tentative agreement with the family of the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
to buy the slain civil rights leader's private papers for $20 million.
Though the price is the largest amount of money the Library of Congress has ever paid for a collection of papers, some researchers and students of the civil rights era question the historic value of the material.
Under the agreement, first reported this week in Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, the King family will transfer to the library King's letters, notes, and first drafts of speeches which are now at the Martin Luther King Center in Atlanta.
The collection, which is made up of about 80,000 items, was valued at $30 million by Sotheby's, which did a private appraisal at the request of the King family.
The King family originally wanted the full $30 million, but when Library officials balked, the family agreed to reduce the payment request to $20 million and take a $10 million tax deduction.
``By accepting a payment that is substantially below market value, we are meeting our fiduciary responsibility to the estate of Dr.
King while making a substantial gift to the nation,'' said a statement issued in the name of Dexter Scott King, the civil rights leader's son who now heads the King Center in Atlanta and is executor of the King estate.
The deal is subject to Congress passing legislation appropriating money for the library to buy the King collection.
The Senate passed such a measure by unanimous consent Friday.
Sponsors of the House bill say they hope to gain passage within the next few weeks.
The Library of Congress rarely spends money to acquire historic documents.
Since the library is the Copyright Office of the United States it automatically gets copies of books and manuscripts that are published in the United States.
The last time the library purchased a collection was in 1930, when it spent $1.5 million to buy a rare-book collection that included one of three perfect copies of the Gutenberg Bible.
To date, that was the most the library had ever paid for a collection.
Some historians say the King papers that are being purchased are worth more for their prestige value than their historical content.
The King family retains control of the official papers of civil rights groups such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which King headed, the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Non-violent Co-ordinating Committee.
These papers are currently housed at the King Center, and will remain there.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) ``Ask anybody who is a historian of the movement, and they would say that the SNCC papers are worth more to scholars than the King papers,'' said David Garrow, a historian at Emory University and author of ``Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr.
, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference''.
Indeed, in 1997, both Stanford University and Emory entered into negotiations with the King family to buy some of the papers housed at the King Center.
But the two universities were not really interested in the material that now may be sold to the Library of Congress, according to Phillip Jones, chairman of Intellectual Properties Management, an Atlanta company that oversees the King estate.
It is unclear whether the payments the King family will receive from the library will be used to maintain official documents like the SCLC papers that are still housed at the King Center.
Some historians say they fear that should the originals of King's personal papers be removed from the King Center, the King family will lose interest in protecting the rest of the collection.
The Library of Congress has long been a repository of the papers or leaders and organizations of the African American civil rights movement.
Among the official papers housed there are those of The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Urban League and the private papers of A.
Phillip Randolph, Thurgood Marshall, Booker T.
Washington and Bayard Rustin.
But, unlike the King papers, all were donated to the library.
The pending sale of King's papers has again raised the question of the King family trying to capitalize financially on the legacy of one of the towering figures of the 20th Century and an icon to many Americans of all races.
In 1996, the family sued CBS for copyright infringement when it included excerpts from King's famous speech during the 1963 March on Washington.
The speech, which included the memorable lines, ``I have a dream,'' is considered one of the great pleas for racial harmony and justice.
Last year, a federal judge in Washington denied the Kings' claim, ruling that the speech was in the public domain.
``The family is amazing, isn't it''? said Gilbert Jonas, one of the chief fund-raisers for the NAACP for 30 years who recently donated his papers to the library.
``They're first ones, in my knowledge, from the civil rights era who have made money on it.
They're really creating an image that was counter to his''.
But others defend the King family's right to earn money.
``I never quite understood why the issue of money was used against the King family when any other family that owns a valuable piece of property would not be expected to just give it away,'' said Clayburn Carson, a history professor at Stanford who was involved in the negotiations to purchase many of the papers from the King Center in 1997.
The Library of Congress, the world's most voluminous library, grew by the equivalent of 2 million books on a single day last week.
But rather than build thousands of new stacks to accommodate the growth, the library could fit the new addition into a small filing cabinet.
That is because the latest donation to the library came in the form of computer disks _ 44 of them, each carrying 40 gigabytes of information.
The disks include a snapshot of the entire contents of the World Wide Web during the first two months of 1997, including each of the millions of individual Web sites _ the good, the bad, and even the smutty stuff Congress does not want kids to see.
The collection was gathered, stored and donated by Alexa Internet of San Francisco, which has developed a tool bar that makes it easy to view Web-site background information like where the site is located, whether it has a privacy policy, or if it has won third-party endorsements or awards.
The company's president, Brewster Kahle, said the donation preserves a moment in the life of the ever-evolving Web and can become a resource for sociologists and, eventually, historians who want to understand our era.
Alas, while the disks are on display at the library _ as part of an interactive sculpture _ their contents are not _ yet.
``It's kind of a laboratory experiment for us,'' said Guy Lamolinara, a spokesman for the Library of Congress, noting that some of the material was not suitable for the collections, and the library was still working out copyright issues.
``We will be using it to explore how to preserve digital materials, and how to provide access to these materials''.
Kahle, who also oversees the non-profit organization Internet Archive, said the Web is growing at a rate of 1.5 million pages a day.
Sounds as if the Library of Congress, in planning for future donations, had better set aside a large file cabinet.
Videophone Call-Ins On a Cable TV Channel The Internet has made it possible to perform all sorts of tasks without leaving the house _ banking, working, even dating.
Credit ZDTV, a fledgling 24-hour cable channel with programming focused on computer issues, for using the Net to make a virtual community out of yet another group: the studio audience.
The San Francisco-based network urges viewers to call in to its programs using Internet-based videophones, which transmit not just voices, but faces.
``Larry King says, `We'll go to Altoona, Pa.
, for our next call,' '' said Greg Derbin, senior vice president for programming and production at the network, ``and you'll hear the caller.
With ZDTV, you'll see the caller''.
To encourage wider participation, ZDTV will give away up to 10,000 videophones, called Netcams because they transmit their audio and video signals over the Internet.
From Oct.
26 to 31, it plans to give away one videophone every hour, on its Web site, Drebin said.
But there are lingering questions like whether viewers want to see each other in the slow-motion video that comes across a videophone with a modem connection.
Then again, there may not be too many viewers to complain.
ZDTV, which is owned by Ziff-Davis and began broadcasting in May, reaches only 8 million homes, a strong start, but a far cry from a mass audience.
Survey Will Track Internet Audiences The question is not whether people are tuning in to radio programs over the Internet _ they are, albeit not in mass numbers.
The question is whether the listeners count.
As radio stations decide whether to spend money to stream their audio content over their Web sites, many are struggling with the business model.
They want to be able to measure the size of their Internet audience _ and, in turn, market it to advertisers _ before they make the investment in audio streaming.
Toward that end, The Arbitron Co.
, which measures traditional radio audiences in local markets, last week announced plans to modify its surveys to track which of the stations' listeners tune in over the Internet.
The new plan is a joint effort between Arbitron NewMedia and RadioWave.com Inc.
, the interactive radio subsidiary of Motorola.
There are 1,708 radio stations worldwide that stream audio, up from 763 a year ago, said BRS Media, an Internet radio consulting agency.
But thousands of others _ among them, CBS Corp.
, which owns about 160 radio stations and has a policy against streaming audio _ have abstained, in part because they want to be able to accurately measure the audiences.
Volunteers Answer Questions Via Internet NEW YORK _ The copious information available on the Net is all well and good, as far as Steve Gordon, a New York lawyer is concerned, except that Gordon figures that people spend hours trying to find the one bit of expertise they are looking for.
So he decided to put a bunch of the experts in one place.
Gordon recently launched Allexperts (www.allexperts.com), a Web site that allows visitors to question 2,000 e-mail volunteers on topics like entertainment, computers, and medicine and get a free reply.
Some of the volunteers are not exactly experts _ the television and music volunteers are entertainment fanatics whom Gordon discovered in chat rooms, news groups and on Web sites _ but in the case of the medical sites, most volunteers are doctors or academics, Gordon said.
``If you have a keen or critical question, you don't spend two hours researching it,'' Gordon said.
``You can spend two minutes researching it''.
Gordon says the site does not vouch for the replies, which he says are meant to serve as general information, not specific advice or diagnosis.
``It's a chance to talk to people that you might not have a chance to,'' he said.
``For example, I personally don't know any neurologists''.
&QL; nn New Inkjet Printer Has a Darkroom Inside One clear trend in electronics is to package ever more functions in a single device, turning a cellular phone, for example, into a beeper, e-mail receiver, messaging center, bottle opener _ and, by the way, a telephone.
In keeping with this trend, Lexmark International Inc.
of Lexington, Ky.
, is scheduled next week to ship a new inkjet printer that is also a digital darkroom.
The Lexmark Photo Jetprinter 5770 is designed to print digital pictures without a personal computer.
The Photo Jetprinter has a slot into which users can insert a digital film cartridge.
This means users no longer have to upload the pictures onto a PC, format them and send them to the printer, said Patrick King, Lexmark's general manager for Digital Photo Printer.
The printer is expected to sell for $349, and individual pictures will cost around 60 cents, taking into account the cost of ink and paper, King said.
He said that compared with a cost of 40 cents to 70 cents per print for pictures developed at a conventional lab.
``It's on the upper end,'' King said.
``But the difference is, with our printer, you're only paying for the ones you want''.
With some estimates that the digital camera and photoprinter industry will reach $6 billion a year by 2002, Lexmark believes the new printer is worth an investment in research and development.
Group Wants to Free Software Source Code A group of concerned hackers and Netizens met on Oct.
9 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to fight for the transparency of computer software.
The group, the Free Software Foundation, met to celebrate its philosophy that the source code that underlies software programs should be freely and openly distributed.
The group reasons that, if the software were readily available, it would be easier for programmers to enhance programs and fix bugs.
Already, thousands of developers freely and openly distribute their source code.
Still, and not surprisingly, the concept meets with no small friction from companies that are no keener about publishing their source code than Coca-Cola is about publishing its secret formula.
The foundation, which was started by Richard Stallman, on Friday presented its first Free Software Award to Larry Wall for his contribution to free software development.
Wall worked on Perl software, a robust and widely used language for text manipulation and system management.
``Larry Wall,'' wrote the Free Software Foundation, ``has always promoted keeping his implementations free for all to study, enhance and build on, without restrictions, and the freedom for all to benefit''.
Sounds like the group may want to schedule next year's meeting for Berkeley. &QL;
The Library of Congress is charged with collecting the creative work of the American people.
This has come to include such varied output as the papers of Thomas Jefferson and the Wright brothers, the original compositions of Leonard Bernstein and the video archives of the Martha Graham Dance Company.
But the nation's creativity now extends to Web sites, electronic journals and magazines, and CD-ROMs of every sort, and the library has fallen behind in collecting and archiving that digital material, according to a report released on Wednesday by the National Academy of Sciences.
Unless its administrators act swiftly, the report says, the library will risk diminishing relevance.
The 260-page report is the most comprehensive overview to date of the Library of Congress' digital preparedness.
``The nation's creativity is at this point significantly represented by what's happening electronically,'' said James O'Donnell, vice provost of information systems and computing at the University of Pennsylvania and chairman of the committee that produced the National Academy's report.
The committee included outside experts in digital libraries, databases, computer networking and digital preservation.
``If you keep the mission of the library what it has been, the change in the landscape brought about by networked information is dramatic and brings about unavoidable challenges for the library,'' O'Donnell said.
Those challenges are, of course, shared by scores of other research libraries faced with the task of collecting, making accessible and preserving the nation's assorted electronica: scholarly journals, books and magazines published in electronic form; multimedia products like CD-ROMs; digital photographs, music and films; and millions of miscellaneous pieces of Internet-based material.
Further, the report stated, there are built-in limits to the library's ability to respond quickly to trends: As a creature of Congress, it is often mired in governmental bureaucracy.
The committee said it saw ``signs that the library is already losing the momentum and purchase required to make the next steep ascent'' to respond to the new challenges ``in a timely and effective way''.
One problem is inadequate infrastructure.
The library urgently needs a sophisticated system for receiving and managing digital documents deposited with the library and registered for copyright.
The library also needs to recruit and retain computer experts from a field already suffering a labor shortage.
The report also emphasized the need for the library to collaborate with other national libraries and institutions.
Ann Okerson, a committee member who is associate university librarian at Yale University, said: ``At a time when we are trying to build large, interconnected systems, it is unlikely that a single institution could create such complicated systems independently of other key players.
That goes for the Library of Congress or any other large library or organization''.
The committee expressed less concern over the library's ongoing efforts to make digital copies of items in its physical collection.
``Digitizing your analog material is less urgent,'' O'Donnell said.
``You can manage that by asking: `What's there a need for?
Why should it be made digital'?
But if you don't do it this year, it'll still be there in five years, and you could do it then.
Digital information that you're losing is probably lost forever''.
James H.
Billington, the librarian of Congress, who commissioned the study two years ago, said he was encouraged by the committee's findings.
``We view it as extremely positive that they are stressing the importance of this,'' Billington said in an interview.
He pointed out that a Digital Futures group within the library is already at work on many of the problems pinpointed by the National Academy report.
But the report, he said, brings a renewed sense of urgency to the situation.
``We've seen that this is a problem, and we now have a strong reinforcement for doing something on it at a more accelerated rate,'' he said.
The report is a set of recommendations only, and the library is not required to act on them.
Margaret Hedstrom, a committee member who is an associate professor in the School of Information at the University of Michigan, said, ``I suppose to some degree, a test of how serious they are is which of them they act on, and how soon''.
Billington said one of the main obstacles to carrying out the report's recommendations is financing.
In its 2001 budget request, the library asked for a $21 million increase for digital archiving, but the actual increase will probably fall far short of that.
``A major unresolved issue is how to fund this effort,'' Billington said.
&QL; (MORE) &QL; &QL; nn Private partnerships are one answer.
Six years ago, the library embarked on the National Digital Library Program, paid for in large part by corporations, foundations and individual donors.
By the end of this year, the library will have placed 5 million of its 119 million items on its American Memory site (memory.loc.gov), for use by the public.
The site gets more than 4 million hits each day, most of them from schoolchildren who go there to view artifacts like old baseball cards, Lincoln's papers and historic pamphlets from the National American Woman Suffrage Association.
A few other pieces of the digital puzzle are falling into place.
The library has preserved many of its digital resources, including the full-text databases of the Thomas system for legislative information and its own bibliographic databases.
The library has an extensive collection of CDs and CD-ROMs, and it is about to sign an agreement with the American Physical Society, which will regularly deposit its eight online physics journals.
The library is also referring researchers to databases that serve as portals to specialized sources of online information, including the table of contents of 10,000 journals and the full text of every doctoral dissertation written in the United States since 1861.
``Still, the rapid clip at which digital information of all kinds is proliferating has caught the Library of Congress largely unprepared,'' O'Donnell said.
``The sheer quantity of networked information is astonishing, and it keeps increasing at astonishing rates''.
&QL; &QL; (STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) In the course of studying the library's digital future, committee members pondered some fundamental questions.
What, for instance, constitutes a publication?
And what really deserves to be saved?
``If you accept that the Internet should also be collected, what does that mean''? asked Ginnie Cooper, director of libraries for the Multnomah County Library in Portland, Ore.
, and a committee member.
``Today's Internet?
Tomorrow's? All?
And do you collect just the first layer of a Web page and none of the links?
Three layers?
Ten''? The library applies the same criteria to digital material that it applies to physical material, Davenport said.
``We say, `If you would have been selecting it in physical form, then select it,''' she said.
``The format does not make a difference''.
Merely archiving digital material isn't enough, however.
The Library of Congress and other research libraries are wrestling with the problem of finding an effective means of preserving it.
Much digital material is actually more vulnerable than its acid-free-paper counterparts.
That is because computer hardware and software quickly become obsolete, and the durability of magnetic storage media like tapes and disks is limited.
Web-based documents that are filled with links pose yet another preservation problem because keeping an electronic research paper vital and relevant means keeping its links alive.
Billington said the library is looking into a number of preservation methods.
In general, O'Donnell said, ``I think they've done a worthy job of thinking their way through some pilots, saying, `Let's dip our toe firmly into the water and see what we can do'.
We say, `We applaud that, but now it's time to jump in.'''
WASHINGTON (AP) --Anyone who wants to pinpoint where James Bond met that blonde with the bottle of champagne on her curvy hip need only consult ``Language of the Land,'' an unusual book published by the Library of Congress offering maps of imaginary places.
Another map shows just where Tom Sawyer whitewashed his famous fence.
Still another points out the spot at which Paul Bunyan's ox Babe, trying to catch a field mouse, dug the Mammoth Cave.
L. Frank Baum's ``Wonderful World of Oz'' is charted.
Illustrator Dick Martin located the Shifting Sands and Deadly Desert, with Emerald City and Gunda's Palace smack in the middle.
A Yellow Brick Road is there too, though it's not clearly labeled.
``Literary maps depict ideas as much as places,'' wrote co-author Martha Hopkins in the book's introduction.
Most literary maps, Hopkins notes, are not drawn to scale and contain little detailed information on topography, geology, towns, rivers or roads.
They ``present a world in which authors and books are the dominant features,'' she explains.
Still, some of the places are real enough.
Author Ian Fleming made his James Bond stories credible by searching out authentic settings for what the library calls his ``assignments and assignations''.
Only ``Agent 007'' himself and his exploits sprang from Fleming's imagination.
J.R.R. Tolkien's completely imaginary ``Middle Earth'' rates three highly detailed maps.
Somewhere between reality and imagination lies Mark Twain's St.
Petersburg, the home of Tom Sawyer, modeled on Hannibal, Mo.
That's where the young Sam Clemens lived before he went piloting on the Mississippi, where he got his pen-name.
The half-whitewashed fence is on St.
Petersburg's Hill Street, just across from Becky Thatcher's house.
``There ain't anything that is so interesting to look at as a place that a book has talked about,'' Twain quotes Tom as saying in later life.
``Language of the Land'' describes and reproduces the fantastic maps, along with many others covering the literary landscape.
It was compiled by Hopkins of the library's Interpretive Programs Office and Michael Buscher of the Geography and Map Division.
The maps mostly cover English-speaking countries --Canada and Australia have maps that illustrate their best-known books.
Even one for Paris gives a large space to Oscar Wilde and American writer Gertrude Stein, whom the French do not see as important to their literature.
There's also a bright map, shaped and colored like a parrot --written in English -- devoted to Latin American writers.
Maps from days when Latin and Greek got more intensive study show the voyages of Odysseus and Aeneas.
Even troubled Balkan politics gets touched on --unintentionally.
A map on places in Hungarian literature includes portions of Romania which once belonged to Hungary, and which many Hungarians would dearly like to get back.

NEW YORK _ Betty Fussell, a food writer best known for a book on the history of corn, says she often buys books rather than trying to use those in the New York Public Library.
``Everything is inaccessible,'' she said.
Everything, to her and other food researchers, means the books kept in the library's annex at 521 W.
43rd St.
, off 10th Avenue.
The annex was closed to the public in the spring of 1994.
The library decided that it was more efficient for the public to use annex materials at the main building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, where security is better.
Since then, researchers have had to request volumes at the main library and then wait days for them to be delivered.
Some researchers warn that an irreplaceable trove of culinary knowledge is in disarray, as books are no longer delivered between floors but across town.
Andrew Smith, who has written a history of ketchup and is awaiting publication of ``Popped Culture: A Social History of Popcorn'' by the University of South Carolina Press, said he flies to Washington to use the Library of Congress in preference to trying to get the research materials he needs from the New York library's collection.
``It can take three days to get a book from the annex _ if you're lucky,'' he said.
``Half the time, the books are missing or misplaced, and the condition they're in is often a disaster''.
Protests over the inaccessibility and condition of the books have spurred the library, which acknowleges the problems, to make changes.
With some 100,000 food-related books, 20,000 of them cookbooks, the library boasts the second-largest culinary collection in the country after the Library of Congress.
Although some of the older books are in the rare book room at the main library, most are stored in the annex.
``I routinely get calls from researchers who are frustrated and intimidated trying to use the New York Public Library's collection,'' said Barbara Haber, the curator of books of the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass.
, which is known for its culinary collection.
``Food history is becoming more serious.
Many scholars are doing dissertations that are food related.
From where I sit it's a great collection, so why not take care of it''?
In April, Alexandra Leaf, the president of the Culinary Historians of New York, wrote to the organization's 255 members warning that ``a large number of books in the New York Public Library's culinary collection have badly deteriorated: bindings are worn, pages are crumbling or missing, and covers are chipped and cracked''.
Andrew Coe, the chairman of the group's cookbook committee, followed up with a letter to Dr.
Paul LeClerc, the library's president, stressing the importance of the collection and suggesting remedies.
Jean Bowen, the library's director of humanities, then informed Coe that the collection would be cleaned and put in protective boxes, and transferred to a storage center with zones of temperature and humidity controls.
The center, which the library is building in Princeton, N.J., is expected to be completed in about two years.
Once the books are transferred there, they will be delivered on request to Manhattan the next day.
Though Coe wrote in his letter that he was alarmed by ``the specter of fragile materials being shipped back and forth on the New Jersey Turnpike,'' he offered his group's help, including fund-raising, to preserve the culinary collection.
Some books, he said, might not survive until the new center is finished.
As examples, he cited a copy of ``Le Maitre d'Hotel Francais,'' a cookbook written in 1822 by Antoine Careme, some of whose foldout illustrations are tattered or missing altogether.
He also mentioned that one volume had been lost from Careme's five-volume ``L'Art de la Cuisine Francais au 19th Siecle,'' published 145 years ago, and other volumes have pages torn or missing.
On June 3 representatives of the library agreed to begin moving 17th- and 18th-century cookery volumes from the annex to the rare book room, where they will be more accessible.
A maximum of 50 books (of perhaps 80) will be moved, joining some 25,000 historic menus, one of the world's largest collections, in the rare book room.
``Mr. Coe gave us a very helpful list of rare books that are in the general collection,'' Ms.
Bowen said.
The transfer, which will begin with ``Le Nouveau et Parfaict Cuisinier'' (1668) by Pierre de Lune, is expected to take about a year.
The rest of the books will eventually be sent to Princeton.
The library has also agreed to allow scholars wishing to consult works catalogued as ``V'' class, which accounts for most of the culinary collections, to do so soon in the rare book room.
As for the group's offer to raise money to try to save the collection, Coe said that the library's directors did not encourage special provisions for the culinary books.
But, he said, the library's development office is exploring ways to allow the group to raise $100,000 for a curator to repair and restore materials.
Ms. Bowen, the library's humanities director, said, ``If there are people using our collections, and they have special concerns, I'm willing to listen.''
WASHINGTON --The world's biggest library could turn into just a ''museum of books'' unless it gets started this year on long-range plans to collect and secure the rising flood of digital information, a federal advisory panel warned on Wednesday.
If there are any questions about the right of the Library of Congress to collect material from American Web sites, the National Research Council said in a thick report, it should try to get the law changed to make clear that it has the right.
''(The Library) serves no narrow set of interests but the broadest public purposes of a powerful nation,'' the report said.
''It represents the commitment of the governing bodies of that nation to a strategy of preserving the heritage of the past and making it useful for the future''.
The National Research Council advises the federal government, the public and the country's scientists and engineers.
A committee prepared the report under the leadership of James J.
O'Donnell, chief information officer and vice provost of the University of Pennsylvania.
The library is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year.
It has more than 9 million books, 11 million films and photos and more than 53 million manuscripts.
Each year it puts about 1 million largely historical items --such as the papers of Presidents Washington and Lincoln -- on its Web site.
''The committee's purpose...
is to encourage readers of this report to take a deep breath and to look out to the horizon,'' it said.
''With the Library and its friends focused on a common vision, it will be easier to take the steps --some small, some large -- that need to be taken.
''None of this will be cheap.
The Library has grown enormously beyond what Congress could have expected in 1800.
... For what (the Library) is and has been, the future will seem expensive, but for the value it delivers to the nation and the world, the Library is and always has been a bargain''.

BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) --Susan Meinheit, librarian at the U.S.
Library of Congress, noted today that the facility houses a collection of some 7,700 precious Tibetan books, most of which were brought to the country by western diplomats and explorers.
"The collection includes more than 300 rare volumes and original copies," according to Meinheit, who presented a detailed paper and report to the library's Tibetan collection to the 1997 Beijing Seminar on Tibetan Studies which opened yesterday in Beijing.
She said: "the library also has more than 300 xylographic and hand-written manuscripts".
She noted that William Rockwill, U.S. envoy to China in 1905, presented the library with 65 volumes of original Tibetan books, including a rare edition of "Changtiao Shu" (plate book) wrapped in yellow silk.
A handwritten note from Rockwill indicates that the book was a gift from the 13th Dalai Lama.
"Changtiao Shu", a unique type of Tibetan book wrapped in fine silk, consists of unbound xylographic pages in wooden covers.
Meinheit noted that two Americans --Dr.
Berthold Laufer (1874-1934) and explorer Joseph Rock (1884-1962) --were also major contributors to the library.
Laufer sold to the library the Chien-lung Palace Edition of the Mahayana Sutra which was printed in rare red ink.
Scholars with the Beijing Library note that a large number of ancient Tibetan books can be found in numerous foreign countries and regions.
For example, a unique volume of the ancient Tibetan Medical Dictionary, the oldest and most detailed publication of its kind, is housed in London's Museum of Great Britain.
Chinese scholars must visit the museum to read, microfilm or copy the original.
The Beijing Library, China's largest library, currently houses a collection of 3,500 volumes of ancient Tibetan manuscripts, and 1,500 Tibetan studies books published since 1949.
WASHINGTON _ The biggest debate on Capitol Hill _ the one that tells us most about our national character, the one that offers the insight into the national mind _ is not about the future of Medicare, or how to use the budget surplus, or whether taxes should be cut, or whether defense spending ought to rise.
The biggest debate on Capitol Hill is over whether books ought to be shelved by size.
The argument is raging only yards from the Capitol, in the national library _ or, more precisely, in Congress's library _ and it is being joined with as much passion as any floor debate in the House, and watched with as much attention as any mark-up session in a Senate appropriations subcommittee.
Shelving books by size, rather than content, is the idea of some administrators of the library, which is awash in books.
Too many books.
If all the large books were together on big shelves, all the small books would be together on small shelves, there would be no gaping holes _ lost space _ in between.
Such a plan could, say its supporters, increase shelf availability by as much as 33 percent.
Ah, but at what cost?
At stake is the place of the written word in the American imagination; the nation's devotion to the fine and practiced art of browsing, even in the amazon.com age; the scholar's impulse to break learning into subject areas; the researcher's conviction that a truth, if not necessarily the truth, can be stumbled upon if only a liberated mind is let loose amongst the stacks of a great library.
The debate is stirring unusual bitterness inside the ordinarily tranquil study carrels and stacks, which hold 115,506,000 items, including more than 17,772,400 books.
The very idea of shelving books by size _ the notion of putting the big ones in one section of the library and the little ones somewhere else _ is anathema to book lovers, researchers, and scholars.
It is a dagger at the heart of the bibliophile's pastime, browsing.
And it is a threat to the greatest delight of the researcher, serendipity.
But it is more than that.
It screams order in a world where learning only serves to underline the persistence of disorder.
It imposes neatness on the messy turmoil of the mind.
It celebrates efficiency in a realm of human endeavor where the great harvests often come amid chaotic inefficiency.
So far scores of Library of Congress librarians, the Library of Congress Professional Association, and Local 2910 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees have howled in protest.
In truth, even the people floating the idea aren't wild about it.
But it hasn't gone away.
Neither have the library's space problems.
Indeed, they've only become greater.
Take a few steps into Deck 9 of the John Adams Building, one of the three massive structures the library maintains on Capitol Hill, and you'll see why.
Pause at the QA 76 section, where books on computers are collected.
So many books sit on the floor that a pair of size 11 loafers cannot navigate the tiny space remaining between the stacks.
A small leak from the sprinklers would convey some of the world's most sophisticated mathematical thought to damp oblivion; the books sit directly beneath the water spouts.
Sitting on the floor, the back cover at a 45-degree angle and the spine under enormous strain, is a copy of the fourth edition of Stephen Wolfram's ``The Mathematica''.
This is a book in the throes of destruction in the world's greatest book collection, dedicated above all to preservation.
Down on Deck 7 of the stacks the situation is little better.
There, amid the neatly stacked collections of the library's justly celebrated Asia collection, is the space problem displayed in stark and unforgiving light.
On the shelves are thousands of books, assembled crisply by subject.
But around the shelves themselves, in a scene more evocative of an industrial launderer than a national library, are 21 massive yellow tubs, strewn full of books, piled every which way, their jagged edges forming a forbidding glacier field of knowledge.
This crisis in the rarefied air of the Library of Congress is not a testimony to the sloth of the library's 4,213 employees, nor a dramatic demonstration that the library's annual federal appropriation (some $400 million) is too small.
It is simply a measure of the explosion of information, publications, monographs, newspapers, pamphlets, maps, moving images, photographs, posters, prints, and drawings.
But mostly the problem is books.
The book collection of the world's biggest library _ half the collection is in languages other than English, 460 in all _ is growing by about 300,000 volumes a year.
``We're running out of space,'' complains Steven Herman, the chief of the collection-management division of the library.
``We have to see if we can make the most efficient use of the shelves we have now''.
There's no prospect of getting more space on Capitol Hill; there simply is no more space on Capitol Hill, and because the Library attracts about 2 million people a year _ making it one of the biggest attractions for tourists in the capital _ the notion of moving the Gutenberg Bible and the Giant Bible of Mainz, both produced in Germany in the 15th century, from their current locations is unthinkable.
In desperation _ quiet desperation, as Henry David Thoreau might put it _ the library already is taking some significant steps to expand its shelf space.
In 14 months the library will open a huge off-site storage space in Fort Meade, Md.
, which should relieve some of the pressure _ but at a price.
The Fort Meade space will not be open to browsing, and any book that a researcher requests won't be available on Capitol Hill for half a day, maybe longer.
The library is planning two delivery runs a day from its new state-of-the-art building (modern security, sophisticated temperature and humidity controls) but researchers in Washington for only a day are almost certainly going to be disappointed.
A special library task force has come up with a number of options to ease the strain.
One is double-shelving, or placing a smaller row of books in front of a larger row.
The library already employs a similar technique, and so the researcher rummaging through the official papers of the State of Ohio is going to find the volume containing the Senate Journal of 1896 sitting behind the House Journal of 1894 on the shelf; this works only because the volumes are chronological and of uniform size.
But the real way to save space may be to shelve the books by size.
Each book would have a fixed place on a fixed shelf.
No need to keep some empty space at the end of the shelf in the anticipation that new works might be on the way.
No need to worry just where that new volume should rest, between which other volumes.
They'd go in, all in a row, catalogued precisely by computer, so that the researcher looking for a copy of James Morris's ``Pax Britannica'' or Carl Yastrzemski and Al Hirshberg's ``Yaz'' would know exactly where to look.
Moreover, William L.
Shirer's ``The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,'' Dr.
Suess's ``The Cat in the Hat,'' and John P.
Marquand's ``The Late George Apley'' might be sitting there right beside each other, being roughly the same size.
Herman knows the plan has some disadvantages.
``We get questions no one else can answer,'' he says.
``One of the ways to answer them to to go to a section of the stacks and fan through tables of contents or indexes and look.
It's a lot easier to look up something on lighthouses, for example, if you can just go to one place and browse.
It's easier to go to a shelf and see exactly what's in the books.
``There are some very good arguments for continuing that,'' he says.
``But it takes up significant amounts of space''.
But the argument about shelving books by size is worth having, not only because the great surge in printed material is causing a problem that many libraries _ from Harvard and Cornell to the national libraries of France and Britain _ can no longer avoid.
It is worth having, too, because it raises important questions about the human mind and the human spirit.
And so now on Capitol Hill, so often the site for discussions trite and trivial, the topic finally has turned to a clash of real values, to a subject that has enduring significance, to a topic that, more than most others, defines who we are, and how we conserve the things that we value the most.
This debate is occasioned, like most of the important debates of the last quarter-century, by a deficit of some sort.
But this one, unlike the budget deficit (which has been slain) and the trade deficit (which persists amid our prosperity), doesn't exist primarily in accounting ledgers.
It exists in real, physical space.

WASHINGTON (AP) --A $1.5 million public-private project to preserve hundreds of movies, such as Paul Robeson's ``The Emperor Jones'' and Frank Capra's World War II series ``Why We Fight,'' is being organized by a federally authorized foundation.
Officials on Tuesday announced the millennium program, called Treasures of American Film Archives.
The coordinators are the National Film Preservation Foundation, set up by Congress, and the National Endowment for the Arts.
The Pew Charitable Trusts in Philadelphia is making a $200,000 contribution on the heels of a $500,000 NEA grant in February.
The American Film Institute and other industry groups have also contributed.
Altogether, 17 separate archives will take part, including five federal agencies.
Hundreds of movies, some only a few minutes long, will be copied onto modern film stocks.
Workers will preserve a master copy, from which viewing copies will be made.
The Library of Congress will work on ``The Emperor Jones'' and a collection from the laboratories of inventor Thomas A.
Edison. It will also preserve footage taken in the field by anthropologist Margaret Mead, author of the landmark ``Coming of Age in Samoa''.
Movies made before the 1950s were on highly flammable nitrate film, library officials say.
Since then, newer and safer film stock has been used.
The National Archives will do the seven-film Capra series, commissioned by the War Department to overcome the isolationist feeling strong in the United States before World War II.
Duke Ellington's baritone saxophonist for 35 years, Harry Carney, took pictures of the orchestra between 1938 and 1941.
The National Museum of American History will be in charge of those, and of shorts on communications technology that Western Union started more than 70 years ago.
The concept of poet laureate is British: an official court poet, appointed by the king or queen.
The first was Ben Jonson.
Other notable poet laureates have been John Dryden, William Wordsworth, and Alfred Tennyson.
The current British laureate is Andrew Motion.
Like his predecessors, he is paid about $300 a year and a cask of white wine.
The US poet laureateship began in 1937 as the position of consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress.
In 1986, Senator Spark Matsunaga, a Hawaii Democrat, added the title ``poet laureate''.
``My initial reaction when Congress passed the law,'' said Stanley Kunitz, who is laureate-designate and was poetry consultant from 1974 to 1976, ``was that no one can be poet laureate.
.. . We are such a diversified culture that to assume one is actually the poet laureate of the American people is vainglorious''.
He added with a laugh, ``But one does the best one can''.
The job pays $35,000.
Duties are few: Give a reading at the start of the laureate's tenure, deliver an essay at the end, and help organize the library's literary programs.
The three most recent laureates, Rita Dove, Robert Hass, and Robert Pinsky, have redefined the post from one that was almost entirely honorary _ ``Life will go on exactly as before,'' said Robert Penn Warren upon being named first laureate _ to one that has become almost evangelical.
Pinsky has kept up a particularly energetic travel and speaking schedule, which has led some to question whether a nonagenarian like Kunitz is up to the job.
``It was a remarkable performance, and nobody will ever duplicate it,'' Kunitz said.
``Naturally, I don't intend to be _ how shall I phrase it?
_ sedentary, though I have no intention of being as much of an activist as Robert has been''.
US Poet Laureates have included: Robert Penn Warren, 1986-87; Richard Wilbur, 1987-88; Howard Nemerov, 1988-90; Mark Strand, 1990-91; Joseph Brodsky, 1991-92; Mona Van Duyn, 1992-93; Rita Dove, 1993-95; Robert Hass, 1995-97; Robert Pinsky, 1997-2000; and Stanley Kunitz, 2000-01 .
WASHINGTON (AP) --The nation's ninth poet laureate is getting a third, unprecedented year on the job.
Robert Pinsky, who teaches creative writing at Boston University, doesn't have the official wine allowance that Britain's poet laureate has been entitled to ever since Shakespeare's drinking friend, Ben Jonson, took the job in 1616.
``I've heard that they're going to abolish all that medieval nonsense, give him a one-year term like we have and put him on a salary,'' Pinsky said Monday about the British poet laureate, who serves for life.
Ted Hughes, Britain's last poet laureate, died last year.
Pinsky, 58, is the ninth American laureate since Congress created the title in 1985.
He was reappointed to a third year Monday by Librarian of Congress James H.
Billington. Pinsky has been especially active, appearing in public and on TV, emphasizing poetry as part of life --even poems composed with words on refrigerator magnets.
He will preside Wednesday at two readings at the library, one for youngsters of school age and one for prominent Washingtonians.
``We're hoping to have Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district's representative in Congress and William S.
Cohen, the defense secretary, to read their favorites,'' Pinsky said.
Cohen is a novelist, but Pinsky said he didn't know if the defense secretary had written any poetry.
Pinsky has been pushing a project in which President Clinton, other prominent people and ordinary Americans are asked to read their favorite poems aloud.
About 1,000 audio and 200 video recordings will be made.
They will be deposited in the Library of Congress as a record of how Americans felt about poetry at the turn of the millennium.
Next April, Pinsky will take a major part in a conference on ``Poetry and the American People,'' celebrating the library's 200th anniversary.
Pinsky gets an assistant, an office at the library and $35,000 a year.
His allowance comes from privately collected money, as does $20,000 each for three special consultants he will have for the first time this year.
The consultants will be Rita Dove, a former poet laureate, and Louise Gluck and W.S.
Merwin, both also well-known as poets.
WASHINGTON _ Jerry Jones, the flamboyant Dallas Cowboys owner best known in the rough and tumble worlds of sports and business, made a foray into the intellectual world on Wednesday with a $1 million gift to honor Thomas Jefferson.
Jones and his wife, Gene, gave the money to the Library of Congress to replace volumes in the third president's personal library that were destroyed in a fire in the Capitol in 1851.
``It's great to be on the team in this way,'' Jones said, speaking at a news conference in the ornate office of James Billington, librarian of Congress.
Pointing to a display of some of Jefferson's original books, Jones called them ``treasures of our past'' and said he wanted students learning about Jefferson ``to feel the roar of the crowd, so to speak''.
Also evoking sports imagery, Billington said: ``The generosity of this gift is, in itself, remarkable.
But in the heart of Washington Redskins territory, it is particularly appreciated''.
Jones kicked off the library's plan to celebrate its 200th anniversary next year by giving Billington a duplicate of a grammar book purchased by Jefferson in 1785.
The book, published in 1765 with the title ``Hermes, or a Philosophical Inquiry Concerning Universal Grammar,'' was written by James Harris, an English scholar.
The Library of Congress plans to use the gift from Jones to recreate Jefferson's original collection of 6,400 books by replacing 987 destroyed or missing volumes with rare duplicates from other libraries, private collections or antiquarian booksellers.
Asked to compare himself with Jefferson, the Cowboys' owner at first demurred, saying that the author of the Declaration of Independence ``is an example to us all''.
Then he added: ``I'd like to think he was a sportsman''.
As if on cue, the library's expert on Jefferson, curator Gerard Gawalt, stepped forward to speak about Jefferson's love of horse racing and hunting.
``The fit between Mr.
Jones and Mr.
Jefferson is a lot closer than one would think at first glance,'' Gawalt said.
``I'll take that,'' Jones said.
Jefferson had a direct connection to the Library of Congress.
His books were purchased by Congress to be the core of the library after British invaders burned the Capitol in 1814 during the War of 1812, which ended with a peace treaty signed Dec.
24, 1814, in Ghent, Belgium.
The Library of Congress was first housed in the Capitol; it is now directly across the street from the Capitol.
The second fire, in 1851, started in a faulty chimney flue in the Capitol and destroyed two-thirds of the collection.
Jefferson's catalogue survived the flames, enabling curators to rebuild the collection.
Billington described it Wednesday as a ``universal collection'' that reflected the diverse interests ``of this universal man''.
Among the items that the Library of Congress' experts will be seeking are a pamphlet on pomegranates and a book on pasta machines.
The Library of Congress has a collection of more than 115 million items, including the diaries of aviation pioneers Orville and Wilbur Wright, the music of George and Ira Gershwin and Leonard Bernstein.
It is now digitizing many of its collections to make them accessible on the Internet.

WASHINGTON (AP) --More than 30 celebrities -- including TV's Big Bird and Gen.
Colin Powell --were feted Monday as ''Living Legends'' as they helped celebrate the 200th birthday of the Library of Congress.
Historian Jaroslav Pelikan from Yale University was chosen to speak on behalf of the group.
They received medals, along with another 54 celebrities who were not present.
''My first thought,'' Pelikan told the group to explain why he was picked as spokesman, ''is that I seem to be the only one among those present whose last name puts him into the same class with Big Bird''.
Then, turning serious, he compared the library with the ancient one in Alexandria, Egypt, which had carved over its entrance the words ''Hospital of the Soul''.
Pelikan, a historian of religion, was introduced by Librarian James H.
Billington as the author of 30 books and translator of the works of Martin Luther.
Former Boston Celtics basketball star Larry Bird, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, 91-year-old practicing heart surgeon Dr.
Michael DeBakey and comedian Bob Hope also were honored.
Big Bird --Carroll Spinney -- joined the others on a stage set up on the Capitol grounds across the street from the library.
He wore his regular eight-foot fuzzy yellow costume, adorned for the occasion with a red and blue striped necktie.
As the first speaker from the group on stage, he said he was glad to be in the District of Columbia.
''D and C are two of my favorite letters,'' he added instructively.
''Gee, I've never been to a birthday party for a library before''.
Looking forward as well as back, the Library also opened a new Web site for children and a reconstruction of President Thomas Jefferson's own book collection.
Acquired after British forces burned the original library in 1814, Jefferson's 6,487 books became the core of what is now the world's biggest one.
At last count, the Library of Congress had 9,429,184 books and nearly 110 million other items, in 460 languages.
The Post Office marked the occasion by issuing a new 33-cent stamp which shows the bright inside of the dome over the library's main reading room.
The U.S.
Mint issued the first commemorative coins of the century: a silver dollar that will sell for $28 to $32, and its first gold-and-platinum $10 piece that will cost $395 to $425, complete with a satin-lined presentation case.

CHICAGO (AP) _ Almost two-thirds of traditional U.S. medical schools now teach alternative therapies, including chiropractic, acupuncture, herbal remedies and mind-body medicine, a survey found.
With millions of Americans visiting alternative practitioners yearly, educators whose job is to prepare doctors of the future have no choice but to ``respond to this relentless challenge to evolve,'' researchers said.
The survey of the nation's 125 medical schools was published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
The survey, conducted last fall, found that 75 of the 117 responding schools offered elective courses in alternative medicine or included those topics in required courses.
Less than two years before, an AMA poll of the same schools found that only 46 were teaching such topics.
``That's an extraordinary rise for a very traditional and conservative area,'' said lead author Miriam S.
Wetzel, a curriculum coordinator at Harvard Medical School.
``Now, these things are being taught in Western medical schools, not necessarily the techniques of how to do them, but certainly about them''.
Dr. David Spiegel, medical director of the Complementary Medicine Clinic at Stanford University Medical Center, said he was not surprised by the survey's findings.
``There has been sort of a sea change,'' he said.
``Traditional doctors are seeing that people are voting with their feet and with their pocketbooks''.
A 1993 survey suggested that Americans spent dlrs 14 billion yearly on alternative care, much of it out of their own pockets.
Health insurers in the past have refused to pay for alternative therapies, but that also is changing as insurers realize they can save money.
For example, unconventional treatment might call for exercise or chiropractic or acupuncture for back pain, while the traditional approach might be surgery.
NEW YORK _ Some people spend hundreds of dollars on skin-care products in attempts to regain a more youthful look and to smooth wrinkles.
They try creams, ointments and herbs, as well as plastic surgery.
Or acupuncture.
Acupuncture, the 5,000-year-old Chinese healing practice, is used in the United States not only for preventing and treating diseases, relieving pain and anesthetizing patients for surgery, but also for face-lifts.
Acupuncture has been used to improve appearance for at least two decades in this country, for patients who do not want to undergo surgery.
But only some acupuncturists will do this.
Many practitioners find the corrective work less professionally satisfying than treating diseases and other ailments.
Acupuncture is based on the Chinese philosophy called Dao.
Dao is believed to be directly related to health and well-being, moderation and harmony in mind and body.
Practitioners seek to restore this balance through Chi, or Qi, Shen and Jing.
Chi is said to be the energy found in the heart and lungs, in circulating blood and oxygen.
The Shen is the soul, manifested in personality, perception and awareness of self.
The Jing is responsible for growth, development and reproduction.
According to the philosophy, the acupuncturists' role is to help people balance their life of excesses__stress, vices, bad diet__ to achieve a long, healthy life.
In an acupuncture face-lift, 36-millimeter needles are inserted into facial muscles.
These needles are believed to produce tiny electric stimulation in anatomic points bringing the blood to the surface, in this case, the face, for better circulation, said Phyllis M.
Shapiro, an acupuncturist licensed by New York State.
In acupuncture, there are about 2,000 spots in the body, or acupoints, used for different treatments.
The points are connected through 12 main channels, or meridians, according to acupuncturists.
Acupuncture ``can make the skin look healthier,'' by increasing the blood flow to the tissues, Mitchell said, ``but can't produce drastic changes''.
Some acupuncturists say it is more stimulating treating patients to restore their health rather than enhance appearance.
``There's less diagnosis,'' said acupuncturist Craig Mitchell from Pacific Institute of Oriental Medicine in New York.
``It's not necessary to have a thorough interview'' with the patient if she wants to tone up her face, Mitchell said.
For him as for other colleagues, using acupuncture as a tool for healing is a more challenging job than making people feel good by ``pumping up'' their faces, said acupuncturist Cameron Bishop of Western Communities Family Practice Association in Florida.
Face-lifts are ``like washing a car,'' Bishop said.
``It's boring work.
Would you rather wash a car or do something more interesting''?
For patients seeking a faster and more permanent alteration in their appearance, plastic surgery is the best solution.
Plastic surgery is often recommended for patients who are 45 or older.
Plastic surgery uses incisions to cut the loose skin and fat off the face.
``It's not just stretching and pulling the skin,'' said Minas Constantinides, who is a plastic surgeon who works on face-lifts and is a member of the American Medical Association.
Face-lift surgery is an operation that costs between $7,000 and $20,000 and it lasts for years.
Acupuncture treatments would take at least 10 weeks to show improvement and do not assure a permanent physical change.
But with acupuncture the treatment is much cheaper, costing about $115 per session, at one session a week.
Acupuncture is one of the least expensive ways to have a face-lift without spending time and going through surgery trying to look younger.
And while some acupuncturists prefer an in-depth diagnosis and a healing treatment, if they have to ``lift faces to make people feel younger and happier'' they will do it, Bishop said.

&UR; (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate) &LR; &QL; Cocaine addicts looking to get clean may want to turn to needles for help.
A new study by Yale University researchers says acupuncture is an effective treatment for cocaine abuse.
The finding gives the ancient Chinese remedy a much-needed foothold in Western medicine, experts say, because it's based on a well-controlled clinical study from a major American medical school.
A report on the finding appears in the latest issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine.
Although the work might be the first large, controlled trial of acupuncture for cocaine addiction, it's not the first time anyone has used the treatment for substance abuse.
Indeed, some 1,000 clinics worldwide offer the needle therapy for the symptoms of cocaine withdrawal, including nearly 175 in New York state alone, says Dr.
Michael Smith, a pioneer in the field.
Smith, a Cornell University psychiatrist who has been practicing acupuncture at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx for nearly two decades, calls the Yale research ``a very well-documented report with high standards that shows that acupuncture helps reduce the craving for cocaine''.
The study, led by Yale psychologist Arthur Margolin, looked at the effectiveness of acupuncture in 82 heroin and cocaine addicts who were getting methadone for the first habit but nothing for the second.
Margolin and his colleagues split the subjects into three groups.
The first received eight weeks of standard addiction acupuncture therapy, based on guidelines from the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association, which calls for three to five needles placed at specific points in the outer ear.
The second group had sham needles placed in non-therapeutic sites on the ear.
The third group watched relaxing videos.
Urine tests for cocaine were taken three times a week over the trial's two-month period, during which all patients received counseling and group therapy.
By the last week of the trial, nearly 54 percent of the patients in the acupuncture group had cocaine-free urine, compared with 23 percent of those in the sham needle group and only 9 percent of those who watched videos.
``This was a highly active placebo arm and we still found an effect over and above that,'' says Margolin, who notes that the effect of acupuncture was as good as that from drug treatment for cocaine addiction.
HOW IT WORKS STILL A MYSTERY While the latest work suggests that acupuncture helps control cravings for cocaine, it doesn't say anything about why it succeeds.
``Quite honestly, we don't know why it works,'' Margolin says.
``We're just beginning to look in Western terms'' at the biological mechanism behind acupuncture's effect.
Smith, however, says tests show that the needles, if properly placed, restore balance to the body's electrical currents.
``Acupuncture helps the body help itself''.
Still, he admits, no one really understands the full mechanics of this assistance.
Whatever the reason, Margolin and Smith agree that acupuncture alone isn't a sufficient treatment for addiction, be it to cocaine, alcohol, tobacco or other substances.
``This is a treatment that helps a person participate in all the other treatments we have,'' such as counseling and group therapy, Smith says.
In fact, by law, ear acupuncture for addicts can only be performed in the context of a licensed drug-treatment program that includes these other methods, he says.
However, acupuncture does have a key advantage over counseling, Smith says.
If addicts refuse to acknowledge their drug cravings, therapists have little recourse to treat them.
But with acupuncture, he says, addicts can get treated without losing face.
``You can treat a problem that the patient doesn't admit to''.
Barbara Mitchell, a licensed acupuncturist and executive director of the Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Alliance in Olalla, Wash.
, says the Yale research lends an extra measure of credibility to the practice.
On the other hand, Mitchell says, with an estimated 15,000 licensed acupuncturists in the United States already, the field is well on its way to becoming mainstream.
Many insurance companies now reimburse for the treatment, which got a major shot in the arm in 1997 when the National Institutes of Health held a consensus conference to discuss the scientific validity of needle therapy.
That report found that acupuncture helped control pain from dental procedures, menstruation and other conditions, with fewer side effects than conventional remedies, Mitchell says.
---- (The HealthScout.com Web site is at http://www.HealthScout.com.)
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) --The following are major news items in leading U.S. newspapers today: The Washington Post: -- The U.S.
National Institutes of Health yesterday concluded for the first time that the ancient Chinese art of acupuncture is an effective treatment for certain kinds of pain and nausea and shows promise for a variety of other conditions, providing an unprecedented endorsement by the Western medical establishment.
The Wall Street Journal: --Some Wall Street economists cut estimates for 1998 economic growth by 0.5 percentage point or more, because of the turmoil in Southeast Asia but also due to some domestic concerns.
The New York Times: --Iraq is using the cover of negotiations to hide evidence about its arms programs, the chief investigator for the United Nations said.
LOS ANGELES, September 21 (Xinhua) --Almost 70 percent of Americans now turn to alternative forms of medicine to cure their illness when regular medicine has failed, according to a recent nationwide survey.
The random telephone survey of 1,000 people, conducted by the Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention, found that 56 percent of those surveyed believe their health plans should cover alternative care.
They are also willing to pay for it in their medical insurance premiums.
The label "alternative medicine" covers a range of products and treatment, some derived from centuries-old spiritual and healing traditions of non-Western societies, others as new and high-tech as pressurized oxygen chambers.
In common is that they all fall outside the list of "standard" therapies approved by U.S. government agencies and medical authorities.
While the Stanford survey reflected the growing acceptance of alternative medicine in the United States, half the people who seek out alternative practitioners still rely on Western medicine for basic health care.
On average, participants in the study made four visits annually to a conventional doctor.
On average, the survey respondents said they would be willing to spend an additional 15 U.S. dollars a month in health insurance for complementary services such as chiropractic, massage or acupuncture.
Five years ago, a landmark survey by Harvard Medical School revealed that one in three Americans used non-traditional or non-Western medicine, spending 14 billion dollars a year in treatment.
Earlier this year, a Los Angeles Times report said that alternative medicine is now an 18-billion-dollar industry edging into the U.S. mainstream.
Americans will spend 3.65 billion dollars on herbal remedies this year, a 100 percent increase since 1994.
California takes the lead in this trend.
Six major health insurance firms in California alone decided this year to cover acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine.
A medical center in Los Angeles opened its integrative medicine program in May.
And the Stanford University Medical Center opened a similar patient-care program in April.
What attracts consumers, medical centers and insurance companies is the hope that alternative medical practices may provide health plans with a relatively low-cost feature.
Moreover, doctors say, there is a negative feeling toward Western medicine's ability to deal with certain health problems, particularly chronic diseases.
Western medicine has made considerably less progress against lingering health problems such as Alzheimer's disease, arthritis and chronic pain.
Acupuncture appears to help some cocaine addicts escape their dependence on the drug, according to a report published Tuesday by researchers at Yale University.
Experts on drug abuse say cocaine addiction is one of the most difficult forms of drug dependency to treat.
And while many treatment centers have been using acupuncture for some time, usually in combination with other therapies, scientific studies of its effectiveness in treating cocaine addiction have been inconclusive.
In the Yale study, 53.8 percent of the subjects who had needles inserted in four acupuncture ``zones'' in the ear five times a week tested free of cocaine at the end of the eight-week study period.
In comparison, 23.5 percent of control subjects given ``sham'' acupuncture treatments and 9.1 percent of subjects who watched relaxation videos tested free of the drug during the final week of the study.
The report appears in the August issue of the journal Archives of Internal Medicine.
The study involved 82 men and women in the New Haven area who were addicted to both heroin and cocaine.
They were receiving methadone treatment for the heroin addiction but were still using cocaine regularly.
Thirty of the subjects, however, were dropped from the study after missing sessions.
The researchers called the findings promising but cautioned that the study was relatively small and that more research needed to be done to confirm the results.
They also said that acupuncture was not a panacea and suggested that it should be used along with other therapies like counseling.
``These are a difficult group of people to deal with,'' said Dr.
Herbert Kleber, the medical director of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse in New York and a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, who is familiar with the study.
``We don't have medicine for treating cocaine addiction, and acupuncture appears to be a useful adjunct for decreasing dependence,'' Kleber said.
Dr. Arthur Margolin, a research scientist in the department of psychiatry at Yale's medical school and lead author of the report, said that among the benefits of acupuncture were its low cost and lack of side effects.
And unlike pharmaceutical treatments, Margolin said, it can be offered to pregnant women.
The study's findings are also encouraging, he added, because ``they suggest that with the proper groundwork we can conduct rigorous trials of complementary or alternative therapies''.
One obstacle that has confronted researchers trying to determine whether acupuncture works has been the difficulty of finding convincing ``placebo'' treatments to act as scientific controls.
For the sham needle treatment, the Yale researchers inserted four needles along the rim of the ear, in spots that are not commonly used in acupuncture treatment and had little effect when stimulated in preliminary tests.
The relaxation tapes were used to control for the possibility that simply sitting quietly for 45 minutes in a darkened room might itself produce an effect.
In the acupuncture treatment, the needles were inserted five times a week for about 45 minutes per session, according to guidelines developed at Lincoln Hospital in New York, and adopted by the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association.
Urine samples were taken three times a week to test for cocaine use.
All the subjects in the study, which was financed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, also received psychotherapy as part of the treatment program.
Margolin said that scientists did not yet understand how acupuncture might work to curb addiction but that there were a variety of theories.
For example, acupuncture has been linked to the release of opioids, the body's natural painkillers, which might help reduce the craving for cocaine.
Or the procedure might stimulate the vagus nerve that runs through the center of the ear, producing a relaxing effect.
In Chinese medicine, Margolin added, the stimulation points used in the study are associated with a diagnosis called ``empty fire''.
``This is a pretty good either metaphorical or literal description of a cocaine-addicted individual,'' he said.
NEW YORK _ The stagger in his gait and pleading in his eyes said it all.
Al had taken everything that a greyhound could be expected to, and then he had taken even more.
Once he had been a racer, sleek and fleet.
Then came abandonment on the beaches of Brooklyn.
Mercy arrived in the form of a new owner and a home in the New Jersey suburbs, but when he was 8, Al's back gave out.
Two painful surgeries and more than $6,000 later, he still wasn't the dog he used to be.
His journey into Manhattan on a recent Saturday morning was a pilgrimage of stubborn hope.
There, in a back yard in Murray Hill, Al dipped into his own Lourdes, a circular pool of heated water that might do what the operations, acupuncture and Bach flower essences had not: heal him.
With Jodi Richard, a trained canine hydrotherapist, holding tight to his rump, Al paddled and paddled, going nowhere fast, his gimpy back legs freed from gravity so they could get the exercise they sorely needed.
His owner, Jackie Wright-Minogue, rushed to him as soon as he left the pool to rest under a pink towel on the cushion of a lawn chair.
``I want him to get well,'' she said, articulating the simple wish that had wrought such complicated ministrations.
``I want him to have a good life''.
That desire, seemingly boundless among many pet owners, has ushered in a whole new era in animal care.
Ms. Richard's business, Bonnie's K 9 Swim Therapy Center, named for her German shepherd, is but one example.
Elsewhere around the New York region, veterinarians are hooking dogs and cats to electric acupuncture machines, dosing them with homeopathic remedies, placing putatively therapeutic magnets beneath their beds, even spraying the air around them with lavender, lemon or eucalyptus in the name of aromatherapy.
All of this is perhaps the inevitable outgrowth of a culture blissed out on St.
John's wort and mesmerized by Andrew Weil.
It is also the ultimate illustration of the degree to which many Americans insist on sharing their own habits and extravagances, from summer camp to spa treatments, with the four-legged members of their families.
Dr. Michael Garvey, director of the Bobst Hospital at the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan, described it as a kind of cross-species psychological transference.
``We project our character flaws on our pets,'' he said.
``We project our behavior on them.
I've even had clients project their religion on them.
This is very much in the same fashion''.
Could your cat benefit from an adjustment?
There are a growing number of veterinary chiropractors on hand.
Is there knotting in your dog's muscles?
You can take him to a canine massage therapist.
If it has been tried on people, it is being tried on pets, and not just on the most common species.
Dr. Gerald Buchoff, a veterinarian in North Bergen, N.J., has performed acupuncture on iguanas with brittle bones.
Dr. Marcie Fallek, who has offices in New York and Fairfield, Conn.
, has administered homeopathic treatments _ solutions with minuscule traces of special plant or mineral ingredients _ to a pet raccoon that was seemingly depressed over a canine companion's death and had stopped using its litter box.
The raccoon's owner, fearful that law enforcement authorities would learn that she was keeping a wild animal, declined to be interviewed for this article, even anonymously, Fallek said.
``Her psychic told her there might be trouble,'' Fallek explained.
``Plus, Mercury's in retrograde and, well, you know''.
Which raises the obvious question: How much of this is pure quackery?
As it turns out, less than one might think.
Dr. Richard Swanson, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association, said that the legitimacy of acupuncture, at least on mammals with skeletal structures similar to people's, was beyond doubt, and that hydrotherapy and chiropractic were probably effective.
But Swanson cast a more skeptical eye on homeopathy, Bach flower essences and the like.
``That's really getting on the fringe,'' he said, adding that a lack of rigorous scientific study into such treatments undercut the sunny testimonials of some veterinarians and their clients.
``The world is made up of a lot of very vulnerable and gullible people,'' he cautioned.
It is also made up of increasingly generous people when it comes to the vim and vigor of their hirsute _ or, for that matter, feathered _ loved ones.
According to the association, expenditures by Americans on all kinds of veterinary care for dogs, cats and birds rose to $11.1 billion in 1996, the most recent year studied, from $6.9 billion in 1991 (the figures were not adjusted for inflation).
During that period, the pet population grew only modestly.
The newfangled treatments that come under the rubric of alternative or holistic veterinary medicine certainly are not cheap.
In New York City _ where, granted, prices for most things tend to be highest _ half an hour of acupuncture generally costs $50 to $75; an hour's worth of immersion in Ms.
Richard's healing waters costs $75.
Because treatments are usually repeated over the course of several weeks, the final bill can run into the high hundreds.
Alternative veterinary medicine began to emerge as more than just random experimentation more than two decades ago.
Racehorses were the guinea pigs, perhaps because the financial stakes surrounding the health of these animals were highest.
But in the last five years, the field has really taken off, drawing thousands of veterinarians around the country who either integrate alternative therapies into traditional veterinary practices or specialize in holistic approaches to healing.
The American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association, which was founded in 1982, reports a membership of 1,000 veterinarians.
The International Veterinary Acupuncture Society, founded in 1974, reports 1,500 members, up from 500 five years ago, though that is still a small fraction of all veterinarians.
Donna Watkins, a spokeswoman for the society, said veterinary acupuncture has been around long enough that it is now being ventured on a wide variety of animals in addition to horses, cats, dogs and parrots.
``A friend of mine in California regularly does turtles _ well, not the shell,'' Ms.
Watkins said.
``I know a guy in San Diego who is doing a dolphin''.
There are dozens of newsletters and periodicals devoted to alternative veterinary medicine, along with a plethora of product catalogs, many with their own Internet sites.
&QL; STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC; nn The Internet site for the Botanical Animal catalog provides a link to the Equilite line of herbal and floral elixirs for horses, including the ``Broodmare Blend,'' the ``Clear Thinking Blend,'' the ``Ego Builder Blend'' and the ``Mellow Out Blend''.
Although pets being given alternative treatments are often following their owners' leads, the inspiration sometimes works the other way.
``I started going to an acupuncturist for stress because I saw how well it worked for Lola,'' Liz Santander, an interior designer from Chappaqua, N.Y., said of her 150-pound Great Dane as the dog awaited her latest treatment the other morning in the offices of Dr.
Phillip Raclyn on the Upper West Side.
It was a busy, busy day.
While Lola, who was bouncing back from a stroke, cooled her paws in the lobby, Ike, a partially lame shepherd mix, received massage therapy in an examining room.
A condition known as degenerative myelopathy had essentially paralyzed Ike's hind legs, which his owner, Chris O'Sullivan, straps into a two-wheeled cart so Ike can still chase Frisbees.
(``I have to throw the Frisbee right at him,'' O'Sullivan explained).
But the cart was off now and Ike lay motionless as the massage therapist, Jean Marie Cooper, gave him what looked like a particularly intimate, thorough petting.
``Feel for the bony landmarks,'' Ms.
Cooper instructed O'Sullivan, who planned to repeat the treatment for Ike at home in Chinatown.
``Push away from the spine''.
Meanwhile, in the examining room next door, Raclyn inserted an acupuncture needle into the forehead of Spike, a female cat with kidney problems.
For a few seconds, Spike looked like a unicorn; then another dozen needles went in, and she looked like a pin cushion.
Relaxed rather than bothered, she nearly fell asleep.
A few hours earlier and a few miles downtown, Ms.
Richard's patients were decidedly more agitated, slaves to a sloshy, invisible treadmill.
Al repeatedly swapped places in the water with Duncan, a three-legged Labrador retriever who needed to lose about 35 of his 106 pounds but, for obvious reasons, wasn't much for running.
Then they ceded the pool to Sydnee, a 12-year-old Shih Tzu recovering from surgery for a ruptured disc.
The operation had left Sydnee without the use of his hind legs, which he may never fully regain.
This was Sydnee's first hydrotherapy session and he looked _ as far as these things can be determined _ appalled and terrified about taking the plunge.
``He's a good boy,'' Lauran Walk, his owner, called out as Sydnee's tiny, bearded face bobbed above the surface.
``He's a good, good boy''.
Ms. Walk, 27, who lives with her husband in Greenwich Village, said that she was definitely feeling the pinch of the $3,500 that Sydnee's various treatments had cost the couple.
But she said she abhorred the thought of putting him down, and would do whatever it took to avoid that, even though Sydnee was only a few years shy of the normal life expectancy for a dog.
``He represents 12 years of my life, so I've got to give him a chance,'' Ms.
Walk said as Sydnee took a brief poolside rest, a shivering knot of fur with limited mobility.
``I can't be selfish.''
TIANJIN, May 15 (Xinhua) --Chinese medical workers have created and are ready to popularize an acupuncture therapy for apoplexy, for which a cure is still lacking in Western medicine.
"Clinical application of the point prescriptions of 'Xingnao Kaiqiao' have yielded positive results in curing apoplexy and its syndromes, and other diseases such as coronary heart disease, cholelithiasis, asthma, and sterility," officials with the State Administration of Chinese Traditional Medicine said.
"The method is effective with 98.56 percent of the cases treated, and the cure rate reaches 59.27 percent".
Invented by professor Shi Xueming, vice president of the Chinese Acupuncture Society, the therapy has already been listed as one of the top-ten traditional medical achievements this year.
So far, the hospital working with Shi has set up some ten centers across China to train medical workers in the practice of this therapy.
The treatment has also been adopted in more than 80 countries to treat apoplexy, and Japan, the United States, and the Republic of Korea, among others, have also established special organizations to explore and popularize this method.

AUTISTIC-ADULTS-MED _ Support services for people with autism --children and adults alike -- fall far short of fulfilling their needs today, says a new study.
And the lack of specialized help contributes to the increased behavioral and social problems among autistic adults living outside their family homes, the researchers say.
SHOES-MAGNETS-MED _ Florsheim says its magnet-laden shoes can ease pain and make your legs and back less tired.
But a California consumer group is not just taking issue with these claims; it is suing the company for touting them as remedies.
The Consumer Justice Center, a nonprofit consumer protection group, filed the suit last week in Orange County and asks that Florsheim stop advertising the MagneForce shoes as a health aid and refund the purchase price (about $122 plus tax) to people who bought the shoes.
COCAINE-ACUPUNCTURE-MED _ Cocaine addicts looking to get clean may want to turn to needles for help.
A new study by Yale University researchers says acupuncture is an effective treatment for cocaine abuse.
The finding gives the ancient Chinese remedy a much-needed foothold in Western medicine, experts say, because it's based on a well-controlled clinical study from a major American medical school.
A report on the finding appears in the latest issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine.
CONSTIPATION-HISTORY-MED _ Here's a history topic you don't see with much regularity: constipation.
That's right, to the annals of medical history comes the complete archival guide to the most basic of bodily functions.
And why not, says James Whorton, author of ``Inner Hygiene,'' just published by Oxford University Press.
``For centuries, there has been a strong intuitive feeling that regularity is essential for health, and because constipation is a topic that affects just about all of us at one time or another, it's always received a lot of attention,'' says Whorton, a professor of medical history at the University of Washington in Seattle.
BRAIN-OSTEOARTHRITIS-MED _ In their efforts to better understand the nature of knee pain caused by osteoarthritis, researchers are setting their sights a bit higher --on the brain.
Osteoarthritis, a degenerative disease of the soft and bony tissues, is the most common type of arthritis, affecting weight-bearing joints that include the knee and hip.
The pain is unique, doctors say, because it can be so prolonged and difficult to manage.

&LR; NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CALIF.
_ Frank Ruiz, on parole for possession of heroin, cocaine and guns, was shocked when his parole officer told him he could stay sober with needles.
But three times a week the 39-year-old Panorama City man is jabbed with five acupuncture needles in each ear, and he said it has kept him away from drugs.
``If it wasn't for that program, I'd be back in prison,'' said Ruiz, who has been on parole and sober for four months.
``I said, 'Wait a minute.
I was trying to get away from needles and you guys are trying to get them in me'?
'' he said.
``It is really different but it works out pretty good''.
Of 98 volunteers who have participated in the pilot program since May, four have been re-arrested including one on suspicion of drug sales, said Roy Chaney, the unit supervisor.
``Usually, we have to chase people down.
A lot of drug addicts will be evasive.
But these guys will come _ rain, sleet or snow _ and they like coming in,'' Chaney said.
``And they're losing their craving for alcohol and drugs''.
Jails and clinics throughout the nation have used the ancient Chinese practice to successfully treat substance abusers.
But the Van Nuys program is the only one of its kind within the parole division of the Department of Corrections in California, officials said.
If the treatment keeps parolees out of jail, it could be expanded throughout Los Angeles County, officials said.
``I don't know of any other programs working with outpatient parolees to keep them out of jail.
We're helping to keep them out,'' said Joseph Acquah, the acupuncturist and Oriental medical doctor who treats parolees throughout the San Fernando Valley.
It works like this: half-inch needles are inserted in the parolee's ears at points that correspond to the lungs, liver, kidneys and nervous system.
Advocates say the treatment triggers the release of chemicals including endorphins, which helps curb drug cravings, withdrawals and promotes relaxation.
``If it works, and they believe it works, then let them use it,'' said Mike d'Agostine, supervisor of criminal justice services at the Tarzana Treatment Center.
Some of the clients at the Tarzana center have also been treated with acupuncture for substance abuse, he said.
``I believe I saw a benefit to it.
It allows some people to relax more and decrease their anxiety,'' d'Agostine said.
But other forms of treatment are also needed in conjunction with the acupuncture, he said.
The Van Nuys program lasts for at least 12 weeks and requires parolees to attend a drug counseling program in conjunction with the acupuncture.
For Ruiz, acupuncture has meant he can hold down a job, sleep through the night without drugs and improve his relationship with his family.
His wife, Dolores, can vouch for that.
``He's not down.
He's alert and his eating is great,'' his wife of 19 years said.
``The acupuncture really helped him out a lot.
Before, he was always sick if he didn't have what he needed.
Everything's getting back to normal''.
Free of charge to parolees, the acupuncture treatment is a pilot program at the Department of Corrections' Van Nuys office that Chaney started in May.
There is no set time limit for the pilot program and the parolees come of their own will after being informed about it through their parole agents.
``We've found that people have no more cravings for the drugs,'' Chaney said.
Modeled after an acupuncture treatment program at Lincoln Hospital, a New York City-owned facility in the impoverished South Bronx, the Van Nuys program treats about 15 drug-plagued parolees at a time about three times a week.
Often the parolees were convicted of other crimes, including assaults, domestic violence and petty thefts, Chaney said.
Wayne Haradin, 37, of Tujunga said acupuncture has pierced his addiction to pain pills and stimulants.
``You have no cravings.
Your thinking's clear.
You're more aware.
Your sense of smell and touch is more clear.
Before, when I would drive down the road, I was only focused on where I was going and now I see everything that's around me,'' Haradin said, with five needles sprouting from each of his ears.
And he has doubled his productivity at work from three days to six to seven days of work per week as a tub and spa installer.
``After the third session, I was hooked,'' he said.
Another parolee, who declined to give his name for fear of hurting the night clubs he has owned for 28 years throughout the Valley, said he too was hooked on the program after his first few sessions.
``This is a miracle,'' the man said while being treated last week.
``I drank like a fish.
... Now, I don't touch it,'' he said.
The self-described alcoholic said he tried drinking scotch _ once his drink of choice _ after an acupuncture session.
``It didn't taste the same.
It was bitter, spicier.
It didn't come in right,'' he said.
The man has a wine cellar at home that he now does not want to touch, he said.
``In my house, I have every type of cognac and liquor you could dream about,'' he said.
``I drink a lot of milk now.
This is a miracle''.
Since the program began, state corrections officials have seen dramatic results: Parolees are getting jobs, maintaining healthy relationships and showing up free of drugs after weekly tests.
``We've got a dedicated group of parolees.
They've been testing free and clear of drugs and alcohol.
It's proving to be a viable treatment,'' said Ivory Roberts, the district parole administrator for the Valley.
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) --A U.S. medical expert committee today endorsed Chinese traditional needle therapy acupuncture as part of the mainstream American medicine.
The 12-member committee selected by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) said that "clear evidence" has been found that acupuncture effectively treats pain after surgery or dental procedures and controls nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy or pregnancy.
The committee also said in a report that acupuncture also is effective in some patients for tennis elbow, muscle pain and menstrual cramps.
"For the first time there is a public statement from the Health and Human Services that acupuncture might have a role in treating certain health problems," said Dr.
Helga Well-Apelt, a medical doctor who uses Chinese medicine in her practice.
"It can now be called real medicine," said Dr.
Bradley J.
Williams, president of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture, an organization of about 3,000 doctors certified to perform acupuncture.
With a history of more than 2,000 years, acupuncture is a major part of an Asian tradition of medicine.
The practice of the therapy involves sticking thin, sharpened needles into specific nerve junction points on the body.
The needles often are rotated or electrically stimulated.
Although Chinese practitioners have long offered acupuncture in the U.S., the therapy moved toward the mainstream in the nation only after late U.S.
President Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972.
SAN FRANCISCO _ A patch on Art Soto's abdomen continuously releases a morphine-like drug into his system to lessen the discomfort from his long battle with AIDS.
But once a week, Soto also avails himself of a much different painkiller: acupuncture.
As the needles are gently inserted and twisted into his legs, Soto says he feels more energized, and the throbbing and numbing begins to subside.
Acupuncture, especially for pain management, is becoming more common.
Health maintenance organizations are starting to pay for the ancient Chinese therapy, and last week the California Legislature sent the governor a bill requiring workers' compensation policies to cover it.
Many already do.
As a result, doctors are seeing more patients whose regimens include treatments such as acupuncture and Chinese herbs, which Soto also takes.
The issue has become more pressing for mainstream medicine since the National Institutes of Health last year gave acupuncture a qualified endorsement for treating post-operative and dental pain, nausea from chemotherapy, and morning sickness.
Cheryl Sterling, who is Soto's acupuncturist, said the walls between western and alternative medicine are starting to come down.
She now talks with the doctors of some of her patients about their care.
And the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, where she is a dean, is in the midst of discussions with the Kaiser Permanente health maintenance organization and the University of California at San Francisco about joint efforts that could bring the two approaches closer together, she said.
Hospitals, medical centers and senior centers are also seeking to explore possible relationships.
``The trend is definitely going to this _ quote _ integrative care,'' Sterling said.
``It means more patients and more revenue''.
Kaiser spokeswoman Lila Petersen said the HMO does offer acupuncture in its chronic pain management program to patients referred by their primary care physicians.
``More and more, our patients are asking for alternative health care methods, so we are working to provide those services,'' she said.
Still, the treatments are controversial in some quarters, and its underlying mechanisms remain a mystery to western medicine.
Sterling said the therapies work by manipulating the patient's life energy, or ``qi'' (pronounced ``chi'').
In an exam room at the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine's Potrero Hill clinic, Sterling begins Soto's treatment by asking about his health during the past week.
He undresses, and Sterling runs her hands down his legs, where Soto has complained of pain.
When he responds to her touch, she calls out ``Liver 8'' or ``Spleen 1'' _ points on his ``channels'' that are blocked.
She explains that the channels lose their ``moisture'' because of the HIV infection and as a result the energy is obstructed, causing pain.
This time, Sterling and an assistant insert and twirl half a dozen needles into specific locations on Soto's legs and feet.
Sterling says she can feel the needle interact with the qi, ``like a fish on a hook''.
Some of the needles are then attached to a device that sends out an electrical current.
A few minutes later, Sterling uses an acupressure technique on Soto's chest and forehead, and then a cigar-like stick of herbs is lighted and passed back and forth over his abdomen, which is supposed to help ease his stomach problems, caused by taking more than 30 pills a day to control AIDS.
All of this happens while gentle guitar music overlaid on the sounds of the ocean play on a cassette player nearby.
To some, the theory and the practice seem fuzzy, and skeptics chalk up the many patient testimonials to the placebo effect.
The National Council Against Health Fraud's position paper on acupuncture says it remains unproven and its ``theory and practice are based on primitive and fanciful concepts of health and disease that bear no relationship to present scientific knowledge''.
Still, some studies have shown that there are physiological changes _ including the release of the body's own natural painkillers, endorphins _ during treatment, suggesting there may be something more at work.
``More and more insurance companies are saying, `Gee, there might be some literature to support this, so let's have it as a covered benefit,''' said Ellen Hughes, interim director of the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of California at San Francisco.
The university has begun a research study with breast cancer patients to look at the benefits of acupuncture in treating the side effects of chemotherapy.
``Careful scientific minds are looking at the data, and there's more of it,'' Hughes said.
``It's going to be more mainstream.''
NEW YORK, November 5 (Xinhua) --A U.S.
National Institutes of Health sponsored panel has concluded that acupuncture merits inclusion in the comprehensive treatment for certain common conditions, and called for further research in its application.
The Los Angles-based American Academy of Medical Acupuncture (AAMA) announced this today and said in a press release that it is pleased about the conclusions made by the NIH Consensus Development Conference.
"The NIH-sponsored panel pointed out that when incorporated into a comprehensive medical teatment program, acupuncture may be as effective as many accepted conventional medical therapies," AAMA said.
"The panel particularly cited the low incidence of side effects of acupuncture when compared to many accepted Western medical therapies such as medications and invasive procedures," it added.
"These conclusions support AAMA's mission to offer the highest quality health care to patients by combining the best of both worlds into safe and effective medical care," it said.
Acknowledging that a growing number of physicians are recognizing the effectiveness of acupuncture, the panel called for significant funding for research in all disciplines of acupuncture to see how medical acupuncture can best be integrated into the American healthcare system.
according to AAMA, NIH sees acupuncture applicable to treat low back pain, asthma, adult post-operative and chemotherapy nausea, post-operative dental pain, addiction, stroke rehabilitation, headache, menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, fibromyalgia, and carpal tunnel syndrome.
TUCSON, Ariz.
_ Acupuncture, therapeutic massage, herbal therapies and yoga: Have these alternative therapies earned their place in mainstream American medicine?
Dr. Andrew Weil, arguing for their acceptance, and Dr.
Arnold Relman, opposing the mainstreaming of these ancient medical treatments into modern medicine, duked it out in a landmark debate Friday night at the University of Arizona College of Medicine.
Weil, who is on the cutting edge of what is new in alternative medicine, sparred on most points with Relman, editor and chief emeritus at the New England School of Medicine, who is squarely from the mainstream medical community.
The debate came on the wings of a scathing article Relman wrote in the ``New'' ``Republic,'' in which he referred to Weil's methods as preposterous.
At the debate, he said Weil's therapies are ``based on wildly implausible theories''.
The fact that the debate took place at all is an acknowledgment that the mainstream medical community is no longer ignoring alternative medicine.
With 42 percent of the public now using some sort of alternative medical therapies, Weil and others have been pushing the nation's medical schools to start requiring more medical students to learn more about such things as acupuncture, herbal therapies and hundreds of other therapies.
Relman was appalled by that idea that medical students should be taught alternative therapies.
Teaching medical students how to do alternative therapies would overthrow what medical schools teach, Relman said.
``You believe first,'' he said to Weil.
``Then you try it.
Maybe it will work.
We tell medical students to look for the data.
To look for objective evidence is how you train doctors to be trustworthy or reliable.
``Why should we bring it into the medical mainstream when evidence is scant?
It is based on unproven therapies, contrary to all that 20th-century medicine. . . ``We're in a time of breakthroughs and this won't help us make those advances''.
But Weil disagreed, saying that powerful social and economic forces moving now are going to make alternative medicine even more widely used and it would be better to have doctors trained than to just let it happen haphazardly.
Otherwise, he said, we may have HMOs deciding what type of massage therapy is good.
More corporations are also interested in health plans that include alternative therapies but don't know how to sort out what works and what is cost-effective, Weil said.
This is the future not only because patients want it, but practitioners do, too, he added.
``Medical students want to know why they aren't learning about herbal therapies,'' Weil said.
Relman replied that the reason more doctors and medical students are interested in it is that medical care is being delivered like a business.
They are unhappy spending less time with patients and may be looking for a different livelihood themselves.
It was the first of what may be many discussions in the future that could affect every person's health, and the two participants hope to take the debate to other college campuses.
In response to Relman's comment that sorting out what to teach from all the various alternative therapies would be impossible, Weil said he found his answer on a button that someone sent him: ``Those who say it can't be done should get of the way of people doing it''.
Both spoke strongly Friday on their positions, said Dr.
Chris Shearer, residency director at Phoenix Baptist Hospital and president of the Arizona Academy of Family Physicians.
``One winner in this debate _ that there needs to be more research about alternative therapies,'' he said.
And there is, although many say not enough considering the huge growing interest in alternative medicines.
The National Institutes of Health is spending $40 million to $50 million on research on alternative therapies this year.
``Dr. Relman's responses were defined by traditional medicine,'' said Carol Feingold, faculty member of the UA College of Nursing.
``But I think people want more than that, they don't just want treatment of disease.
They want health care, but they want the whole picture''.
Richard L.
Bourke, chairman of National Integrative Medicine, a health care business in the Valley, said, ``Patients today are looking to physicians for answers and aren't getting them.
Doctors don't have the training or the time''.
There are a lot of different terms used when people describe alternative therapies.
Studies have shown that most of those using alternative medicine are women, and about 86 percent have at least some college, said Rena Gordon, a medical geographer affiliated with both the University of Arizona and Arizona State University.
They are middle-age and socially established.
Many of them live in the West.
They use alternative therapies in conjunction with conventional medicine, she said.
Only 4 percent use alternative medicine exclusively but disclosure is low.
No one knows how many people go to alternative healers because they don't talk about it, especially with their family physician.
Because Weil's clinic at UA is a teaching clinic, it is unable to accommodate large numbers of patients.
There is a waiting list of several hundred and at least several months to be seen.
The clinic is set up as a self-pay program because most HMOs don't reimburse.
Nevertheless, individuals interested in a place on the waiting list may call 1-(520)-694-6555. &QL;
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) --The number of Americans who are using alternative treatments such as herbal supplements, massage therapy and megavitamins is increasing dramatically, said the Washington Post Wednesday by quoting studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
"It is the beginning of the beginning of acceptance of some forms of 1998 alternative medicine into mainstream medicine in the United States," said George Lundberg, editor of the JAMA.
An estimated 83 million American adults, more than four out of 10, used some form of alternative medical treatment last year, said a new survey by a Harvard research team.
They said that visits to practitioners of alternative therapies, from herbal medicines to "energy healing," have increased 47 percent since 1990.
In addition to herbal medicine and "energy healing," the alternative therapies included in the survey were relaxation techniques, massage therapy, chiropractic, spiritual healing, megavitamins, self-help, imagery, homeopathy, hypnosis, biofeedback, acupuncture, folk remedies and various diets.
Among the fastest growing therapies were herbal remedies, massage, megavitamins, relaxation techniques and "spiritual healing".
One study found that moxibustion, a traditional Chinese therapy in which a herb, Artemisia vulgaris, was burned next to an acupuncture point on the toe, proved safe and effective for stimulating fetuses in the wombs of pregnant women to turn over from a breech position to a head-first position, which is safer for delivery.
However, some medical experts have expressed concern that herbal products, which do not have to meet any official government purity or manufacturing standards, may carry dangerous impurities.
The ancient technique of acupuncture is now being used for cosmetic surgery.
`` Needles unblock pathways through which the vital energy called Qi flows,'' says acupuncturist Henry Woo, Ph.D., of Newport Beach, Calif.
``Traditional Chinese Medicine treats a wide variety of conditions this way''.
Best known for relieving pain, acupuncture's uses in the West keep expanding.
Inserting needles into pressure points throughout the body to increase well-being goes back more than 2,5000 years.
But using the hair-thin needles to accentuate beauty represents a whole new concept in cosmetics.
``The needles stimulate circulation and tone the muscles underneath the skin,'' says Woo.
``Stimulating energy centers restores the Yin/Yang, or balance of energy in the body''.
``I'm pleased,'' says Sandy Ridout of Huntington Beach, California.
``I can see that the fine lines under my eyes lessened, and my smile lines diminished a lot.
I'm most pleased about that''.
COSMETIC ACUPUNCTURE Practitioners assert that lines around the eyes, and wrinkles that form around the mouth respond quickly to acupuncture treatments.
But inviting as the treatment seems, not many acupuncturists offer it, says Woo, because of the time involved.
In addition to cosmetic therapy, Woo treats a host of disorders with acupuncture, including addictions, weight problems, pain, adult acne, bedwetting and even infertility.
``It opens the channels through which energy flows, and rejuvenates the body's cells.
The improvement shows in the face by relaxing and strengthening the muscles below the skin, which helps eliminate wrinkles''.
Since people often fear needles, Woo uses techniques to ease their anxiety.
``I help patients overcome their fear of needles by first showing them that I use very fine, disposable needles made of steel.
They don't hurt''.
Background music and dim lighting further the relaxed atmosphere.
The number of needles that Woo uses can vary from patient to patient.
Some require as few as nine, and others need 16 or so placed strategically around their face.
``The needles bring more circulation to the area where they are inserted,'' says Woo, ``which brings more rejuvenating oxygen to the cells.
The needles activate the fiber under the skin too, and give it more elasticity''.
NEEDLE PLACEMENT After Woo cleans the patient's face with alcohol, he uses tape to put pressure on the muscles.
Anesthesia cream is applied to the sensitive lip area to avoid discomfort.
Then he inserts the needles at angles of less than 15 degrees, mostly pointing toward the top of the head.
This takes about 15 minutes, and the needles remain in place for about a half hour.
Woo also inserts two needles into the hand to stimulate circulation to the face.
``It's the same pressure point used to stop a toothache or a headache,'' he explains.
Woo cleanses the face again with alcohol after removing the needles, and massages the patient's face for about five minutes.
A Chinese cream restores moisture and nourishes the skin.
Ten treatments usually do the job.
Then, maintenance visits once or twice a month renew the benefits.
EASY TO KEEP UP Much cheaper than a surgical facelift, patients pay about $45 for each acupuncture treatment.
Woo explains that restoring the essential energy, or Qi, (pronounced chee) improves mood and increases a sense of well being.
This shows in the face.
``Sometimes patients experience a momentary stinging or tingling sensation when needles are inserted,'' he says.
``That is then followed by a complete sense of relaxation and ease''.
Breaking up energy stagnation and restoring a balanced flow of Qi through the body represents a radically different approach to achieving beauty than a surgical facelift.
The focus on the whole person and improving energy flow appeals to many.
``From what I understand, surgical facelifts last 10 or 12 years even if you have good skin tone,'' says Sandy Ridout, ``which I do.
Eventually, I'll probably have a facelift like that.
But if I can put it off, that's a good idea, I think.
Acupuncture seems like a better way to get rid of wrinkles right now because it's easy to keep up.
And there's no pain involved, or recuperation time.
I enjoy the procedure''.
ACUPUNCTURE USED WIDELY A consensus statement from the National Institutes of Health states that acupuncture has been used by millions of Americans.
Thousands of physicians, dentists, and other practitioners have used acupuncture for the relief of pain, and many other conditions.
Since the field still remains relatively new to the public, issues such as training, licensure, and insurance coverage need further clarification.
The majority of states offer licensure or registration for acupuncturists, but not all states recognize the same credentialing exam.
A nationally recognized exam has been established, however, for physicians who become acupuncturists.
The Federal Food and Drug Administration recently removed acupuncture needles from the category of ``experimental medical devices,'' and now regulates them just like surgical scalpels and hypodermic syringes.
This ensures good manufacturing practices and high standards of sterility.
The FDA recommends that the needles be used only once.
The NIH consensus statement lists many health problems that acupuncture may help mitigate including addiction, rehabilitation after stoke, headaches, menstrual cramps, myofascial pain, back pain, asthma, osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome and fibromyalgia.
The consensus panel concluded that further research is likely to uncover additional areas where acupuncture interventions will be helpful.
Acupuncture's positive effects seem to radiate in an all encompassing way for some patients.
``I feel like I'm brighter,'' says Sandy Ridout.
``It gives me a better feeling just to know I don't have wrinkles.
``I'm a preventive type person, and my appearance and my mood are important to me.
I needed a perker-upper and this is it''.

&UR; COSMETIC ACUPUNCTURE &LR; &QL; Can you smooth wrinkles with Chinese therapy?
As a healing technique, acupuncture boasts an impressive track record.
By inserting tiny needles into various areas of the body, practitioners of this Chinese therapy have shown the value of acupuncture in relieving pain, easing nausea and lowering blood pressure.
Now, acupuncturists say that their services can also erase signs of aging.
Cosmetic acupuncture works in a variety of ways, says licensed acupuncturist and traditional-Chinese-medicine practitioner Phyllis Olson.
Inserting a needle into the skin causes oxygenated, nutrient-rich blood to rush to that spot.
This promotes circulation and healing.
Second, facial muscles relax during the treatment, Olson says, which lessens the appearance of wrinkles.
Acupuncturists believe that the body's energy, or chi, takes certain pathways.
By using needles to access points on those pathways, an acupuncturist can move the energy where it's needed to speed healing or eliminate damage.
While there's no scientific evidence to back up these claims, cosmetic acupuncture may have some benefits, says Dr.
Barney Kenet, a dermatologic surgeon at New York Presbyterian Hospital/Cornell Medical Center.
``Next to the sun, contraction of facial muscles is the major cause of wrinkling.
That's why we get smile lines and crow's-feet,'' Kenet says.
``If acupuncture relaxes the muscles, it might reduce wrinkling temporarily''.
As for the increased blood flow, at most it will probably give you a temporary rosy complexion _ something you don't want if you have an inflammatory condition such as acne or rosacea.
Otherwise, cosmetic acupuncture is relatively harmless.
If you're interested in trying it, keep expectations in check and enjoy the experience.
Aside from the momentary stings, acupuncture is really quite relaxing, Olson says.
The treatment _ depending on the amount of wrinkles _ consists of about 20 to 25 superfine needles being inserted into the face, ear or hand.
The price runs from $60 to $100 per session.
What sort of results can you expect?
Improvement after the first treatment can last about a week.
After 10 weekly sessions, the body's energy will begin moving into these areas on its own.
Monthly treatments can maintain the results, Olson says.
&UR; A GENTLER AND MORE ACCURATE HEART TEST &LR; &QL; In a study of patients recovering from a first heart attack, myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) plus a drug that increases blood flow to the heart predicted future heart attacks better than the standard exercise-stress test.
The technique can be performed 48 hours after a heart attack, compared with a five-to-seven-day waiting period for the stress test.
``If there's danger of a second cardiac event, this can enable physicians to make lifesaving treatment decisions earlier,'' says Dr.
Kenneth A.
Brown, author of the study and director of the nuclear-cardiology and cardiac-stress laboratories at the University of Vermont in Burlington, where the study was conducted.
MPI is available at most large and medium-size hospitals.
&UR; NOSE DROPS EASE MIGRAINE PAIN &LR; &QL; Lidocaine nose drops, available by prescription, may offer the fastest relief from a migraine headache.
In a study at the Southern California Permanente Medical Group in Woodland Hills, researchers found that the medication eased pain within 15 minutes for 36 percent of patients, compared to 7 percent of those given a placebo.
A follow-up study found that the treatment brought relief within 30 minutes to more than half of the migraine sufferers who tried it.
``The best candidates for lidocaine are those who have occasional migraines,'' says Dr.
Morris Maizels, lead study author and a family-practice doctor at Permanente.
If you experience symptoms before the migraine itself, Maizels advises, ``a quick lidocaine treatment may prevent the pain from setting in at all''.

BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) --The efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine is now being acknowledged by more and more people around the world, said an official of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine here Saturday.
Shen Zhixiang, an official with the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, noted that traditional Chinese medicine has been exported to over 130 countries and regions, with annual foreign exchange earning of 600 million US dollars, a figure expected to grow each year.
China has sent several hundred medical teams and over 10,000 doctors to foreign countries, especially developing countries, to provide services to the local people.
Shen pointed out that by 1998, China had conducted governmental level exchanges and cooperation on traditional Chinese medicine with over 40 countries and regions including the United States, Japan, and France.
China and the World Health Organization (WHO) have made achievements in cooperation in traditional Chinese medicine, and the WHO now has seven traditional medicine cooperation centers and three acupuncture training centers in China, in a bid to introduce and promote traditional Chinese medicine to the world.
China has trained nearly 15,000 foreigners from over 130 countries and regions in traditional Chinese medicine in the past decade, extending the influence of this method of treatment worldwide.
Now, most countries and regions worldwide have various kinds of clinics and research centers devoted to traditional Chinese medicine.
China will continue exchanges with foreign countries in traditional medicine education and technology research, and also will consider establishing hospitals in foreign countries, said Shen.
BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) --Scientifically-based treatments will open the world market wider to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a national conference in Beijing was told today.
Zhang Wenkang, director of the State Bureau of Traditional Chinese Medicine (SBTCM) told the conference on TCM that the SBTCM plans to choose five prescriptions of Chinese traditional medicine with good curative effects, which can meet the demands of the world market.
The aim is to develop them within the next five years to meet world criteria.
He said that the bureau will conduct a quality standard study of 80 kinds of commonly-used TCM in a bid to build up a world-recognized standards system for traditional Chinese medicine.
Chinese traditional medicine has become more popular in world markets in recent years due to few side-effects.
But China's export volume of TCM is only about 500 million US dollars a year, a very small share in the world market.
However, Chinese acupuncture and moxibustion enjoy a legal status in medical treatment in many developed countries due to efforts by Chinese scientist.
They have also explained why acupuncture can kill pain, with extensive publicity helping make acupuncture popular in the world.
The random telephone survey of 1,000 people also showed that 56 percent of those interviewed believe their health plans should cover alternative care.
They are also willing to pay for it in their medical insurance premiums.
``What we see from this survey and many other indicators is that people generally want to take control of their own health, using those services they find most effective,'' said William Haskell, a Stanford professor of medicine.
``This places responsibility on both traditional care providers and health educators to ensure that responsible information and advice are available to patients,'' he added.
While the survey reflected the growing acceptance of alternative medicine in the United States, it said roughly half the people who seek out alternative practitioners still rely on Western medicine for basic health care.
On average, participants in the study made four visits annually to a conventional doctor.
Significantly, those surveyed said that their decision whether to consult a conventional physician or a practitioner of alternative medicine, was guided principally by the practitioner's ``technical skills at diagnosis and treatment''.
The findings were released at a conference on alternative and complementary medicine held last week at Stanford Medical Center and attended by more than 500 physicians and other health care professionals from across the nation.
The survey was conducted by the Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention.
Haskell is the principal investigator for Stanford in a major federally funded study of the effectiveness of complementary and/or alternative medicine.
Five years ago, a landmark survey by Harvard Medical School revealed that 1 in 3 Americans used nontraditional medicine, spending $14 billion a year in treatments.
The Stanford findings did not include patient expenditures for alternative medicine.
But, on average, survey respondents said they would be willing to spend an additional $15.41 a month in health insurance for complementary services such as chiropractic, massage or acupuncture.
While many physicians are still skeptical of alternative medicine, a growing number of patient care organizations offer complementary services in clinics alongside traditional medicine or reimburse patients for alternative treatments.
Public interest in alternative medicine presents some challenges and obligations for traditional physicians, said Wes Alles of the Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention.
``Whether we are talking about vitamins, yoga, acupuncture, massage or a variety of other practices, physicians should be candid with their patients about which techniques they feel are most appropriate for each patient,'' he said.
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.
_ Pain, tough for anyone to beat, attacked Esther Levow like one of her meanest karate opponents.
Thirty years ago, while in her early 20s, Levow nearly died when a doctor gave her painkillers during an operation.
Since then, she's been terrified to take any pain relievers during medical procedures.
``I had my heart stop,'' says Levow, a third-degree karate black belt who otherwise is no shrinking violet.
``It's a little scary to have that happen...
I just want to wake up''.
So Levow resorted to an unusual counterpunch recently when told she needed dental surgery: acupuncture.
And she isn't alone.
With an increasing number of patients reporting pain, fear and experiences like hers, local doctors have become more open-minded about the blending of conventional and alternative therapies.
``I did a test,'' Levow recalls.
``After (the acupuncturist) put the needles in, she stuck a needle directly into my gum to see what would happen.
I felt almost nothing''.
Convinced she could use this alternative in her dentist's chair, Levow got permission from Delray Beach, Fla.
dentist Dr.
Hyman Friedman to bring the acupuncturist to his office.
Before the scaling, scraping and pulling he was to perform, the acupuncturist _ Simm Gottesman of Deerfield Beach, Fla.
_ carefully placed needles on the side of Levow's face, her ear, and her hand to ease her pain.
``I never felt more than a bearable discomfort,'' Levow said.
Friedman was fascinated.
``It might not work with every patient, but I was impressed,'' the dentist says.
Some say the movement toward so-called ``alternative'' treatments may be driven by economics.
Dr. David Eisenberg, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard University, led a survey that found a sharp increase in the use of alternative medicine by Americans from 1990 to 1997.
Whatever doctors' motivation, bastions of conventionality such as The American Medical Association are taking alternatives seriously.
The AMA devoted the entire November issue of its journal to alternative therapies.
Across the road from Jupiter Medical Center, where patients undergo CAT scans and other high-tech medical procedures, the new Mind/Body Institute offers alternative treatments from hydrotherapy to acupuncture to therapeutic touch.
But there's no real competition here between conventional and alternative healing methods: The center is a department of the hospital.
``Over 300 medical institutions are employing mind/body centers in this country,'' says John Fritz, executive director of the new institute.
``We feel we'll be able to show others how to do this''.
A physician serves as medical director for the institute, reviewing most patient's cases for appropriate treatment.
Fritz admitted it took some meeting of the minds before the medical center's doctors were comfortable with the institute's offerings.
The institute, which opened in November, was a gift to the hospital from Guy and Jackie Fiske, area residents whose son is a cancer researcher at the University of Pittsburgh.
Patients are either referred by doctors or come in on their own.
And they're not always dealing with intractable pain, which drives many to seek alternative care.
The institute offers programs for weight reduction, smoking cessation, and insomnia, Fritz said.
Because the institute is part of the hospital, Fritz thinks it might make people more comfortable seeking alternative treatments.
``A number of people would like to know more about what's available, but they may not have a place to go they can trust,'' he said.
And trust is a precious commodity, especially when treating patients with chronic pain.
A-h-h-h-h. Barbara Cottrill lets out an explosive sigh.
She is being treated for her chronic pain by Brett Ferrigan, a licensed acupuncturist who isn't a medical doctor, but is certified in Florida to perform the age-old treatment.
He works at St.
Mary's Rehabilitation Center in West Palm Beach.
It's on the campus of St.
Mary's Hospital but is a separate corporation and operates independently.
The center has offered alternative treatments for more than a year.
Cottrill has acute pain from an operation 10 years ago that was followed by a fall.
``Pain changes you,'' she says, as Ferrigan strategically places acupuncture needles in her feet and hands to relieve her suffering.
The Palm Beach Gardens resident has been through many medical procedures for pain, she said, even nerve blocks.
But results varied.
She tried acupuncture when her doctor suggested it.
Ferrigan sticks a needle in the big toe of her right foot.
When the ``blocked energy'' that Ferrigan blames for the pain is released, Cottrill flinches again, as if someone has clamped a cardiac paddle on her chest and yelled, ``clear''.
She says the acupuncture brings relief where conventional painkillers haven't.
``People come primarily for pain,'' says Ferrigan, who has started getting referrals from St.
Mary's doctors.
``I like working in a medical setting.
It's very gratifying for me''.
That type of partnership is growing.
A task force from the National Institutes of Health found acupuncture, a component of the Chinese health care system that can be traced back at least 2,500 years, was ``widely practiced'' and that ``promising results have emerged'' for nausea, vomiting and post-operative dental pain.
At the same time, The American Academy of Medical Acupuncture, a 12-year-old society of medical doctors trained in acupuncture, has seen its membership grow from 200 in 1991 to 1,550 today.
Dr. Joan Barice, an Ivy League-trained doctor, practices her skills on military veterans.
Barice works part-time at the Veteran's Administration Medical Center in West Palm Beach.
She's a longtime supporter of alternative care.
``I've been treating VA patients more than a year with acupuncture.
I've heard nothing but good things from patients,'' she said.
``I think we had some open-minded people in administration, good supportive leaders.
And they also recognize that when you're working with chronic pain patients, and nothing has really relieved that suffering, it's a useful adjunctive tool.
``Until not that long ago, doctors mistrusted chiropractors and were resisting things they didn't know,'' Barice said.
``Right now, people are jumping on the bandwagon for a number of reasons.
Profit motivation, or patients want it.
It's almost a shotgun marriage in a lot of places between alternative and traditional medicine''.

NEW YORK (AP) --Beth Israel Medical Center, a large New York teaching hospital, this month opened a funky looking facility -- complete with pastel-colored walls and a waiting room with fluffy couches and a redwood bench -- where physicians work along side chiropractors and practitioners who specialize in homeopathy and clinical imagery.
At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, one of the most prestigious hospitals in Los Angeles, cardiac patients are given the option of receiving acupuncture or massage therapy after coronary bypass surgery.
At the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, known for its ground-breaking organ transplants, psychiatrists prescribe herbal medicines to help patients overcome depression.
Hospitals, the bastions of Western medicine and high-tech gadgetry, are increasingly using procedures such as aromatherapy and Tai Chi to try to attract patients by tapping into one of the hottest trends in health care.
Though the medical profession remains skeptical about the effectiveness of alternative therapies, hospital administrators say they can no longer escape the reality that millions of Americans routinely use them to complement --or even take the place of -- traditional medicine.
About 83 million Americans are spending some $27 billion a year on alternative care, according to a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
With these patients and dollars in mind, about 13 percent of U.S. hospitals provide alternative therapies, according to a survey of about 1,000 hospitals by the consulting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
The figure rises to 25 percent for inner city hospitals and 32 percent for hospitals with at least 500 beds.
A decade ago, it would have been almost unheard of for hospitals to offer such services, industry analysts say.
That's changing fast.
''It would be silly for doctors and hospitals to ignore something that will be a large part of health care for years to come,'' said Dr.
Matthew Fink, a neurologist who is president and chief executive of Beth Israel Medical Center.
But doctors and the practitioners of alternative care don't always mix well.
Many doctors still are suspicious of alternative therapies and consider chiropractors and acupuncturists to be quacks.
And health insurers are reluctant to pay for most alternative procedures.
At the State University of New York at Stony Brook, a move to affiliate with a group of alternative care practitioners prompted a firestorm of criticism from faculty members before the program got off the ground.
Despite occasional setbacks, alternative care providers and medical practitioners are increasingly seeking to find common ground to help their businesses prosper.
That's what's happening at Beth Israel's Center for Health and Healing, located on the second floor of a nondescript office building in downtown Manhattan.
The $5 million center, with 17 treatment rooms, has pastel-colored walls.
The waiting room is light and airy with fluffy couches, and there's a bench made from recycled redwood in the reception area.
''We are providing a wide range of therapeutic options of remedies that have stood the test of time and/or scientific scrutiny, and preferably both,'' said Dr.
Woodson Merrell, the center's executive director who is a physician and an acupuncturist.
''I see integrative medicine as the future of medicine''.
The center, opened in June, includes medical doctors, registered nurses, nurse practitioners, psychotherapists and practitioners of acupuncture, chiropractic procedures, mind-body therapy and massage therapy.
Beth Israel officials opened the center not only to tap into the growing interest among consumers for alternative care but also to conduct research to try to determine if these therapies --some practiced for thousands of years-- really do work, Merrell said.
Merrell said some Beth Israel doctors were suspicious of the center, especially orthopedic surgeons who are leery of chiropractors.
To win the specialists' support, the center has agreed that after a patient sees a chiropractor three times, the case must be reviewed by a physician.
''We tried to get both sides to come to the table to work together,'' Merrell said.
''It was like putting together disparate worlds''.
Experts say alternative care providers gain credibility by working with physicians and hospitals.
And the doctors and medical institutions are viewed as cutting edge for facilitating alternative care.
Financial barriers remain, however, because there is limited insurance coverage for alternative procedures.
Beth Israel's center so far has been unsuccessful in attracting an insurer for a pilot project to test whether alternative therapies can save money and provide good care, Merrell said.
Still, support among physicians is growing.
Dr. Gregory Fontana, a cardiothoracic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai, uses acupuncture to relieve the neck pain he develops from surgery.
Seeing first hand how the therapy works for him --and concerned that his own patients were not receiving effective treatment for pain -- Fontana recently led a group of physicians to start a pilot program to test acupuncture, massage therapy and guided-imagery relaxation techniques on cardiac bypass patients.
Early results on about 100 patients show that nearly all reported some relief from the services, he said.
''As my practice evolved, I saw the frustrations of my patients and came to the realization that Western medicine does not have all the answers,'' Fontana said.
Fontana's study is just one area at Cedars-Sinai where there is alternative care.
The hospital last year launched its Integrative Medicine group, which offers such services as acupuncture and meditation as well as physician services.
Doctors are becoming involved because their patients are asking about such procedures, officials say.
''Doctors fear they will lose patients if they do not know how to talk to patients about alternative therapies,'' said Dr.
Mary Hardy, the group's medical director who is an internist and specialist in herbal medicines.
Beyond New York and Los Angeles, hospitals in more conservative areas of the country also are introducing alternative care.
Central Iowa Health Systems last year opened the Center for Health and Well Being in West Des Moines, Iowa.
The center, which treats allergies with Chinese herbs and back pain with acupuncture, hopes the hospital name and logo will attract patients who are hesitant to give these alternative services a try.
''We give patients more of a comfort level because they know we've checked out these practitioners,'' said Sheila Gregan, the center's director.
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) --Chinese herbal medicines are now selling 10 to 15 billion U.S. dollars worth, two to three times the 1990 figure.
This trade amounts to 10 to 15 percent of the world's total, according to Prof.
Zhang Boli, director of a traditional medicine institute in Tianjin.
Prof. Zhang told a national medical symposium today that one of the reasons for the increasing popularity is that people are becoming more concerned about the side-effects of other medicines and are looking for alternatives.
Another reason is that new medicines need a lot of time and money to develop.
There are at least 170 companies and many research institutes developing herbal medicines world-wide.
Zhang said that some European and North American countries now account for about a quarter of the natural medicine use, and the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe account for 32 percent, while China consumes nearly half.
The WHO has also put traditional medicine development on its agenda and has built 26 traditional medicine centers.
In 1980, it announced 43 diseases that it considered suitable for treatment by acupuncture and moxibustion, and one branch has published a guidebook on herbal medicines.
NEW HAVEN, Conn.
(AP) --Acupuncture is an effective treatment for those addicted to cocaine, Yale researchers found.
A study published in Monday's Archives of Internal Medicine reports that patients who received therapeutic acupuncture treatments, along with counseling, were more likely to have cocaine-negative tests than those who didn't.
''Our study shows that that alternative therapies can be combined with the arsenal of Western treatments for fighting addiction,'' said Yale Medical School researcher Arthur Margolin.
Of the patients studied, 53.8 percent of those receiving the acupuncture technique tested free of cocaine during the last week of the treatment, compared with 23.5 percent and 9.1 percent in the two control groups.
Those who completed the acupuncture treatment also had longer periods of sustained abstinence than participants in either control group.
The eight-week study involved 82 participants who were addicted to heroin and cocaine.
They received methadone for their heroin addiction, but no medication for their cocaine addiction.
All participants received individual and group counseling.
They were divided into three groups.
One group received auricular acupuncture, in which needles are inserted into specific places in the outer ear thought to be associated with addiction.
A second control group received acupuncture in other points along the outer ear believed to have no treatment effect.
The third group was shown videotapes depicting relaxing images, such as nature scenes.
While the scientific basis for acupuncture is unknown, the results are indisputable, said Daniel Iead, clinical coordinator for the Grant Street Partnership, a New Haven addiction services agency.
''We've been doing it here for years and it works,'' said Iead.
''The results are fantastic.
Some of our most difficult cases have turned their lives around because of it''.
Margolin said the findings also were encouraging because acupuncture has fewer side effects and is relatively low-cost.
He said the results suggest the need for increased study of acupuncture and other forms of alternative medicine.
''Controlled clinical research of acupuncture is in its infancy, and while our positive findings are gratifying, further research is needed to replicate the results and to better understand how to combine acupuncture with existing treatments for addiction,'' Margolin said.
When Sharon Gretz Lasky found out she had melanoma last August, she wasn't ready to surrender to cancer.
``I didn't want to feel powerless, like a rock rolling down a hilt,'' said the 42-year-old mother of three.
``I wanted to be in charge of my health''.
Therefore, her treatment consisted not only of surgery to remove a block of tissue from her thigh and lymph nodes, but also of acupuncture, craniosacral therapy, hypnosis and biofeedback.
Best of all, Lasky was able to get top-notch conventional and alternative care under one roof.
After her cancer was diagnosed, she began treatment at the three-year-old Center for Complementary Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Shadyside Hospital.
The same health-care network that featured her oncologist and plastic surgeon for tissue reconstruction also included an acupuncturist, a massage therapist and other alternative practitioners.
``Everyone who worked with me _ the surgeons, the acupuncturist, the nutritionist and the rest _ were part of my health-care team,'' she said.
``They treated my cancer, but they also helped me through my fears, so I went into surgery incredibly calm and confident''.
In addition, Lasky got help in dealing with pain and recuperation _ and the news that she'd need a second operation to remove a spot from her lung.
Thankfully, the tissue in her lung proved noncancerous, and she left the hospital in half the expected time and with much less pain medication.
This integrative approach to treating an illness certainly isn't new.
But the fact that Lasky was able to get multifaceted treatment at a single facility is indicative of a growing trend in health care: the integrative medicine facility.
Across the country, an ever-increasing number of conventional hospitals and health-care organizations are setting up complementary-care centers.
As yet, no one is tracking these centers as a group, but last year, the American Hospital Association found that roughly 9 percent of U.S. hospitals offer complementary services; some estimates say that between 25 and 50 complementary centers affiliated with hospitals are presently open or will be opening in the near future.
Many of these facilities are fully staffed with medical doctors and alternative practitioners who work together to determine each patient's course of treatment.
Others offer individual therapies such as therapeutic touch or guided imagery to patients who ask for it.
``If you look at what was happening even a few years ago, the extent to which complementary services have become part of the health-care system is astonishing,'' said John Weeks, editor and publisher of The Integrator, a newsletter covering the business of alternative medicine.
``We're really in the first phase of a process that will evolve over the next 10 or 20 years''.
``As we see more and more consumers making health-care decisions for themselves, this trend is really going to take off,'' said Dr.
Samuel Benjamin, director of the Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the State University of New York, Stony Brook.
``There will be only one medicine in the future, and it will include all of the things that we once thought of as either alternative or conventional''.
What's more, demographics support the notion that these centers are here to stay.
``Baby boomers are hearing that they could live to 80 or 90 or 100, and they want to be healthy doing it,'' Weeks said.
An expected squeeze in the labor market in the next several years should prompt companies to seek more and better services with which to attract and retain employees.
At the top of any worker's list: better health care.
``Patients are going to demand more complementary medicine, and they're going to demand it right in the hospital they're using,'' said Dr.
James N.
Dillard, medical director for alternative medicine at Oxford Health Plans in New York City.
Many complementary-care clinics are also moving beyond patient care to address one of the biggest concerns in integrative medicine: the information shortfall.
Patients often use alternative therapies in a smorgasbord-like way, without a complete understanding of the advantages or risks involved.
``Part of what got me into the development of our center is that I knew my patients were already using alternative therapies,'' said Dr.
Mimi Guarneri, an interventional cardiologist and the medical director of the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine in La Jolla, Calif.
``They were out there buying every vitamin and herb they could find, and I was concerned that they might not know enough about what they were taking''.
With this in mind, hospitals like Scripps have set up classes to inform patients about various alternative therapies.
Since traditionally schooled physicians are often unduly skeptical about complementary approaches, many clinics have also made research and analysis part of their standard operations.
``If we don't evaluate the evidence with an objective eye, there's no way that complementary therapies can ever be brought into the medical mainstream in a way that makes sense,'' said Guarneri.
``As a physician, you can't stand up and present anecdotes without being thrown out of the room''.
Virtually all of the centers track patient outcomes and share that information with other hospitals nationwide.
Many centers are conducting comprehensive studies on the effects of individual therapies _ the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, for one, is researching complementary treatments for asthma, while George Washington University's Center for Integrative Medicine in Washington, D.C., is looking at the use of acupuncture in treating carpal tunnel syndrome.
Of course, what matters to patients isn't hard-core data but real-life outcomes.
And in that respect, the news is positive.
``Many complementary therapies can help people face an illness more calmly, use less pain medication and recover more quickly,'' said Dr.
Lewis Mehl-Medrona, program director for the Pittsburgh medical center and the author of ``Coyote Medicine''.
Tracy Cunning definitely agreed.
The 35-year-old research assistant received therapeutic touch and massage at the Center for Health &AMP; Well-Being at St.
Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, while undergoing knee surgery at the hospital.
(She also had acupuncture treatments at an unaffiliated center nearby, with her doctor's blessing).
Just one day after her surgery, she put away the crutches she'd been given; by the third day, she'd tossed her pain pills, having taken only six of the 30 that had been prescribed.
``Everyone was very supportive,'' she recalled.
``I sailed through surgery and was up and moving around much more quickly than I'd expected.
I think the care I was given made a big difference''.
OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS THE INSURANCE QUESTION Will the fact that so many hospitals are bringing complementary therapies under one roof mean less out-of-pocket costs for consumers?
Probably not _ at least, not right away, said Dr.
James N.
Dillard, medical director for alternative medicine at Oxford Health Plans in New York City.
``The fact that these centers are opening will put pressure on insurers to pay for more things,'' he said.
``But that will take time.
Right now, we're seeing very few insurers paying for any alternative medical treatment beyond chiropractic, which is licensed in all 50 states''.
But chiropractic is the one treatment that most of these centers have the hardest time offering, he said.
``Most academic medical centers freak out at the mere mention of the word''.
So where does that leave consumers?
``You'll see massage offered at most of the centers, but most insurers won't pay for it,'' Dillard said.
At best, you'll get a discounted rate.
How about acupuncture, therapeutic touch or nutritional counseling?
``Maybe,'' he said.
``But it's still not too common, no matter where it's provided''.
Insurance companies are motivated by numbers, he explained, meaning they will pay for treatments that are cost-effective.
So the pressure is on the complementary-care centers to track patient outcomes and prove to insurers that alternative treatments work as well as _ or better than _ conventional treatments in managing disease and keeping costs down.

OTTAWA _ In the United States, the gray wolf is a protected species, guarded by tough federal legislation.
In Canada, the creature is vermin.
Hunters are free to blast away at the beasts on whim, and they do.
A few years ago, US game biologists using radio collars to track gray wolves in Montana were horrified when a trio of females loped across the line to establish dens in Alberta.
Each found a mate, gave birth to cubs, and settled in.
Within 16 months, all of the female wolves, their offspring, and their mates had been killed by Canadian ranchers.
Such contradictions are commonplace along the border.
Among international wildlife groups, Canada is notorious for its failure to pass a federal endangered species law similar to one enacted in the United States more than a quarter-century ago.
Mexico has broad federal protections for threatened species, leaving Canada as North America's wildlife renegade.
Feeling the pressure, both domestically and from abroad, the country's new environmental minister, David Anderson, pledged last month to push for strong legislation that will place special emphasis on guarding breeding and ranging habitat, such as forest, wetlands, prairies, and coastal waters.
Canada has been down this road before.
Although Anderson is personally respected by environmentalists, there is cynicism as to whether a federal government that has shown a historic unwillingness to confront the issue can buck opposition from the country's extremely powerful forestry, mining, and agricultural industries _ as well as from provincial legislatures.
``We simply cannot get our act together in this country on the most fundamental of problems,'' said David Schindler, a renowned wildlife biologist and profesor of ecology at the University of Alberta.
``Far be it from Canada to stop loggers or miners or farmers from the innocent pursuit of destroying our natural heritage''.
In a country so vast and pristine that many of its citizens have difficulty comprehending that hundreds of native animal and plant species are in genuine danger, Canadian environmentalists find themselves fighting battles that their American counterparts won a generation ago.
``Richard Nixon brought in a darned good law in the US, and Pierre Trudeau refused,'' said Elizabeth May, executive director of the Canadian branch of the Sierra Club, referring to the former Canadian prime minister.
``That's been the story ever since.
Mexico can do it, Australia can do it, but good, green Canada can't''.
Earlier this year, more than 600 scientists from Canadian universities, research centers, and even the government's own wildlife agencies signed a strongly worded letter to Prime Minister Jean Chretien imploring federal Parliament to enact meaningful endangered species legislation.
``Canada's endangered species are too imperiled, too close to extinction, and too precious to be held hostage to lobbyists, political manipulation, or simple ignorance,'' the letter stated.
In cases like the gray wolf, opponents of a federal species law argue that the animal may be endangered in the United States, but healthy populations survive in Canada and do not deserve rigorous protection.
The grizzly bear, abundant in Alberta and British Columbia only a decade ago, is now in decline, according to many wildlife experts.
``The grizzly is going down rapidly in Alberta,'' said Schindler.
``Mainly because of huge intrusion into habitat by logging, oil, and gas companies''.
Even wolves are having problems.
In the Bow Valley of Banff National Park, one of the most famous symbols of Canada's raw beauty, not a single successful litter of wolves survived this year; all of the young creatures were killed by cars or met other misfortune from humans.
Canada has 339 species in serious danger of disappearing, according to wildlife experts, from the Peary caribou to the piping plover.
The federal government lists these animals and plants as endangered but has no broad laws to protect them.
Some of the creatures, such as the northern cricket frog or the Eskimo curlew _ an Arctic bird _ haven't been seen in years.
Others, from the Vancouver Island marmot on Canada's far west coast to the American marten in Newfoundland, on the country's easternmost edge, are down to a few hundred animals.
At least on paper, there are often local regulations or provincial laws to guard Canada's threatened animals or plants against hunters or trappers, or _ in the case of plants and insects _ against harvesters and collectors.
Critics say such laws are often toothless, and that the real danger to most Canadian wildlife is not the hunter's bullet but the developer's bulldozer, the logger's chainsaw, and the farmer's pesticides and plow.
``The real issue is habitat, not the individual animal,'' said Lindsay Rodger, species recovery manager for World Wildlife Fund-Canada.
``If we can't protect the spaces where endangered animals live and breed, we can't protect the animal''.
It is still open season on almost any creature in the provinces that have no endangered species laws, such as British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland.
``Canadians love peregrine falcons,'' one leading environmentalist joked darkly.
``They taste as good as bald eagle''.
In provinces with such laws, protections amount to no more than legal lip service.
Ontario, the most populous province _ where species such as the Acadian flycatcher, aurora trout, and Lake Erie water snake cling to the edge of survival _ has brought prosecutions only five times in 26 years.
On Prince Edward Island, warning signs and fences skirt the sand dunes that provide nesting grounds for the piping plover, a melodious shore bird fast disappearing from its widely scattered breeding ranges.
But bicyclists, hikers, and other beachgoers at spectacular Cavendish National Park regularly intrude on the grassy knolls.
Park officials claim to be helpless.
``Basically, the only authority we have is to put up signs saying it's bad to hurt the birds,'' said one uniformed ranger.
Nationally, a bigger threat comes from mining, forestry, and the petroleum industry, which are mainstays of the economy, especially in western Canada.
Recently, these industries have discovered a public relations problem related to habitat destruction _ something most American natural resources companies recognized decades ago.
But logging and mining outfits insist they cannot afford to support a federal endangered species act unless they get compensation.
Farmers also want federal paybacks for not plowing under habitat, a demand that gets more sympathy from environmentalists than from politicians.
Provincial governments insist that land management falls under their jurisdiction, and that federal protection for wildlife represents a slap against Canadian-style home rule.
A less obvious problem, but one cited repeatedly by wildlife experts, is psychological.
Canada is so vast and so relatively unspoiled that environmental protection has never carried the sense of public urgency that it does in the United States or Western Europe.
Much of Canada is frozen barrens or tundra, as inhospitable to most animals and plants as to humans.
Most, although not all, of the country's seriously endangered species inhabit the 200-mile-wide band along the US border that is also home to most of Canada's cities, factories, and farms.
``In a sense, Canadians are blinded by the country's amazing natural riches,'' Schindler said.
``It's hard to recognize the slippage.
But all the dangers are there.''
TUCSON, Ariz.
(AP) --Four endangered Mexican gray wolves have been freed to roam the Apache National Forest, the first of their breed released this year in efforts to restore the animals in their natural habitat.
Two adults and two pups born last year were released Monday after spending two months in an acclimation pen at Turkey Creek north of Clifton, near the New Mexico line about 160 miles east of Phoenix.
``These wolves were fairly anxious to run free.
One of the wolves was out before the biologists could retreat from the pen,'' said Dave Parsons, head of the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service's Mexican gray wolf recovery program, The wolves are native to Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico.
Two other adults have been free since December, but the program got off to a rocky start in 1998 when five of 11 animals released were shot to death.
No arrests have been made.
Plans call for another 11 wolves to be put into the wild this spring during the breeding season.
That includes a pair that will be carried by pack mules in specially built crates in mid-April into the Blue Range Primitive Area in eastern Arizona.
That pair will be directly into the roadless area without any transition period, Parsons said.
``It gives us a chance to put wolves in a much more remote area, deep in the Blue Range,'' he said.
All the animals being released will have fluorescent collars, so hunters can distinguish them from coyotes, and radio transmitters so biologists can track them.
The federal and state wolf program has changed its approach in its second year after criticism from ranchers and other local residents.
Most of the release sites will now be more remote, there will be more law enforcement agents in the areas and there will be a greater effort to alert residents, forest users and groups such as hunters' organizations.
Of the animals released in 1998, one wolf is missing and presumed dead, and three other females were returned to captivity.
Two males whose first mates were among the five killed were recaptured; one has been released a second time and the other's re-release is pending.
LOS ANGELES --Robert Smith led the leashed gray wolf Tatonka toward 50 nervous students Thursday at Van Nuys High School, where the mascot is a wolf.
The yellow-eyed, 125-pound canine can exert three times more jaw pressure than a German shepherd, enough to rip a human arm off, warned Smith, ranch manager for Wolves -N- Wildlife, a Fillmore educational group.
For a few tense moments, the teen-agers sat silently, not knowing what to expect next.
``Oh, how cute,'' 17-year-old junior Anush Artenyan said finally, breaking the silence and bringing smiles to her classmates.
Smith brought the 1-year-old wolf to school to show the students wolves are one of the world's most misunderstood animal.
``We teach kids the wolf is not the evil animal in `Little Red Riding Hood,''' Smith said.
`It's actually a gentle animal that will not hunt you down.
It's not the devil''.
Actually, Tatonka was raised in captivity and is used to being around humans.
Helen Champion, executive director of Mercy Crusade, Inc.
, a Thousand Oaks-based animal humane organization that sponsored the event, said she hopes the students understand the importance of protecting endangered wildlife like wolves.
``A lot of these kids will never get to see a real wolf,'' she said.
``Being the school is the home of the Wolves, this was perfect.
The school is now interested in adopting this wolf as its mascot''.
For student 17-year-old student Alisa Akilyan, the experience with the wolf was a memorable one, but she wanted to get closer.
``The eyes attracted me from far away,'' she said.
``When I saw the wolf, I noticed he wouldn't attack people.
I could tell he was kind so I didn't get scared.
I wish I could have touched him''.
Wolves -N- Wildlife is an educational wildlife group located on a 120-acre ranch in Fillmore, also home to nine other wolves, a Siberian tiger and a black bear.
At one time, wolves ranged all over the United States in large numbers, but traps and poison made them virtually extinct by 1930, he said.
In 1971, wolves were placed on the endangered species list.
Since then, wolves have been reintroduced in some western states and now number about 5,000, Smith said. &QL;
The federal government is preparing to announce that the gray wolf _ which was once nearly shot, trapped and poisoned out of existence in the lower 48 states _ is abundant enough in a few places that it no longer uniformly needs the strict protection afforded the country's most endangered species.
The Fish and Wildlife Service plans this month to propose dropping the wolf a significant notch under the Endangered Species Act, from endangered to threatened, in all but a small part of its range.
The change would mean that, in most areas, wolves that kill livestock or otherwise pose a threat to human affairs could be chased away or shot by government agents.
It also represents the first step toward eventually turning over management of the species, Canis lupus, in many places to state wildlife agencies.
Just about anything having to do with the wolf, which has been both reviled and revered through much of human history, generates fierce debate, and the proposed change in its status is no different.
Some conservation groups say the forthcoming plan would relax protections too soon and would declare victory before wolves have recolonized broad parts of their old range.
Many ranchers and conservative private groups, though, say the laws shielding wolves wrongly limit property owners' rights.
Wildlife officials acknowledge that, in part, the proposed change _ by allowing shooting of livestock raiders _ is intended to assuage opponents of wolf restoration, including ranchers and their allies in Congress.
But they argue that the relaxation of rules would be a net benefit for the species by diminishing the tendency of frustrated property owners to resort to illegal, uncontrolled killing of wolves.
Most significantly, the federal scientists said, the proposed change signals their confidence that the comeback of the wolf, although limited to less than 5 percent of its former range in this country, constitutes an important ecological success story _ like that of the American alligator, peregrine falcon and bald eagle before it.
They say that the lower 48 states had only about 400 wolves in 1973, when the Endangered Species Act was passed _ almost all of them in Minnesota or Michigan.
Now more than 3,500 animals roam parts of eight states.
Thousands more live in Alaska, Canada and parts of Europe.
``The question of the next decade, will not be how to save the wolf, but rather how best to manage the animal,'' according to a recent status report written by Dr.
L. David Mech, a biologist for the U.S.
Geological Survey and a leading wolf expert.
From coast to coast, conservation and property rights groups, ranchers and wildlife watchers still heatedly debate the possible reintroduction of a predator that is a first cousin of man's best friend but also is an age-old antagonist.
Last year, New Hampshire's Legislature approved a bill banning the reintroduction of wolves.
Oregon's congressional delegation has repeatedly introduced language that would limit wolf protections or bar even the natural migration of wolves from adjacent states.
Two wolves wandered into Oregon in the last year from experimental packs transplanted into central Idaho.
One was captured and sent home by federal officials and the other was killed by a car.
Environmental groups hailed the dispersing wolves as pioneers returning the call of the wild to the state after a 50-year absence.
Ranching groups said the state was well rid of them and did not need them back.
``We have excessive numbers of cougars, coyotes and bears that take a heavy toll on the other wildlife and livestock and we simply cannot add another predator,'' said Sharon Beck, a past president of the Oregon Cattlemen's Association.
But in some places, there are signs that wolves are becoming an accepted feature of the landscape outside of parks and preserves, and conflicts are shifting from whether they should be there to how they should be dealt with.
Some Montana ranchers have figured out high-tech ways of driving them away instead of resorting to high-powered rifles and a strategy popularly known as ``shoot, shovel and shut up''.
On his 4,000-acre ranch in Montana's Bitterroot Valley, Tom Ruffatto recently installed loud alarms that are triggered by the radio tracking collars used to monitor most of the area's wolf packs.
Ruffatto's project was partly paid for by Defenders of Wildlife, a private group that also writes checks to cover livestock losses from wolf attacks.
In Minnesota and parts of Wisconsin and Michigan, wolves are so abundant _ some have dens just 50 miles from Minneapolis _ that they could theoretically be removed entirely from the endangered list.
The only impediment lies in Minnesota, which has yet to follow the other two states and create its own wolf management program _ a prerequisite if federal protection is to be ended.
``No matter what is done in Minnesota, there's no way of threatening the wolf there anymore,'' said Mech (pronounced MEECH).
``I can't conceive of anything, excluding poison, that would endanger this population''.
Under the agency's classification scheme, the only place wolves would remain endangered would be portions of southern Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, where efforts to bolster a particularly rare subspecies have faltered, wildlife officials say.
As drafts of the new wolf classification proposal have circulated, private conservation groups, scientists, ranchers and others with an interest in the animal have begun lobbying for changes and girding for hearings and _ inevitably _ lawsuits.
Once it is formally released, the proposed classification change will be the subject of four months of public comment _ twice the required length _ and eight months of internal discussions and possible changes before it becomes a rule.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn The tug of war now is between those who want wolves restored to broader parts of their range, including the southern Rockies and the Northeast, and those who say that the existing numbers are sufficient.
The Endangered Species Act includes much flexibility on this point, containing no clear guidance on how much of a species' original range needs to be restored before it is declared saved.
A recent draft of the proposal was provided to a reporter by someone outside the Fish and Wildlife Service.
Officials at the agency said that almost all of the draft's major points would be reflected in the final version.
Under the plan, wolf habitat in the lower 48 states would be divided into four regions, with separate recovery plans for each.
The western Great Lakes region would encompass Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota and South Dakota.
The western region would be Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and parts of northern New Mexico and Arizona.
The southwestern region, the only one where wolves would remain endangered, would include some parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Texas.
The northeastern region would be New York, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine.
Wolves have not been seen in the Adirondacks in 100 years and only two possible sightings have been made in Maine, which is considered the likeliest spot for any future reintroduction effort.
But federal wildlife officials said they were not even sure what kind of wolves inhabited the Northeast, with some genetic studies suggesting that they were red wolves, a different species altogether.
In part because of those questions, no recovery effort is likely in the Northeast for many years, officials said.
In the rest of the contiguous states, the proposal says, wolves are never likely to be seen again, and thus in these areas _ 30 states in all _ the animals will be dropped from the list entirely, leaving any future decisions about restoration up to state officials.
Criticism of the impending plan is particularly acute in Colorado, where private wildlife groups have banded together into a coalition aimed at trying to replicate in the southern Rockies the successes with wolf introduction in Yellowstone National Park and Idaho.
Tina Arapkiles, a regional representative for the Sierra Club in Boulder, Colo.
, said the Fish and Wildlife Service was trying to wrap things up before the job was done.
``Their own studies said that over 1,000 wolves could exist in 11 of the national forests in Colorado alone,'' Arapkiles said.
Private land owners, including Ted Turner, the media tycoon, have offered expansive tracts of land, rich in elk and other prey, that could serve as wolf habitat, she added.
``To ignore that kind of potential is foolhardy,'' Arapkiles said.
But federal wildlife officials are standing by their conclusions, saying that the federal list of endangered species is the ecological equivalent of a hospital's intensive care unit, and that wolves are clearly ready for the recovery room.
Ron Refsnider, a wolf biologist for the wildlife agency based in Minnesota and the main author of the classification proposal, said there was still plenty of work to do to nurture the wolves living in the northern Rockies and especially in the Southwest.
``At best, those wolves have a tiny toehold on the landscape,'' Refsnider said, referring to areas along the Mexican border that could support the Mexican subspecies.
Right now, he said, fewer than two dozen wolves roam there.
Any significant new federal programs to expand the range of wolves, he said, would come at the expense of other species that might be just as important ecologically, but that do not have the mystique and high profile of a legendary predator.
``There was no intention that the act should be providing long-term care for these species,'' Refsnider said.
``The intent is to pull them back from the brink for the foreseeable future and turn them over to normal management agencies.
And that's what we're proposing.''
WASHINGTON _ The Interior Department will announce on Monday that it is considering the relaxation of federal protection for gray wolves in the Rocky Mountains and near the Great Lakes, because these wolf populations are increasingly safe from extinction.
Department officials said they believed it was time to remove about 2,500 wolves in Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin from the list of those animals protected under the Endangered Species Act, turning over to the states the authority to manage the wolves.
Much smaller populations in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho could be reclassified from endangered to the less-dire category of threatened, giving wildlife officials greater flexibility in controlling those wolves and managing their habitat as their numbers increase.
The move is part of a broad program by the Clinton administration to emphasize the successes of the Endangered Species Act by taking species off the protected list as their numbers increase.
Officials said they believed that wolves might again roam the Adirondacks of New York and the forests of northern Maine, and said they would study what level of protection to give wolves in the Northeast, where today there are few, if any.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called the new plan a step forward for the wolves, which were once widely reviled and hunted almost to extinction.
The rugged canines with the haunting howl have loped through primeval forests just as they prowl the human psyche in myth, folk tale and nursery rhyme.
Today, they have recaptured a revered status among conservation groups, reflecting their important ecological role as a top predator.
In interviews, Babbitt and Jamie Rappaport Clark, the director of the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, said the changes would not lessen the likelihood that wolf packs would continue to thrive and to extend into new territories.
Babbitt plans to explain the policies on Monday while visiting a wildlife science center in Minnesota where the animals are held captive to help rebuild their numbers.
The new policy will not affect the protection of wolves that were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho, reproducing successfully, even though these populations might be reclassified from endangered to threatened.
Nor will the plan change the status of Mexican gray wolves, a subspecies being reintroduced to the Southwest, or of red wolves in the Southeast.
Gray wolves in Alaska have never been listed as endangered or threatened.
Formal proposals will be published in a few months.
The changes in the wolves' legal status are not likely to occur before 1999, but officials said the department's intentions were unlikely to change.
``I think it is important to acknowledge success,'' Babbitt said.
``One reason the Endangered Species Act was in question was the opponents were saying it did not work''.
The department's proposals for managing wolves have long been contentious, but this time some conservation groups are willing to support easing the protection.
``We think it is the right thing for the wolves, at the right time,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of the National Wildlife Foundation.
``It is the way the Endangered Species Act was designed to work''.
Proponents of relaxing the protections for wolves say that the change will make it easier to convince farmers and ranchers that the wolves can expand into new areas without threatening their livelihoods.
The wolves eat anything from small animals like mice and rabbits to larger species like sheep and cattle.
A population of wolves listed as threatened or not listed for the law's protections at all may be managed under state or Federal plans that allow some wolves to be killed and some of their habitat destroyed, as long as helping the species recover remains the overall objective.
When the population is classified as endangered, tighter protections apply and people who oppose the spread of wolves are more likely to resist reintroduction.
The Interior Department has listed gray wolves as an endangered species through most of the lower 48 states since 1973, when the Endangered Species Act was passed.
No wolf recovery plan has been drafted for the Northeast, but proponents believe that the Adirondacks and Maine provide suitable conditions, and planning may now begin.
Although it might be possible for wolves to move naturally back into the Northeast from Canada, little migration has been detected.
The government is far from committing to a reintroduction of the wolves, but the legal doors have cracked open.
``Do we have immediate plans for reintroduction?
No,'' Ms.
Clark of the Fish and Wildlife Service said.
``But there is suitable habitat, there is a potential opportunity, there are suitable prey species''.
In the Northeast, moose and white-tail deer would be among the gray wolf's prey.
``Part of the vision for the grand Laurentian forest from the Adirondacks up to Maine is to bring back the wolves,'' Van Putten said.
``We think the proposal Secretary Babbitt is going to announce will make it more likely that that will happen.''
PHOENIX _ Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said endangered Mexican gray wolves are here to stay, and the former Arizona governor meant it, as more wolves arrive today (WED.
JAN 13) in the Apache National Forest.
Despite a quartet of unsolved wolf killings, two disappearances and three recaptures, the second year of a controversial wolf reintroduction experiment will see more wolves than ever this winter _ perhaps as many as 17.
Some wolves may even arrive by helicopter as researchers attempt to keep the captive-bred wolves as wild as possible by releasing them in the most inaccessible parts of the forest.
``My goal is to make these wolves as wild as possible, and keep them wild,'' said Diane Boyd-Heger, Mexican wolf biologist for the Arizona Game and Fish Department.
All the wolves released this winter sport bright orange, pink or yellow markings on their fur and their radio-location collars, an attempt to prevent hunters from mistaking them for coyotes.
Meanwhile, environmentalists continue to post a $50,000 reward for the arrest of those responsible for last year's wolf killings, while ranchers continue their opposition to the reintroductions with a new federal court petition.
``You have a government program that can destroy an individual and his private property,'' said Sam Luce, a rancher along the isolated Blue River whose trained cow dog, Pepi, was killed by a wolf last year.
Despite fears expressed by ranchers and others, no cattle, sheep or people have been killed or injured by the wolves, which generally feed on overpopulated herds of wild elk.
Federal biologists plan to re-establish a self-supporting population of at least 100 wolves in eastern Arizona and western New Mexico by 2005.
At that point, the wolves might be removed from the federal Endangered Species List.
The lobos of the Southwest are the rarest subspecies of wolf in North America, and their recovery is the No.
1 priority among international wolf experts.
There are fewer than 200 at 40 zoos and breeding centers.
The reintroduction efforts across the West represent a complete reversal of policy by the federal government.
Earlier this century, government agents _ acting on behalf of ranchers _ shot and poisoned Mexican wolves, leaving none in the wilds of the United States after 1970 and none in the wild in Mexico after 1980.
Last week, (Jan 7 ) the first of up to four new wolf packs arrived in eastern Arizona _ an adult pair and their three 8-month-old pups.
Their arrival comes a year after Babbitt brought 11 wolves to Arizona to get the program started.
Another adult pair and two more pups arrive today, two pairs of adults were released Dec.
11 and two more pairs of adult wolves may arrive before the end of winter.
Although they wear brightly colored collars, their thick winter fur could obscure these markings, and hunters remain responsible for identifying their targets.
Researchers plan to release some wolves inside the Blue Range Primitive Area, one of the first places in the national forest system to ban motorized vehicles.
No pens or other structures can be built inside the primitive area, so wolves released there might be brought in by helicopter and immediately left to fend for themselves.
But even the primitive area hosts a few ranchers, like Bill and Barbara Marks, who fear the wolves brought in by helicopter will be too close to their spring calving grounds.
``This is our reward for opposing the program,'' said Barbara Marks.
The Markses, like most ranchers in the West, own a small amount of private land surrounded by government lands they lease for their cattle.
Of the 11 wolves brought to the wilds of Arizona last year, five were shot dead, one is missing and presumed dead and three were recaptured for their own protection.
In addition, the first Mexican wolf pup born in the wild in half a century is missing and presumed dead.
Of the original 11, the two remaining males were paired last month with two new females.
A $50,000 reward is offered for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the deaths of the wolves, whose killing is punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 and a year in prison.
But so far, there have been no arrests, and speculation is growing among those involved in the reintroduction that the killings may have been random acts by hunters.
Whatever the case, Babbitt condemned the wolf killings and promised that no matter what, more wolves would come.
``I don't know who did it, but it's a tragic event.
It's not in anybody's best interest, whether they're hunters or ranchers or anyone else''.

DENVER (AP) --A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that hundreds of transplanted Canadian wolves can remain in the northern Rockies, a decision environmentalists hailed as a boon for species recovery efforts nationwide.
The 10th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 1997 decision by a Wyoming federal judge who ruled that a government wolf reintroduction program in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho was illegal.
Ranchers and state farm bureaus oppose the 5-year-old program because they say the wolves endanger livestock.
They also claim that the program is unnecessary because there is already a viable wolf population in the area.
The government and environmental groups deny that, and say there may be only a few lone native wolves.
The groups suing over the program, the American Farm Bureau Federation and state chapters in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, employed an unusual tactic.
They pointed out that while native wolves are covered by the Endangered Species Act, the reintroduced wolves are considered part of an ``experimental population'' and can be shot if they threaten livestock.
The farm groups said the reintroduction program violates the Endangered Species Act by providing different protections to the native and the reintroduced wolves.
But the appeals court said the 1973 Endangered Species Act and a section added by Congress in 1982 were intended to allow the Interior Department flexibility in its approaches to the goals of preserving and recovering threatened animals.
The appeals court said a limit to that flexibility ``ignores biological reality and misconstrues the larger purpose'' of the law.
Environmental groups that joined Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and other government agencies in the appeal of the Wyoming ruling said Thursday's decision sets an important precedent.
``The practical effect is that the wolves are here to stay,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of the National Wildlife Federation, adding that the decision has ``enormous significance nationwide''.
Van Putten said there is a thriving population of about 300 wolves in Yellowstone and central Idaho as a result of the reintroduction program.
Babbitt called the decision ``a ringing endorsement to our wolf reintroduction program''.
Jon Robinett, who says his livestock has been attacked repeatedly by wolves at his ranch in Dubois, Wyo.
, about 40 miles from Yellowstone, was disappointed with the ruling.
``I just don't think they paid close enough attention to what was presented to them,'' he said.
``Maybe they weren't well-versed in the Endangered Species Act''.
In 1997, U.S.
District Judge William Downes ordered the reintroduced wolves removed but stayed his ruling pending the decision by the federal appeals court.
You might have read last week about an endangered Mexican gray wolf that was found dead in the White Mountains near the carcass of an elk calf.
The wolves, raised in captivity, are a recent reintroduction to Arizona, an attempt to re-establish the wolf.
Unfortunately, this small female was the mother of the only pup born in the wild that still was there.
Biologists may try to provide food for the motherless pup and attempt to keep it in the wild.
An alternative would be to capture it and raise it in captivity.
Another wolf was shot by a camper, who said he killed the animal after it attacked his dog.
The U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service won't prosecute the camper.
But the death of the female wolf seems more compelling because it apparently happened during a conflict with another predator _ namely a mountain lion, perhaps the most formidable killer in the state.
But before the confrontation could be figured out completely, federal agents had to determine whether a crime had been committed.
Since the wolf was an endangered species, the place of her death was treated as a crime scene.
It's against the law to kill a member of an endangered species.
The wolf's remains were sent to experts for examination.
``A chunk of its side was ripped out, which could have been consistent with being shot with a high-powered rifle,'' said &UR; John &UR; Phelps, furbearer specialist for the Arizona Game and Fish Department.
``That was the first thought''.
When it was determined that probably wasn't the case, Phelps said, other biologists were allowed to examine the scene.
It appears, Phelps said, the lion had killed the elk calf and was challenged by the wolf.
``A pack of wolves can challenge a lion,'' he said, ``but usually an individual wolf wouldn't do that _ especially a small female like that''.
Perhaps it should have been, but taking out this wolf was no easy task for the lion, according to Phelps.
``The whole hillside was torn up,'' he said.
``There apparently was a pretty good fight.
Usually, a lion will grab the back of the neck and break it or grab the throat and suffocate when it attacks.
This was a small wolf, but it put up a good fight.
This was not typical of a lion kill''.
Some of the wolves have shown signs of their inexperience in the wild.
There have been reports that some have shown little fear of humans.
There was speculation that the dead wolf, probably having never encountered a lion, didn't know how formidable this foe would be.
But she obviously was aggressive.
``That's the kind of wolf you'd like out there (if the species is going to re-establish itself),'' Phelps said.
``It's too bad she had to die.
``She was just too aggressive''.
&QL; Information growing &QL; In the next few weeks, Game and Fish should have available on its Internet site a unit-by-unit breakdown of hunting information on both small and big game, according to &UR; Bob Miles, a public information officer for the department who is organizing the service.
Only bison will be excluded.
The information will be compiled from the reports of wildlife managers in the various units, who work the field in those areas.
There will be reports on quail and other small game plus reports on big-game populations.
``This isn't an attempt to tell hunters which rocks to hunt under,'' Miles said.
``But it will be an overview with specific information on each unit.
It will give them a general place to start.
``It should be a tremendous help to hunters _ especially for small-game stuff.
It will be more basic for big game.
But it will give good access information''.
Miles, who once worked in the Tucson region, said a similar Internet page was developed there and became the most popular part of the region's Web site.
The information also will be available in hard copy at Game and Fish's regional offices free of charge.
Target date is about Sept.

Someone has shot dead yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona, the fifth one killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year, federal officials said Tuesday.
The latest wolf death has environmentalists calling for FBI intervention, while some ranchers say now is a good time to abandon the experiment.
A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called the latest killing ``incomprehensible,'' and she repeated Babbitt's vow last week that the wolf reintroduction program _ and the goal of returning at least 100 Mexican wolves to the wild in the next decade _ will continue.
Meanwhile, there are allegations that a $35,000 bounty has been posted for the wolves' slaughter.
Coincidentally, that is the same amount the federal government and environmentalists are offering for information leading to the arrest of the wolf killer or killers.
For now, there are only four wolves remaining in the wild, and none is running free.
The two surviving males from the original group of 11 brought to the wilds of Arizona in January _ the first wild wolves in the Southwest in 28 years _ were recaptured this week.
There were placed in pens with two new females Babbitt delivered last week from the New Mexico ranch of cable-TV mogul Ted Turner.
Those four wolves will be released in about two months, and four more wolf packs will arrive this winter.
The latest wolf killing occurred near Hawley Lake, on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, between Show Low and Springerville.
Like four others, the wolf appeared to have been shot, said Tom Bauer, spokesman for the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service in Albuquerque.
Government biologists found the dead wolf Monday.
Barbara Marks, a rancher and spokeswoman for the Arizona Cattlemen's Association, said now is a good time to end the program, since all the wolves have been rounded up and none is running wild.
``How much money do they have to spend before they admit that it's a failure, for the wolves and for the community?
It's been a cruel experiment,'' said Marks, who lives in the isolated Blue Primitive Area, which has been the primary wolf release area.
In contrast, Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity, said the federal government should increase the reward leading to the arrest of the wolf killers to $50,000 and begin releasing wolves in the Gila and Aldo Leopold wilderness areas in New Mexico as well as the Blue.
Cattle ranching, Suckling said, should be phased out in all three areas; the government should close unneeded roads in the Apache and Gila national forests, and provide full wilderness status, which would ban mechanized vehicles, to the Blue range; and ranchers should drop their federal lawsuit challenging the wolf releases.
``They (ranchers) may not have pulled the actual trigger.
But by creating this anti-wolf climate up there, they have encouraged whoever did it,'' Suckling said.
Two leaders of Santa Fe environmental groups _ Pat Wolff of New West Research, and Sam Hitt of Forest Guardians _ said the federal government has failed to fully investigate information they have collected that they say points to wolf bounties of up to $35,000 being offered by an as yet unidentified man from Catron County, N.M.
They said a tape recording they obtained of a federal prison inmate in Tucson indicates a wolf bounty was being offered by someone affiliated with the New Mexico ranching groups.
``That's laughable,'' said Caren Cowen, executive secretary of the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association.
``Patricia Wolff has really gone off the deep end this time.
``We are pursuing our case through the courts.
There is no reason to go out and senselessly and needlessly kill an animal''.
Both Marks and Cowen said it is doubtful ranchers are the killers because they not only would risk fines under the Endangered Species Act of $100,000 and a year in prison, but they also would risk losing their right to graze livestock on public lands.
Hitt, of Forest Guardians, also has called on Babbitt to bring in the FBI, saying the law enforcement officers of the Fish and Wildlife Service are prone to intimidation by ranchers and not backed up by their superiors.
Babbitt said more federal officers are already assigned to the case and there is no need to involve the FBI, but if the help of other federal agencies is needed, he will call for it.
Of the 13 wolves brought to the wild this year, five were shot, three were recaptured for their own protection, one is missing and presumed dead, and four remain.
In addition, the pup of one of the wolves killed _ the first wolf pup born in the wilds of Arizona in half a century _ also is missing and presumed dead.
Bobbie Holaday of Phoenix, the 76-year-old retired computer systems analyst that led the decadelong charge to return the wolves, called the wolf killings ``beyond comprehension''.
``It's so. . . difficult to think that there are people with so much hate in their lives . . . to do such atrocious acts,'' Holaday said.

(UNDATED) _ Under crystal skies, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt carried two burdens Monday into the pine-studded forests of eastern Arizona.
One was a heavy steel cage.
Inside was one of two endangered Mexican gray wolves delivered Monday to the wilds of the Apache and Gila national forests.
The second was a message for those who in recent weeks have gunned down three of the rare lobos, including the mother of the first wolf pup born in the wilds of Arizona in half a century.
``The wolf is here to stay,'' said the former Arizona governor.
Babbitt returned to the same rocky ridge where in January he took part in the release of the first 11 wolves into the wilds of the Southwest in nearly three decades.
``It's just incomprehensible that people would view this (wolf) as a threat, and that they would resort to this kind of violence,'' he said.
Although sheep and cattle ranchers feared their herds would be decimated, the wolves have not killed any livestock.
A reward of $30,000 is posted for information leading to the arrest of the wolf killers.
The killing of an endangered animal can result in a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.
The wolves are being returned to the wild in an effort to increase their numbers, remove them from the list of species in danger of extinction and put back a predator into the Southwest ecosystems that will help ensure populations of other animals are kept in check.
Babbitt met Monday morning in Albuquerque with state and federal law enforcement officers from Arizona and New Mexico, and he promised to provide whatever resources are needed to bring the killer or killers to justice.
And he promised to return again this winter, when four additional wolf packs are planned to be released, part of a multiyear plan to eventually have more than 100 wild wolves scattered over 5,000 square miles of some of the most rugged land along the Arizona-New Mexico line.
Babbitt also left open the possibility that a federal investigation may not be over for a Tucson man who killed the first wolf in April _ a controversial shooting that was ruled an act of self-defense.
He said decisions in the case involving retired postal worker Richard Humphrey are up to law enforcement agents.
But when pressed for whether the case may be reopened, Babbitt said, ``I'd just rather not comment on it''.
The interior secretary, who heads the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, said there is no evidence that Humphrey or any member of his family was under attack.
And he said it remains true that there is no documented case of a healthy wild wolf in North America this century ever attacking a human being.
``I don't think the facts support any inference that the wolf was anything other than an animal that happened to be in the neighborhood,'' Babbitt said.
G.J. of Tucson, a hunting enthusiast who has acted as a spokesman for Humphrey, said he believes it is possible that the three wolves shot in August, October and earlier this month may also have been killed legitimately.
``It may well be that several people had a run-in with the wolves similar to Humphrey, and are afraid to turn themselves in after witnessing his public crucifixion,'' said Sagi, the former editor of a newsletter called ``Outdoor News''.
Sagi said he closed shop because of the harassment he's suffered while sticking up for Humphrey.
Still, Sagi said whoever killed the wolves recently should consult an attorney and turn themselves in to the authorities.
``Whether a series of accidents or deliberate sabotage, one thing is for sure: The recent killings are a monolithic catastrophe in the effort to reintroduce the Mexican gray wolf, and speak volumes about the need for coalition building in this and any federal effort that potentially impacts recreation and property rights,'' Sagi said.
Babbitt said the wolf program goes beyond building bridges with the local community.

TUCSON, Ariz.
(AP) --A pack of Mexican gray wolves that repeatedly harassed or attacked cattle in eastern Arizona is being relocated.
Wildlife officials have tracked the pack --an adult male and female, a female yearling and an unknown number of pups -- for two weeks, following complaints from ranchers in the Apache National Forest.
The adult male and the yearling were recently captured and officials hope to catch the adult female and her pups and relocate the pack to an area free of livestock.
Officials heading the federal reintroduction program hope to intercede before the pups get used to livestock as a food source, instead of deer, elk and other wildlife.
``They tried an experiment in that location and it didn't work and they're responding,'' said C.B.
Lane, director of natural resources for the Arizona Cattlemen's Association, which opposes the reintroduction program.
``It gives us a good feeling that the government does understand that there's more to life than just where the wildlife are''.
On Thursday, federal wildlife officials said they have confirmed two attacks on calves, including a death Sunday.
Bob Dyson, a spokesman for the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, said there is speculation that pups may have seen, if not participated, in the calf killing.
Federal officials said there have been other instances where wolves chased cattle but were driven off by people.
Mexican gray wolves are native to Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico but were shot, poisoned and trapped to near extinction by the 1970s.
Five packs with more than two dozen wolves are in eastern Arizona's wilderness as part of the reintroduction program.
Five captive-born wolves released last year were killed and others were re-captured.
GARDINER, Montana _ One of the most persistent problems in Western tourism has been solved in this small town on the northern edge of Yellowstone National Park.
The hardest thing to find (at a reasonable price) in Montana is a steak cooked the way you want it.
It is true, in the big cities on the plains, they have heard of ``rare''.
Also in Gardiner (population under 1,000), at Red's Blue Goose Saloon and Barbeque, they know what rare means.
You can get cool rare, warm rare and medium rare at Red's.
A few miles south, down in the park, the wolves are thriving on a diet of extremely rare elk chops.
Forget everything you learned on television about wolves.
They do not have small litters of pups in Yellowstone.
It is not just the Alpha female who gets to have pups.
There are packs of wolves in Yellowstone where every female has had a litter this year, and some of them have had as many as eight and 10 pups.
This is unheard of, but so is putting a couple of dozen wolves out in the middle of a few hundred thousand elk who have, apparently, forgotten what wolves are and what wolves do.
Irven DeVore, a distinguished primatologist (the study of apes and other beings like you and me) at Harvard University hooked up with some mammalogists (wolves and elks and also you and me) to visit Yellowstone last winter and had the privilege, if not necessarily the pleasure, of watching a few wolves eat an elk.
``That elk had no idea,'' he remarked, ``that these wolves weren't just oversized coyotes.
There wasn't a chase.
They just walked up to that elk and ate it''.
Finding a large carnivore in Yellowstone is not as easy as it was in the days when people fed the bears at the roadside.
Grizzly bear sightings are remarkable, and a grizzly that stays in view of one of the park's paved roads will stop traffic in both directions for a couple of miles.
Wolves have the same effect, but they move around more than grizzlies and seldom stay long enough to attract more than a few hundred automotive naturalists before moving off into the woods or over the ridgeline, out of sight.
The bears don't move as much, for a variety of reasons, but mainly because the grizzly bear can do whatever it darn well pleases.
With a long day to make a short drive, it seemed like a sensible idea to put away the fishing tackle (Yellowstone, on a bad day, is still the best trout fishing country in the Lower 48) and make a small attempt to find a wolf.
It is not a good idea to make a major expedition, the price of disappointment increases with the effort expended, whether it's fly-fishing or wolf-watching.
The best country for wolves this summer had been the Yellowstone River valley below the falls and over on a tributary, the Lamar River basin.
The reason has more to do with human ability than actual wolf presence.
The lower Yellowstone and Lamar valleys are less traveled by automobiles, and the landscape is prairie-like for the most part, not forested.
You can see a wolf a lot easier through clear air than through lodgepole pine trees.
The plan (even when you're relaxed, it doesn't hurt to have a plan) was simple, just head for the Lamar Valley between the Tower-Roosevelt intersection and where the country pinches in around the road at Soda Butte, park the car, walk up the hillside until you had a sweeping view of the valley, and get out the binoculars and start looking for wolves along the treeline and in the swales where they would be out of sight of the highway but visible to the brave, solitary, resourceful amateur mammalogist, moi.
Even with a plan, it is good to be flexible.
Less than halfway from Gardiner to the place I had in mind, the Lamar Valley near Slough Creek Road, I noticed a road sign for something called Blacktail Plateau Drive.
It was a one-way dirt road, six miles in length, a second sign explained.
No problem.
The day was young, and a six mile dirt-road detour doesn't slow you down much in a park that has a 45-mile-per-hour speed limit on the most open roads.
And halfway down the dirt, a very large coyote ran across the road in front of the car.
That is what my brain said: ``Big coyote''.
Like the elk, I hadn't seen a wolf in my life.
Well, unlike the elk, I'd seen a couple running around a cage in the London Zoo.
Then the brain took a timeout: too huge around.
Too tall.
Tail too brushy.
Shoulders too heavy.
A series of ``toos'' added up to wolf.
So, taking a lifetime of wildlife watching experience in hand, I parked the car off the road, got the binoculars, and started scanning the ridgeline toward which my wolf had disappeared.
He (she, it, whatever) would have to come up out of the low country and cross that ridge, that's what the well-trained brain said.
Another vehicle stopped, and a man and a woman got out with their binoculars.
This is what happens in Yellowstone when anyone sees anyone else peering through lenses at the distant vistas.
``Wolf,'' I whispered.
``Went that way''.
A few minutes later, I felt a gentle nudge.
``Wolf,'' the man said in a conversational tone.
``Actually, four of them.
Over there.
Behind you''.
A long way behind, two or three football fields away, up on a bench were wolves.
And suddenly, the brain also remarked that those hadn't been dogs barking, those were wolves having a discussion about where to go to eat what.
We watched wolves for an hour.
A couple disappeared, one at a time, over a more distant ridge line.
The remaining two did interesting wolf things.
They sat down.
They sat up.
They lay down.
They got up.
They ignored each other.
They sat around together.
It was not as good as watching them eat an elk, I suppose, but it was enormously satisfying.
In the entire hour, no more than four cars stopped to not dance with the wolves but to peer at them through binoculars, spotting scopes, and long camera lenses.
It was a civil, polite, small crowd.
Newcomers would be advised exactly where to look (to the naked eye, the wolves were the size of poppy seeds on the other side of the kitchen table, so to speak).
We departed, one by one, newcomers arrived, one by one, and I am sure that as long as the wolves were visible, someone was there to watch them do their wolf act.
We were a happy few, a band of wolf-watchers, with an almost private, and certainly elite, wolf-viewing party on Blacktail Plateau Drive.
&QL; WOLF KILLED-ARIZONA (Undated) - Someone killed yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona, federal officials said Tuesday, the fifth lobo killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year.
The latest killing has environmentalists calling for FBI and National Guard intervention.
Also, new evidence says a $35,000 bounty has been posted for the wolves' slaughter.
Ironically, that is the same amount the federal government and environmentalists are offering for information leading to the arrest of the wolf killer or killers.

Greg Collins still wore blood-stained khaki pants as his friends dragged him from the Bear Wallow Cafe _ the end of another successful day of elk hunting in the heart of eastern Arizona wolf country.
``There's nothing wrong with wolves,'' said Collins, a hunter, miner and coppersmith who lives in the hills near Silver City, N.M.
``(But) I will shoot a wolf on sight, and I'd like the FBI tagging along.
You are not going to tell me what to do''.
If Collins' view seems contradictory, it reflects a deep-rooted conflict many folks along the Arizona-New Mexico line have about the federal government's program this year to repopulate the Apache and Gila national forests with endangered Mexican gray wolves.
Many here say they are not so much against the wolves, as they are against what the wolf represents: the steady erosion of a Western lifestyle dependent on mining, ranching and logging.
Five of the wolves have been shot to death, a federal crime that carries a potential fine of $100,000 and a year in prison.
A state-federal task force is investigating, but so far has not filed charges against anyone.
A $50,000 reward has been offered for the capture of the wolf killers.
The mystery surrounding the killings has led to claims of death threats received by ranchers and environmentalists.
But no one has been harmed, and no sheep or cattle have been eaten by wolves.
Between conflicting theories of intentional sabotage and random accidents, Collins shares another theory that the wolves were intentionally shot by different people in opportunistic moments of frustration.
``What's the big deal?
You see a wolf, you shoot a wolf,'' said Max Schowengerdt, a former Las Vegas, Nev.
, construction contractor who recently retired to the mountains of western New Mexico.
To these hunters, the potential suspects in the wolf shootings could include anyone in the economically depressed region, which has an unemployment rate three times the states' averages.
``Every truck that goes down this street has a gun in it.
Does that mean they're militia?
No. It's because their daddy and their daddy's daddy had guns,'' Schowengerdt said.
There also are those who believe that the wolves were mistaken for coyotes, even though wolves are nearly three times the size of coyotes.
Among those are Jess Carey, a former Catron County sheriff and gun shop owner from Reserve, N.M., who was subpoenaed last month by a federal grand jury investigating the wolf killings.
Carey turned over reams of records, guns and ammunition to special agents of the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, anything that related to the kinds of shell casings found near the dead wolves.
Although the Fish and Wildlife Service says they have no suspects, Carey said he was handed a piece of paper _ with his name on it _ that listed the suspects in the wolf killings.
``I knew each and every one of these people who bought these guns, and not one of them was capable of shooting any wolves,'' Carey said.
Asked how he could be so sure, he said, ``Because everyone of those people are law-abiding citizens.
And they're not going to go out here and shoot a wolf''.
For many, the wolves represent the latest intrusion by environmentalists and federal land managers.
Timber production has fallen throughout Arizona and New Mexico as federal land managers move to comply with federal court orders in lawsuits brought by environmentalists aimed as saving other threatened and endangered wildlife such as the Mexican spotted owl.
Falling copper prices also are forcing layoffs of hundreds of miners in New Mexico.
And ranchers are under pressure to cut back their herds in areas where federal land managers move to restore rivers and streams damaged by decades of overgrazing livestock.
Bill Marks, for example, has cut his herds in half in recent years, and he faces more cuts next year.
At the same time, federal officials plan to release at least one wolf pack near Bear Valley, within a quarter-mile of spring calving areas.
``All they (wolves) have to do is find one stillborn calf, and they'll be right on them,'' said Marks, who worked throughout the summer to scare wolves away from his cattle.
``This is the kind of cooperation I'm getting,'' Marks said of the releases planned near his ranch in the Blue Range Primitive Area.
Prior to their release into the wild, wolves have been put in acclimation pens that ring the Primitive Area.
After several weeks, they are released into the forest.
Four more wolves currently in such pens will be released today.
And at least two more wolf packs will be released from acclimation pens in coming months.
But the use of acclimation pens has led to accusations by ranchers that the wolves _ which were raised in zoos and other captive breeding facilities _ are too dependent on humans bringing them food.
Ranchers say that the wolves starved when they weren't fed road-kill and that the wolves are attracted by the sound of automobiles.
Dave Parsons, Mexican wolf recovery leader for the Fish and Wildlife Service, said wolves have learned on their own to hunt wild game _ mostly elk, which compete with cattle for forage.
The wolves, he said, are afraid of people, but don't seem to move far enough away to keep from being shot.
As part of the ongoing reintroduction experiment, biologists plan to release one or two pairs of wolves _ possibly by helicopter _ directly into the Blue Range Primitive Area, a roadless zone where mechanized vehicles are prohibited.
No pens are allowed to be built inside the Primitive Area, and wolves released there will be forced to fend for themselves right from the start.
Meanwhile, to avoid confusing them with coyotes, federal officials are releasing the wolves today with brightly colored radio collars and brightly painted markings on their hips.
If these wolves are shot to death, it could only be by someone who purposely wanted wolves dead.
Because most mammals are colorblind, the markings will not affect the wolves' ability to hunt.
But the new wolf-painting effort was criticized Thursday by Peter Galvin, conservation biologist for the Tucson-based Southwest Center for Biological Diversity.
Instead, he believes coyote hunting should be outlawed in the wolf recovery area.
Shooting coyotes is a time-honored pastime in the rural Southwest.
Many believe that killing coyotes means more deer, elk and antelope fawns will survive each spring.
But biological studies show that no matter how many coyotes are killed, they reproduce rapidly, and quickly fill every ecological niche available.
Ironically, recent studies of wolves in Yellowstone National Park show the one way to effectively remove coyotes is the reintroduction of wolves.

The Clinton Administration's trademark new approach to enforcing the Endangered Species Act on millions of acres of private lands has often relied on shaky science, a broad new study has found.
The draft study, performed by 119 independent scientists with National Science Foundation funding, highlights scientific weaknesses in more than 200 Habitat Conservation Plans, which the administration has fequently substituted for bans on disturbing species protected by the Act.
The plans are agreements between landowners and the federal government.
They allow the landowners to develop, mine, log _ or otherwise use _ their property.
In return, the landowners agree to make habitat improvements that lessen the harm to the endangered plants or animals.
The plans have reshaped the way the Endangered Species Act is enforced on about 5 million acres of state and private land, and they're spreading rapidly.
The areas covered by the habitat conservation plans range from suburban sage-scrub brush of gnatcatchers in Southern California to the red-cockaded woodpecker's longleaf pine forests in North Carolina.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said he welcomed the study as ``innovative'' and ``helpful''.
He said it is spurring his agency to rewrite guidelines for habitat planning.
Overall, the study concludes that the plans often lack scientific support for conclusions that they would help at-risk species.
Plans commonly fail to assess how many protected plants or animals would be disturbed, show how this would affect the species' survival, or prescribe monitoring that will indicate how the species actually fare, the study says.
The problems stem, in part, from a lack of available scientific data, according to the study, which also says that the estimates of the plans' impact on senstivie species are, at times, ``very close to a guess''.
The Clinton administration contends the plans get owners of private land, the site of 80 percent of endangered species habitat, to preserve or improve habitat that otherwise might be lost.
And large landowners, especially timber companies in the Northwest, have come to enthusiastically embrace the plans.
They have negotiated or are working on agreements that would effect about 11 million acres in Washington, Oregon California, Idaho and Montana.
That land includes one quarter of non-federal commercial timberland in the region.
In recent years, the plans have drawn mounting criticism from environmental groups and some conservation biologists.
A draft of the new study, obtained by the Post-Intelligencer, supported some of those complaints.
It found: _ No estimates regarding the number of at-risk plants or animals killed or disrupted by the authorized plans were done for about two-thirds of the species covered.
_ Inadequate assessment of the impact of those losses on the species' survival was ``especially common''.
_ Almost two-thirds of the plans fail to show that the improvements minimize damage to the species as much as is practicable, as the Endangered Species Act requires.
_ Less than 10 percent of the plans ``had clear monitoring programs that were sufficient for evaluating success''.
_ About 25 percent of the plans fail to assess whether habitat is currently sufficient to support recovery of the species or what cumulative impacts would result from piecemeal loss of habitat.
_ The agency has been negotiating plans that last as long as 100 years, with guarantees that no further concessions will be asked, without regard to uncertainties about whether they will provide adequate species protection.
Laverne Smith, chief of Interior's Division of Endangered Species, declined to respond to any of the draft's specific criticisms.
She said a formal response is being drafted.
The study, which eclipses previous habitat planning reviews in both depth and scope, was coordinated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at the University of California at Santa Barbara with financial assistance from the National Science Foundation and the American Institute for Biological Sciences.
The scientists from eight universities evaluated 208 of 227 habitat plans, with an in-depth look at 43 of them.
Though still subject to revisions, the draft study expands on findings reported in December.
At that time, Peter Kareiva, the University of Washington ecologist who supervised the study, said, ``There are a huge number of Habitat Conservatin Plans (HCPs) that probably should not have been written''.
Kareiva could not be reached for comment on the latest version of the report.
The White House announced in February it intends to improve HCP guidelines.
Interior Department officials have been working on language to require plans to have clear monitoring programs, measurable biological goals and more public review.
And, where information is lacking, the government is seeking shorter duration and more clauses that would force landowners to tighten safeguards if new species problems developed.
In a recent interview, Babbitt dismissed many of the problems as necessary growing pains for a new program.
``Obviously, this stuff is all new and we're cutting it out of whole cloth,'' Babbitt said.
``We've got a couple hundred HCPs.
Now, what we have to do is go back and look at all of them and see if there are lessons we can learn''.
Federal officials noted that the plans cannot be delayed for perfect data and are negotiated compromises, not pure science.
The study follows mounting criticism from other quarters.
In 1996, 167 scientists complained about the plans' lack of independent scientific review and warned they ``have the potential to become habitat giveaways that contribute to, rather than alleviate, threats to listed species and their habitats''.
Several environmental groups and members of congress have also raised concerns.
``Giving it all away'' is what a coalition of Northwest environmental groups last year called a review of the plans.
One notable exception to the environmental group critics is Michael Bean of the Environmental Defense Fund, a highly regarded expert on on U.S. wildlife law.
Bean agrees that some of the plans are ``lousy,'' but says they can produce net gains.
``HCPs have the potential to produce results that are far better than we could otherwise expect,'' he said, especially where human intervention is needed to restore habitat or combat an invasive exotic species.
Calling it a success story on a par with the comeback of the bald eagle, federal wildlife officials announced Tuesday that the gray wolf, hunted nearly to extinction a century ago, has rebounded enough to no longer be considered an endangered species in most of the country.
The wolves, which once roamed from Canada to Mexico, have been stalked for centuries like no other animal, starting in 1630, when the Massachusetts Bay Colony paid a month's salary for each one killed.
By the time they received federal protection in 1973 there were only a few hundred left.
But nowadays, with more than 3,500 wolves living in eight states, US Fish and Wildlife Service officials said it is time to ease the tough nationwide protections they have enjoyed under the federal Endangered Species Act.
``Wolves are a living symbol of the regard Americans have for things wild,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, announcing the proposal to reclassify wolves from endangered to threatened in the Northeast and two other regions and to strip them of all federal protection in 30 states.
Endangered species get more legal protection than threatened species.
Babbitt's optimism may seem odd in New England, where there are so few wolves that a single sighting is big news, and environmentalists are pushing a controversial plan to import wolves to replenish the stock in Maine or New Hampshire.
However, some federal officials believe reduced protections for wolves may actually improve prospects for reintroducing them here by easing private land owners' fears that the wolf's arrival would trigger serious limits on the use of their land.
But activists who have been pushing to bring the wolf back to the Northeast rejected that logic.
They called Babbitt's plan to ``downlist'' protections for wolves a concession to the ranchers, sheep farmers and land owners who see wolves as a hazard to their businesses.
Changing the wolves from endangered to threatened ``is a purely political move with no biological basis whatsoever,'' said Michael Kellett, executive director of Restore the North Woods, which supports reintroduction of wolves in the Northeast.
``We're going to urge people to support the strongest recovery plan possible, and to oppose the downlisting''.
Currently, wolves are considered endangered in all of the lower 48 states except Minnesota.
They would remain so in the Southwest under Babbitt's proposal, which would be final a year from now after public hearings.
Even if wolves are downlisted to threatened, it would still be illegal to shoot them.
If the proposal survives the public debate ahead, it would signify an extraordinary compromise between critics and supporters of wolf recovery.
Critics have included private property groups and many states, including New Hampshire where the legislature approved a bill last year banning wolf reintroduction there.
On the other side, environmental groups have played on the wolf's charisma to build support for reintroducing the animal.
The compromise is evident in the Service's plan to involve critics and supporters in writing the recovery plan, the document that will guide efforts to build up wolf populations.
And, under a special rule included in the proposal for the Northeast, wolves that kill livestock or otherwise threaten people and property could be shot or relocated.
Such concessions are intended to appease landowners and legislators alike, who may fear the federal government even more than the wolves.
``This would give us quite a bit more flexibility,'' said Paul Nickerson, chief of the Fish and Wildlife Service's Northeast regional endangered species office.
``Unlike other areas of the country, where there is a great deal of public land, whatever recovery we do here will occur on private land, with the full cooperation of private landowners''.
To the timber industry, which owns millions of acres in the four states and has been uneasy about wolf recovery, such overtures are welcome.
They are nervous that wolves may wander into Maine from Canada, potentially triggering all sorts of efforts to protect the animals at their expense.
So far, although animals believed to be wolves have been shot in Maine in 1993 and 1996, there is no documented evidence of a current population.
Timber industry officials particularly praised the idea of helping to write a recovery plan which spelled out what logging and other activities can take place in potential wolf habitat.
``Because of the many restrictions that often follow Endangered Species Act listings, it'd be a stretch to say our members would be thankful if wolves actually do show up in Maine,'' said Andrew Kekacs, a spokesman for the Maine Forest Products Council.
``But if they do, at least we'd know that we're not doing anything in our forest practices that's incompatible with them.''
ALPINE, Ariz.
_ Last spring, Bobby Fite peered down the sight of his.22 magnum rifle at what he thought was a coyote stalking two newborn calves near his house here.
``I threw that scope on her, then I saw that box on her, and I thought, man, that's one of them wolves,'' Fite, a rancher, said, recalling how he lowered his rifle after he realized that the predator in his pasture was a Mexican gray wolf, or lobo.
Newly reintroduced after ranchers exterminated them half a century ago from the high timberlands of eastern Arizona, today's lobos wear radio collars that allow them to be tracked by biologists.
But the wolves have had a rocky return to Arizona's forests this year.
Of the first batch of 11 released in March, five were shot, two are missing and presumed dead, and the rest had to be recaptured for their safety while biologists reworked the program.
Last week, scientists released two pairs into the wilderness.
This time, the hindquarters of each wolf were spray-painted orange.
The radio collars were also painted, orange for males, pink for females.
The paint should not interfere with the wolves' mating habits, because the animals are color blind.
But some environmentalists grumble that, even though the intent is to protect the wolves, marking them this way is the equivalent of painting fluorescent targets on their backsides.
The paint is to help hunters distinguish Mexican wolves, one of the smallest wolf subspecies in North America, from coyotes, the garden-variety predators of the West.
In much of the rural West, coyotes can be legally shot year round.
``Coyotes are varmints,'' said Sam Luce, another rancher near here.
``They are in our chicken houses, killing our chickens, killing our barn cats.
A lot of the sportsmen consider them a target.
That puts the wolf in a bad situation, because he looks just like a coyote''.
After the rash of wolf shootings in the fall, wildlife officials angrily called the killings ``sabotage''.
But now they say it appears that errors by hunters may account for most of the shootings.
Aware that many local ranchers were hostile to the release of the wolves, biologists worked early this year to monitor the animals and remove them from areas with sheep and cows.
They also educated ranchers about the penalty for intentionally killing a Mexican wolf, an endangered animal, on public land: a fine of up to $100,000 and a jail term of up to one year.
The efforts appeared at first to be successful.
Until the hunting season began in August, only one wolf was shot and killed _ by a camper.
``If the ranchers wanted to shoot wolves, they would have shot them in April, May, and June, when the wolves were in town, in calving pastures, among sheep, among horses,'' said Diane Boyd-Heger, a wolf biologist for the Arizona Game and Fish Department, who has directed the introduction program.
``The local people had plenty of opportunities to shoot these wolves.
I really don't think it was the ranchers''.
But things took a turn for the worse with the annual fall invasion by hunters of the Apache National Forest, which surrounds this tiny village.
Before the season began, wildlife officials had mailed brochures explaining the wolf-recovery program to the 6,000 hunters who had permits to hunt dear, elk, bear and mountain lions in the wolf area.
But from August through November, four wolves were shot dead over an area the size of Connecticut.
According to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which is leading the investigation into the killings, at least three guns were used.
Rewards totaling $45,000 have been posted for information leading to an arrest and conviction in a wolf killing case.
Undaunted by losing half of the wolves in the first year, biologists plan to release in the National Forest here next March two more packs, totaling nine wolves.
The goal is to have a population of 100 Mexican wolves roaming the National Forest by the year 2005.
Bruce Babbitt, the secretary of the interior and a former governor of Arizona, has stressed his support for the program in two visits this year to this mountain town, a five-hour drive from Phoenix.
A poll in October of 720 Arizona residents by the Behavior Research Center, a Phoenix company, found that 61 percent of respondents said they had become more supportive in recent years of efforts to protect endangered wildlife.
But in this economically depressed corner of the state, many people see the wolves as another blow imposed by outsiders to a rural economy already hurt by dramatic reductions in timber harvests from public lands and in the number of cows that ranchers can have graze on public lands.
``We've got plenty of predators around here already _ mountain lions, coyotes, lots of bears,'' said Luce, a retired doctor whose cattle grazes on his own land along the Blue River.
He said that every fall when his neighbors rounded up cattle from grazing on National Forest lands, they regularly discovered that they had lost about 10 percent of their calves to predators.
``This competition just throws these wolves into the cattle,'' said Luce, who added that, in May, a wolf killed his 8-year-old trained cow dog, which he valued at $5,000.
Tim Anderson, a big-game hunting guide, said over lunch at the Bear Wallow Cafe here that he had no problems with a few wolves in the woods.
``But if they get 100 up here, I don't know what will happen,'' Anderson said, as his blue tick hunting hounds barked outside.
Worried by articles in hunting magazines about wolves killing hunting dogs in Minnesota, he said: ``I have hounds that I have turned down $4,000 for.
I guess, I'll just keep my fingers crossed''.
The wolf release program was opposed by the ranching associations of New Mexico and Arizona, the governors of both states and by votes of county commissioners in 11 counties.
Reflecting the polarization caused by the wolf release, on Dec.
6 someone fired a shotgun into the offices of a Santa Fe, N.M., animal rights group.
The group had received an anonymous letter threatening ``to kill any wolf reintroduced''.
Four days later, someone spray-painted in large letters, ``Wolves'' and ``N.M.
Needs Wolves'' on the building that houses the New Mexico Cattle Growers' Association.
On Wednesday, the Cattle Growers' Association sent out a press release urging hunters to boycott a Fish and Wildlife Service questionnaire about the wolf killings.
Slipping into the kind of harsh language that often has surrounded the wolf program, the association called the query ``Gestapo tactics by an out-of-control federal agency embarrassed by the total failure of its all-advised reintroduction program''.
Faced with sharp criticism by three of New Mexico's congressmen, the Service retracted the questionnaire last Friday. &QL;
LOS ANGELES _ Maybe it's just the ``w'' word _ wolves.
The reintroduction of the nearly extinct Mexican wolf into the American Southwest has initiated an emotional argument that seems to go way beyond the paltry numbers involved.
The wolf is a creature able to stir passion; the species has such a dark hold of human imagination that rational debate may be impossible.
Rick Bass has entered the circle with the credentials to be fair.
The Texas native _ from deep in the heart of often-militant opposition to wolves _ is a conservationist and a hunter.
The author has set the ambitious goal of being both journalistic and literary in ``The New Wolves'' (Lyons; $18.95).
He has made his 166-page book readable and enlightening, though a few lapses weaken the vivid picture he has painted.
Bass does a good job of setting up the situation before the return of Mexican wolves to Eastern Arizona's Blue Range: The slaughter of the wolf and other predators paralleled the killing of bison and Indians.
Bass introduces biologists and volunteers inspired by the idea of reintroduction, interviews a ranching couple who favor holistic management, making no attempt to kill predators, and a gadfly who believes the program is doomed to failure, another example of questionable government planning.
Yet nowhere does Bass interview the ranchers who would just as soon kill the wolves on sight because they pose a threat to livestock on the parched and often overgrazed land.
Bass does note that each rancher losing any of his herd will be compensated and that the losses would surely be minimal.
He is sympathetic to the wolves' plight; however, the views of detractors whose voices must be heard in an open-minded forum are nowhere in these pages.
Regardless, the author shows a delicate touch.
Describing the release of the wolves into the wild, he writes, ``Their eyes carry more than ours do''.
He provides fine profiles of the beasts and their territories.
But he falls into the role of a mystic, and it can be grating.
He gets so carried away that he resorts to extravagant metaphors that are unnecessarily intrusive: ``Do the increases in rumors reflect that the wolves are already there, or do the increases in rumor compress to a point of saturation, a density of desire in the air, that is finally sufficient to lure and welcome wolves back into that land, as a weather system rolls from a high-pressure area into a low, or as the tides follow the moon and the Earth''?
Come on.
To his credit, Bass has sketched the basic details of the story and there's a lot of good writing.
But readers will find the book not a meal but an appetizer.
A wolf would need more.

DENVER _ The rapid beeping of a radio collar on the yearling male wolf a few weeks ago signaled the end of Mexican gray wolves in the wild _ for now, at least.
The transmission from the collar indicated that the wolf had stopped moving, and trackers found it dead several days later near the White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation in Arizona.
It was the fifth rare Mexican gray wolf found dead, apparently from a gunshot, since 11 of the animals were released into the wild in a recovery program last spring.
``There are no Mexican wolves free in the wild today,'' said Tom Bauer, assistant regional director of the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife's Southwest Office in Albuquerque, N.M.
Of the 11 wolves released in this inaugural year of the recovery program, five have been killed, one is missing and presumed dead, and five have been returned to captivity for breeding in acclimation pens near Alpine, Ariz.
One pup born in the wild is missing and presumed dead since his mother was shot in August.
One shooting in April was accounted for when a camper said he mistook the wolf for a coyote that was endangering his family.
Necropsy reports are expected to determine the cause of death of the other animals.
Since the latest killing was reported, there has been talk of a conspiracy to eliminate the wolves.
But Nancy Kaufman, regional director of the wildlife office, said, ``We really don't have, despite what people want to think, evidence of a conspiracy to kill the wolves.
These killings have sabotaged the program, they have set the program back substantially.
However, we are going forward with the program, and reviewing our techniques and adding law enforcement''.
The Albuquerque Journal reported that a wildlife activist had met with an Arizona prisoner who said he had been offered $35,000 by a New Mexico rancher to kill all wolves reintroduced into the wild.
Wildlife activists say it has not been uncommon in the Southwest for ranchers to offer a bounty for predators such as mountain lions.
``I don't know any rancher that's got the time or the money to do this if somebody was that misguided,'' said Caren Cowan, executive secretary of the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association.
``A radical environmental group accused livestock owners of getting a fund for a bounty to do this, and well, it's laughable.
We in no way condone the needless and senseless shooting of animals for any reason, and no, we don't know who's doing this''.
Ms. Cowan said her organization is one a handful that has pursued legal avenues to stop the reintroduction of the wolves, and admitted the wolves had not been as problematic as anticipated.
``This is not the big, bad wolf the ranchers make them out to be,'' said Shane Jimerfield, assistant director of the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity in Tucson, Ariz.
``The wolves have exceeded all expectations of recovery, the only problem they are having is with humans, not the natural environment''.
Jimerfield said a reward of $35,000 has been offered by wildlife organizations and the government for information leading to the arrest of whoever is killing the wolves.
Because the Mexican gray wolf, or ``lobo,'' as it is regionally known, is an endangered species, the punishment for killing one is a $100,000 fine and up to six months in prison.
Ranchers brought the animals to extinction around the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century.
In the past decade, two sub-species of gray wolf have been reintroduced in Yellowstone National Park and wilderness areas of Idaho.

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Sinapu, a group in Boulder, Colo.
, that supports reintroducing wolves into the wild, filed a notice of intent Tuesday to sue Colorado Gov.
Roy Romer and his successor, state Treasurer Bill Owens, over a longstanding statewide bounty of $2 on gray wolves that has never been rescinded in spite of the animal's federal status as endangered.
``The notice letter underscores the fact that Colorado's bounty presents a political impediment to wolf restoration in the region,'' said Rob Edwards, the group's program director.
Last week, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt went to the remote Gila National Forest on the border of New Mexico and Arizona to show support for the recovery program.
In a written statement, Babbitt said, ``We are committed to the recovery of the Mexican wolf and the goals of the Endangered Species Act.''
Timber wolves from Canada are unlikely to recolonize the northeastern United States on their own, leaving the politically more contentious course of deliberate reintroduction as the best strategy for restoring the wild wolf's howl to the region, a new study sponsored by New York's Wildlife Conservation Society has found.
While there are corridors of natural habitat through which wolves from southern Quebec might move into Maine, the study found, many barriers inhibit their passage, most importantly legal hunting and trapping, which have long been a way of life in that region of Canada.
``It's a pretty intense gantlet they would have to run'' to survive in numbers sufficient to establish a permanent population in the United States, said Dr.
William Weber of the Wildlife Conservation Society, formerly the New York Zoological Society.
Weber was one of four authors of the study, which appears in the current issue of the Wildlife Society Bulletin, a scientific journal.
Even if a few lone wolves were to succeed in filtering into the northeastern states, the study found, they might well mate with the region's abundant coyotes.
This could create a hybrid population in which the wolf gene pool would eventually be swamped, defeating the very purpose of recolonization.
Artificially reintroducing intact wolf packs might overcome that difficulty, some scientists believe, since packs tend to kill coyotes rather than breed with them.
Conservation organizations, led by the Washington-based Defenders of Wildlife, have been pressing for the re-establishment of timber wolves in northern New England or the Adirondacks or both, where they were once plentiful but have been extinct for about a century.
The new study ``says what we have felt all along, that natural colonization probably isn't highly likely,'' said Nina Fascione, the director of species conservation for the Defenders of Wildlife.
Although wolves are plentiful in Canada and Alaska, several species of them have long been legally protected as endangered or threatened in the contiguous 48 states, where populations numbering in the thousands were hunted to the verge of extinction, or beyond, well into the 20th century.
Today, gray wolves are on the rebound in two former American strongholds, the Northern Rockies and the upper Great Lakes.
More than 30 packs totaling 400 to 500 wolves now inhabit large areas of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, mostly because wolves artificially introduced from western Canada in 1995 and 1996 have rapidly reproduced.
Some 2,500 wolves now live in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, where they always lived.
The Midwestern and Western wolves are doing so well, in fact, that federal officials plan to remove the Great Lakes population from the protected list soon and hope they will be able to follow with the newly re-established Northern Rockies population in two or three years.
The Mexican wolf is also being restored to the Southwest, albeit with much difficulty, and the red wolf has been re-established in the Southeast.
As a result of these efforts, according to the new study and others, the wolf population of the United States outside Alaska has doubled and the wolf's range has nearly tripled.
Now federal officials are turning their attention to the Northeast.
After the plan to reclassify some wolves under the Endangered Species Act is published in the Federal Register for public comment, perhaps next month, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service will begin putting together a recovery plan for wolves in the Northeast, said Paul Nickerson, a wildlife biologist who heads the agency's regional office of endangered species in Hadley, Mass.
All recovery options will be considered, he said.
From the standpoint of conserving biological diversity, the basic rationale for re-establishing wolves in the Northeast could be strengthened by recent genetic studies by Canadian scientists.
Their findings, not yet published, suggest that the timber wolf of eastern Canada and formerly of the eastern United States, long considered a subspecies of gray wolf, is in fact a separate species and may be more closely related to the red wolf than the gray.
Proponents of wolf recovery say that restoring wolves would help to re-establish natural ecological relationships long sundered in the Northeast.
For instance, wolves prey on moose, which are too big for coyotes.
Moose have flourished in northern New England, both because there are no predators and because logging has created ideal second-growth habitat for them.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn Wolves, which along with cougars were historically the region's top predators, might restore some natural equilibrium with moose, say the advocates, just as they might help control runaway deer and beaver populations.
In addition, the carcasses of animals killed by wolves provide food for scavengers that are essential elements of a complete ecosystem.
Moreover, wolves have acquired a certain cachet, as their new popularity in Yellowstone testifies, and proponents say they bring in tourist dollars.
But opponents, as they did in the West, argue that wolves would prey on livestock.
There have been some attacks in the West, and owners of the livestock have been compensated from a special fund set up by the Defenders of Wildlife.
In Idaho and around Yellowstone, owners are allowed under federal rules to shoot wolves they see attacking livestock, and some have been legally killed.
Some opponents also fear that wolves might attack people, but experts on wolves say that they strongly fear humans and avoid them.
Ms. Fascione said that for her, the possibility of interbreeding between wolves and coyotes was the biggest concern about the success of wolf restoration in the Northeast.
Her organization, which has been instrumental in the Northern Rockies wolf restoration, is completing its own two-part study of restoration in the Northeast.
An earlier study sponsored by the Wildlife Conservation Society, in 1997, concluded that the Adirondacks were too removed from Canadian wolf packs for any natural recolonization to take place.
It also found that the Adirondacks had little more than half the area needed to sustain a wolf population.
If wolves were put into the Adirondacks, Weber said in a recent interview, they would probably expand into more of upstate New York and neighboring New England.
The 1997 study found that northern New England was a better bet than the Adirondacks for both natural colonization and for providing sufficiently extensive habitat.
It also identified two possible corridors near Quebec City along which wolves could disperse from Quebec into Maine.
The authors of that study said, however, that further investigation would be required to determine whether wolves were actually likely to move along the corridors.
The new study found that highways, railroads and the St.
Lawrence River posed formidable barriers across these corridors.
It also concluded that intensive hunting and snaring, coupled with negative attitudes toward wolves, would further inhibit their spread.
Moreover, the study found, hunting and trapping had reduced the wolf population of southern Quebec enough to lessen the pressure on wolves to migrate to the United States.
The authors said that natural colonization remained a possibility if Canada and the United States worked together to protect wolves in the dispersal corridors.
It also noted that any reintroduction of wolves to the northeastern United States would require Canadian cooperation, since the wolves would probably spread into New Brunswick.
``Any restoration in New England has to be done with binational cooperation,'' Ms.
Fascione said.
DULUTH, Minn.
_ Wolves prowl late in summer nights through the streets of Brasov, a Romanian city of 320,000, as well as its municipal garbage dump and a shopping mall.
A no-less-bold wolf was shot and killed last year within the city limits of Rochester, Minn.
Wolves stroll the town of Ely, on the edge of the state's rapidly expanding wolf range, and one was tracked to within 19 miles of St.
Paul, the state capital.
Wolves have denned 25 miles from Rome where 2,800 years ago, according to legend, a she-wolf suckled the abandoned Romulus, its founder, and his twin, Remus.
On the verge of extinction less than 40 years ago in many countries, wolves have made a remarkable comeback and while generally regarded as an extremely shy species, their presence in or near urban centers should not come as a surprise, says Dr.
L. David Mech, a biologist with the United States Geological Survey.
``We have altered the concept of wolf habitat,'' he said.
``That habitat is where wolves have prey and food and where people let them live''.
In places like Minnesota, wolf recovery is surging to such levels that Mech, widely regarded as the doyen of wolf specialists around the world, and others, say that prudent wolf managers must consider controlled killing.
He spoke at the end of a symposium here that drew more than 600 wildlife biologists, managers, educators and wolf fans from 44 states and 28 countries late last month.
The four-day conference, ``Beyond 2000 _ Realities of Global Wolf Restoration,'' assessed recent efforts to reintroduce and protect wolves in a number of countries after centuries of officially authorized extirpation of the species.
Spain, for instance, has fostered a recolonization of vast areas of Galicia and Asturias.
There are more than 2,000 wolves in the northwest of the country, a three-fold increase in a decade, said Juan Carlos Blanco of Madrid's wolf project.
``Wolves can live thanks to urban people's tolerance,'' he said.
``But farmers say, `Kill all of them'.
There is no common ground.
We have a social war in the name of the wolf''.
Italy, with 500 wolves, is another restoration success, with tolerance of increased numbers aided by subsidies for owners of lifestock lost as prey to wolves and the skilled deployment of guard dogs by shepherds.
Yet Professor Luigi Boitani, a wolf biologist at the University of Rome, has begun to ask himself, ``Did we do something wrong''?
The fact that ``today most of the public is in favor of wolves'' in Italy has made it impossible for him to convince people of the need for control of the wolf population.
``I tell people if we want the wolf to come back, one day we'll have to kill them.
But I find I confront a very strong wall of emotion''.
In Croatia, Dr.
Djuro Huber of the University of Zagreb, wishes he had Italy's problems.
After many years of unlimited killing of wolves, Croatia inaugurated protections in 1995 that include fines of $6,000 for the willful killing of wolves.
``It went the opposite of expectations,'' he said.
``Killing of wolves increased after protection.
Over 40.
No one has paid the fine''.
Huber was even threatened when he was in the field doing research on wolves.
The country now has about 100 wolves.
Other speakers told of similar problems, suggesting that, just as in ancient times, wolves still evoke extreme emotions: what Blanco of Madrid called ``pathological hatred,'' and opposed to that, an almost irrational devotion.
Wolf lovers manifested the latter at the conference with wolf pins, T-shirts, posters, books, coffee mugs and fairly frequent, piercing wolf howls.
On the negative side, Dr.
Iyad A.
Nader of Saudi Arabia, said, ``The wolf is considered the ancient enemy of man in the Middle East''.
As in other countries, Saudi hunters who succeed in killing a wolf often string up the carcass on a pole to show off.
Nader, of the King Khalid Wildlife Research Center in Riyadh, estimated a total of 600 to 700 wolves in three protected areas of Saudi Arabia.
Otherwise they are not protected.
nn Countries with large wolf populations generally have large problems with them, judging from the conference presentations.
Kazakhstan, has probably largest: 90,000 to 100,000 wolves.
Sergei Pole estimated that in 1987 and 1988 wolves killed 150,000 or more domestic animals, mainly camels, cows and sheep, as well as 14,000 wild animals including boar, deer, ibexes, elk and bighorn sheep.
In addition, there were 50 attacks by rabid wolves on humans, said Pole, from the zoology laboratory of the Plague Control Research Institute in Almaty, the former capital of Kazakhstan.
Russia, despite heavy hunting and killing of wolves _ some 15,000 in 1998 alone, by all methods including poison _ still has a population of 45,000, according to a comprehensive winter survey.
Federal bounties are no longer paid on killed wolves and only some state governments pay the equivalent of $25 for a killed female.
And the central government no longer encourages poisoning wolves.
Nikita G.
Ovsianikov, a wolf specialist from Moscow, said that nevertheless ``attitudes still remain negative'' with surveys showing that wolves are seen as threats to livestock, despite the paucity of attacks and that hunters believe that wolves kill prized game and hunters' dogs.
He listed statistics from the Tver region that showed hunters killed far more dogs than wolves had killed.
Ovsianikov said he was pleasantly surprised there was no opposition to the Russian project to transform the 2,000-square-mile Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean into a nature preserve with a wolf colony.
Wolves are needed, he said, to cull Wrangel's large herds of musk oxen and reindeer.
Then there is Japan, which ``got rid of its last wolves 100 years ago,'' said Naoki Maruyama of the Japan Wolf Association.
Opinion polls show skepticism toward reintroduction, not least because people believe there is ``no space'' for them.
Even biologists are ``very conservative'' on the predators.
But he saw hope for wolves in the need to control Japan's proliferating Sika deer, which are damaging forests.
Perhaps the only country with lots of wolves and no outstanding problems is Romania, which has an ancient tradition of honoring wolves.
The pre-Christian Dacian people even had a flag with a wolf's head, Ovidiu Ionescu of the Ministry of Environment said.
Most of Romania's 2,500 wolves, weighing as much as 150 pounds each, live in the heavily forested Carpathian Mountains, where there are about 5 million people and millions of sheep.
The sheep are protected by shepherds' guard dogs, said Christoph Promberger of the Munich Wildlife Society, and wolves prey largely on chamois, roe deer and red deer.
Having failed to track wolves on mountain slopes, Promberger asked a Romanian shepherd for guidance.
``What are you looking for up here; they are down there,'' said the shepherd, pointing below to Brasov.
Following this lead with night tracking equipment, Promberger trailed a wolf through the city to garbage cans, the dump and a shopping mall.
He showed a film of the wolf at the Duluth conference.
Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt called a decision last week by the 10th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ``a ringing endorsement of our wolf reintroduction program in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho''.
Many farmers and ranchers in the affected regions had hoped that a 2-year-old federal district court's decision to dismantle the program would be upheld.
Babbitt regards the Jan.
13 appeals court decision overruling the lower federal court as ``a welcome vindication of our efforts to preserve this magnificent species''.
In December 1997, Judge William Downes of the U.S.
District Court of the District of Wyoming ruled that the U.S.
Fish &AMP; Wildlife Service, as an agency of the Department of the Interior, had violated the Endangered Species Act and the intent of Congress with its wolf recovery program.
Under the program, Canadian gray wolves were relocated in Yellowstone and central Idaho and considered an ``experimental and nonessential'' wolf population, which means they lost much of the protection they would otherwise have under the Endangered Species Act.
Any stray wolves already in the regions or who migrate there also lose the protective shield that the law provides.
Congress passed the Endangered Species Act in 1973 to ``provide for the conservation, protection, restoration, and propagation of species of fish, wildlife, and plants facing extinction''.
Under the act, the Department of the Interior is not allowed to introduce an experimental population of an endangered species in the same geographical area where there is already an existing population of the same species.
Part of the lower federal court's decision pivoted on the term ``population''.
Wolves do wander through Yellowstone and central Idaho.
However, do stragglers or wolves traveling with mates constitute a population?
In 1994, the Fish &AMP; Wildlife Service issued its Final Environmental Impact Statement on the wolf reintroduction plan.
It stated: ``Scientific evidence does not indicate that any population of wolves persisted or currently exists in the Yellowstone or central Idaho areas''.
But in his ruling, Downes equates individual wolves with naturally occurring populations.
He asserts that ``Congress has stated the `experimental population' cannot include naturally occurring wolves.
... The introduction of an experimental population cannot operate as a de facto `delisting' of naturally occurring wolves''.
Downes concludes that the Department of the Interior's ``blanket treatment of all wolves found within the designated experimental population areas as experimental animals is contrary to law''.
The judge's decision set aside the wolf recovery plan and ordered all the introduced wolves and their offspring removed from Yellowstone and central Idaho.
Recognizing the importance and the ramifications of his ruling, Downes imposed a stay on his judgment pending an appeal.
The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals had little patience with Downes' legal reasoning.
It pounced on the soft spot in his analysis like Dracula on a jugular vein.
The appellate court begins with basic separation of powers tradition: If Congress has clearly spoken to a national public policy issue, then unless Congress has taken an unconstitutional position, a federal court bows to its authority.
If Congress is silent on the issue and has delegated authority over the matter to a lawful federal agency, then the court defers to the agency's interpretation _ unless that is unconstitutional.
In the Endangered Species Act, Congress did not define the term ``population''; therefore, the appellate court reasoned, ``Congress deliberately left the resolution of this type of management/conservation issue to the Department (of the Interior)''.
And federal wildlife biologists define a wolf ``population'' as at least two wild breeding pairs that raise at least two young in an area for the previous two years.
There is no evidence that a naturally occurring wolf population existed in Yellowstone or central Idaho prior to the introduction of the gray wolves.
Therefore, concluded the appellate court, on that question, the Department of the Interior did not violate the Endangered Species Act.
The appellate court wasted little time on the issue of ``de facto `delisting''' of wolves already in the area, which Downes found in violation of the Endangered Species Act.
The appellate court wrote: ``We believe this holding unnecessarily limits the administrative discretion and flexibility Congress intentionally incorporated into section 10(j) (of the ESA), ignores biological reality, and misconstrues the larger purposes of the Endangered Species Act''.
The court explains further: ``It is not difficult to imagine that sound population management practices tailored to the biological circumstances of a particular species could facilitate a more effective and efficient species-wide recovery, even if the process renders some individual animals more vulnerable.
... Congress left such decisions to the department.
We conclude the department reasonably exercised its management authority''.
There is little chance that the U.S.
Supreme Court will grant an appeal, even if one were requested.
There is no conflict among federal appeals courts concerning the legality of the wolf reintroduction program.
The 10th Circuit Court's ruling not only ensures that the wolf reintroduction program is safe, it ensures that other wildlife recovery programs can go forward without jeopardy.
This decision is a significant step toward saving our endangered species and maintaining the diversity of our wildlife.
Experimental restoration of the gray wolf to Montana, Idaho and Wyoming has been so successful since 1995, federal officials say, that the first steps toward a single, integrated wolf population in the Northern Rockies have now been taken.
In the Yellowstone area, where wolves have been most visible to wildlife enthusiasts, there are now about 110 adult wolves and roughly 60 newborn pups organized into 11 or 12 packs, said Edward E.
Bangs, a biologist with the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service who heads the Northern Rockies recovery program.
The wilderness of central Idaho is home to at least 12 packs with about 115 adults and 60 to 65 pups.
Canadian wolves were introduced to these two areas in 1995 and 1996, and natural reproduction has steadily expanded their populations since then.
In addition, 8 packs with about 60 adults and some 50 pups now inhabit northwestern Montana as a result of natural southward expansion of wolves from Canada that began in the mid-1980s.
About 10 percent of the wolves die each year from various causes, including starvation, predation by mountain lions, auto collisions, avalanches, old age and gunshots.
Most of the latter killings were done legally, after wolves preyed on livestock.
Just as significant as their numbers is the fact that in at least two instances, wolves from different populations have mated, making a genetic connection that could be the foundation for a single Rockies population.
And for the first time since the reintroductions, wolves have taken up territories well outside Yellowstone Park in the last year.
One pack each has established itself near Cody, Dubois and Jackson, all in Wyoming, some 50 miles from the park boundary.
The Jackson pack has adopted the National Elk Refuge as its winter hunting ground.
One could sit in Jackson this winter, ``sipping your latte and watching nature at work'' as the wolves hunted down elk, Bangs said.
In another ecological milestone, he said, one Yellowstone pack has learned to attack and kill bison in the park and is now something of a bison specialist.
The Yellowstone wolves generally have concentrated on the park's abundant elk population.
From 1995 through 1998, 80 cattle, 190 sheep and 12 dogs were confirmed victims of the Northern Rockies wolves.
Nearly $70,000 in compensation was paid to the affected owners from a fund maintained by the Defenders of Wildlife, according to a report by Bangs and others in the current issue of the Wildlife Society Bulletin.
Forty-seven wolves were moved after depredations, and 43 marauding wolves have been killed.
By comparison, according to the report, livestock producers in Montana alone lose an average of 142,000 sheep and 86,000 cattle, valued at $45 million year, to all causes each year.
A federal court has decided that the rules under which reintroduced wolves can be killed violate the Endangered Species Act and has ordered all the wolves removed from Central Idaho and Yellowstone.
The case is now on appeal.
As a practical matter, Bangs said, the wolves are now so numerous and well-established that removing them would be a problem.
``You could remove all the wolves,'' he said, ``but you couldn't catch them all alive''.
Many of the wolves born after the initial reintroductions are not wearing radio collars and would be hard to find.
``To recapture all of them would be very difficult,'' Bangs said.
If the restoration program survives the court challenge, the Northern Rockies wolf population can be removed from protection under the Endangered Species Act when there have been at least 100 wolves and 10 packs in each of the three recovery areas.
``We are dad-gum close to the countdown'' to that day, said Bangs.
At the end of November, after bullets had felled 5 animals, biologists recaptured the last free-roaming survivor of 11 Mexican wolves released with fanfare just eight months earlier in Arizona's Apache National Forest, bringing a temporary halt to a celebrated 20-year cooperative program between the United States and Mexico to restore this distinctive subspecies of the gray wolf, which became extinct in the wild in 1977.
By the end of the year biologists, who have bred from just 5 animals a total of 150 wolves with the ultimate goal of having 100 in the wild and 240 in captivity, had begun reintroducing the wolves into the wild again.
But whether they can achieve their goal, and at what cost to the wolves, remain open questions.
Long practiced as a way to replace stocks for hunting and fishing, captive breeding came to be seen in the 1970s as a panacea for species teetering on the edge of extinction.
Zoos began to promote themselves as latter-day Noah's Arks, capable of preserving stable, genetically sound populations of rare animals until the world was ready to welcome them back to a reconstructed nature, be it a century or more in the future.
In the 1970s and 80s, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service collected not only Mexican wolves but also red wolves, California condors, and black-footed ferrets from the wild in order to restore their populations through captive breeding, in cooperation with zoos, and then return them to their native habitats.
Similar programs were begun for species in other parts of the world while advances in reproductive technologies inspired plans for preserving frozen embryos and sperm in high-technology gene banks.
In 1994 the World Conservation Union's captive breeding specialist group suggested that the world's zoos could breed and maintain as many as 2,000 endangered species of vertebrates.
The recent developments with the Mexican wolf and those three other high-profile rescue programs have underscored the perils and promise of reintroducing captive bred animals.
The program to restore red wolves suffered a major setback last fall when officials removed the remnants of a group of some 30 animals that had been reintroduced into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee for lack of sufficient prey.
With one free-ranging population of nearly 100 animals in eastern North Carolina, project leaders are seeking suitable habitat for future releases, but blocks of more than 170,000 acres with minimal risk of conflicts with human activities and sufficient prey for wolves are scarce in the Southeastern United States.
On the other hand, biologists estimate that there are as many as 56 condors now riding thermal currents over Southern California and adjacent areas _ a remarkable recovery for the huge carrion eater that became extinct in the wild in 1987.
And the black-footed ferret, which nearly vanished from the Earth a decade ago, is producing a bumper crop of kits in and out of captivity, primarily in South Dakota, Montana, and a large breeding operation in Wyoming.
But the condor and black-footed ferret remain vulnerable.
Although they have bred well in captivity, none of the released condors has yet reproduced in the wild, and they are particularly sensitive to lead, which litters the landscape and is toxic to them in small doses.
Across the West, a plague is obliterating black-tailed prairie dogs, the black-footed ferrets' sole food source.
Even without the plague, habitat is being lost at an alarming rate to development and prairie-dog eradication programs.
Peter Gober, a United States Fish and Wildlife Service biologist in Pierre, S.D., said, ``I don't expect the ferret ever to be recovered to the point where it can be downlisted from endangered to threatened''.
Indeed, despite the sometimes spectacular achievements of these programs, captive breeding has come under fire in recent years as a costly, often futile exercise that does little to address the underlying problems, especially habitat loss and fragmentation, not to mention poaching and pollutants, that are pushing species toward extinction.
Collectively, the condor, wolf and ferret programs have already cost more than $50 million.
A five-year, $2.3 million effort initiated by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association to establish a captive breeding program for the Sumatran rhinoceros collapsed in 1993 without producing a single birth or protecting any wild rhinos.
``The Noah's Ark theory has no validity,'' said Christopher Servheen, coordinator of the Fish and Wildlife Service's grizzly bear recovery program and co-chairman of the World Conservation Union's bear specialist group.
``You're not going to have more habitat in 50 or 100 years than you do now''.
Critics also maintain that the reintroduction process is wasteful of individual animals, many of which die because they do not know how to live outside a cage.
Other problems include a lack of space and resources for preserving populations of animals indefinitely, the development of behavioral problems in some species, and inbreeding among captive animals that can lead to genetic abnormalities and other health problems.
Efforts to breed some species, including clouded leopards, wooly monkeys, African wild dogs, Sumatran rhinos, and the Micronesian kingfisher, have faltered.
``The captive-breeding industry creates the idea that we're techno-fixing the problem,'' said Dale Jamieson, the Henry R.
Luce professor in the human dimensions of global change at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn.
``In a way it's an elaborate fiction that allows people to say, `Isn't it great, these animals are being saved'.
'' In fact, the vast majority of programs have failed to meet expectations.
In 1994, Benjamin Beck, associate director of the National Zoological Park in Washington, and three collaborators found that of 145 documented reintroductions in this century involving 115 species, only 16 (11 percent) had produced populations that were sustaining themselves in the wild without human assistance, and only half of those were endangered species.
Successful projects mostly involved herbivores, birds and reptiles, including the Plains bison, Arabian oryx, bald eagle, peregrine falcon, wood duck, and Galapagos tortoise.

WASHINGTON (AP) --The government proposed Tuesday to reduce federal protection of endangered gray wolves, saying they had successfully recovered from near extinction but acknowledging more could die as a result of the change.
The Interior Department proposal would classify most of the wolves --all those except the Mexican gray wolf in the Southwest -- as threatened rather than endangered.
That means authorities would have greater leeway in developing management plans that take into account concerns from private landowners.
The small population of Mexican gray wolves recently introduced to parts of New Mexico and Arizona --only 22 wolves -- would remain endangered because they continue to be under the threat of extinction, officials said.
Jamie Rappaport Clark, director of the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, said the recovery of the gray wolf --also known as the timber wolf in some parts of the country -- was ''an endangered species success story''.
But she said the increase in the number of wolves will allow her agency to ''structure wolf recovery to meet the needs of the species and those of the people''.
While wolves may be given somewhat lower levels of protection, the increased flexibility provided by reclassifying them as ''threatened'' may make it easier for wolf populations to expand into areas in which they currently are not found, federal wolf experts said.
Those include vast areas of the West and even parts of New England, they said.
For example, the less restrictive designation might convince landowners in the Northeast --where currently there are no wolves known to exist, despite ideal habitat for the animal -- to accept future wolf recovery plans from Maine to upstate New York, officials said.
But as threatened --a less protective designation under the federal Endangered Species Act -- some wolves also may be captured or killed if they threaten livestock or fall under another less restrictive provision of a formal wolf management plan.
The gray wolf is currently classified as endangered throughout the country except in Alaska and in Minnesota --where it has a ''threatened'' classification.
But the recovery of the wolves has been impressive across the northern tier of the country from Michigan to Minnesota and in the northern Rocky Mountains where the animals were reintroduced in Yellowstone National Park in 1995.
Virtually extinct in the lower 48 states in the 1950s, today there are 2,445 wolves in Minnesota and a total of nearly 500 in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
The reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone has resulted in more than 300 wolves in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.
''We made the right choice to...
bring these animals back from the brink of extinction,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, in announcing that the animals have rebounded enough to warrant reclassification.
The new proposal brought mixed response from conservation groups with some praising the move and others expressing concern that the lesser protection might endanger attempts to expand the wolf's range.
''It's a mixture of good news and bad,'' said Bob Ferris of Defenders of Wildlife.
He said he wasn't opposed to the reclassification, but was concerned that the government ''is not considering any further recovery areas'' and that some wolves could lose federal protection entirely.
The National Wildlife Federation said while the proposal ''reflects the success of wolf recovery programs,'' it ''falls far short of a bolder vision for recovery'' of wolves in the West.
Under the proposal, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service would establish four distinct population segments, based on the primary ranges in which the wolves are found or are expected to migrate.
The wolves would be removed from all Endangered Species protection in all or part of 30 states where wolf introduction is unlikely.

The new service will be headed by Pat Mitchell, who heads the production division at CNN that won a Peabody award for its series on the Cold War.
``Women represent the fastest-growing Internet population and a television audience that remains underserved,'' she said.
``The new network will provide a destination exclusively for smart, active women seeking relevant content and community''.
The companies did not release information about specific programs, but they said the new channel would draw material from style, entertaining, travel, food and parenting articles in the various magazines published by Conde Nast and Time.
Conde Nast publishes Mademoiselle, Vogue, Bride's, Glamour and other magazines.
Time Inc.'s titles include People, InStyle, Parenting, Health and Food &AMP; Wine.
The new venture would face competition from the successful Lifetime channel, which is run by Walt Disney Co.
and Hearst Corp.
, as well as a new channel called Oxygen, being developed by talk show host Oprah Winfrey and Geraldine Laybourne, one of the driving forces behind the success of Nickelodeon.
While the success of Lifetime could bode well for other channels aimed at women, entertainment industry analysts said it was not yet clear that there was room for all three.
``There's certainly enough topics to be dealt with, but the question is whether there's enough advertising to support three networks in the same area,'' said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co.
``It's just too soon to know''.
Mitchell said she thought there was plenty of room for programming aimed at women.
``Lifetime and Oxygen are different from what we're offering.
Women are half of the viewing population, and there's not only room for three or more services targeting women but there's a need for it,'' she said.
&UR; Oprah Winfrey &LR; 's at the top of her form right now: Her movie, ``Beloved,'' is about to open, she's the richest and most influential woman in entertainment, she's celebrated as a proponent of reading and all things bright and beautiful, and she's on the cover of the latest Vogue, looking terrific.
We all know the story of her humble beginnings, her rise to stardom, her longtime romance, her crash diets, weight regain and much-admired, sensible decision to give up dieting in favor of exercise.
But maybe being queen of the TV world isn't enough.
Vogue's &UR; Anna Wintour &LR; exults in the editor's note at the front of the Oprah issue that the magazine staff was thrilled ``when we heard that Oprah Winfrey wanted to be made glamorous.
She knew she had to lose weight, but she has done that before, and she promised she would lose 20 pounds by our deadline.
She did.
... Our fashion editor said that she was so moved by the Polaroids taken during the shoot that she went to her dressing room to be alone and came out with moist eyes.
There's something reassuring in the fact that Oprah, one of the most powerful women in America, should nurture her own dreams of perfect beauty and allure _ just like the rest of us''.
Our instant minipoll of five women found that 100 percent found nothing at all reassuring about it.
A one-word description of their assessment: bummer.
&QL; &UR; ANOTHER DIETER MAKES GOOD &LR; On the eve of the premiere of her TV talk show, the &UR; Duchess &LR; &UR; of York &LR; promised that she would be good.
``I'm not going to be saying anything wrong or bad about the royal family,'' she told the Telegraph of London.
The show will focus on people, like herself, who have suffered.
``I want to talk to real, proper people who've been through hell,'' she said.
``People like my friend Irene, who lost her daughter at 14 through drugs.
What was that like for her?
I can think of nothing worse.
``I want to know.
I would hate it if my children took drugs or got leukemia, so if I can help by spreading the word, it might ease the drug situation or encourage people to give bone marrow''.
Monday's first show featured a hit-and-run driver and a rape victim; the second was about anorexia, the third about cosmetic surgery.
The duchess dedicated Monday's program to the memory of her mother, who recently died in a car accident.
Life in public isn't easy for her, she told the Telegraph.
``People who know me say `poor you' because they know I'm actually a shy person.
Not many people realize that''.

1939: In April, regularly scheduled network TV is born when NBC airs President Franklin D.
Roosevelt's speech at the opening of the New York World's Fair.
With few people able to afford a TV set, the event is hardly a ratings blockbuster.
1947: NBC's first broadcast of baseball's World Series draws a large audience and overnight turns the sport into ``America's pastime''.
Even more significantly, it starts a run on TV sets, which until then were never expected to supplant radio.
Today, the average American family owns three TV sets.
1960: The televised presidential debate between Richard Nixon and John F.
Kennedy illustrates the power of image.
Viewers watch as a sweaty Nixon looks pale and inexperienced next to the calm, good-looking Kennedy.
Candidates begin to respect TV's power.
1963: John F.
Kennedy's assassination is massively covered by network television, becoming the first major breaking TV news tragedy.
Blanket coverage is now a staple of television news, and with so many channels and so little news, the events deemed worthy of such coverage are of much less significance than the murder of a president.
1968: Dressed in flak jackets and military helmets, Walter Cronkite and other TV journalists file nightly dispatches from the front lines of the Vietnam War, bringing home the horror while helping shift public sentiment against America's involvement.
1970: Phil Donahue debuts with a daytime show on which everyday people discuss everyday topics, and the talk show genre is born.
The success of ``Donahue'' makes room for Oprah Winfrey, who takes her Chicago-based talk show national.
Later, however, the genre is severely exploited, morphing into ``trash'' TV talk shows with hosts like Geraldo Rivera, whose chair-throwing exhibitions precedes an even sleazier profit-monger named Jerry Springer, a former Cincinnati mayor.
1970s: ``M-A-S-H,'' ``Maude,'' ``All in the Family'' and ``Sanford &AMP; Son'' usher in a new kind of situation comedy built around red-flag issues such as interfaith marriage, abortion and war.
These open the door for variety shows such as ``Saturday Night Live'' to delve into political satire.
Comedy would diminish in the late '70s and early '80s, only to be revived by ``The Cosby Show'' in 1984.
Now the cycle has dipped again, with sitcoms attracting fewer viewers than ever.
1980: On Nov.
21, more than 80 million viewers tune in to see who shot ruthless character J.R.
Ewing in the prime-time soap ``Dallas''.
Producers have been trying to duplicate such dramatic suspense since then, with cliffhangers and special episodes of drama on sitcoms.
But with today's fragmented audience, the top-rated program on TV, ``ER,'' tops out at 35 million viewers.
1980s: Cable slowly but successfully becomes an alternative to network television.
But it also eliminates the universal language of TV.
Now everyone's speaking a different tongue: kids, blacks, Hispanics, computer geeks, Martha Stewart wannabes.
1997: Billions of viewers around the world watch Princess Diana's funeral.
It helps Elton John's eulogy song top ``White Christmas'' as the all-time bestseller and, more significantly, illustrates how the medium few believed in at first is now a trusted, ubiquitous presence.

LONDON (AP) --Oprah Winfrey is fed up with the sleaze on daytime television -- especially rival Jerry Springer's show -- and is ready to bail out of her long-running show.
``I am all talked out,'' Winfrey told The Sunday Times.
``My contract has two years left, then I am getting out of such shows because I feel they are going to burn themselves out''.
Winfrey has been a ratings success since launching ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in September 1986.
Despite its 32 Daytime Emmys, it recently has been challenged in the ratings by ``The Jerry Springer Show''.
While in London to promote her new film, ``Beloved,'' she told the newspaper it was depressing to return to television after her stint on the movie set.
``Coming off that wonderful film to be just interviewing more dysfunctional people was a letdown,'' she said.
Another reason for her disgust, she said, is Springer, calling his show a ``vulgarity circus''.
``Unless you are going to kill people on the air, and not just hit them on the head with chairs, and unless you are going to have sexual intercourse --and not just, as I saw the other day, a guy pulling down his pants and pulling out his penis -- then there comes a point when you have oversaturated yourself,'' Winfrey was quoted as telling the Times.
Winfrey was unavailable for comment today because she is taping her show in the Bahamas this week, said Jerilyn Schultz, a publicist in Chicago.
Schultz said she could not comment beyond a statement issued Monday, which said no announcements were planned on whether Winfrey would continue the show after the end of her current contract.

``Gore should ask Oprah to be his vice presidential nominee,'' I heard an amateur pundit _ one of legions, I'm sure _ declare last week.
Think of what follows as theatrical speculation then, set against a backdrop of some of the dreariest political performances we've yet been subjected to.
George W.
Bush got a father figure in Dick Cheney, one who supplies him with authority and stability but who still has to take a back seat when it comes to visibility and sex appeal.
Vice President Al Gore would get a sister with a touch of the mother in Oprah Winfrey; she would give him an aura of spontaneity, generosity and basically sexless titillation.
I refer, of course, to the race angle: Theirs would be a chaste union undertaken solely for the public good.
Tipper Gore's position wouldn't be usurped: The children are there as visible proof of who the real wife is, and Oprah's companion, Steadman Graham, would be by Oprah's side, as proof that everyone goes back to the old neighborhood when day is done.
And there is great mileage to be gotten from a Tipper-Oprah alliance (the Tipper-Hillary combination had no chemistry).
See them together: just girlfriends one moment, women of authority the next, jogging, making speeches, photographed shopping together.
Under Oprah's influence Tipper would show a touch of girlish soulfulness, while Oprah could add chipper gentility to her repertory.
Graham's influence should not be minimized either.
He would appeal greatly to all those unmarried couples who become inadmissible evidence whenever politicians start testifying about family values.
And he could set an example for men across the country who may one day find themselves, if they haven't already, less famous, less wealthy and less powerful than their wives or lovers.
An aside here.
I wish I fully understood why certain African-Americans, apart from athletes, take on a cultural value that is nearly godlike but doesn't transcend race.
Maybe it's like what architects or designers do when they take old materials and arrange them differently: keep the comforting associations of the past, while getting the excitement of the present and future.
(``These people are black; I know what that has meant and could still mean, but I feel completely different'')!
Oprah Winfrey and Colin Powell have this value.
So do certain actors who have become the voices and bodies of American industry and technology.
There is James Earl Jones as the body and cellular soul of Verizon Telephone and Ruby Dee as the voice of life insurance.
(It's a nurturing concept, life insurance; it needs a woman's voice).
And there is Avery Brooks.
He first rose to television fame as the black hustler helpmate of a white private eye on ``Spenser: For Hire''.
He now commands a space station on ``Deep Space 9'' and embodies the technological prowess of IBM here on earth.
But no one has achieved Oprah's well-nigh superhuman status.
(I use her first name only because the show and the magazine invite me to).
Look at the cover of her new monthly magazine, still on newsstands.
Read ``O'' in white boldface with ``The Oprah Magazine'' just below in a bright square of color, then let your eye move to a full-page photograph of the woman herself.
This is not a magazine title along the lines of Jane or the now-defunct Mirabella.
This is not a proper noun; it is an idea or way of life, like Vogue; even a species, along the lines of People.
And with its emphasis on physical, psychological and spiritual evolution, there is the hint that a new species or at least a new, improved gender is in the offing.
Both in her magazine and on her television show, Oprah's name is used in a queenly manner.
Implicitly, her ``I'' is a royal ``we'': she speaks for us as well as to us.
(Don't you wish that Diana, Princess of Wales, had been a guest on her show?
That would have been one for the ages).
But the process works in reverse, too.
We can be _ in fact we are every day _ royalty, striving for the same kinds of material and spiritual blessings Oprah strives for and, in the case of material blessings, clearly has won.
What's hers is ours, it seems: the magazine's sensible psychologist, Dr.
Phillip C.
McGraw, and its spiritual advice giver, Gary Zukav, both appear on the talk show and are introduced as Oprah's personal counselors.
Her cook appears too, as do members of her book club.
What a brilliant businesswoman and media star: mogul plus. . . well, in the early days I would have said updated matriarch, but she has rechanneled the matriarchal associations that almost inevitably trail a black woman who can talk at all soulfully and is not Naomi Campbell thin.
Now she is a national care giver, a national therapist (how smart she was to play Ellen DeGeneres' therapist on the episode in which she came out) and a philanthropist.
Remember the ``fabulously wealthy'' John Beresford Tipton on that old television show ``The Millionaire,'' who anonymously bestowed fortunes on ordinary citizens to see if they could use the money wisely and become better people?
Oprah is a real-life extension of this fantasy, bestowing gifts on her television audiences _ food, CDs, Palm Pilots _ and opportunities for self-enhancement and self-discipline on all her fans.
``Live Your Best Life''! is O's motto.
The magazine teaches informed selflessness and enlightened selfishness.
And it does so very well, adapting and expanding on elements of women's, general interest and celebrity magazines.
Learn to control your temper; learn to give yourself flowers and candles; learn about community organizers and how to become one yourself; learn how famous women cured themselves of ``the disease to please''; take the pull-outs of quotes from famous people (the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
, Epictetus, Joe E.
Lewis) and tape them to your mirror or mail them to friends.
The current issue is laid out like a four-step program.
The articles in ``First Words'' are about improving one's life in the world, from handling money to learning from failure.
Then comes ``Live Your Best Life'' with an inward focus: how to meditate, how to give yourself solitude.
Now you are ready for pleasure: ``Enjoy Yourself'' with fashion, health and beauty ideas.
And lastly come ``Features,'' which include Oprah's interview with a famous woman (Jane Fonda here), profiles, pieces on sex and on aging, and, from other famous women (Hillary Clinton this time), books that have made a difference in their lives.
The magazine ends with a brief coda called ``.
. . and More'' which beautifully recapitulates the themes of Oprah's ministry and marketing genius.
There is a full page of beauty products meant to ``go with'' the articles you have just read on fashion, food and the home.
And there is Oprah's last word, a spiritual anecdote called ``What I Know for Sure,'' with one last photograph.
Why would Oprah Winfrey need to be a politician?
She is already a business impresario and a media empress .
ATLANTA --Jerry Springer knows how to fight.
As he promised he would do if a kinder, gentler ``Jerry Springer'' suffered in the ratings, daytime's hardest hitting slugger brought his talk show back to the brink of violence in July.
The result: Nielsen ratings, which dropped significantly for the toned-down ``Springer,'' went back up in metro Atlanta as soon as the guest confrontations got uglier.
The return to violence helped ``Springer'' claw its way to a virtual tie with one-time giant ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in July ratings as metro Atlanta's most-watched daytime talk show.
Roughly 145,000 area households tuned in to both shows on average during July.
While that was a 21 percent drop in viewership for ``Springer'' compared to the recent May sweeps, it was still enough to match ``Oprah,'' whose ratings remained virtually unchanged from May and from July a year ago.
SEEN AND HEARD Poll on Tailwind Americans see CNN's retraction of its Operation Tailwind story as part of an overall decline in the media's accuracy, according to a poll to be released today by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
The poll, conducted July 29-Aug.
2 by telephone of 1,189 adults, found that 49 percent were aware of CNN's retraction of its ``NewsStand'' story, which alleged nerve gas use by the U.S. military.
Asked if Tailwind was an ``isolated incident'' or if ``the news media as a whole is generally less accurate these days,'' 55 percent said they are less accurate overall, and 31 said Tailwind was isolated, with 14 percent not responding.
The research center has also been tracking for three years whether the public thinks news organizations are generally accurate, and finds a steady decline, from 55 percent in 1985 to 34 percent in February 1998.
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent.

NEW YORK _ ``Waiting,'' by Ha Jin, a novel set in contemporary China, about a man struggling with the conflicting claims of two women, won the National Book Award for fiction Wednesday night.
The winner for nonfiction was ``Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II'' (W.W.
Norton &AMP; Company/The New Press) by John W.
Dower, about the transformation of Japan into a democracy under American occupation.
The poetry prize went to the dramatic monologues about urban life in ``Vice: New and Selected Poems'' (W.W.
Norton &AMP; Company) by Ai.
``When Zachary Beaver Came to Town,'' (Henry Holt and Company) by Kimberly Willis Holt, a coming-of-age story about a 13-year-old boy who is obese, won the award for young people's literature.
Ha Jin, the author of ``Waiting,'' which is published by Pantheon Books, served for six years in the People's Liberation Army of his native China, and came to the United States in 1985.
He is a professor of English at Emory University.
The ceremony, which celebrated the 50th anniversary of the National Book Foundation, the sponsor of the awards, was held at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Manhattan.
The talk show host Oprah Winfrey, a powerful figure in the book world because of Oprah's Book Club, received a 50th Anniversary Medal from the foundation.
``More than movie stars and rock stars and famous politicians and world leaders,'' she said, ``I love authors.
I love authors because in the beginning was the word''.
``For all of you here who are liberated by the word,'' she said, ``God bless you''.
Ms. Winfrey founded her book blub in 1996, and since then being chosen for the club has been almost a guarantee that a book will be a best seller.
Ms. Winfrey remembered calling up Wally Lamb, author of ``She's Come Undone,'' whose novel was one of her selections, and he was doing his laundry.
It was a revelation, Ms.
Winfrey said.
``Authors do laundry''! she said.
The comedian Steve Martin, who served as master of ceremonies at the dinner, said that at first when he was asked to be the host of the event, he thought it was for the National Basketball Association.
But, Martin said, ``I really wanted to come here tonight because I thought it would be a good way to troll for intellectuals''.
``Please keep your acceptance speeches short, especially if you don't win,'' Martin told the audience of more than 1,000 people, including 35 past winners, and 17 writers who attended the first National Book Award ceremony in 1950 at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel.
Notably missing from this year's nominations were two of the industry's biggest books this year.
``Dutch,'' a semi-fictional biography of Ronald Reagan by Edmund Morris, and ``'Tis,'' the sequel to Frank McCourt's best selling memoir, ``Angela's Ashes'' both failed to get nominations.
Despite mergers in the publishing industry, the Foundation said it received nominations from a record number of imprints.
Eight hundred and eighty one titles were submitted, somewhat fewer than last year.
Winners in each category receive a $10,000 cash award and crystal sculpture.
Oprah Winfrey has played a big part in the emergence of our tell-all culture, not with a lurid approach, but with a truth-will-set-you-free attitude.
From revelations of her own sexually abused girlhood to the stream of guests who work toward emotional health by confessing their problems on television, ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' has become a favorite site for talking cures.
So it makes sense that the latest film in her ``Oprah Winfrey Presents'' series is ``David and Lisa,'' a remake of the 1962 film about two emotionally disturbed teen-agers who meet at an institution and form a tentative, healing friendship.
This new version literally brings mental illness into the light.
The original ``David and Lisa'' was shot in black-and-white so extreme that it looked gothic.
And though the film was a sympathetic attempt to demystify mental illness, the melodramatic music sounded like it belonged in a movie about institutional horrors, like ``The Snake Pit''.
``Oprah Winfrey Presents: David and Lisa'' takes place in the California sun.
The institution where the teen-agers live is filled with windows that let crystal light shine through.
It shines especially brightly in the immense office of the school's head, who is played by Sidney Poitier and so deserves nothing less.
But the visual openness is the only dramatic change in this dull film, which turns out to be disappointingly like the old one.
Such a faithful rendering seems senseless because time has robbed the story of its daring.
Or maybe ``David and Lisa,'' with its simplistic message about the healing touch of friendship, was always waiting for the psychobabble '90s to catch up to it.
The key to this film's approach comes in Ms.
Winfrey's introduction.
``Like David, sometimes we can get consumed by fears and anxieties,'' she says, explaining why she wanted to produce this story.
With the help of his psychiatrist, David arrives at ``a place where he can begin to feel and trust again''.
Like an extension of the ``Oprah Winfrey Show,'' this is television as therapy.
But David has more serious problems than what might be labeled intimacy issues.
``Touch can kill,'' he yells, recoiling in terror when he arrives at the school and another student accidentally brushes his hand while trying to help with his luggage.
His fear of being touched physically seems an impossibly blunt '90s addition, but it was there in the original, too.
Lukas Haas does not glamorize David, with his lank hair, buttoned-up shirts and gaunt, haunted face.
David is so obsessed with order and time that he spends his days making precise drawings of the inner mechanisms of clocks.
If David keeps everything in, Lisa (Brittany Murphy) lets everything out.
She swirls in circles and speaks in rhymes.
``Nag, nag, dirty hag,'' she taunts her social worker, Maggie (Debi Mazar).
She is a shy, pretty girl, with a childlike innocence and blooming sexuality that the film hints at.
Individually, the actors inhabit David and Lisa convincingly, yet together they fail to make the emotional connection on which the entire story depends.
Lloyd Kramer's direction is neither mawkish nor tough; it is simply pedestrian.
Poitier is used for his iconic presence here.
He can exude authority simply by standing, sitting or walking into a room, and often that's what he's called on to do.
At other times he is saddled with the film's most babbly aphorisms, including, ``If you don't feel in love with life, you are more dead than alive''.
The film barely acknowledges the changes that have taken place in the study of psychology in the last three decades.
In one of the rare instances when it does, the hyperintelligent David says Lisa is ``disassociative'' and sneers at the idea that she might have been diagnosed as schizophrenic.
(In 1962, schizophrenia was precisely the proud diagnosis David offered).
Poitier's character says he prefers simple language.
``People have feelings,'' he tells David, who has just said he prefers clocks to humans.
As disappointing as ``David and Lisa'' is, it would be too bad if it became ammunition in the growing Oprah backlash.
The two previous television films she produced, ``Before Women Had Wings'' and ``The Wedding,'' were among the most intelligent and finely wrought network films of the past two years.
Producing and starring in ``Beloved'' was a serious artistic move and Oprah's Book Club is an inspired idea.
``David and Lisa'' comes from the Oprah Winfrey who joins with her audience in group therapy, which is not one of her better roles.

Sherry Lansing, chairwoman of Paramount's motion picture group since 1992, has replaced Oprah Winfrey as the most powerful woman in the entertainment business, according to an annual trade publication due out today.
Under Lansing's reign, Paramount has popularized the concept of co-financing many of its big-budget films.
The studio finished a close second to Disney last year in market share and ranks fourth in 1999 share after Disney, Warner Bros.
and Universal, with hits like ``Runaway Bride,'' ``Double Jeopardy'' and ``The General's Daughter''.
Lansing finished second in The Hollywood Reporter's ranking last year, compiled annually as part of a ``Women in Entertainment: Power 50'' issue.
``Sherry has more green-light power than any other woman in film and her studio has had a pretty good year,'' said Randy Tierney, special issues editorial director at The Reporter.
``She's in great control there.
The fact that she's been there for so long definitely factors into it''.
The Reporter named Universal Pictures Chairwoman Stacey Snider as No.2 on its list, noting that Lansing and Snider are the only two women single-handedly running motion picture studios.
``There's a lot of instant power in being the head of a studio,'' Tierney noted.
Snider, a three-year veteran of Universal who was ranked 19th last year, became co-chairwoman in June as the studio was ending its long box office slump with ``The Mummy,'' ``Notting Hill'' and ``American Pie''.
She assumed sole chairwomanship last month when Brian Mulligan departed.
Tierney pointed out that the list _ based on position, how much money they control and success in the marketplace of their products _ reflected a generally strong upward shift among women executives in Hollywood.
``It's not just Sherry Lansing anymore,'' he said.
``There has been a huge upward movement within the past year-and-a-half to two years.
It looks as if the business has been opting for the best person (instead of the best man) because there's definitely been a lot of movement that has broken the inertia''.
The increased power among female executives is the key reason why Winfrey's ranking slid from first to 19th, according to Tierney.
``It's not as if Oprah isn't hugely successful, but the dynamics have changed,'' he explained.
Winfrey, chairwoman of Chicago-based Harpo Entertainment Group, also saw her ranking fall due to a below-expectations performance by ``Beloved,'' in which she starred, and a slight decline in the overall clout of the talk-show business.
Finishing in a tie for third place were Lucy Fisher, vice chairwoman of Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Group, and Amy Pascal, president of Columbia Pictures.
Sony ranks sixth in domestic box office with ``Big Daddy'' as the only hit but it has high hopes for the soon-to-be-released ``Stuart Little''.
Sony Music executive Michele Anthony finished fourth, followed by ABC Television Network President Patricia Fili-Krushel, CBS Entertainment President Nancy Tellem and Universal Pictures distribution Chairwoman Nikki Rocco.
Tierney said he expects more upward movement among female executives, which should lead to more opportunities for women in acting, writing and directing.
``The numbers are still very low in some areas so I think you're going to see more openings,'' he added. XXX
CHICAGO (AP) --Oprah Winfrey was such a big hit with Northwestern University business students that she's been invited to teach another class.
Winfrey, who taught "Dynamics of Leadership" last fall at the university's J.L.
Kellogg School of Management, has accepted an offer to teach again next fall.
The talk-show host has received reviews that were among the strongest of any professor, Assistant Dean Rich Honack said this week.
"Students said she truly provided a class they learned something from," he said.
Winfrey, who taught the class with longtime beau and businessman Stedman Graham, told The Daily Northwestern that she wants to improve.
"I gave myself a B and I'm coming back to get an A because I now know how to get it," she said.
NEW YORK (AP) --It may not be all Oprah, all the time, but Oprah Winfrey's new magazine, O, comes pretty close.
Guess who will grace the cover of every issue for the ''foreseeable future''?
And there's plenty more of Oprah inside, too.
Essays from the magazine's creator and lead personality, titled ''Let's Talk'' and ''What I Know for Sure,'' are at the very beginning and very end of each issue.
Then there's ''Oprah to Go,'' cutout cards with inspiring quotations chosen by the talk show host.
The magazine, which is a partnership with Hearst Corp.
, goes on sale Wednesday.
Fans need not worry that it will dominate Winfrey's time.
''For me, the Oprah show is still the mother lode,'' Winfrey said.

LOS ANGELES (AP) --After winning 32 Daytime Emmys and a lifetime achievement award, Oprah Winfrey is taking herself out of the running for best talk show host at this year's ceremony.
``Last year I was given the lifetime achievement award,'' she said in an interview scheduled to air Tuesday on ``The Roseanne Show''.
``And after you've achieved it for a lifetime, what else is there''?
The Daytime Emmys will be held May 21.
``I Know This Much Is True'' By Wally Lamb HarperCollins, 897 pages, $27.50 THE AUTHOR: Meet Wally Lamb, a literary cross between John Grisham and Pat Conroy.
He's like Grisham because of his singular knack for telling a story; like Conroy for his writing talent, the pithy one-liners sprinkled throughout the book, and a penchant for melodrama.
Oprah Winfrey discovered Lamb some time after he published his first book, ``She's Come Undone,'' which became a monster bestseller.
``I Know This Much Is True'' shot to No.
1 on the bestseller lists soon after Lamb's recent appearance on Oprah's show.
But it didn't stay there long.
The book's daunting length is probably why.
THE PLOT: Narrator Dominick Birdsey is the supposedly sane identical twin.
His brother, Thomas, suffers from acute schizophrenia, which causes him to enter a public library and chop off one hand in a protest against the looming Persian Gulf War.
Turns out the two never knew their real father; their stepfather was a raging jerk, and their grandfather was an immigrant from Sicily with a closet full of skeletons.
Dominick, we soon learn, is not exactly an exemplar of mental health himself.
The dramatic possibilities here are endless.
Unfortunately, Lamb insists on exploring all of them _ at length.
By page 600 or so, this gets maddening.
We don't need to know all this stuff.
The story sizzles in the beginning, but reading for the umpteenth time how angry Dominick Birdsey is at the world gets a little tiresome.
Yet just when you want to lay the book down and never again pick it up, the story regains its momentum.
Come to think of it, I had a hard time putting the book down at all, even during the tedious times, because Lamb writes so well, and his characters are so well drawn.
They linger continually on the edge of crisis and/or catastrophe.
I read the last 150 pages in one sitting, and was rewarded with a satisfying ending.
IS THERE AN EDITOR IN THE HOUSE?
Lamb, even with the oomph of Oprah, has cost himself readers because of the book's unnecessary tonnage.
``I Know This Much Is True'' could have lost a third of its length and none of its considerable power.
But on balance, it's still worthwhile.
After 900 pages and three weeks, I admit to being a little sad upon coming to the last page, the frustration of the middle pages long forgiven.

CHICAGO (AP) --A lawsuit accusing Oprah Winfrey of using copyrighted pictures in her best-selling book will go to trial next month, a federal judge said.
Judge Ruben Castillo this week issued an opinion saying photographers Paul Natkin and Stephen Green own the copyright on 11 pictures in the book.
But the judge said only a trial can decide whether Winfrey was licensed to put them in ''Make the Connection: Ten Steps to a Better Body and Better Life''.
Winfrey claims she paid the photographers more than $250,000 for the license to use the pictures not only in the book, but anywhere she wants.
Natkin and Green said the money allowed Winfrey to put the photos in publicity packages for her TV talk show but not in the book.
Winfrey was out of the country and unavailable for comment Wednesday.
But attorney Charles Babcock said she likely would be on hand for the trial and take the stand herself.
''Let's face it,'' he said.
''She'll make an awfully strong witness.''
LOS ANGELES (AP) --In a landslide any politician would envy, NBC's idealistic series about a White House staff in turmoil, ''The West Wing,'' won a record-setting nine Emmy awards Sunday night including best drama series.
It was a rubout in the political drama's competition with HBO's ''The Sopranos''.
James Gandolfini, who plays ''The Sopranos''' hulking mob boss, avoided a shutout for his show by winning best actor.
The haul for ''The West Wing'' broke the previous record of eight Emmys for a series in a single season, set by ''ER'' and ''Hill Street Blues'' in their first years.
''There's going to be no living with me now,'' said ''West Wing'' creator Aaron Sorkin, who won an Emmy for his writing.
Michael J.
Fox was a sentimental winner of the best actor award for a comedy.
Fox retired from his comedy about a New York City mayoral office, ''Spin City,'' after last season because of Parkinson's disease.
He won three best actor trophies in a row in the 1980s for ''Family Ties''.
''Thanks. It's been a great ride and stay tuned,'' Fox said, after receiving a standing ovation.
''Will &AMP; Grace'' won best comedy show, a big boost for NBC's sitcom as it moves to Thursday nights this fall.
It also won two awards for its supporting actors, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally.
Patricia Heaton, who plays the long-suffering wife of comedian Ray Romano on the CBS comedy ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' won best actress in a comedy.
It was her first award.
Veteran actor Jack Lemmon, a Hollywood favorite, drew a standing ovation when he won best actor in a miniseries or movie for ''Oprah Winfrey Presents: Tuesdays With Morrie''.
His co-star, Hank Azaria, also won an Emmy, and the show was honored as best TV movie.
''A little bit of magic,'' said Lemmon, fighting back tears as he paid tribute to his family: ''This and what I do, is important.
But you are my life''.
Sela Ward was an upset winner in the best actress category in a drama for ABC's ''Once and Again''.
She beat out two competing actresses from ''The Sopranos,'' Edie Falco and Lorraine Bracco.
Gandolfini, in taking home the only trophy for HBO's groundbreaking series, said, ''I can't really explain this, except the academy maybe has an affinity for slightly overweight bald men''.
The pre-show buzz was about the faceoff between ''The West Wing'' and ''The Sopranos,'' the politicians against the mobsters.
Both had 18 nominations.
''The West Wing'' won in a walk.
Richard Schiff, who plays the grim aide Toby Ziegler, and Allison Janney, who portrays the White House's tough press secretary, won supporting actor awards.
Thomas Schlamme won for directing.
''I love every member of my cast,'' Janney said.
''This should be an ensemble award and I share it with all of you''.
Janney paid tribute to fellow nominee Nancy Marchand, who played the scheming matriarch Livia Soprano.
Marchand died of lung cancer on June 18.
Janney called Marchand ''exquisite, elegant''.
NBC won bragging rights with 23 Emmys.
HBO had 20 awards, ABC had 15, Fox had 11 and CBS had 7.
For the third year in a row, David Letterman's ''Late Show'' won the award for best variety series.
It came during a year Letterman had to take a break for an emergency quintuple bypass operation in January.
''Dave, if you're watching at home, it looks like the fake heart surgery paid off,'' said the show's executive producer, Rob Burnett.
HBO's series about a Baltimore inner-city neighborhood, ''The Corner,'' won three Emmys, including outstanding miniseries.
Eddie Izzard won for both his performance and writing in his HBO special, ''Eddie Izzard: Dress to Kill''.
The two biggest television events of the past year --''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and ''Survivor'' -- weren't competing Sunday.
''Millionaire'' was shunted off to the Daytime Emmys and ''Survivor'' missed the cutoff for nominations.
Host Garry Shandling did a ''Survivor'' takeoff in his opening segment, though, and several contestants were in the audience.
''I don't like this reality television, I have to be honest,'' Shandling said.
''I think real people should not be on television.
It's for special people like us, people who have trained and studied to appear to be real''.
Emmy watchers were anxious to see the impact of a change in voting procedures designed to widen the voting panel and make it younger.
Instead of requiring Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences members to watch nominated shows in a hotel, the academy sent out videotapes for voters to watch at home.
As a result, it nearly quadrupled the number of people voting.
Many actors, including John Lithgow and David Schwimmer, wore gold ribbons in a show of support for the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, who are involved in a strike against the advertising industry.

WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) --U.S.
Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore appeared on a TV talk show Monday in a bid to attract more women's votes in the November election.
"I know something about the job of president," Gore answered when he was asked by the talk show host why she should vote for him.
Gore is the first politician invited to the television stage of Oprah Winfrey in Chicago.
Gore's Republican rival George W.
Bush is scheduled to appear on September 19 on Winfrey's show, which reaches 22 million viewers weekly.
Reacting to a new Federal Trade Commission report criticizing Hollywood for targeting children with violent products, Gore said they would ask the entertainment industry for a voluntary "cease- fire" in marketing inappropriate movies, video games and music to children.
Gore said that if elected, his administration would give entertainment companies six months to clean up their act or face unspecified "tougher measures" under current laws on advertising.
"What we are calling for in this case is industry self- restraint and self-regulation, not censorship," he said.
He said that if the entertainment industry does not change its practice in the six months, it could be found guilty of false advertising.
Gore's appearance on the "Oprah" TV show kicked off a week in which Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman hope to solidify gains among women voters by focusing on education policy and pledging to clean up entertainment violence marketed to children.
A recent poll showed that Gore has opened up an 18-point lead among women, while Bush held about a 20-point lead among men.
Now there's violence on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show''.
Well, not the gutter brawls like you see on ratings competitor ``Jerry Springer''.
Not the hair pulling.
Not the pimp slapping.
Not the chair throwing.
But violence it is.
There's Winfrey on Wednesday with her new ``change your life'' guru John Gray (``Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus''), who hands a big wooden stick to an audience member named Debbie.
She's feeling real guilty because no matter how hard she tries, she can't make everyone she knows happy.
Debbie's then instructed to whack a red box with the word ``Guilt'' written on it.
And whack it Debbie does with her best Mark McGwire swing.
Bam! This week Winfrey has launched a new season of her daily talk show.
And, somehow, talk just doesn't seem to fit this show any more.
Call it a daily chakra show.
Winfrey has reinvented herself, her show, her mission, her set, her theme song (she sings it herself).
On Tuesday she meditated, was shown lounging serenely in a bathtub surrounded by lighted candles and talking about ``Remembering Your Spirit''.
On Wednesday she sported a quite fashionable long tan skirt.
She looks great.
``Oprah'' is now all about learning who you are with a capital ``YOU''.
She's calling it ``Change Your Life TV'' and part of that will include a free, over-the-tube seminar each Wednesday with Gray.
``Determine for yourself your soul's true desire''.
``Everyone's pain is the same''.
``Personal success is not deemed by possessions''.
``The secret of success is intention''.
Later, Winfrey's shown sitting by a pond, dabbing her bare feet in the water and chronicling in her daily journal the things she's grateful for.
``I'm amazed at each little blossom,'' she writes.
``I'm grateful to return to the farm and all of its green glory''.
And you can't help but wonder what's going on over on ``Springer''.
``I'm Dumping You''! is Jerry's mantra for this day.
A mom comes on stage, reaches over and slaps a guy named Jason a good one.
Mom wants him out of her daughter's life.
``You're a big fat liar, Jason,'' she screams.
``You ain't gonna do nothin'...
you need to get out of her life and leave her alone''!
Over on ``Oprah,'' Winfrey says, ``What I believe is that we are all looking for something deeper, greater''.
Flip to ``Springer'': Three female audience members say their goodbyes to the camera.
Then turn around quickly and bend over ``to show our bootys for you, Jerry''.
SEEN AND HEARD Dan Rather and Larry King on the same team?
CNN and CBS News are holding preliminary talks about a possible merger, but don't look for anything to come of it.
The two have held similar talks several times over the past few years and nothing has happened yet, or really ever come close.
Still, the rumors of talks are true, and they come as CBS News is faced with cutting a reported $40 million out of its budget.
There's speculation inside CBS that it's CBS executives who are leaking word of the talks, and that their goal is convincing Wall Street analysts the network is serious about reducing costs, which would have a positive impact on CBS's stock.
In the past, merger talks have broken down because neither side would yield control over a merged operation to the other.
There's little apparent reason at this point to think that's changed.

NEW YORK (AP) --Talk show host Oprah Winfrey is starting a magazine next spring with the magazine publisher Hearst Corp.
Hearst said in a statement that the new magazine will offer articles on community, family, relationships, health and fitness, fashion and beauty, and books.
``I love the printed word and have always appreciated the unique connection between author and reader,'' said Oprah Winfrey.
``This magazine provides a different way for people to be informed and inspired''.
Hearst publishes a variety of major magazines, many of them aimed at women, including Cosomopolitan, Good Housekeeping, Country Living and Harper's Bazaar.
The new magazine, which will debut in the spring with 850,000 copies, will have a cooperative relationship with the Oprah.com Web site.
Most everything about her is geared toward cycling.
Hence the minimalist lifestyle that most would consider quirky but Freedman regards as imperative.
Oh, sure, she'll share in the inevitable laughter when people get a gander at her immobile home in the driveway _ decorated garishly along the sides and windows with large fruit and other Odwalla insignia.
She'll good-naturedly point out that this old team van has occupied this spot since Miller nursed it here from Colorado despite a crippling generator problem that meant the engine couldn't be restarted once it was turned off.
And, though she's now the van lord rather than the resident, she'll chuckle through a guided tour of the interior, featuring a spartan bed on which she's placed a futon; a cabinet console that houses an assortment of nutritional supplements _ ``I think I take more pills than my 80-year-old grandmother''; the guest room, also known as the passenger seat; the laundry room, formerly the driver's seat; and an eclectic library scattered along the floor consisting of cycling tomes and works ranging from ``Schindler's List'' to Jackie Joyner-Kersee's autobiography.
She's lighthearted about the whole thing, but it's no joke.
She lives this way because she believes it facilitates her cycling.
Freedman prefers New England and intends to settle there, probably in Western Massachusetts, ``because it's more rural.
The people are more family-oriented.
They may lack some of the social graces, but you can know what they're really thinking.
You can know your neighbors''.
But for now, she stays here, living under dorm-like conditions in _ and outside _ an obscenely overpriced ramshackle ranch that is a glorified tract house but still rents for $2,875 monthly, this being Silicon Valley and all.
``Ask people why they're here and they say to live for a couple of years and make lots of money,'' says Freedman.
``For them, it's get-rich-quick.
I guess for me, it's get-poor-slow''.
So she sacrifices by subletting, enabling her to share indoor privileges with four fellow transients in a house that is decorated in what best could be described as collegiate dishabille, the major furniture being five bikes hanging from a wall in the foyer.
``It's a cardboard box,'' says Freedman.
But it's worth it because she considers the training conditions here perfect _ the moderate year-round weather, the trails and hills wending to the coast on which she rides some 350 miles a week and where ``she knows every leaf and rock,'' says her father.
Even her temporary move indoors, which will end after the Olympics, was planned with Sydney in mind.
She needs her sleep, Freedman explains, and it's futile trying to get much in the driveway because a train regularly traverses the tracks in the shadow of the neighborhood and sounds its horn throughout the night.
Meanwhile, unused in the nine-room, four-bedroom family home in Wellesley is Freedman's room.
There a papier-mache monkey that took her a half-year to create in high school still dangles on a makeshift branch from a window, a la Curious George.
But Freedman eschews these familiar niceties and the career track many of her friends _ now doctors and lawyers and teachers _ have followed.
She works part time for an on-line women's sports company but is on hiatus now as she devotes all her energies to Olympic preparations.
And she hopes never to have a cursed 9-to-5 desk job, preferring to settle into a career connected with women's sports that will enable her to get out and about.
In the meantime, she follows a trail that almost defies orthodoxy.
``I definitely think she enjoys the underdog role,'' says Schwab.
``It's because of the way she lives.
She could live where the cost of living is lower, work full time, train less. . . '' And hate every minute of it.
For better or worse, this is Freedman's unique interpretation of the American dream.
And even while her parents _ who thought she would proceed directly from college into a career _ cautiously wonder when, if ever, she'll use that bachelor's degree in the marketplace, they applaud her resolve.
``I kind of admire the way she lives,'' says her mother.
``It makes sense to me to pursue what you enjoy doing, not spend your money on frivolous things but on what gives you enjoyment''.
It's just that Marvin and Corey Freedman never envisioned such all-encompassing enjoyment coming from this.
&QL; -------- &QC; &QL; Even when she became an itinerant track apprentice with the Wayfarers, her parents thought sports were a diversion.
``She's the only one in the family who's competitive,'' says Marvin.
And Corey adds, ``We didn't realize she was this competitive''.
Indeed, little did they know.
``We'd go on bike rides to Walden Pond,'' says Dr.
Julie Damon, a Freedman friend since sixth grade.
``She always said she wanted to go to the Olympics, but she never specified in what event''.
Certainly not cycling.
At least not on the surface.
But there were hints . . . ``You could tell track wasn't a love for her,'' says Peggy Kriss, who used to employ Freedman as a baby sitter and will accompany her husband, Cliff Pollan, to Sydney for the road race.
``When she started biking, you knew it was a passion for her''.
Still, track, if anything, seemed her athletic destiny.
Sally Jean Alexander would write accounts of Wayfarers races for various local newspapers, and Nicole took great pleasure in the publicity.
``She always enjoyed the limelight,'' says her mother.
``She liked seeing her name in the paper''.
Still, ``she was competitive in a good way,'' says Dr.
Amy Spooner, who has known Freedman since second grade.
``And she basically was good at everything she tried''.
That continued in high school, where Freedman captained the track team, excelling in events ranging from the 100-yard dash to the 2-mile, and played tennis.
``She was probably the best all-around athlete I ever had,'' says former Wellesley High track coach Mickey Walsh.
``What I found special about her was her toughness.
She was dynamic, a great kid with a great sense of humor.
She's the reason people go into coaching''.
When she got to MIT, she continued to compete in track and played basketball, but these seemed no more than extracurricular activities as Freedman focused on her studies.
``If I did what I'm best at,'' she says, ``I'd be a mechanical engineer''.
She discovered that MIT wasn't the best for her.
For one thing, she wanted to pursue liberal arts.
For another, she wanted a more intensive athletic challenge.
``She found MIT boring,'' says Spooner.
``I think she wanted to be with people who were more serious about track''.
Hello, Stanford.
But once there, Freedman took a major detour, and not just academically.
At the Division 1 level in track, ``I was thoroughly mediocre,'' says Freedman.
``If I fell dead on the track, it wouldn't matter'' to the team.
So after her junior year, she tried another approach.
``I decided to do what I wanted to do,'' says Freedman.
``If I felt like running, I'd run''.
The first week of this new regime, she felt like running 40 miles.
``I said to myself, `See?
That proves I'm a runner,' '' she says.
Then she promptly proved she wasn't.
``I didn't do any after that,'' she says.
Instead, her footwork involved pedals.
And passion.
``I found myself riding 200 miles a week,'' says Freedman.
``I did it with absolutely no pressure''.
Or thoughts about any riding other than recreational.
But Art Walker, coach of the Stanford club team _ it's not an NCAA-sanctioned sport _ persuaded her to try competition.
And thus was born an obsession.
Freedman helped Stanford win the informal national college championship, then participated in the Ride Across America.
And she was hooked.
Her parents discovered her addiction almost by accident.
When they visited Corey's relatives in Los Angeles, Nicole joined them _ by bike.
Some 440 miles from the Stanford campus.
And on excursions to the beach during their stay, Nicole would ride while they would drive.
She'd start out earlier, and she'd always be there to meet them when they arrived, having covered a route that included uphill ascents even Corey considered taxing _ and she was in a car.
``When I saw how Nicole had gone over the mountains,'' says Corey, ``I was amazed.
I wasn't surprised when she won the trials because what she does is amazing''.
Now Nicole is living for the ultimate moment _ the Olympic race, where she'll try to put the pedal to the medal in what would truly be an amazing acccomplishment.
``It's risk and reward,'' says Miller.
``She'll have a go at it.
It may pay off or she may finish last''.
Either way, she'll embody the ultimate contradiction in her life.
``I think there's something about this competitiveness,'' says Marvin Freedman as he attempts to explain his daughter's decisions to a visitor and to himself.
``You get instant gratification''.
If you're long-suffering enough, as Nicole Freedman is .
The February sweeps end Wednesday night, so it's time for a very special, all-daytime and early evening remembrance of the month that was...

HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) --The provincial government is weighing a request by Lloyd's of London to search the Swissair crash site for $300 million in diamonds and jewels reportedly aboard the plane, according to news reports.
The British firm, through a Canadian insurance company, has asked the Nova Scotia government for permission to hunt for the valuables, said CBC-TV, Canada's national broadcast network.
Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the ocean just off Nova Scotia on Sept.
2, 1998, killing all 229 passengers on board.
The cause of the crash still hasn't been determined.
The plane's manifest indicates that 4 pounds of diamonds and 11 pounds of jewelry were aboard when it went down.
The valuables have not been found.
The reports said the insurance company plans to use a mini-submarine to seek the gems among the wreckage, which lies in about 200 feet of water.
The diamonds were reportedly in a stainless steel tube, which may have disintegrated on impact or been driven deep into the seabed.
Lloyd's told CBC-TV last week that it hopes to begin the search this summer.
Lloyd's officials in London were unavailable for comment Monday evening and calls to a spokesman's cell phone were unanswered.
Nova Scotia Natural Resources Minister Ernie Fage has said the government will make a decision on whether to allow the search in a couple of weeks.
Fage said he wouldn't rule out allowing it, adding that he will consider concerns of family members.
Ian Shaw, whose daughter died in the crash, argued before the Nova Scotia legislature Friday that no one should be allowed to ''rake through'' the site.
He said other relatives of the victims also opposed the plan.
Bill Estabrooks, a member of the Nova Scotia legislature who represents communities near the crash site, wants the province to reject any treasure trove application ''because of the sacredness of the site.''
CHANGSHA, September 14 (Xinhua) --China has successfully collected natural benthal electric data using an electromagnetic survey machine at 200 meters under the sea, according to official sources.
The machine that can work at a maximum depth of 500 meters was developed by a research team led by He Jishan, an expert with the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
The test was taken at the electric field under the sea of the Taiwan Straits.
Sea electromagnetic surveying is an advanced benthal exploration measure.
China has pinpointed benthal surveying research as a key national technological project, which has been undertaken by the Zhongnan University in central China's Hunan Province.
It is expected to facilitate the country's exploration seabed geography and benthal resources.
China has a coastline of more than 18,000 kilometers and more than 14,000 kilometers of island coasts, but marine development, offshore petroleum exploration, and rapid industrial development along the coasts have caused serious environmental pollution and damage to the marine ecology.
The amount of losses from various marine disasters including the red tide has reached some 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion US dollars), as against 1 billion yuan each year in the 1980s.
So, seabed forests are an effective way to help sustainable development, Zeng said, and the country's oceanography authorities has a positive attitude toward this giant scheme.
Song Xiuwu, an oceanographer who presided over the seaweed planting project in Changdao, joined Zeng in suggesting that algae, shellfish, and rare marine products be developed in the offshore areas.
The two also emphasized the study of proliferation and protection of various algae on the seabed and different "afforestation" projects, and Zeng even hoped to establish a "seaweed growing festival" to get more attention.
WELLINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) --One of the biggest international science ventures undertaken in New Zealand waters will begin later this month with the arrival of an advanced French research ship to carry out a program of deep sea drilling.
A Wellington-based newspaper Tuesday reported that scientists from 11 countries, including New Zealand, France, Australia and Britain, are due to join the flagship Joides Resolution as it has drilled seven holes along the eastern coast of New Zealand to retrieve sediment and rock for analysis.
The Dominion quoted New Zealand scientist Lionel Carter, one of the researchers who will be on board, as saying that the project is part of a global initiative to determine how the oceans tick and influence climate.
The Ocean Drilling Program, set up in 1985 by 22 member countries, has led 78 expeditions and overseen drilling at more than 1,300 sites around the world.
The New Zealand visit, dubbed "Leg 181" and hoping to uncover the history of the South Pacific Ocean in the past 32 million years, will last two months.
The bill for the New Zealand leg has been estimated at six million U.S. dollars, funded mainly by the United States' National Science Foundation.
While conventional drilling ships typically work in water depths of less than 200 meters, the Joides Resolution can work in waters eight kilometers deep and then drill to one kilometer or more below the seabed.
Dr. Carter said this is truly a remarkable capability considering the ship will be bobbing in the ocean with 4 km of rotating drill pipe snaking through current-swept waters to the seabed and penetrating several hundred meters below to obtain the core material.
New Zealand's eastern coast has been chosen because of its position across the great current systems of the ocean.
New Zealand is the visible part of a vast submarine continent, half the size of Australia, that projects deep into the pathways of the currents, Dr.
Carter said.
El Nino and La Nina, the warmer and colder phases of a perpetual oscillation in the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean that drastically affects weather around the world, have in recent years become familiar agents of short-term climate change.
Now some scientists believe they may have identified a comparable kind of oscillation involving deep ocean currents.
They say this oscillation could warm and cool substantial parts of the globe on longer time scales of centuries to millenniums.
The deep ocean currents, in effect, create a global conveyor belt that transports great amounts of heat around the world.
When the currents run strongly, for example, Western Europe and the North Atlantic region are relatively warm; when they are weak, they cool off.
One instance of this cooling, some experts now suspect, was what is called the little ice age, an intermittent cold spell from the 14th to 19th centuries that at its coldest sent glaciers coursing down mountain slopes and condemned much of Europe to famine by freezing harvests.
Two years ago, researchers at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University discovered that cold spells lasting several centuries, much like the little ice age, have occurred regularly, about every 1,400 to 1,500 years, since the end of the last full ice age some 10,000 years ago.
Much bigger temperature swings, they found, occurred at the same intervals during the ice age itself.
They discovered this by analyzing climate signals contained in ocean sediments in the North Atlantic.
Now, by putting together different sorts of evidence, other researchers led by Dr.
Wallace S.
Broecker, a marine geochemist at Lamont-Doherty, have postulated that the oscillations in deep-ocean currents may be responsible for the 1,500-year cold cycles.
The study by Broecker and Stewart Sutherland of Lamont-Doherty and Tsung-Hung Peng of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration appears in the current issue of the journal Science.
While there is a long way to go before Broecker's postulate can be proved or disproved, it appeared to provide a possible new explanation for what Dr.
Richard Alley, a climate expert at Pennsylvania State University, called ``a fundamental beat to the climate''.
He said Broecker had ``put together a very possible story''.
``We need good hypotheses,'' Alley said, ``and he's given us one''.
Discerning and explaining the climate's fundamental beat is important to a central climate question of the day: whether the atmosphere is warming because of natural changes or human-induced changes in the atmosphere, chiefly emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases, like carbon dioxide.
Broecker is a primary advocate of the concept of the ocean conveyor belt as a climate regulator.
The conveyor is believed to be driven by changes in the salt content of the ocean's surface.
When salt builds up in a particular spot in the North Atlantic, it eventually makes the water dense enough to sink to the ocean depths.
Other water rushes in to replace it at the surface.
This combination is what sets the conveyor moving.
The bigger and stronger the main conveyor current, the more heat it can transport.
Aside from the North Atlantic, there is one other place where the conveyor gets a boost from sinking water (scientists call this production of deep water): the Weddell Sea near Antarctica.
By combining the results of a number of recent chemical and physical studies by several scientists, Broecker has concluded that the two sites do not produce roughly the same amount of deep water all the time, as had been thought.
Rather, he says, the southern and northern sites alternate as strong producers: when one is giving a strong boost to the conveyor, the other is giving a weak one, with widespread consequences for climate.
A number of studies of past climates have shown that when the North Atlantic region has been cold, as in the end of the last ice age, Antarctica has been relatively warm.
And a recent study by Dr.
Gary Clow, a geophysicist at the United States Geological Survey in Denver, based on an analysis of ancient Antarctic ice, suggests that since the end of the last glaciation, Antarctica was warmer whenever Europe was colder, as in the little ice age.
Finally, chemical evidence shows that the production of deep water off Antarctica has slowed to about a third of its rate a century or so ago, when the little ice age was ending, while production has remained strong in the North Atlantic.
That means the conveyor belt in that region continues to draw heat from the south to warm the North Atlantic region, especially Western Europe.
No firm cause-and-effect link has been established between the conveyor's supposed oscillations and the 1,500-year recurrences of cold spells like the little ice age.
But Broecker says there is a clear relationship between the conveyor's behavior and climate oscillations in the last ice age.
And he says that if the conveyor has indeed oscillated since then, as now seems the case, it suggests that the link may have persisted.
It is, he says, ``consistent with the idea that changes in the large-scale circulation in the ocean can have very important effects on the atmosphere,'' and that ``we're playing with a system that we still don't understand.''
The sea has millions of dark secrets.
And now, a famous explorer is to illuminate more of them.
For more than a third of a century, Alvin, the world's first craft to roam the abyss with relative ease, has been ferrying American scientists into the planet's sunless depths and racking up a staggering record of discovery, including dark ecosystems that, with riots of tube worms and other bizarre creatures, rival rain forests in richness.
But the plucky, white, 25-foot-long craft has its shortcomings.
Most notably, it can plunge down only so far without the deep's pressures suddenly crushing its crew capsule (and three occupants).
For dives, the safety limit is 2.8 miles.
That distance is little more than the sea's average depth and far short of its deepest spot, seven miles down, much lower than Everest is high.
The upshot is that a large part of the seabed, with its dark recesses and riddles and perhaps even a den or two of undiscovered monsters, is out of Alvin's reach.
Off limits is an area larger than Asia.
But now, Alvin is getting a major overhaul that may extend its reach and allow it to match and possibly even surpass newer submersibles abroad, making it the world leader.
In a remarkable bonanza from the end of the Cold War, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, which runs Alvin, has just received from the Navy a submersible known as Sea Cliff, which has been decommissioned in the wake of military cutbacks and changing priorities.
Woods Hole and its federal patrons have insufficient money to run Sea Cliff, designed for military work, as a separate vehicle.
But Woods Hole is happy to cannibalize its parts to improve Alvin, a process now getting under way.
The trove is rich.
Alvin cost about $50 million, and Sea Cliff about $200 million.
The crown jewel of Sea Cliff is its crew capsule.
The walls are made of a thick layer of super-strong titanium that can withstand pressures down to depths of 3.8 miles (or 6 kilometers).
So Woods Hole is now studying whether the capsule can be transferred to Alvin, a move that would extend the reach of the tiny submersible by a full mile.
``We have a responsibility to make sure it's the best,'' Dr.
Robert B.
Gagosian, the director of Woods Hole, said in an interview.
Eager to push even deeper and capitalize on the politics of the moment, the institution is seeing whether further strengthening would allow Alvin to plunge down to depths of 4.3 miles (or 7 kilometers) _ deeper than any of the rival submersibles now operated by Russia, France and Japan.
``We've been the leaders in exploration,'' Dr.
Gagosian said.
``In order to continue that tradition, we need to have the deepest-diving submersible.
It's that simple.
We want to lead''.
Scientists say major questions of geology, biology and even archaeology now lie beyond Alvin's current reach, not to mention the unknown.
``There's important science to be done'' in the sea's deeper regions, said Dr.
Daniel J.
Fornari, head scientist for the deep submergence program at Woods Hole.
``It's such a compelling part of the planet.
We've got this sitting in our backyard and we know so little about it.
It's ridiculous''.
Over the decades, Alvin users have been the first to glimpse the seabed's dark ecosystems, its hot chimneys, its cold seeps, its rocky chains of mountains longer than the Andes and its lost human worlds, such as the Titanic.
The explorers have also brought to light thousands of new species of animal life, including slimy things seemingly fit for monster movies.
This record of ongoing excellence is causing some of the submersible's users to view any renovations warily.
&QL; nn ``One thing is clear,'' said Richard F.
Pittenger, head of marine operations at Woods Hole.
``We don't want to screw up the reliability in the process of trying to make the submersible better''.
When Alvin was first proposed by Woods Hole in the 1960s, it was considered a curiosity.
Most military officials and scientists of the day cared little about people exploring the deep.
No regular Navy contractor wanted job.
So the submersible was built by General Mills, the maker of breakfast cereals.
The situation changed after a Navy submarine, the Thresher, sank with 129 men in 1963.
Its wreckage remained lost for months.
In the catastrophe's wake, the Navy decided to throw itself into mastering the abyss.
No expense was too great.
The Navy built two Alvin look-alikes, Sea Cliff and Turtle.
Both were heavier and faster than their forerunner.
Eventually, in 1984, Sea Cliff dove much deeper, with its stronger crew capsule.
However, foreign submersibless began to rival Sea Cliff's maximum depth of 3.8 miles and to make new discoveries.
In 1990, the Japanese pulled ahead with a new submersible that plunged down 4 miles.
Woods Hole scientists looked on sheepishly in 1994 as the Japanese submersible, Shinkai 6500, set an Atlantic depth record.
Today, the 31-foot-long Japanese submersible is still unrivaled.
Such competitive pressure is one reason Woods Hole is eager to have Alvin go deeper.
The more important reason is raw knowledge.
Scientists say the inky deep is not only inherently provocative but important to understand if people are to be good planetary stewards.
It is the Earth's largest habitat, containing, by some estimates, 97 percent of the space inhabited by living things.
It is also the planet's lifeblood.
Its voluminous waters supply vital elements that sustain life on the surface and regulate planetary heat flow, keeping the land temperate.
Geologically, the deep is the planet's most dynamic feature, the place where huge slabs of crust are created and destroyed.
About 90 percent of the Earth's volcanism happens undersea.
Gagosian, the Woods Hole director, said a deeper-diving Alvin could better study these cauldrons, which also support lush ecosystems and are suspected of being the place where life arose four billion years ago.
A deeper-diving Alvin, he said, could not only explore the sites directly but could wire the ocean with sensitive detectors meant to track distant seaquakes.
A great opportunity for such wiring lies in old telephone cables that criss-cross the sea's abyssal plains, Gagosian said.
This month, one such cable between California and Hawaii is to be lifted from a depth of 3.1 miles and fitted with geologic detectors _ an oceanographic first.
A deeper Alvin could service such devices, eliminating the need for lifting the cable, which is a risky job.
A deeper Alvin would also be able to visit more of humanity's lost worlds.
The luxury liner, Titanic, resting at a depth of more than two miles, is now within Alvin's reach and was visited in 1986 by the tiny white submersible, but thousands of other wrecks lie deeper.
One is the I-52, a Japanese submarine sunk in World War II while carrying a shipment of two tons of gold, 146 bars of it packed in metal boxes.
Discovered in 1995 more than three miles down on the Atlantic abyssal plain, the I-52 wreckage is now slated for further exploration as the salvage team searches for vehicles than can go that deep.
Bits of Sea Cliff are already being transferred to Alvin.
The first to go was the military submersible's digital sonar.
Barrie B.
Walden, manager of deep submergence at Woods Hole, said incorporating Sea Cliff's crew capsule into Alvin might cost $15 million, a sum as yet unapproved by federal planners.
He said the upgrade could be done during the sub's next major overhaul, which is scheduled for the end of 2000, allowing it to start the new millennium on an auspicious note.
With Alvin diving to depths of 3.8 miles (or 6 kilometers), the region outside its reach would shrink dramatically, contracting from something larger than Asia to the size of Europe.
Gagosian, eager for even greater penetration of the sea's darkness, has asked Woods Hole experts to assess the feasibility of Alvin's plunging to depths of 4.3 miles (or 7 kilometers).
But achieving that may take more than Sea Cliff's sphere, and might cost $100 million _ big money in a field that gets about $20 million a year in federal money.
Some scientists feel such money is unlikely to materialize.
But others are hopeful, saying that the potential returns are huge and the cost is extraordinarily low compared with other Federal science investments.
``It's way underfunded,'' Fornari said of the nation's efforts at deep exploration, still led by Alvin.
``It's appalling how little it gets and how much gets done.''
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) --China has recorded new advances in the exploration of seabed polymetallic nodules in the eastern Pacific and planning for commercial mining in the next century, according to the China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association (COMRRDA).
China has explored the international seabed since the late 1970s.
COMRRDA registration with the United Nations as a pioneer investor in international seabed resources in 1991 raised the country's exploration program to a new stage.
COMRRDA had carried out nine exploratory expeditions by the end of last year.
Related operations yielded extensive data and information on the 150,000-sq.km.
area in the Pacific.
The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea requires China to relinquish 50 percent of the aforementioned area by March 5 this year.
However, China will retain the right to explore for polymetallic nodule resources in the remaining 75,000-sq.km.
area. "China has developed a complete set of deep-sea mining techniques and will continue to develop new techniques," according to a COMRRDA spokesman.
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) --Animals living on the ocean floor may be just as susceptible to climate change as surface-dwellers, the science journal, Nature, reports.
Researchers came to this conclusion after studying the fossil record of ostracods, minute clam-like crustaceans in deep-sea sediment at the bottom of the North Atlantic, dating from the Late Pliocene era more than 2.4 million years ago.
Most scientists believed the ocean floor was buffered against climate change by the water above it, but the journal's report today questions this deep sea environmental stability.
The diversity of deep sea animals seems to wax and wane over a 41,000-year cycle, says Dr Thomas Cronin, of the Geological Survey, Virginia, and Dr Maureen Raymo, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
That cycle corresponds to the rhythmic vibration in the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation, which affects seasonality.
In waters off Virginia and North Carolina, scientists have found cracks in the seabed that might set off a tsunami, they say, sending waves as high as 20 feet speeding toward the mid-Atlantic states.
Neal W.
Driscoll of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, Jeffrey K.
Weissel of Columbia University and John A.
Goff of the University of Texas said in an article in the May issue of the journal Geology that the recently discovered cracks could mean the continental shelf was unstable and could slide down like an avalanche, inducing the giant waves.
The scientists said they discovered the cracks about 60 miles from shore along a 25-mile section of the continental shelf off the Virginia and North Carolina coasts.
If the seabed there gave way, they said, the reaction could set off the giant waves.
``From a societal perspective, we need to evaluate the degree of tsunami hazard that might be posed by a major submarine landslide,'' the scientists wrote.
And they plan to find out if the cracks ``are fossil features or are active and likely to produce a potentially disastrous, large submarine slide in the near future''.
The scientists are leaving this weekend on a 14-day expedition to gather more data to assess the risk.
``We don't want to sensationalize this,'' Driscoll said in an interview.
``The risk associated with these cracks is finite.
First, we have to determine if they're geologically active, then whether they're moving on human time sales''.
The long fissures were found 325 to 650 feet beneath the waves and lie perched close to the edge of the outer continental shelf, where the seabed becomes gradually deeper and then quickly gives way to the abyss.
Never before, the scientists said, have cracks so large been seen, although hints of smaller ones have cropped up in undersea data.
If the danger of the cracks proves real, the scientists said, coastal areas of North Carolina, southern Virginia and the lower Chesapeake Bay would be at risk for wave heights similar to the surge of a category 4 hurricane, which is characterized by top sustained winds of 131 to 155 miles per hour.
The problem is that a tsunami can come with no warning.
Such sudden events are not unknown.
In 1929, a submarine landslide associated with an earthquake on the Grand Banks set off a tsunami that killed 51 people along the coast of Newfoundland.
The waves from that event were estimated to range in height from 3 to 40 feet.
Tsunamis are often larger than predicted from the force of earthquakes alone, suggesting that submarine landslides play an important role in their generation, the scientists said.
In 1998, a tsunami in Papua New Guinea killed 2,000 people.
The scientists plan to make images of the cracks with sonar waves, and then take deep samples of the seabed to see if the cracks are fresh or covered with layers of sediment.
The latter finding would suggest that the cracks were geologically inactive and a low threat of producing giant waves.
TIANJIN, May 4 (Xinhua) --Since April last year, China has successfully been using steel caissons to develop oil in the Jinzhou 9-3 Oilfield in the Bohai Sea.
A cylindrical steel caisson, 13.8 meters tall and 38 meters in diameter, was put in April last year on the seabed in the oilfield's eastern section, where it has been used as a platform for drilling and storage of oil, according to Jiang Hengyu, manager in charge of the project.
This is the first time China has used this technology in offshore oil production, Jiang said.
He explained that the new technology effectively prevents sedimentation and icing on a drilling platform, and a new 10-meter-thick oil-bearing stratum has been discovered.
The Jinzhou 9-3, which is 20 km from the city of Jinzhou in Liaoning Province, has proven oil reserves of 30.8 million tons.
The oilfield was discovered by the Bohai Oil Company in the late 1980s.
The water over the oilfield is 7 m deep, making conventional oil development methods costly and difficult for recovering investment.
After eight years of study, petroleum engineers decided to use the steel caissons for efficiency and safety.
The oilfield's eastern section will not have any living facilities, but will be linked with the other section by a 2.7-km marine pipeline and a marine cable.
The caissons for the western section have been completed and are expected to be installed soon, according to Jiang.
The Jinzhou Oilfield is expected to have 27 production wells, 26 water filling wells, and one natural gas well, and a designed annual capacity of a million tons.
The oilfield will cost 1.8 billion yuan and will go into production in 1999.
The Bohai Oil Company was originally set up in Tanggu of Tianjin in 1966, and now has 10 billion yuan in fixed assets and 10,000 employees.
Down into the lifeless, oxygen-free depths of the Black Sea, and on the edge of the American continental shelf where the Hudson River plunges into the deep ocean, explorers will deploy an array of high-tech gear this week in search of history that has lain out of reach for thousands of years.
In the Black Sea, a team from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and MIT hopes to find evidence of harbors dating from an era when the waters were hundreds of feet shallower, and perhaps shipwrecks that could reveal ancient deep-water trading routes, possibly the maritime equivalent of the old Silk Road.
Off the coast of New York, an expedition led by oceanographer Robert Ballard and archeologist Kevin McBride of the University of Connecticut will search for signs of human settlements that may predate any ever found on land on the East Coast, perhaps revealing how and when this part of the continent was first settled _ maybe as far back as the height of the last ice age, 18,000 years ago.
Coming close on the heels of stunning discoveries last year, the searches represent the dawning of another era in archeology, a dramatic advance made possible by oceanographic research tools, including precisely-controllable robotic vehicles with electronic cameras, and high-resolution sonar detectors.
Last summer, the most ambitious attempt so far to explore in deep water for traces of humanity's distant past yielded an astonishing trove of data.
In just three weeks, a Mediterranean expedition, led by Boston University archeologist Anna Marguerite McCann and Ballard, discovered five Roman shipwrecks spanning virtually the entire history of Roman maritime trade.
These ships lay as much as 2,800 feet deep on the ocean floor.
Before then, no ancient wreck had been found deeper than 300 feet.
Because they were so deep, the Roman ships' artifacts were better preserved than any found in shallow water.
At those depths, McCann said, there is little of the activity that quickly destroys shallower shipwrecks, including wind and wave action, devouring by marine creatures, or looting by treasure hunters.
``The deep sea's opened up'' for archeology, said McCann in an interview last week.
And it was last year's remarkably successful Mediterannean research that proved the value of applying the technologies of deep ocean exploration to the old and often tradition-bound field of archeology, she said.
``It was a breakthrough, a true beginning for marine archeology''.
Her colleagues in the field were profoundly critical, McCann said, when Ballard first offered back in 1989 to apply his team's equipment and expertise to the untested idea of deep-water archeology.
They were skeptical because Ballard was not an archeologist, because of his high public profile since his discovery of the wreck of the Titanic, and because they thought robotic deep-sea vehicles would be too clumsy to recover artifacts without breaking them, she said.
``Ballard is not an archeologist,'' McCann conceded, ``but I'm not an engineer or an oceanographer.
The technology is here, and there are treasure hunters using this and selling stuff.
I thought, `We've got to get into this'''.
In weighing whether to go against her colleagues' advice and join the expedition, said McCann, now 65, who already was considered one of the nation's leading authorities on Roman-era archeology, ``I thought, `Why not?
I'm old, I don't have to worry about tenure'''.
Since then, McCann has been recruited by Boston University, which already has one of the nation's leading departments for dry-land archeology, to create a program dedicated to underwater archeology.
What is needed now, according to both oceanographers and archeologists who have participated in the pioneering deep-water explorations, is a generation of graduate students who will be trained from the start in both traditional archeology and in the technology of deep marine exploration.
Ballard sees himself as a kind of matchmaker in helping to bring about the marriage of these two fields.
&UR; &LR; ``There's a new opportunity here,'' he said last week, ``to bring together the world of oceanography with the world of archeology, and to try to create a new field of science''.
Parts of the relatively shallow near-shore waters of the continental shelf, up to a depth of about 200 feet, have been explored by archeologists using scuba diving equipment for many years.
But deeper water, where only expensive submersibles, submarines and remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs) can reach, had never been examined by archeologists until McCann decided to sign on as archeology director for Ballard's 1989 trip to Skerki Bank, in the Mediterranean Sea near Sicily.
That year, with thousands of schoolchildren watching through a satellite link as part of Ballard's educational Jason Project, the team discovered a Roman shipwreck they dubbed the Isis.
It was eight years before they were able to take the second step _ last year's return expedition to the area.
This time, they had some new tools: the Navy's NR-1 nuclear submarine to perform the initial reconaissance and locate promising sites, and a sophisticated array of sonar equipment and digital cameras added to the Jason, the world's most precisely-controllable ROV.
The three-week trip yielded eight discoveries, five of them Roman ships ranging in age from the first century BC to about 400 AD.
&UR; &LR; ``What we did in the Mediterranean that had never been done before &UR; &LR; was to make quantitatively accurate maps of the site, to allow all the information from that wreck site to be preserved,'' said Dana Yoerger, an oceanographer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution whose job includes guiding the ROVs.
&UR; &LR; Many groups now have the capability to use these robotic vehicles to take pictures of underwater sites, and to use computers to create photomosaics of an entire site, but Woods Hole alone has the ability to monitor the vehicle's position to within a half-inch as it takes its pictures.
The shapes and dimensions of objects in its photomosaics can be measured with the precision that archeologists achieve when they measure the position of every artifact and plot it on maps of land sites.
&UR; &LR; Thanks to the precision of this data, McCann said, ``I think the archeological community has been won over''.
Being able to find ancient artifacts in such deep sites not only opens up previously unreachable areas for research, it also allows the mapping of trade routes that were previously unknown.
It also means that ancient wrecks will likely be found in a far better state of preservation than those found in shallower water.
Ballard, who last year left Woods Hole to head a new organization called the Institute for Exploration, based in Mystic, Conn.
, said it was the discovery of the Titanic that opened his eyes to that potential.
&UR; &LR; ``What really amazed me about the Titanic was the preservation environment of the deep sea,'' he said.
``Ships that found their way to the bottom in deep water were very different'' from those near shore.
For one thing, near-shore wrecks are often rapidly buried under accumulating sediments; in the deep sea, sediments build up at an imperceptible rate of about a half-inch every thousand years, he said.
In addition, ships that sink near shore are often quickly torn apart by the pounding surf; in deep water they may settle gently to the bottom and remain undisturbed and virtually intact.
He offers a vivid vivid illustration of that benign environment.
When the team returned to the Skerki Bank site, the imprint in the mud of an amphora they had removed eight years earlier was still clearly visible.
The preservation may be even better in the Black Sea, Ballard said &UR;. &LR; ``It is the largest body of water in the world with no oxygen,'' he said, and without oxygen the marine organisms that often devour all the exposed wood in a wrecked ship are unable to survive there.
David Mindell, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who will lead the Black Sea expedition, said the explorers hope to find evidence of a trade route directly across the sea through deep water.
``It would have been the maritime equivalent of the Silk Road,'' he said.
``It would have been a pretty significant shortcut, if you could make it work, between the Mediterranean and Central Asia''.
Some ancient texts, he said, suggest such a route was indeed used.
Oceanographers have found that until about 7,000 years ago, the Black Sea was a freshwater lake about 300 feet shallower than its present level, and that it was flooded when the Mediterranean broke through the Bosporus.
That flooding, which may have buried ports in areas that are now far offshore, is believed to have taken place very rapidly, and some archeologists think it may have been the origin of the Biblical story of the deluge.
Similarly, the site Ballard's group will explore this week off Long Island was also high and dry for many millennia, and may hold sites that were once hunting encampments on land.
Until about 12,000 years ago, when most of what is now New England was buried under a mile-thick sheet of ice, the continental shelf was exposed and may have been occupied by the ancestors of native Americans.
Connecticut's Mashantuck and Pequot tribes are helping to finance this week's reconnaissance mission, which will once again use the Navy's NR-1 submarine, in hopes of learning about their distant ancestors.
``This is the first time anyone has gone out in this region thinking paleo-Indians,'' Ballard said.
The potential for discoveries of ancient sites around the world is enormous, as the new deep-water methods continue to be applied in new places, McCann said.
``The technology is here,'' she said.
``This is new knowledge, a new opportunity, and we've got to get in there make use of it.''
BEIJING, February 3 (Xinhua) --China has announced it is to draw up boundaries for its exclusive mineral mining operations in 75,000 square kilometers of the eastern section of the Pacific Ocean where it intends to intensify its exploration activities.
In 1991, China was officially recognized by the United Nations as one of the pioneering investors in international seabed exploration and acquired the mining right in an area of 150,000 sq.
km of the Pacific Ocean.
After surveys indicated poor reserves in large tracts of the original zone, China has given up the right for about half of the area.
It will now concentrate on the new, smaller mining zone which geologists estimate could have an annual production capacity of three million tons of rare metals such as manganese, nickel and cobalt.
The reserves are expected to last for at least 20 years, which will help ease the shortage of such rare metals in China throughout the early part of the next century.
The newly designated area is estimated to contain about 112 million tons of manganese, 4 million tons of copper, 5 million tons of nickel and 980,000 tons of cobalt.
According to Jin Xianglong, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), the metals and minerals are scattered on the sea-bed "like potatoes".
He added, "China has now acquired the advanced technology to pick up these 'potatoes like' lumps of rock and metal from the deep sea".
After much research Chinese engineers have developed a robot which can operate 6,000 meters underwater and will be used in such deep-sea mining.
However, this type of exploration requires high technology and a large investment with a concurrent high risk factor, warned Jin Jiancai, secretary-general of the China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association.
Explaining the need to find more reserves of rare metals on the ocean beds, Jin went on to say that because of the pace of development in technologies, modern instruments and telecommunications, China's land-based rare metals resources only have a further 30 to 50 years of life.
"As a result, the shortage of rare metals would have great impact on people's lives," said Wang Dianzuo, vice president of the CAE.
He explained, for example, that the batteries used in mobile phones consume a large amount of nickel every year.
"If those nickel resources are exhausted, people will lose the convenience brought about by mobile phones," he said, adding the crisis will also appear in other areas using products needing rare minerals and metals.
MOSCOW, August 17 (Xinhua) --The crippled Russian nuclear submarine Kursk with its trapped crew of 118 is slowly sinking deeper into the Barents Sea floor, although rescue is still possible, Russian navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said Thursday.
"This process is very slow and does not significantly impact on the rescue operation," the Interfax news agency quoted Dygalo as saying.
However, the hatches on the submarine, to which rescue capsules are trying to attach, so far in vain, remain accessible.
"Due to the weather conditions, the attempts to dock with the submarine have once again failed," Dygalo said.
Weather has somewhat improved but a fresh breeze continues to blow and there is still fog and drizzle on the surface.
Four submersible rescue vehicles took turns Thursday at working deep in the water near the site where the Kursk sank, the Russian Navy press service said.
As rescue efforts continue, experts are analyzing video and photo materials picturing the damage done to the bow of the sub.
The accident reportedly happened last Saturday.
"The situation is estimated as being critical," the press service stressed.
More than 20 ships on the surface were involved in the rescue bid.
The ill-fated submarine was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995.
It has a displacement of 14,700-23,860 tons and can dive to depths of up to 500 meters.
The submarine is armed with torpedoes and "Granite" cruise missiles.
The vessel can operate autonomously for up to 120 days, Interfax reported earlier.
On Wednesday, Russia agreed to enlist help from Britain and Norway in the rescue bid.
It had earlier refrained from seeking outside assistance.
The Norwegian vessel "Sea Eagle," with 12 deep-water divers from a special Defense Ministry unit, is expected to reach the site Friday evening, Interfax reported.
A second Norwegian vessel carrying the British submarine rescue craft "LR-5" is also expected to arrive at the scene at about 1 p.
m. Saturday, Interfax said, quoting military sources.
Russian President Vladimir Putin called British Prime Minister Tony Blair Thursday and the two discussed the rescue operation, Putin's senior aide Sergei Prikhodko said.
They discussed concrete aspects of the rescue efforts, Prikhodko said.
In addition, Germany has also offered to send a team of doctors and decompression chambers to the place where Kursk went down.
The offer was extended Wednesday through the German embassy in Moscow and to Russian Navy command officers holding consultations at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on assisting in the rescue of the crew of the sunken sub, Interfax reported, quoting diplomatic sources in Moscow.
WASHINGTON (AP) --Video screens displayed fantastical pictures of otherworldly landscapes below the waves and beyond the sun Monday as President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton hosted the latest in a series of White House lectures on science, arts and letters.
Monday's session on space and sea exploration featured gee-whiz science demonstrations and scientists' musings on what future explorations might yield.
Schoolchildren asked questions in person and over the Internet.
''We must continue as a nation to set out for new frontiers, whether under the sea or into the heavens,'' Clinton said at the start of the 90-minute session.
''We must continue to try to conquer the seemingly impossible, to discover the unimaginable, to find out more about what's out there, and in the process about ourselves and what's here''.
Clinton announced federal participation in three new undersea exploration projects: A deep-water canyon off the coasts of New York and New Jersey; reefs deep beneath the Gulf of Mexico off Florida's Gulf Coast; and an ocean mountain range off California.
He also directed the Commerce Department to form an advisory panel of scientists to recommend priorities and goals for new ocean exploration.
A report is due in four months.
Although oceans cover some 70 percent of the Earth's surface, scientists estimate that 90 percent of that space remains unknown to humans.
Clinton and scientists predicted Monday that some of the organisms found in those depths might one day provide medical cures or lessons for industry and human development.
Pictures of those creatures --brightly colored tube worms that live near undersea volcanoes and diaphanous scribbles floating in the deep -- flashed on the eight thin, high-tech screens set against the gilded splendor of the White House East Room.
Clinton fidgeted at times but also looked amazed as two prominent scientists, undersea explorer Marcia McNutt of California's Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and Neil de Grasse Tyson of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City, traded what-ifs about the future.
The lecture was the ninth of a program conceived by Mrs.
Clinton as part of the White House millennium year commemoration.
CANBERRA, October 21 (Xinhua) --A multinational scientific team has recovered the first rock sample from deep beneath the Antarctic ocean bed in a bid to reveal what happened in the frozen continent 30-100 million years ago, an Australian earth scientist on the team said today.
Ken Woolfe from James Cook University in Australia's northern Queensland state said 51 scientists from six countries were involved in the research.
James Cook University is the only Australian signatory to the International Cape Roberts Project involving the research on the Antarctic which got underway earlier this month.
"My own work will involve looking at the description of the rocks and interpreting the environment in which they were formed," Woolfe was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying.
He said the scientists were excited by the project because nothing was known about what happened in the Antarctic when the ice sheet was first forming.
"We think we'll find there was a time when there was no ice at all in the Antarctic.
We don't know how it occurred or when it occurred," he said.
By being able to understand the past, scientists would be better able to predict the future and understand how the Antarctic would react to global warming, he said.
"If all the ice in the Antarctic melted at once, sea levels all over the Earth would rise by 60 meters," he said.
Woolfe said the research, the largest ever scientific project undertaken in the Antarctic, was fraught with potential logistical nightmares.
"What we've basically done is putting a drilling rig on the sea ice, then drilled through the ice and water and then finally 400 meters into the seabed," he said.
"But we have to have exactly the right conditions, which really only gives us about eight to 10 weeks to work in".
He said the weather had to be cold enough to keep the ice stable yet not so cold that it made the steel of the 20-tonne drilling rig brittle.
Violent storms which could fracture the ice and potentially plunge the rig into the ocean posed another risk for the researchers, he said.
Because of the high risks involved, the research team lives at a camp 10 kilometers from the drilling site and members are flown to the rig by helicopter to work on 12-hour shifts in minus 21 Celsius centigrade conditions.
Besides the scientists, 20 drilling and support staff from Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Italy, Germany and Britain are involved in the project which will continue drilling until the end of November and then resume next summer.
GUANGZHOU, April 12 (Xinhua) --Last October's discovery of natural gas-hydrate resources in the seabed of the Xisha Isles of the South China Sea is the first of its kind in China, according to the Guangzhou Maritime Geological Investigation Bureau.
Natural gas-hydrate, also known as "combustible ice," "gas ice" or "solid gas," is a pure, clean, high-power and environmentally- friendly energy which has great development potential in 21st century.
The study of the gas-hydrate resources has been listed as one of the bureau's major exploration projects.
Scientists believe the East China Sea and the frozen earth area of the Tibetan Plateau are also possible reserves of natural gas hydrate.
LAKE GEORGE, N.Y.
_ In September 1999, a storm hit Lake George that wasn't quite as perfect as the one you can watch at the movies these days, but for an inland tempest, it was as good as they get.
State authorities who oversee Lake George say 150 boats were sunk when Tropical Storm Floyd was over, and all have been recovered.
Divers, however, say it might have been more like 200.
That difference of 50 boats is the stuff lake-bottom lore is made of.
If any boats sunk last fall remain under water, none have been spotted _ and with big fines likely, any owner of a still-swamped boat would probably prefer to keep it that way.
Still, the notion persists that a bevy of cabin cruisers are waiting to be found, at rest among the sloops, the treasure chests and even the sea monsters that live in the imaginations of lake watchers.
What is true, however, is that over the centuries ships have gone down to storms and in battles; others were deliberately scuttled in the days before strict laws forbade such sinkings.
One vessel, a 15-foot homemade submarine built to study French and Indian War wrecks, was stolen from its dock in 1960 before it even made a trial run.
Its fate was one of the lake's big mysteries until 1995, when Bateaux Below divers found the rusted hulk in deep water, midlake.
Mystery half-solved: No one can say how it got there.
Bateaux Below, a Saratoga Springs-based diving group that studies Lake George, has undertaken a lake-bottom inventory that might, over the next decade or so, take the guesswork out of many such tales of the deep.
But here are some mysteries that endure: _ In the deep water along the ``narrows'' at midlake, a 60-foot sailing vessel with a 65-foot mast is believed to be submerged, its sides collapsed, an open safe lying next to the wreck.
Its existence is not confirmed.
_ It is said that a treasure chest was found by two divers south of Diamond Island, near where the Forward wreck lies.
Divers say the chest is sunk in 120 feet of water and some continue to search for it today, but others note that waters off the island do not exceed 110 feet.
_ In the 1850s, a storm took down a three-mast sailing vessel (known as a ``bark'') in the middle of the lake with its full crew aboard.
One man jumped off before the storm became too powerful, and lived to tell a tale of violent winds and a crew member who tied himself to the mast to ride out the storm.
The ship has never been found.
_ The British vessel Halifax, a sloop-of-war, disappeared and may be somewhere in Lake George.
Over 50 feet long, it participated in both the 1758 Abercrombie expedition and the 1759 Amherst expedition.
Some historians believe it was dragged ashore and left to rot.
_ What ever became of the Ganouskie?
The steamboat was a lake attraction in the mid-19th century, then retired and moored at Big Burnt Island, where it was a floating bar.
When the bar failed, it is said the ship was scuttled in deep water off Dome Island, near Bolton Landing.
Divers are still making discoveries in Lake George.
But surely, some of the wrecks that divers hunt for never did exist.
And with the Bateaux Below survey poised to identify everything on the lake floor, those nonexistent wrecks may be the most thrilling to hunt for in years to come _ for divers who thrive on mystery.
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) --China has succeeded in building and utilizing a robot recently to survey Pacific Ocean depths of 6,000 meters, according to today's "Economic Information Daily".
The robotic accomplishment represents an advanced level in this high-tech sector, experts said.
Exploration of the ocean floor at 6,000-meter depth has sparked fierce competition among nations.
Survey technology at such depths --considered by some to be more sophisticated than space technology -- must cope with atmospheric pressure 600 times that at sea level.
In addition, oceanic research robots must adjust to unexpected problems.
The China-made robot completed its deep-water video record, measurements of the ocean bottom, investigation of water conditions and search for missing objects while automatically recording data, according to the report.
A special group of experts for the robot project also expressed satisfaction with the cable-less robot's quality and reliability.
LAGOS, November 16 (Xinhua) --Oil companies operating in Nigeria have achieved encouraging results in deep water oil exploration although a total of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars was spent between 1993 and 1998.
Shell's deep water oil exploration in its Bonga field has come up with exciting results which can be compared to the huge discoveries made in Angola, Congo, the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea when brought on stream by 2001, This Day newspapers Tuesday quoted Elf General Manager Daniel Ndafe as saying.
Industry sources said that the Bonga discovery held billion of barrels in proven reserves, making it biggest discovery by any of the multi- nationals operating in Nigeria's deep offshore region.
The general manager told a workshop organized by the Nigerian Association of Petroleum Exploration that the country's deep water terrain could hold the key to meeting the government's set target of increasing daily crude oil production to four million barrels per day and total reserves to 40 billion barrels by the year of 2010.
Ndafe said that from 1993 to 1998, 33 exploration and appraisal wells were drilled, 21,000 square kilometers of 2-D seismic work conducted in the frontier terrain and an additional 21,500 square kilometers of 3-D seismic work carried out.
AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ Dutch scientists say they have discovered toxic industrial chemicals in the tissue of whales that normally feed in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean.
While the quantities detected may not be harmful to the huge mammals, the scientists say their findings, presented at a conference in Stockholm last week, should serve as a warning of how far the chemicals have penetrated the ocean's food chain.
Some findings also were reported in Nature magazine in July.
At issue are so-called polybrominated compounds that are used as flame retardants in many everyday products, like television-set casings and children's clothing.
While these chemicals can be useful to consumers, they appear to be resilient and harmful in nature.
Scientists say they behave much like PCBs and DDT, which were banned for their toxicity.
Now the scientists say they have evidence that the brominated compounds enter the atmosphere and river and sea water, probably because they are not fully destroyed in waste incinerators.
The molecules do not dissolve easily in water and eventually find their way into animal and perhaps human tissue, they say.
``The study showed that we are seeing warning signals that more serious problems may be ahead,'' said Jacob de Boer, of the Netherlands Institute for Fisheries Research, who led the team that analyzed the whale tissue.
``These compounds are useful and relatively cheap, and industry has not been motivated to look for alternatives.
But maybe that time has come''.
For their most recent study, de Boer and a team of 10 Dutch scientists examined 13 sea mammals, including sperm and minke whales that were stranded on the Dutch coast in 1996 and 1997.
They said they found traces of the compounds in the animals' fat and sometimes in the liver.
Significant levels of the compounds had already been found in sea creatures that live near the coast, like dolphins and seals, but finding them in minke and sperm whales is more disturbing, de Boer said, because these whales normally feed at a depth of about 1,000 to 3,600 feet and the males hunt as far north as Iceland, where the ocean is presumed to be clean. &QL;
LAGOS, June 30 (Xinhua) --Shell International plans to invest 40 billion to 60 billion U.S. dollars in deep water oil exploration along the west African coast in the next 20 years, the Vanguard reported today.
The newspaper quoted a Shell publication as saying that the oil reserve in the deep waters of the west Africa is as high as 15 billion barrels.
Shell has already started its deep water exploration in Nigeria through the Shell Nigeria Exploration Company Limited.
The exploration wells drilled by the company in the waters near Warri in southwest Nigeria have shown encouraging signs that could lead to commercial development, said Shell manager Kisito Okpere.
Shell will also carry out deep water explorations in the waters of Angola, Congo and Cote d'Ivoire, the report said.
JERUSALEM, July 3 (Xinhua) --The Israeli government has awarded the first five licenses to drill for oil in the Israeli deep waters in the Mediterranean, reported The Jerusalem Post today.
The winning consortium, headed by Avner Oil and Gas Ltd.
, intends to drill off the coast at unspecified locations between Haifa and the Gaza Strip by the end of next year.
The first stage is to find further financial and technical partners, followed by a seismic study of the area between October and December, according to Avner's Managing Director Eli Rosenberg.
"Drilling will hopefully begin before the end of 1997," he said.
Rosenberg dismissed suggestions that the total cost of the project will be around 1 billion U.S. dollars.
He estimated that the initial drilling, at a 1,500 meter-depth, will cost 25 million dollars.
"Israel's deep waters appear to be very promising," said the government's Director of Petroleum Research, Dr.
Yehezkel Druckman, who granted the licenses.
This confidence stems from the results of previous drillings in the nearby shallow waters by Isramco in the early 1990s, which suggested the area is oil rich.
Avner, together with Delek Kiduchim and Enserch Middle East, had to be granted five licenses to carry out the project, because each only covers 400 square kilometers.
While experts agree that the area could prove lucrative, there is a variance of opinion as to how much oil is needed to make the operation economically viable.
Druckman suggested a minimum of 3,000 to 5,000 barrels a day while others believe more would be needed.
"For a successful well in that depth of water, they need thousands of barrels," said Yaron Ran, the managing director of Israel National Oil Company.
Avner, which claims the support of many international oil companies, said a former vice-president of the world's largest publicly owned oil company, Exxon Corporation, described the prospects as "world-class."
LAGOS, December 20 (Xinhua) --Nigeria is to join the league of deep offshore oil producers in the world when the nation's first deep water oil field commences production in the year 2003, the Guardian newspaper reported on Monday.
The country is now executing an oil project through Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO) at a cost of 2.7 billion U.S. dollars.
According to a statement issued by SNEPCO, the "Bonga" oil field is located 120 kilometers off the coast of the oil-producing Niger Delta region in water more than 1,000 meters deep.
The oil field, which has a reserve of 600 million barrels, will produce some 200,000 barrels of crude oil and 150 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day, the statement said.
Managing Director of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group Phil Watts was quoted as saying that the project would help establish Nigeria as a major player in the global energy sector.
The "Bonga" field is launched as a joint venture project, of which Esso has 20 percent of the share, Elf has 12.5 percent and Agip has 12.5 percent while the rest 55 percent is held by SNEPCO, the operator of the venture.
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) --Phoenician mariners sailed more than 2,500 years ago into the uncertain waters of the Mediterranean, praying to their storm god for a successful voyage -- only to meet death in a fierce tempest.
Now, American explorer Robert Ballard has located their two ships --the world's oldest known deep-water sea wrecks -- using the same techniques he used to find the Titanic.
The vessels' cargo --large ceramic containers of wine -- was probably headed to the Pharaoh's table in Egypt or to the Phoenician colony of Carthage in present-day Tunisia, Ballard told a news conference Wednesday, in announcing the discovery.
The ships' contents indicate they set sail from the Phoenician port of Tyre --now a city in Lebanon -- around 750 B.C.
Both vessels were transporting hundreds of ceramic jugs, called amphorae, filled with wine.
Remarkably, the amphorae were found intact, stacked snugly in rows, unlike the shards typically unearthed on land.
Archaeologist Lawrence Stager, one of several Harvard University scientists on Ballard's team, said the discovery of the pristine jugs ``was one of our greatest moments''.
The ships were also almost perfectly preserved --a result of the bitter cold deep-sea waters, where sunlight cannot reach, the pressure is intense and sediment scarcely accumulates.
Ballard said the ocean's deepest waters are capable of suspending history in time.
``Human history lost in the high seas is waiting to be discovered,'' said Ballard, who was propelled to fame by his 1985 discovery of the ocean liner Titanic.
Ballard, a former Naval officer and oceanographer, uncovered the Phoenician vessels about 30 miles off Israel with the aid of an underwater robot, deep-water tracking equipment and a global positioning satellite.
He was led to the area after a team looking for the Dakkar, an Israeli submarine that sank 35 years ago, photographed what appeared to be the remains of an ancient shipwreck.
The vessels were discovered sitting upright on the ocean floor at a depth of about 1,500 feet.
The fact that they sank straight to the bottom and were located within two miles of each other indicated they sank in a storm, Ballard said.
Ballard said the deep-sea route used by the two vessels was not previously known as one traveled by Phoenicians, and he hopes to find more ancient wrecks along the same path.
One ship is approximately 60 feet long and the other measures 45 feet.
The vessels were probably part of a fleet of cargo ships on consignment, Stager said.
Stone anchors were found, as well as crockery, a wine decanter and incense stands for offering prayers to the weather gods.
Incense offerings were made at the beginning and end of every voyage, but Stager said desperate sailors might also have used the incense stands during the violent storm that sank the boats.
Based on the pots and crockery found aboard, Stager said he believed there were about a half-dozen sailors on each ship and that fish stew would have been a typical meal for the crew.
Ballard said the two vessels were the first intact Phoenician ships ever found, and will aid historians and archaeologists, who until now had to rely on classical texts and the Bible for an idea about Phoenician shipping.
Phoenicians were a seafaring people who lived along the Levantine coast for about 2,000 years, beginning in 2300 B.C.
Stager said the findings were preliminary, noting that the expedition ship had just docked Tuesday night.
More would be revealed in the coming months when the artifacts are brought to Harvard for study, he said.
Ballard's expedition was sponsored by the National Geographic Society, the U.S.
Office of Naval Research and an Israeli archaeological institute.
It was the first time explorers have looked for archaeological ruins in deep water, partly thanks to newly developed technology.
Past deep-water expeditions had discovered only modern ruins, such as the Titanic.
Two other ship wrecks found in recent years are older than the Phoenician find, dating to around 1300 B.C. and 1200 B.C.
But they were found in shallower waters and were not in as good condition.
Ballard said the answer to many of history's mysteries could be found under the sea.
``A lot of history books will be rewritten from what we are finding in the deep seas,'' Ballard said.
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) --Pharaonic statues and sphinxes as well as Byzantine coins have been found in the undersea remains of ancient cities off Egypt's Mediterranean coast, a French undersea explorer said on Saturday.
The artefacts were found in the underwater vestiges of Herakleum and Menouthis, off the coast of the town of Canopus, which lie just east of Alexandria in the Nile Delta, Frank Goddio told a news conference held in the port city.
The Middle East News Agency reported that a team of divers led by Goddio discovered the treasures in two years of exploration and excavation, during which they found the remains of the ancient Greek town of Herakleum, where the Greek God Hercules was worshiped, Goddio said.
The finds included statues, sphinxes and columns from ancient Egypt, some dating to the 26th dynasty (seventh century BC) and the 30th dynasty (fourth century BC), he added.
Coins from the Byzantine and Islamic eras were also found.
He termed the discovery as a key step in helping unravel the ancient Egyptian civilization drowned in the Mediterranean Sea.
Herakleum is the second city which was found deep in the Mediterranean water after Menouthis was discovered in 1934.
They were among six cities which were built in the Greek era (332 BC to 305 BC) and sank into the sea in a major earthquake in ancient times.
SANTIAGO, October 2 (Xinhua) --Foreign mining firms will maintain investments in Chile of 1.66 billion U.S. dollars this year at the same level as last year.
Director of the Chilean Copper Commission Eduardo Titelman said Friday that these investments would be used in expanding or implementing projects linked to mining of copper, gold, silver and nitrates.
Titelman said total investments including those from the state enterprises in the sector will amount to 2.4 billion dollars this year.
BUENOS AIRES, October 7 (Xinhua) --Argentina will be among the top 20 gold producers in the world, a senior official of the Argentine Ministry of Mines said Wednesday.
Despite the effect of the international economic crisis, Argentina's gold production will increase from 800 kilograms in 1996 to 30 tons in the year 2000, an official of the ministry, Daniel Meilan, said at the "International Gold Seminar Argentina 98," which opened here on Wednesday.
Participants from mining sectors of 14 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Chile, Brazil, the United States, Peru, Colombia and Venezuela, are scheduled to discuss the international economic crisis and the development of Argentina's mining industry.
Meilan added that from 1996 to 2000, the total investment in Argentina's mining sector would be around 3.5 billion U.S. dollars, which will help increase gold exports from 32 million to 1.3 billion dollars.
LIMA, May 7 (Xinhua) --Peru turned out 56.4 tons of gold in 1995, representing an increase of 18 percent over the previous year, the Energy and Mining Ministry said today.
Peru is the world's 12th biggest gold producer and second in South America after Brazil.
Gold production will increase by 6.4 percent this year to reach 60 tons, a ministry document said.
For Peru, gold is the third most important export item after copper and fishmeal.
Six of the country's 50 biggest exporting companies are gold mining companies.
Ten years ago, the production of gold in Peru totaled 35 million dollars a year.
It totals 700 million dollars a year right now and is expected to increase to 1.2 billion in the next few years, said the chairman of the gold committee of the National Mining and Petroleum Society.
BANGKOK, May 4 (Xinhua) --Officials from the Thai Chamber of Commerce will meet Peru's gold industry leaders to discuss possible joint ventures to mine Peruvian gold, the Bangkok post reported today.
Patima Srichoomsiri, director of the Chamber's committee on small and medium-sized enterprises, will visit the Peruvian capital Lima at the head of a delegation next week and attend Peru's Second International Gold Symposium there.
A press release from the Peruvian Embassy in Bangkok said the gold mining industry has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years, prompting Peru's National Mining and Petroleum Society to organize the first international gold symposium in 1994.
That meeting drew more than 800 participants.
Next week's symposium will highlight the current state of gold resources in the country and promote new investment in the industry.
JOHANNESBURG, July 8 (Xinhua) --South Africa will establish resident diplomatic missions in Venezuela and Peru in the next few months, the Department of Foreign Affairs announced today.
The decision took into account South Africa's emerging priorities in it's foreign policy and political, economic and other opportunities the countries had to offer, the department said.
Some South African mining companies are already operating in Venezuela and Peru, both having significant mining potential and interested in joint ventures in this field with South Africa, department sources said.
South Africa established diplomatic relations with Peru and Venezuela in July and December in 1993 respectively.
The two Latin American countries have also opened embassies in South Africa.
Bilateral trade between South Africa and Venezuela stood at 41.96 million U.S.
Dollars and that with Peru at 45.3 million Dollars.
Currently South Africa has resident diplomatic missions in six Latin American countries.
They are Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Mexico and Uruguay.
LIMA, December 24 (Xinhua) --Peruvian main mining free on board (FOB) exports reached 2.13 billion dollars during the January-October period, the Energy and Mines Ministry said Thursday.
Gold,the most outstanding Peruvian mining export which ranks t he first place together with copper, increased by 55.6 percent the total value of its sales abroad.
Peru sold a total of 641.6 million dollars of gold during the first 10 months of the year,compared with 412.2 million dollars in the same period of 1997.
Copper remained with 641.8 million dollars, followed by zinc with 366.4 million, lead with 162.2 million, refined silver with 196.5 million, tin with 102.3 million and iron with 80.5 million dollars.
Energy and Mines Ministry spokesman said that 50 percent of the country's hard currency are from the mining industry.
SANTIAGO, December 16 (Xinhua) --Private mines in Chile will have produced 1.9 million metric tons of refined copper in 1996, marking an increase of 41.7 percent over 1995, according to the National Mining Society (SONAMI).
The SONAMI said the dynamic growth this year in the private mining sector had consolidated Chile as the world's leading copper producer.
It said the increasing momentum would become more accentuated in the next three years.
Private mines were estimated to produce 3.2 million metric tons of refined copper, with the total production for the country reaching 4.7 million metric tons.
Output of state-run copper mines would rise to 1.2 million metric tons in 1996, with new mining projects, including El Abra, Refugio, Santa Barbara, Mantoverde, Andacollo-copper and Anacollo-gold, going into operation, the Mining Society said.
GUATEMALA CITY (AP) --Refugees from Guatemala's civil war returned to their homeland from Mexico on Thursday, marking the final chapter of an international effort to resettle them.
United Nations officials called the return of 294 Guatemalans a successful example of resettlement efforts.
With Thursday's return, a total of 41,633 Guatemalans have been helped home.
About 13,000 Guatemalan refugees remain in 60 camps in the southern Mexican state Chiapas.
They will either return individually or stay in Mexico under a nationalization program offered by that country.
The refugees were welcomed with religious services and music Thursday in the town square of Coatepeque, 125 miles west of Guatemala.
They are the last group to be resettled under a U.N.-supervised program in which the Guatemalan government offered them low-interest loans to buy farmland.
Tens of thousands of Guatemalans fled to Mexico and the United States beginning in 1981 amid violence from the country's civil war.
----- QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Striking bus drivers blocked streets and many businesses closed their doors Thursday in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, in a one-day strike against the government's economic reforms.
About half of the businesses in Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest of Quito, closed to protest President Jamil Mahuad's proposal to raise taxes to reduce the small South American nation's $1.2 billion budget deficit.
Bus drivers blocked roads with their vehicles to protest the planned gasoline price increase.
Municipal workers demanding a greater share of the nation's budget for cities also joined the strike, placing city trucks and construction equipment across roads to strengthen the blockades.
The protest was largely peaceful.
Guayaquil police reported arresting 25 striking drivers for causing disturbances.
In eight months in office, Mahuad has faced two national strikes and repeated street protests as he tries to reform Ecuador's bankrupt economy and drag it from its worst economic crisis in decades.
----- MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Nicaraguan troops surrounded Managua's Sandino International Airport on Thursday to stop reported plans by student protesters to seize the facility and press their demands for higher funding for public universities.
The move came one day after a 21-year-old law student killed by a rubber bullet fired by police Tuesday was buried in an emotional ceremony.
Police officials have warned protesters they might begin using regular ammunition if demonstrators continue to attack public buildings and police lines with rocks and mortars.
Students backed by the leftist Sandinista party have been demonstrating for three weeks to demand that the center-right government of Arnoldo Aleman increase budgets for universities.
The students barricaded access roads to the airport Tuesday and some said they planned to seize it.
Dozens of police officers and students have been injured in the clashes, and 70 protesters have been arrested since the disturbances began.
----- CHILANGUERA, El Salvador (AP) -- U.S. army reserve members started work Thursday on a joint project with the Salvadoran army to rebuild bridges and public facilities destroyed by Hurricane Mitch in November.
The 350 reservists --mainly from the 81st regional support command based in Birmingham, Ala.
, but including reserve members from 15 other states --will work for the next four months rebuilding highways, bridges, roads, schools and health clinics.
At a ceremony in this hamlet 100 miles southeast of San Salvador, U.S.
Ambassador Anne Patterson said the projects are aimed at ``preventing another disaster like the one that occurred during the recent hurricane''.
Hurricane Mitch killed more than 9,000 people in Central America and caused billions of dollar in damage in October and November.
----- CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Indians clad in loincloths and smeared with warpaint on Thursday protested President Hugo Chavez's failure to halt gold mining in Venezuela's Amazon rain forests.
Chavez, a former coup leader who took office in February, promised during his campaign to reverse a 1997 decree that legalized gold and diamond mining in the pristine Imataca rain forest in southeast Venezuela.
But Jose Luis Gonzalez, a leader of the Pemon tribe, said Chavez has approved mining projects, including one at Las Cristinas, the site of what is believed to be one of the largest gold deposits in Latin America.
About 60 Indians protested outside Congress Thursday, including two Yanomamis who walked into Congress to present legislators with a letter outlining their complaints.
The Yanomamis are one of the last Stone Age tribes on earth, though their culture has been hurt in recent years by contact with modernity.
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ About 400 Indians blocked Venezuela's main highway to Brazil with huge logs to protest a high-voltage power line being built in the ``Lost World'' of Amazon rain forests.
The Indians shut down the El Dorado-Santa Elena International Highway near the gold mining town of El Dorado, about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) southeast of Caracas, on Monday and Tuesday, said Nicolas Betis of the Bolivar State Indian Federation.
They might carry out the action again Friday.
Construction of the (dlrs) 110 million, 500-kilometer (300-mile) power line is deforesting swaths of jungle and destroying Indian yuca, corn, banana, sugar and pineapple crops, he said.
The project is affecting about 15,000 people in 30 communities of Pemon, Karina, Akawaio and Arawako Indians.
``The deforestation is just horrible,'' said Mary Lou Goodwin, vice president of the Venezuela branch of the Audubon Society, who was at the protest site.
Some of the logs the Indians rolled onto the highway were nearly as wide as she is tall, she said.
One-third of the power line is to run through the 3-million hectare (7.4 million-acre) Canaima National Park, a popular tourist destination.
It is home to Angel Falls, which at 978 meters (3,208 feet) is the world's longest cascade, and to the eerily beautiful, flat-topped mountains that were the inspiration for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic adventure story ``The Lost World''.
Government officials say the power line is to run mainly alongside highways already built in the region and will cause little environmental damage.
The line is to supply electricity to Brazil, Indian communities in Venezuela and gold mining companies that plan to come to Venezuela to extract some of the largest gold deposits in Latin America.
Environmentalists say the companies will increase damage to the forests.
The Indians say much of the land where the power line is going up belongs to them and they were never consulted.
LIMA, December 19 (Xinhua) --Peru's gold output this year is expected to grow by 20.5 percent from last year to 92.6 tons, keeping Peru the eighth biggest gold manufacturing country in the world.
The increase in gold output is a result of the effort of entrepreneurs and workers as well as the confidence of national and foreign investors, said Jaime Uranga, chairman of the National Mining, Oil, and Energy Society's Gold Committee.
He said that the country's investment policy on gold mining has been sustained and that some 480 million U.S. dollars have been put in.
The average gold prices dropped from 331.3 dollars per ounce last year to 294.4 dollars per ounce in 1998.
CARACAS, April 26 (Xinhua) --Toco diamond mine, at El Guaniamo, in the southeastern Venezuelan state of Bolivar, will start its commercial operations next year, with a forecast production of nearly 150,000 karats.
Toco consortium is owner of the mine, with 70 percent of the ownership in hands of Venezuelan and American investors, and the rest belonging to the Canadian Teck Corporation.
Toco officials were quoted on Wednesday by the media as saying that in next three years this mine's diamond production will reach between 600,000 and 700,000 karats, and will become Latin America' s second largest diamond mine, the first position being a similar mine in Canada.
In Toco there has been identified, the world's largest kimberlita -a kind of rock originated in Earth's depths containing diamonds- layer, will turn Venezuela into one of the world's largest diamond producers in a not too distant future.
About 50 percent of the bed is of industrial quality, and the rest is of gem value.
The world's diamond production is around 65 million karats a year.
Botswana has the world's largest mine with a production of 11.4 million karats.
BANGKOK, March 25 (Xinhua) --Peru, with its resurgent gold industry, is seeking investments from Thai entrepreneurs to develop its gold mining and fine jewelry manufacturing industries, according to Oscar Maurtua de Romana, the Peruvian ambassador to Thailand.
Peru will sharpen its promotional focus among Thai investors during the Second International Gold Symposium in Lima from May 7-10, Maurtua was quoted by today's Bangkok Post as saying.
The symposium will cover all aspects of gold mining, financing and technological processes.
It will be an ideal forum for Thai investors to find out the strong potential Peru offers, he said.
With abundant supplies of gold in Peru, Thai manufacturers could set up joint ventures there to produce jewelry, Maurtua said.
Thais would find even greater opportunities in gold mining, which has proved to be very profitable in recent years, and the recent conclusion of a bilateral agreement for protection of investments gave Thai investors another strong incentive to look at Peru, he said.
The agreement was signed by Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan during his visit to Peru in January.
LAS NUEVAS CLARITAS, Venezuela (AP) _ ``Guarico'' is lounging in a hammock near gigantic Amazonian gold deposits where he has spent 11 years searching for his jackpot.
But far from counting his riches, he's ticking off the days before he quits this one-time boom town that's going bust.
``I'm not doing anything.
I've been defeated,'' says the 25-year-old gold hunter.
The Amazon rain forests of eastern Venezuela used to be a place where a poor man with a pick and shovel could strike it rich _ or at least dream of it.
But now the government is chasing illegal miners off some of the best land to make way for international companies that have concessions to mine for gold.
That has environmentalists worried that miners are moving to untapped lands where they will leave more paths of destruction.
The miners ``may cause even worse damage if they aren't located in areas where they can be controlled,'' said Jorge Padron, head of the National Ecological and Social Union.
Thousands of miners flooded into the Imataca rain forest in the 1980s.
They searched for gold that over the centuries has attracted explorers like Sir Walter Raleigh, who sought the legendary golden city of ``El Dorado''.
In Imataca they built a frontier town called Las Claritas on top of what is believed to be the richest gold deposit in Latin America.
The town grew to 10,000 people, including entire families.
They came from as far as Colombia, Brazil and the Dominican Republic and built houses out of plastic sheets and wooden poles.
Each day they dug out rocks, put them into sacks and trudged to a mill where gold was separated from dirt.
Everyone had good days and bad.
Yet during the boom, miners earned as much as dlrs 5,000 a month at a time when the average worker in Venezuela made about dlrs 200.
At the center of Las Claritas they erected a statue of a miner with a pick in his hand and a dog at his side.
In their minds they were pioneers, like the men and women who conquered the Wild West in the United States.
But ecologists said the miners destroyed the environment with mercury and high-pressure water hoses used to uproot trees.
Government officials complained it was impossible to collect taxes or control the miners, whose village was rife with drugs, violence and prostitution.
Several years ago, authorities forced Las Claritas' residents to relocate a few miles (kilometers) away.
The new town _ Las Nuevas Claritas _ prospered at first.
But then the government sold rights to the prized mining site to Canada's Placer Dome and other mining companies.
Today, Las Nuevas Claritas is fading.
It used to boast a couple dozen ore mills.
Now there are two.
One of them, where Guarico works, used to operate 24 hours a day.
Now it cranks up no more than six hours.
The amount of gold sacks processed is down from 600 a day to 50.
The town's population has dwindled to 3,000.
Falling international gold prices have contributed to the hard times.
``Before it was a situation of bonanza.
There was lots of gold and it was easy,'' said miner Juan Tremeria.
``Now we have a situation where people are going hungry''.
Few miners have fortunes stashed away from gold's heyday.
Most blew their money on alcohol, prostitutes and wild parties in the remote jungle village, where goods were expensive.
The gold diggers, like the rest of Venezuela that was experiencing an oil boom, neglected to save for a rainy day.
Nowadays, a miner is lucky if he makes dlrs 400- dlrs 500 a month.
Officials say bringing in dozens of companies to the mining areas will provide thousands of jobs and decrease ecological damage.
The companies use sophisticated technology and will run programs to teach illegal miners better techniques, they argue.
Environmentalists contend the companies will overwhelm the forest.
And they question the government's claims about jobs and training programs.
Some miners are already heading to new sites not sold to the mining companies, such as the fragile areas around the river headwaters that feed the Guri Dam, one of the world's largest hydroelectric plants.
Padron and other environmentalists charge that National Guardsmen are collecting bribes from illegal miners to allow them to operate in the new areas.
Officials don't deny the allegation and say they are working to curb corruption.
The invasion of new territories may leave another ``disaster in the middle of the pristine forest,'' said Clemencia Rodner of the Audubon Society.
LIMA, May 11 (Xinhua) --A rich gold seam with estimated reserves of 16.8 million metric tons of mineral ore has been discovered in South America's biggest gold mine in Peru.
The U.S.
Newmont Mining Corporation and the Peruvian company Buenaventura have been jointly exploiting the Yanacocha gold mine in northwest Peru for the last two years.
The mine is already a major gold producer --output last year rose 15 per cent to 620,000 ounces.
Commercial exploitation of the new deposit could start after 1998, a company spokesman said after the completion of infrastructure, including a power generation plant and telecommunications system.
LIMA, April 19 (Xinhua) --Peru will rank seventh largest gold producer this year, an official from the Mining, Oil and Energy National Society said on Wednesday.
Peru's gold output will amount to 140 tons this year, up ten tons compared with that of last year, said Guillermo Albareda.
The output could sharply grow in a not too long period if the great potential of many gold projects under construction are taken into account, he added.
This year Peru's mining companies planned to invest over 350 million U.S. dollars to increase gold production.
"We are working in long-term investments as hard as we have worked during the last ten years," said Carlos Galvez, president of the Gold Committee and Chief Executive Officer of Buenaventura company.
In 1999, the exports of gold earned Peru about 1.2 billion dollars.
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 5 (Xinhua) --Brazil's diamond production picked up last year after a year in recession.
The output totaled 900,000 carats, mining experts said.
Diamond production in 1994 fell to 600,000 carats from the previous year's 1,000,000 carats.
But it grew by 300,000 carats last year, said geologist Paulo Dibeiro de Santana, from the Mining Department.
Brazil's diamond production ranks seventh in the world.
OTTAWA, June 13 (Xinhua) --Canada's Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation and Gold Fields Limited in South Africa announced their merger plan Tuesday for the creation of the world's third largest gold producer valued at 3.7 billion U.S. dollars.
Under the share-swap plan, shareholders of Johannesburg-based Gold Fields will receive 0.35 share of Franco-Nevada for each Gold Fields common share.
The new company, with its headquarters office to be based in Toronto and the executive office in Johannesburg, will have an annual production of 4.4 million ounces of gold.
Franco-Nevada is the fifth largest gold company in the world, while Gold Fields ranks second among gold producers in South Africa and is one of the largest in the world.
The two companies will call a shareholder meeting in August before an effective merger date is set in September.
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The National Guard sprayed tear gas and shot rubber bullets Wednesday at a group of Indians protesting the construction of a high-voltage electricity line in the Amazon jungle.
The Indians said three of their members were hospitalized with injuries, a version denied by the National Guard.
About 350 members of the Pemon tribe in southern Bolivar state occupied the site where crews planned to begin erecting an electricity tower Wednesday.
Within hours, national guardsmen arrived and ``attacked the community,'' said Jose Luis Gonzalez, head of the state's Indigenous Federation.
Gonzalez said the three victims included 13-year-old Orangel Pulido, who he said suffered eye damage when a tear-gas bomb exploded in his face.
Gen. Pedro Zambrano, state leader of the National Guard, told The Associated Press that ``we cannot speak of injuries''.
But he did confirm ``there were some shots of rubber bullets and tear gas bombs were used''.
For the past month, the Pemon tribe has been trying to block the 300-mile (480-kilometer) power line's construction, saying it will damage the environment by supplying electricity to gold mining companies that want to set up operations in the Imataca rain forest.
LIMA, Peru (AP) --The Peruvian government fined Latin America's largest gold mine $500,000 for a mercury spill in June that poisoned dozens of Andean villagers.
The fine was announced Tuesday in a legal notice in the government's official newspaper, El Peruano.
Officials from the Yanacocha gold mine had already pledged to pay all costs for medical treatment and environmental cleanup.
Company officials last month cited 70 confirmed cases of mercury contamination.
A local midwife was the only person to fall gravely ill, lapsing into a coma, said Andres Vargas, associate director of the Regional Hospital of Cajamarca, 350 miles north of the capital, Lima.
On June 2, a truck carrying mercury from the Yanacocha gold mine spilled about 3 gallons of the toxic liquid metal in the village of Choropampa, according to the Newmont Mining Company of Denver, which has a 51.4 percent stake in the operation.
The mercury leaked onto a road near the village, 53 miles southwest of the mine, while it was being transported by a private trucking firm, the company said.
The mercury, a byproduct of the mining operation, is sold to a Lima-based firm that uses it for medical equipment.
SANTIAGO, May 30 (Xinhua) --Chile's mining output registered an increase of 10 percent in April this year compared with the same period of 1999, the National Institute of Statistics said Tuesday.
In the first four months this year, the mining production grew by 5.7 percent from a year earlier.
In April, gold production was up 19.5 percent while that of silver up 21.7 percent.
CARACAS, November 14 (Xinhua) --Venezuela's gold production is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years thanks to massive investment growth by national and foreign private investors, the Energy and Mines Ministry said on Saturday.
Venezuela is expected to attract between 1999 and 2003 4.4 billion U.S. dollars in private capital to boost the mining of gold, coal, iron, nickel and bauxite.
To encourage investment, the government plans, among other incentives, to cut the current minimum income tax rate of 34 percent by 20 percent.
The ministry estimated that out of the 4.4 billion-dollar investment, 2.04 billion dollars, which will mainly take the form of strategic associations with foreign companies, will be used to raise the country's annual gold output to more than 33 tons after the year 2003.
Venezuela's gold output varies between 1.0 and 1.2 tons a year.
Its gold ore reserves are estimated at 10,000 to 12,000 tons, representing 10 percent of the world's total.
Venezuela boasts approximately 3 million hectares of land with gold prospection potentials, of which about 1.5 million hectares have already been assigned.
LIMA, February 2 (Xinhua) --Peru's mining production is expected to increase by 7 to 8 percent in 1996 if international metal prices are stable, Peruvian mining industry sources said today.
Peru's copper output in 1995 was 480,000 tons and its copper export earned 800 million U.S. dollars.
Gold production in 1995 stood at between 53 and 55 tons, and gold export amounted to 600 million dollars last year.
The sources forecast that gold output in Peru, which is rich in mineral resources, will be more than 65 tons in 1996 due to an investment of 26 million dollars in gold projects in the San Jose de Yanacocha and Retamas zones.
MEXICO CITY, June 18 (Xinhua) --The following are major economic news briefs from Latin America over the past few days: Gold Production in Mexico Increases 46 Percent MEXICO -- Gold production in Mexico reached 20.3 tons in 1995, a 46 percent increase compared with 13.9 tons in 1994 in spite of a drop in world market prices, representative of the World Gold Council Nora Jaime Trevino said.
The increase in gold production, which put Mexico in the 17th place worldwide, was due to an increase in demand for exports and to the investments that were made during the past two years in the mining industry, mainly in the north of the country.
6.7 Million Quintals of Rice to Be Harvested In Panama PANAMA CITY --Panama will harvest this 1995-96 agricultural season a total of 6.7 million quintals of paddy rice, a 7.38 percent increase over the last growing season, a document of the Agricultural Development Ministry said.
In May, Panama had a harvest of 6.6 million quintals of paddy rice on 70,328 hectares out of a total of 71,304 hectares cultivated in the country.
The average yield of rice per hectare for this agricultural year will reach 94.13 quintals, 6.53 quintals more than last year.
Foreign Investment in Venezuela Drops in May CARACAS --Foreign direct investment in Venezuela reached 9.1 million U.S. dollars in May, a 82 percent drop compared with the previous month.
During the first five months, foreign investment in this country reached 137 million dollars.
Japan was the biggest investor with 53.1 million dollars, followed by the Cayman Islands with 20 million dollars, the United States with 13.7 million dollars and France with 11.8 million dollars.
BP Increases Investments in Venezuela CARACAS --The British Petroleum Company (BP) will invest 1 billion dollars over the next few years in Venezuela to activate its oil and gas exploration and exploitation programs in the country.
Investments by the British Petroleum company have risen to 250 million dollars so far this year and are expected to reach 300 million dollars by the end of the year.
Mexican Oil Reserves Reach 49 Billion Barrels MEXICO CITY --Mexico's reserves of crude petroleum reached 49.775 billion barrels in January, which put Mexico in eighth place worldwide, figures from the Federal Energy Commission showed.
The reserves of Mexican crude oil will be sufficient to meet national demand during the next 50 years if current levels of consumption remain unchanged, analysts from energy department said.
Foreign Investment in Peru LIMA --Foreign investment in Peru reached 5.6 billion dollars by the end of May, the National Commission on Foreign Investment said.
Spain is the biggest investor, accounting for 40.6 percent of the total.
Investments in the economic sector stood at 35.6 percent in communications, 17.4 percent in mining, 5.1 percent in energy and 13.2 percent for industry while 10.6 percent went to the financial sector and 4.7 percent to commerce.
EL DORADO, Venezuela (AP) _ The Pemon Indians rolled a huge log across the highway to block traffic.
The tribe, some dressed in red loin cloths and their faces streaked with paint, was defending its piece of paradise.
Tensions are rising in Venezuela's Amazon rain forests, where Indians and environmentalists are clashing with mining companies and government officials who want to exploit some of the richest gold deposits in Latin America and build towns and tourist hotels in the wilderness.
Rapid economic development ``is going to mean the death of the jungles and of the indigenous people,'' said Pemon leader Jose Luis Gonzalez.
Workers with chain saws and bulldozers recently started cutting a swath through the forest in southeastern Venezuela for a 470-mile (750 kms) high-voltage electricity line that will be the lifeline of the projects.
During the last two weeks, about 400 Indians trying to stop the line periodically blocked traffic on a highway used by construction crews as national guardsmen stood by in riot gear.
The dlrs 110 million line is to provide hydroelectric power to northern Brazil, remote communities in eastern Venezuela and scores of gold mining companies eager to work the pristine Imataca rain forest reserve.
They're being drawn by gold deposits thought to be worth billions of dollars and that over the centuries have attracted explorers such as Sir Walter Raleigh looking for the legendary golden city of ``El Dorado''.
Last year, President Rafael Caldera authorized large-scale logging and gold and diamond mining in nearly half of Imataca.
The 9 million acre (3.6 million-hectare) reserve _ twice the size of Switzerland _ sits in southern Bolivar state and boasts a variety of wildlife that few places in the world can match: jaguars, pumas, red howler monkeys, bearded bluebells, neon-colored butterflies and the world's largest eagle, the endangered harpy.
Imataca ``is one of the most gorgeous endemic forests I've ever seen,'' said Mary Lou Goodwin of the Audubon Society in Venezuela.
Nature lovers and scientists from around the world come to visit it.
The power line also will slice through Canaima National Park, one of about 100 U.N.-designated World Heritage Sites.
The park is home to the mysterious flat-topped mountains that inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic adventure story ``The Lost World''.
Government officials see the region as a vast untapped source of wealth that could help alleviate the poverty that afflicts more than half of Venezuela's population.
Thousands of jobs would be created through projects including a proposed 500-room hotel to be built on sacred Pemon lands in Canaima.
Authorities deny their plans will wreak widespread environmental and cultural destruction.
They contend the damage should actually decrease since large companies will help control thousands of illegal miners who poison rivers with mercury, knock down trees with high-pressure water hoses and create lawless boom towns rife with drugs, prostitution and violence.
``There are a lot of unfounded fears,'' said the Environmental Ministry's Santos Carrasco.
Environmentalists and Indians say they aren't opposed to all development in the jungles, but the government plan is too much, too fast, and officials won't properly regulate the mining and logging companies.
Bringing large-scale development to still mostly unexplored Imataca is ``sort of like destroying a treasure chest before you even know what you're destroying,'' said Atossa Soltani of California-based Amazon Watch.
Bulldozers already have leveled some of the Indians' yucca, corn, banana and pineapple crops.
The Pemons and three other tribes say they plan to keep shutting down the highway until the government halts the electricity project.
They also want officials to overturn last year's mining and logging decree, grant them title to what they say are millions of acres of their ancestral lands and recognize their right to decide the future of the region.
Pemon leader Lloyd Henrito said, ``We're the owners of this land.
We were here before Colombus, but in the eyes of the Venezuelan government we are nothing.''
SAN JOSE, October 24 (Xinhua) --The Central American countries and Canada signed here today an agreement on rules for a clear environment for the mining industry in Central America.
A communique issued afterwards said that in the future both the Central American countries and Canada will take into account the need of sustainable development when developing their mining industry.
Several Canadian firms have shown interest in investing in mining activities in Costa Rica and other Central American countries, mainly in gold exploitation.
But such projects have met opposition because of the undesirable effect they could have on environment.
``Just one Clinton joke,'' a man in the audience called out when Jerry Seinfeld appeared for his encore after the second show on Wednesday, opening night of his brief run of stand-up performances on Broadway.
It says everything about his humor that the only topical joke came by request, and even then it wasn't a genuine Clinton joke.
He veered smoothly away from politics into typical Seinfeld territory, wryly observing the manners and absurdities of contemporary life.
``Everyone lies about sex,'' he said.
``People lie &UR; during &LR; sex.

Those jokes were recycled from a news conference promoting the live telecast of this show (Sunday night 9 on HBO), but no matter.
Freshness is precisely not the point of ``Jerry Seinfeld: `I'm Telling You For the Last Time' _ Live on Broadway''.
Looking backward is.
New York is the last stop and Sunday's live television show the final performance in a two-month world tour.
That amounts to a farewell tour for this material, which Seinfeld has said he will retire.
These Broadway performances hold no clue to his future, but they say a lot about his past.
He comes full circle here, back to the stand-up routines that inspired his phenomenally successful sitcom.
He did, after all, play a stand-up comic named Jerry Seinfeld in the series, and in its early years each episode began and ended with sitcom Jerry offering a snippet of his act.
On Broadway, that act has a familiar but still funny feel, with material long-honed and often recognizable from the series, talk show appearances and his best-selling book ``Seinlanguage''.
In Australia, he visited the great Barrier Reef ; in Iceland, he worked the word Reykjavikians into the routine; in Des Moines, Iowa, he gave away all the tickets.
Most shows on the tour sold out; some didn't.
But New York is home, the audience was primed to adore him, and all he really had to do was show up.
He did more.
Relaxed, with impeccable timing, he gave a warm but controlled, hour-long performance built on small, shrewdly targeted observations.
And now that the cloud of hype that covered the final ``Seinfeld'' episode is receding, the performance highlights why he became immensely popular in the first place and how influential his style of stand-up has become.
He began with a line only New Yorkers could love, in language so purely Seinfeld that it can only be a self-reference: ``So what's with the cabbies and the b.o''.?
He went on to talk about the lunacy of astronauts taking a car to the moon, and the instructions given by flight attendents: ``They show you how to use a seatbelt in case you haven't been in a car since 1965''.
There is little danger of giving away the best jokes, because he has already given away so many himself.
It is nearly impossible to give away the punchlines because the essence of his style is that he has none.
``Tell you what I like about Chinese people, they're hanging in there with the chopsticks,'' he says, even though, ``They've seen the fork''.
In a dark suit and tie, stand-up Jerry is better dressed than sitcom Jerry ever was.
And he makes more funny faces.
He imitated a turtle making change, offered the voice of a sarcastic horse, as well as the pinched face of a neighbor's pet monkey.
``That's the look you have on your face when you're that close to being the dominant species on the planet and you didn't make it''.
He interacted with the audience just enough to seem warm, but not so much that he lost control.
To someone who threw a business card with a scribbled note on stage he said: ``No, I'm not going to read it.
I'm busy''!
Scads of comedians are now doing what Seinfeld made popular, relying on dry observations rather than jokey punch lines.
His opening act on Broadway (there will be none for the HBO show), the comedian Kevin Meaney, whipped the audience up with a frenetic energy that semeed conspicuously old-fashioned next to the cool Seinfeld style, even though Meaney's routine came with deliberately retro touches, such as his maroon jacket and bow tie, and a routine in which he pretends to sing a duet with Frank Sinatra.
Though Seinfeld has his routine down, each performance varies a bit, so Sunday's televised show is not entirely predictable.
The HBO show will include a brief filmed opening with Seinfeld and unannounced guests (not from the cast of ``Seinfeld'').
On stage, he said of the HBO special: ``It's live.
When I screw up, you see it''.
He's not likely to flub such a well-crafted routine, though it's just as well that he's putting the material out to pasture.
After these long Seinfeld goodbyes, it's time for something new, maybe even risky.
One of the funniest recent Seinfeld appearances comes in a promo for Sunday's show, in which he pretends to have taken up painting as his next career.
He splashes cans of paint wildy on a canvas while a proper visitor, played by Marian Seldes, asks whether he'll go back to stand-up if the art thing doesn't work out.
``How could it not work out''? he wonders.
He looks goofily pleased with himself, with a wild-eyed glimpse of inspiration at the thought of something new.
It may be a goof, but it holds promise.

&UR; &LR; NEW YORK _ Jerry Seinfeld, the star of one of the most succesful shows in television history, says he'll never do another situation comedy.
``I can't imagine doing another one.
Only an idiot would think they could do better,'' said Seinfeld, during a press conference Tuesday, promoting his Sunday night live (9 p.m).
HBO special, ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time''.
Wearing white slacks with a navy polo shirt under a gray jacket, the 44-year-old comedian joked and jostled with the media over subjects ranging from sex to money.
While Seinfeld says he misses some of the things about the ending of the phenomenal run of ``Seinfeld'' after 140 episodes, he's relieved it's over.
``Did you ever take a dog to the park and take his leash off,'' he asked asked rhetorically.
``The dog looks up for a minute then bolts like a maniac''.
Accompanied by by HBO's Marty Callner, who will be directing the special live, Seinfeld explained that returning to stand-up was liberating.
For nine years he worked on a show with 100 crew members, a dozen writers, and the cast.
``That was very much a group thing,'' he said.
``Now I feel like the leash is off''.
He has no plans to take a vacation.
``I've been on beaches,'' he said.
``I've been on boats''.
Then he shrugged his shoulders.
While Seinfeld is not retiring from stand-up, he is retiring all the material from Sunday night's program.
``You'll never hear these jokes again,'' he promised.
He's planning to work on another special, presumably for HBO, during the next eight months, and put out a comedy album based on Sunday's performance.
Tickets for the concert at the Broadhurst Theater are hot.
The New York Attorney General's office is investigating ticket scalping.
The going street rate for a ticket is $1,500, nearly 20 times the face value.
Seinfeld is donating all of the proceeds from the concert to PENCIL (Public Education Needs Civic Involvement in Learning).
``I didn't invent scalping, '' he said, pausing just long enough for everyone to realize the absurdity of the situation.
``I don't really have any control over it''.
While ``Seinfeld'' will never be considered controversial, the show did run into trouble with an episode in which Kramer accidentally set a Puerto Rican flag on fire.
``I liked that episode,'' said Seinfeld.
``People forget that in that episode Kramer was really looking forward to the Puerto Rican Day parade and that the whole thing was an accident''.
When asked if the protest of the episode by some Puerto Ricans was legitimate or a politically correct over-reaction, Seinfeld raised his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders.
While Seinfeld said that he doesn't have a favorite episode, he did recall with great affection the one in which he mugs an elderly woman for her loaf of marble rye.
``They brought in snow and we had snowball fights at five in the morning, and I was trying to throw a loaf of rye bread up to the fourth floor,'' he said.
``It was just fun''.
Seinfeld refused to confirm the rumors that cast members from the show, particularly Jason Alexander, might appear for his HBO special.
``If I named who might come, it wouldn't be a suprise,'' he said.
``How can there be suprise guests if there are no suprises''?
Other Seinfeld observations: On fame: ``I've been anonymous.
Being famous is better''.
On Monica Lewinsky and President Clinton: ``Everyone lies about sex.
Truth and sex don't go together.
Everyone lies during sex, so truth just isn't going to happen.''
BRANSON, Mo.
(AP) --Jerry Seinfeld is collecting new material Jack Kerouac-style by driving across the country?
Get out!
Seinfeld was en route from New York to Albuquerque, N.M., in a 1973 Volkswagen Beetle this week when he decided to pull into this country music town to see an old friend and collect on a gold mine of potential material.
On Tuesday, Seinfeld took in a show at the Bobby Vinton Theater.
Seinfeld and Vinton used to play in Las Vegas at the same time, said Chris Vinton, the pop singer's son.
Seinfeld ''said he was really excited about being in Branson and was somewhat overwhelmed by it and surprised by how sophisticated the facilities are,'' Chris Vinton said.
BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) --Television viewers still in withdrawal over the end of ``Seinfeld'' could have gotten a quick fix -- in Romania.
The hugely successful American sitcom also is this nation's most popular comedy program, and private station ProTV aired a five-hour special Sunday to mark more than a year of broadcasting the show.
Twelve people competed as lookalikes of the Seinfeld characters Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer.
One, a 31-year-old sketch artist, won a trip to New York for his resemblance to Jerry Seinfeld.
Seinfeld's jokes have struck Romanians' funnybones.
Friends often gather to watch the show and many of the expressions, including the famous ``yada yada yada,'' have become hip.
``Seinfeld's kind of humor is different.
It's for people with brains and I consider it the best comedy show ever made,'' said Ilie Vornicu, 24, a geology student.
That pretty much sums up Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm.
The one-hour special contains some laugh-out-loud moments but also some long stretches of humor-free aridness.
One crucial difference: Curb Your Enthusiasm violates half of David's famous no-hugging, no-learning rule of television.
``There was some hugging at the end of the show,'' David said in a conference call.
``It was as insincere as you could get.
Insin cere hugging is al lowed''.
Although David, who penned some of Seinfeld's most darkly brilliant ep isodes, is more or less the model for George Costanza, he is also a former stand-up comedian himself.
He hadn't performed onstage for 10 years and mentioned to a friend that he was thinking about giv ing it another shot.
``He said, `You should film it,' '' David said.
``Like everything else, I was reluctant at first.
The more people I asked about it, everyone seemed to think it was a good idea.
I thought it was a way to motivate me to get on stage''.
However, he wasn't interested in the standard film-the-comedian-telling-jokes format.
``I wanted to do something different,'' he said, ``rather than the straight stand-up show.
Then, I started to think I needed some other stuff in there, what we were going to do offstage.
We couldn't just follow me around the supermarket shopping, so I had to come up with some stuff''.
``Some stuff' wound up being about 90 per cent of the show, with the stand-up routines in New York and LA only a small part (a ratio close to the early episodes of Seinfeld as well).
Curb Your Enthusiasm turned out to be mostly a mock LA documentary _ totally unscripted _ about David's return to stand-up.
``It's not totally mock,'' David said, stressing that revealing just what is real and what isn't would spoil the fun for viewers.
``Certainly, the stand-up is real.
I would say that there are elements in there that are real.
Most of it's embellished, but some of it's real''.
Part of the genuineness, David said, is his person ality.
``It's not that much of a character,'' he said of the Larry David we see on-screen.
``I'm not re ally stretching there.
That's pretty much who I am''.
That Larry David wanders around a good bit, mumbling about life and its foibles, sounding remarkably like a certain bespectacled, balding, chunky, self-proclaimed loser from a late, great hit TV series.
``I really resent that `who's call ing'?
'' he says while making a phone call.
``Like some people are good enough to make the cut''.
Jason Alexander, who played George on Seinfeld, makes an ap pearance, commenting on David.
So does Jerry himself, who relates that during his early stand-up days, Da vid referred to the audience as ``you people''.
Other comedians show up, as well, including Richard Lewis.
``He was a phenomenon,'' Lewis says of David.
``He just couldn't get over the hump that comedians have to perform in front of other people''.
David called his stand-up career ``the epitome of a love-hate rela tionship''.
``It's the kind of thing where you walk around at times when it's not going well, you blame it on the au dience,'' he said.
``You think the whole world must be stupid or you stink and have no talent.
``When it's going well, you think that you're the greatest thing on two feet and everybody's brilliant.
.. . It's very extreme thinking''.
Part of the special concerns other comics telling David how the clubs have changed in the 10 years since he has been onstage.
Of course, David's life has changed as well.
Seinfeld has made him a wealthy man, in deed.
But that's the only change, he said.
``I'm pretty much the same, but I can get dental work in my house now,'' he said.
``That's the difference''.
David left Seinfeld after the infa mous season-ending episode in which George's fiancee dies after licking bargain-basement envelopes, and the show lost its dark New York heart, which made it so funny.
He famously returned for the series-ending show, which managed to combine excessive hype and mini mal laughs for one of TV's biggest flops.
David naturally begs to differ.
``I couldn't be more pleased with it,'' he said of the final episode.
``First of all, the fact that so many people didn't like it?
I loved that.
It accomplished everything I think a finale should accomplish''.
Then he must be delighted with Curb Your Enthusiasm, because it's far funnier than Seinfeld's finale.
Then again, how could it not be?

PASADENA, Calif.
_ Phil Morris must have found the whole thing professionally unsettling or, at least, personally amusing.
One moment he's a B-list actor whose last TV credit was The Love Boat: The Next Wave on a D-list network.
The next, he's resurrecting his recurring Seinfeld character, a trigger-happy lawyer named Jackie Chiles, to star in an NBC sitcom executive-produced by Jerry Seinfeld and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David.
And slated for 8:30 Thursday nights, no less.
Reporters who normally scurry by Morris en route to a higher-grade celebrity are sticking tape recorders in his face and clamoring for more specifics concerning the big announcement that's really no announcement at all.
Says Morris, as a joke, I hope: ``This whole thing could be wrapped up by the time I make it home''.
He's referring to his pretentiously sordid profession, a business in which the art of the deal can be something of a bizarre art form in itself.
That no matter how much talent you have, or how decorative a resume you possess, you're only as valuable as you're perceived to be.
Read on and this might make sense yet.
Morris hasn't signed anything for anyone.
In fact, he hasn't even met formally with Seinfeld or David or NBC about a comedy series based on the wacky attorney, last seen as a rather funny punch line in a Honda TV ad.
Yet as newspapers ran the item, entertainment television picked up the story.
And as one cable executive said while reading the blurb in the Los Angeles Times, under the heading ``Seinfeld Spin-off?,'' ``If they hadn't made a deal, they're probably in serious talks by now''.
This reminds me of the 1989 film The Big Picture, in which a young filmmaker, depressed by his inability to find work, spends an afternoon driving around with his girlfriend and, in the space of a few hours, becomes the hottest director in town.
Why? Because he didn't return phone calls.
Not because he's juggling the many deals pouring in, but because he was simply unavailable.
Morris might be experiencing a similar snowball effect.
He was part of a news conference promoting a movie for Black Entertainment Television when asked about the lack of minority characters who toiled on Seinfeld.
Seeing that the Jackie Chiles character is the only one to resurface since the comedy ended, Morris was merely pointing out the irony of it all: that the first and perhaps only spinoff of a series constantly attacked for its lack of minority characters could, would, should be fronted by the show's lone black character.
Journalists pounced on the just-kinda-thinking-aloud comment, and before long the news was making the rounds as though it had a life of its own.
Which, of course, it did.
In understanding this, we have to remember that a disdain for truth in labeling seems to be par for the course in this company town, and though there are certainly talented people working and creating here, it's by and large a place of style without content and progression without talent.
It's so backward that it's a wonder the talented ever get their share of the pie.
For example: Despite his striking leading-man looks and effortless acting style, Jessie Martin was struggling until David E.
Kelley cast him in a handful of episodes of Ally McBeal playing Ally's (Calista Flockhart's) love interest.
Martin's buzz came not during his episodes but after his character returned after being written out.
Sensing that audience reaction convinced Kelley to bring Martin back, networks started falling over themselves to sign the actor to development deals.
Fox seemingly had the inside track, but once Benjamin Bratt exited Dick Wolf's Law &AMP; Order, NBC came up with the best offer: a key spot on a stable, creatively satisfying series.
Then there's Tea Leoni, a former ``it'' girl who came to our attention as the good-time girl in the Fox comedy Flying Blind and nearly immediately landed in the disastrous The Naked Truth.
She's now out of TV.
Jenna Elfman's similar tale had a more positive result.
She was jobless after the Molly Ringwald-led sitcom Townies, in which she co-starred, flopped.
But not for long.
This could be debated, but it seems Elfman raised her stature when, during a promotional party for ABC stars, she leapt on the stage at the House of Blues and danced, if you want to call it that.
Shortly after that, the statuesque, slinky Elfman became a hot commodity _ and ABC gave her a sitcom, Dharma &AMP; Greg.
Will Morris actually do a sitcom based on Jackie Chiles?
The wait will be interesting.
Or did his comments have about as much validity as the cabbie who tried to convince me that CBS is sitting on a sitcom script of his, one about a taxi driver and the wacky people who parade in and out of his back seat?
My advice?
Don't return phone calls.

Depressed that there's no more ``Seinfeld''?
Don't fret: An herbal medicine man is offering free Saint Johnswort to help addicts through the depression he expects to come with Seinfeld-less Thursday nights.
``As-Funny-as-Seinfeld Kits'' include a month's supply of Saint Johnswort and a list of 25 names that rhyme with female body parts.
The kits have been created as ``a contribution to the improvement of society as a whole,'' says Ken Hakuta, creator and CEO of AllHerb.com.
Fans of ``the show about nothing'' can feel as good as they did when Seinfeld was on the air, and it's all free, Hakuta says.
His new Web site, AllHerb.com, is being launched to offer consumers a comprehensive herbal education, he says.
Industry experts will offer health tips, news and feature articles, as well as a mail-order supply of many herbal products.
``This is a fun way to show the application of natural herbal supplements,'' Hakuta says of the Seinfeld kits.
``What we are demonstrating here is that natural products can have very positive influence on our moods and our health.
Herbs help us feel good''.
Viewers can leave an e-mail message saying absolutely nothing on AllHerb.com's Seinfeld message board; they can also send absolutely nothing (except a clear return address) via regular mail to ``As-Funny-as-Seinfeld Kit,'' Jericho Communications, 304 Hudson St.
, Suite 700, New York, NY 10013.
Delivery will take a couple of weeks, a company spokeswoman says.
The kit, when taken in combination with any of the non-Seinfeld situation comedies in the new fall lineup, is intended to induce about the same level of enjoyment and happiness that we all received from Jerry and friends for the past decade, according to the company.
Warning: The kit should not be taken with an empty remote control...
or without the consent of your doctor.

SEINFELD-BROADWAY (New York) _ Jerry Seinfeld, who drew inspiration for his wildly popular show from the idiosyncrasies of New Yorkers, brings his act back to New York City, returning to his stand-up roots in a performance at the Broadhurst Theater.

PASADENA, Calif.
_ Actor Michael Richards is reed thin.
Actor John Goodman is not.
But the two have something very much in common: Each has a new sitcom on the fall schedule, and neither had much to bring to show-and-tell at the TV critics' press tour in Pasadena.
After shooting pilot episodes, each has scrapped the first draft and gone back to the drawing board.
Richards, who will play private detective Vic Nardozza in ``The Michael Richards Show'' on NBC, is still casting the series after he and his co-producers, all former ``Seinfeld'' writers, decided it should be an ensemble effort instead of a star-driven comedy.
Tim Meadows is leaving ``Saturday Night Live'' to join the cast.
William Devane is also on board.
Goodman, whose show for Fox remains untitled, will play William ``Butch'' Gamble Jr.
, a gay man who returns to his hometown in Ohio, where his adult son and ex-wife still live.
Aside from the son, to be played by Greg Pitts, the Goodman show is still casting about for the ex-wife, as well as for Butch's sister and her two children.
Though it's not unprecedented for a show to be pilotless in July, it's often not a good sign.
Fall-series production begins just about now, so a show that's still trying to decide what it wants to be has only a few weeks to set a course.
Fortunately, the fall season is late this year because of the summer Olympics, pushing the premiere of Richards' show into October at the earliest.
Goodman's will be even later _ Nov.
1 _ because of Fox's commitment to the World Series.
Richards, whose private persona is completely unlike the manic Kramer he played on ``Seinfeld,'' seemed almost apologetic when he asked critics to be patient.
``I'd like to say just stick with us.
We're working hard here, and I think you'll see something quite special this fall''.
Goodman, meanwhile, remains ever sarcastic, with nary a clue about what producers Bonnie and Terry Turner have in mind.
``I'm right now kind of a hired-gun guy,'' he said.
``I'm waiting to see how it shapes up before I start screwing up''.
As they say in TV, stay tuned.
Olympia, Wash.
, native Sonja Christopher, the first contestant to be voted off the island in ``Survivor,'' is a little dismayed by what she experienced in her short time on Pulau Tiga in the South China Sea and by what she has seen of the program on TV.
``I feel I'm a little naive,'' she confessed.
``I don't know whether it's the younger generation or certain people in my tribe or whatever, but I didn't do the `outwit' part of it very well.
I didn't even think of it''.
Christopher, who is 63, was referring to the three basic tenets of ``Survivor'': to outwit, outplay and outlast the competition.
Troubled by the creation of power alliances on the island and outright deception by at least two contestants when asked if such alliances exist, she looked at producer Mark Burnett and said: ``I hope the program doesn't teach the young people in America that the way to win is to be duplicitous and dishonest.
That's a concern of mine.''
ALBANY, N.Y.
_ Jerry, thanks for the laughs, the memories and all the goodbyes.
Now, go away.
Missing Jerry Seinfeld is hard, and not because ``Seinfeld'' has left the air after nine glorious seasons (well, seven glorious, one all right and one pretty average seasons).
It's difficult to have withdrawal when he is still around so much.
Jerry is becoming like your favorite uncle who came to visit for a week and has been living on the couch since last spring.
Look, it's Jerry on a commercial!
Wow, Jerry is on a magazine cover!
Jerry is guest-announcing a Mets game!
And, hey, Jerry is on world tour and giving tickets away!
Now he's returning to his roots: New York and stand-up comedy.
His 10-show run at Broadway's Broadhurst Theater mercifully titled ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time'' is highlighted by a live telecast airing Sunday at 9 p.m.
Eastern on HBO.
Reviews of his previous shows have been positive, even though Seinfeld is a decade removed from his stand-up career.
So touring in Australia and Europe and across the United States is what one would consider retirement?
``Stand-up for me is not like work,'' Seinfeld said this week at a New York City news conference.
``It is a very liberating type of performance.
Putting on a weekly TV show is very complicated.
``Stand-up was the best way for me to feel free and feel relaxed.
To be in front of the audience is the most fun I can have''.
When Seinfeld (who first appeared on HBO 17 years ago as part of a series of young comedians, and last was seen on there in 1987 in a stand-up show) says ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time,'' he means it.
The material he will use _ observations of the arcane and sublime borne from his original stand-up act and perfected on his NBC show _ will be retired after the show.
``I will never do any of these jokes ever again,'' he vows.
Thank God.
In many ways, Jerry Seinfeld's last season on NBC was like the last season for Hall of Famer Willie Mays: both stayed around one year too long, and were shadows of their former selves.
Unlike Mays, Seinfeld can retool and recast himself.
After the Broadway show, Seinfeld will look to develop fresh material.
``Did you ever notice ''... could be replaced by something else.
What, even he doesn't know.
``It will probably take eight months to a year, I would say, before I'm ready to do another concert...
depending how hard I work,'' he said.
It's strange: I liked ``Seinfeld'' when a lot of people weren't watching, and grew to detest it proportionally to its popularity.
The hype had a lot to do with it.
And while many considered the last episode (watched by more than 76 million on May 14) lame by ``Seinfeld'' standards, you had to respect him for avoiding the cliched hankies-and-hugs route.
``Criticism is always fair,'' he said.
``What people forget is, it's unimportant''.
Thanks. And ouch.
After this concert series, Seinfeld plans to kick back, work on the new routine, maybe even go into the creative side of the advertising business.
He definitely has the schtick to sell.
What he won't be doing is doing movies or another series.
Jerry is nothing if not smart: He knows he could never be that lucky twice.
When asked who would replace him on the cultural radar screen, Seinfeld paused, then deadpanned.
``I have bad news for you,'' he said.
``There will be no next Seinfeld''.
Yes, there was only one Jerry.
Now get out of here for a while so we can miss you.

LOS ANGELES _ During a press conference Tuesday, Jerry Seinfeld was asked what it was like to end the run of his hit comedy series.
``Do you ever take a dog into the park and take his leash off, and he kind of looks up at you for a second and then just bolts like a maniac''? he asked.
``Something like that''.
Seinfeld has vowed that he won't do another TV series, but before he bolts off again, he is going to perform, one final time, the stand-up comedy act he developed throughout his career.
Tonight, Seinfeld is going to bury the act with a live HBO special called ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time''.
(It's tape delayed on the West Coast).
The comedian has vowed that after tonight's performance he would ``never do any of these jokes again,'' and said he plans to start working on an all-new act, though it may take eight months to a year, ``depending on how hard I work''.
In the last few weeks, Seinfeld has been polishing his show on a tour that has taken him to the likes of Iceland, Australia, England, Kansas City and Des Moines.
He made an unpublicized appearance at the Comedy &AMP; Magic Club in Hermosa Beach a few weeks ago.
On Wednesday, he began a 10-performance run at the Broadhurst Theatre on Broadway that ends with tonight's show.
As for why he decided to tour rather than take some time off, Seinfeld said it was much more appealing than the usual vacation.
``To be in front of an audience is the most fun I can have,'' he said.
``I've been on beaches.
I've been on boats.
It's pleasant, but it's not really a lot of fun''.
Seinfeld is clearly enjoying himself on this tour,and performing before his hometown crowd in New York City is especially rewarding.
``New York audiences have always been the best for me, because humor is really a New York invention, as far as I'm concerned,'' he said.
Seinfeld isn't likely to pull any surprises tonight, though reports say the material varies slightly from show to show.
He is at heart a Borscht Belt-style stand-up comedian who polishes his material to a brilliant shine; his strength is wry, witty observations.
You'll see no wild, raw improv antics a la Robin Williams.
Neither will he go into a prolonged character, as Billy Crystal or Whoopi Goldberg do in their acts.
Seinfeld is most comfortable being himself.
He did, as you remember, play a character for nine years named Jerry Seinfeld on his hit series.
The comedian's schtick, for the most part, is his puzzlement and amusement over the absurdities of modern life.
And his look at the end of a joke, which combines a slight bewilderment at the ridiculousness of a situation along with a bit of smug superiority because he's aware of it, is what endears him to audiences who feel the same way.
(``Oh yeah,'' you're thinking as you're laughing, ``I noticed that'').
The reviews of the tour and the Broadway performances have been mostly positive.
And even if the material is likely to be familiar to fans, it isn't likely to stop anyone from laughing.
One Midwest critic started off by carping that a better title for the concert would be ``Don't Stop Me If You've Heard This One,'' but throughout the rest of the review repeated a lot of the show's jokes (we won't do that) and talked about how much the audience enjoyed itself.
Makes sense.
``Seinfeld'' reruns in syndication do handsomely.
Good jokes, after all, are hard to find, which makes tonight's show, if Seinfeld keeps his promise, a keeper for anyone with a VCR.
(It will be repeated at 9:30 p.m.
Sept. 12).
For those of you who don't, the material will also be included on his upcoming Universal Records album of the same name.
Oh, by the way, one of the people watching those syndicated reruns is Seinfeld himself.
``I thought they were very funny, the ones that I saw,'' he said.
``I found them very, very entertaining.
I was upset that the show went off the air when I saw them.''
LOS ANGELES _ To Jerry's credit, he never censored anything,'' said Larry David, the co-creator and executive producer of ``Seinfeld'' for seven years.
``But he vetoed this''.
``This'' is an incest-themed story line that never showed up on ``Seinfeld'' but that David was taping two weeks ago for his new show, ``Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' starting on HBO in October.
David, who plays himself, is asked by an old girlfriend to go with her to a support group for incest survivors.
He tries to worm out of it, arguing that abuse by a stepfather might not count.
``With all due respect to your ordeal,'' he says.
``There might be a whole other group for stepthings''.
He goes to the meeting and makes up an incest event of his own.
Later, he will pay, both for agreeing to accompany his ex and for lying.
In David's world, no bad or good deed goes unpunished.
Seinfeld isn't sure he vetoed incest.
``I don't really remember that,'' he said.
But you can see why such a plot twist _ or twisted plot _ might have raised red flags at their old network, NBC.
On HBO, such sensitivities fall under the forgiving umbrella of creative license.
And the man who wrote and supervised the other writers of one of the most acclaimed and lucrative sitcoms of all time gets a lot of license.
Larry David is hardly a household name.
But few households do not know the intimate details of his life, his obsessions, his euphemistic catchphrases (``master of my domain'').
He, not Seinfeld, had the wacky neighbor named Kramer.
He once ruined a suede jacket worn for a scary meeting with a girlfriend's father.
He was the model for Jason Alexander's portrayal of Jerry's alter ego, George Costanza.
And yet, the only on-air exposure his millions of viewers ever got to David was his uncanny vocal impersonation of George Steinbrenner.
HBO subscribers got a glimpse of him, though, in an hourlong mock documentary, also called ``Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' which the channel has shown every so often since last October.
In it, a camera crew purports to follow David, who is 52, around as he works the comedy club circuit in preparation for a supposed HBO stand-up special.
It ends with Larry chickening out of the special.
Other characters include his wife and his manager, who happen to hate each other, various alleged HBO executives and cameos by minor celebrities.
``Curb Your Enthusiasm'' was directed by Robert Weide, a documentary filmmaker whose specialty is comedians (most recently Lenny Bruce).
The whole thing was a put-on, but seemed so real that a friend of the actress playing David's wife was offended that she wasn't invited to their wedding.
Imagine ``The Larry Sanders Show'' _ only more so.
Coincidentally in sync with ``Survivor'' and the current mania for voyeuristic programming, David has created a hybrid of extreme reality and extreme comedy.
All dialogue is improvised from a loose five-page outline that he has written for each of the 10 episodes of the series.
The stand-up scenes and mock-documentary gimmick have been dropped.
But it still has the same verite feel.
It's deadpan in a way that will certainly appeal to critics if not a mass audience expecting the second coming of ``Seinfeld''.
In some ways ``Curb'' is subtler and more nuanced, but with the same unmistakably Seinfeldian structure of snowballing bad luck.
David's desert island may be Los Angeles, but that doesn't make survival any easier.
``This show is about a guy trying to get through the day with a little dignity attached,'' said Chris Albrecht, HBO's president of original programming.
Albrecht has known David since the 1970s, when they were both unsuccessful comics at Catch a Rising Star here.
``Larry's an incredible everyman,'' he said.
An everyman reported by Forbes magazine to have hit a $242 million jackpot when ``Seinfeld'' was sold into syndication.
But unlike Seinfeld, who collects Porches like baseball cards, David has never really been able to enjoy his windfall.
``Mostly what it does is make you apologize a lot,'' he said.
Unlike the dwarfish, irritable Costanza, David is a rangy character with a quick smile.
He has a penchant for wide-wale cords and untucked shirts.
To look at him, you wouldn't know he was loaded, but out here, you never can tell.
By the pool of the once-glamorous Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard, he ate his lunch during a break in the incest group scene and subjected himself to questions about the real Larry David.
``I have quite a house,'' he said.
``People come over and I go, `I know, I'm sorry'''.
Albrecht said David's world view could be summarized as, ``I know, I should have had the chicken''.
Regret, remorse _ those are old friends of his comedy.
Long ago, he taught himself never to think about the future because it was too painful for him to contemplate.
``To regret the past _ yes''! he said, his voice rising to a characteristically Costanzan shout.
``To regret everything about the past _ certainly''!
The present is no picnic either, what with its habit of turning into the regrettable past.
In one episode of ``Curb Your Enthusiasm,'' in a car-phone conversation with his manager, he refers to his wife as ``Hitler''.
(Verbalizing things that the rest of us might think but would never say is a David specialty).
The manager is in his own car, on his speakerphone, but fails to mention that his parents are in the back seat.
So offended are they by the Hitler remark that David is later called upon to offer an apology.
(Another speciality is awkward moments).
``People are constantly screaming at me on the show,'' he said, allowing that this is a slight exaggeration of his relatively civilized existence as a supersuccessful Los Angelino.
``When I was living in New York, there was a lot of screaming in my life.
I would just get into these altercations all the time.
Being in public, dealing with shopkeepers, just trying to cross the street _ things like that.
I'm not in a position where I can scream like that anymore.
I'm not quite as anonymous as I was.
And I guess things aren't as vital to me as they were then''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; nn It was during those struggling stand-up days in New York when David and Seinfeld became friends.
They'd meet at coffee shops and talk for hours about things like laundry.
As Seinfeld recalled, ``What we had in common was both of us had the ability to focus deeply on something small, to blow small things out of proportion''.
One of them was on his way to becoming one of the most successful comedians in the country.
The other remained a comic's comic, meaning he'd perform in front of five people and they'd boo him off the stage.
Interviewed in the ``Curb'' special, Seinfeld said David would address the audience as ``You people,'' which, as Seinfeld would tell him, ``was a little distancing''.
The highlight of David's pre-``Seinfeld'' career was a stint writing and performing on ``Fridays,'' ABC's short-lived ``Saturday Night Live'' clone.
Also in the ``Fridays'' cast was Michael Richards, later to play the fictional version of David's old neighbor Kramer.
The conventional wisdom on why the Seinfeld-David collaboration worked so well is that Jerry made Larry palatable to a mass audience.
They both hate the inevitable Lennon-McCartney analogy.
``Whether it was a dark thing or a light thing,'' Seinfeld said, ``we almost always agreed on what was funny and what wasn't funny''.
The major point of contention was that, almost as soon as they started doing the show together, David wanted to stop.
He had no more ideas.
He constantly worried about keeping it funny.
It was too stressful, he'd complain.
After the show had been on for a few years, executives from Castle Rock, the production company, told its creators that they were in a position to make some serious money on the show.
Weide recalled David's reaction to this news: ``Larry said, `Great!
Now we can take it off the air'''.
He finally left in 1996, returning only to write the series finale in 1998.
David's first outing without Seinfeld was not auspicious.
``Sour Grapes,'' the 1998 movie he wrote and directed, was a black-humored morality tale of two cousins who fall out over money: One lends the other the quarters he uses to win a slot machine jackpot in Atlantic City.
Roger Ebert called it ``a comedy about things that aren't funny'' and didn't stop there.
``I can't easily remember a film I've enjoyed less,'' he said.
Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times, was kinder: ```Sour Grapes' should soften the blow of `Seinfeld's' imminent extinction with the good news that, in David's merry world of hair splitting and back stabbing, the dream definitely lives on''.
Moviegoers did not agree.
Expectations could not have been higher, except maybe for the final episode of ``Seinfeld,'' which also received less-than-glowing reviews.
``Let them try to write it''!
David said on the set last week.
``I shouldn't have kept the script a secret''.
Wincing with remorse, he still feels burned by the overhype that surrounded that show.
No danger of that happening this time around.
David is determined to undersell himself, even in the title.
HBO wanted to give him a billboard on Sunset Boulevard.
No way.
``I don't want to do anything,'' he said.
``I can't stand reading anything that I've said.
I hate that kind of attention.
I don't want articles and pictures''.
His action plan: ``Let the show sneak up on people''.
In his vampiric fear of the limelight, David is more like a writer than a performer.
But he is remarkably relaxed in front of the camera, quite at ease playing himself.
Much of the comedy of the series is simply his poker-faced reactions to the terrible situations he has wrought.
And the improvisational style of the show, having to be funny on his feet, leaves him less time to worry about his acting, or how he looks.
Over lunch, he wondered if he was the first bald star of a sitcom since Phil Silvers, whose show he loved, growing up in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn.
``I was thinking about it, but I couldn't come up with any.
I guess, Don Rickles''.
Jeff Garlin, who plays Larry's manager, said David's point of view is defined by three things: ``Anxiety, anger and despair''.
Despite which he manages to be an extremely friendly, likable and funny guy to be around.
Here at the Roosevelt Hotel, attended to by a personal assistant who looks like Liv Tyler, possibly better, and no network suits in sight, he seemed...
happy. ``He's having as good a time as I've ever known Larry to have,'' Weide said.
This miserable fictional Larry is not quite him, after all.
His wife and manager don't actually hate each other.
Really, they don't .
EAST HAMPTON, N.Y.
(AP) --His show was about nothing.
His new house in the Hamptons is about $40 million.
Jerry Seinfeld agreed to pay that for a 12-acre East Hampton beach estate that once belonged to rock star Billy Joel.
As the masters of a new domain on exclusive Further Lane, Seinfeld and new wife Jessica Sklar will be with the beautiful people during the summer months.
Neighbors on Seinfeld's street include ''Saturday Night Live'' creator Lorne Michaels, designer Helmut Lang and writer James Brady, and that's just the tip of the Hamptons' social iceberg.
Steven Spielberg and ''60 Minutes'' producer Don Hewitt own homes on the island's East End, while frequent summer visitors include Sean ''Puffy'' Combs and Donald Trump.
When it comes to keeping up with the Joneses, Seinfeld is more than holding his own.
Billionaire Revlon boss Ronald Perelman's East Hampton estate is worth a mere $15 million.
Seinfeld and Sklar already share a home on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
Details on how the purchase came about were limited.
Jerry was shopping for a Hamptons retreat, he was turned down a couple of times, and yada yada yada...
he bought a $40 million home.
Comedian Paul Reiser brought Seinfeld and Joel together.
Joel reportedly gave the Seinfelds a personal tour of the property, which the Piano Man purchased in the mid-1980s and redid in the style of a Mediterranean villa.
Joel's move is work-related.
He wants a home on Long Island's North Folk, closer to a recording studio where the Grammy winner is working on a classical music album.
Seinfeld, 45, is a native of the far-less-tony Long Island town of Massapequa.
He and his wife were married on Christmas Day 1999 .
NEW YORK (AP) _ Jerry Seinfeld has a new girlfriend, and Jerry Seinfeld's new girlfriend has an angry husband.
Seinfeld took up with 26-year-old Jessica Sklar soon after she married Broadway theater scion Eric Nederlander four months ago, the New York Post and the Daily News reported this week.
Nederlander, whose father owns six theaters and a piece of baseball's Yankees, is filing for divorce.
A furious Nederlander called his bride a ``gold-digger'' who ``won't get a cent,'' the Post said Tuesday, quoting an unidentified close friend.
The Post said Seinfeld began seeing Sklar after she returned from her honeymoon in Italy last summer.
But friends of the couple said the marriage was doomed from the start and the breakup has nothing to do with Seinfeld.
Seinfeld's spokeswoman did not immediately return calls Tuesday.
The Post said he is mortified by the mess.
Dan Klores, a spokesman for Nederlander, said: ``The family is appalled by the behavior of Jessica and Jerry Seinfeld''.
&UR; ___ &QC; LONDON (AP) _ Michael Flatley, who hung up his ``Lord of the Dance'' shoes last summer, agreed Tuesday to pay his former manager a ``substantial sum'' to settle a breach-of-contract lawsuit.
The terms were not disclosed.
John Reid claimed he was summarily dismissed in a letter in 1997, seven months after the management contract was signed.
The contract was not due to expire until this month.
Reid, who sought dlrs 17 million, said Flatley fired him just as the popularity of Flatley's Irish dance production surged.
``Naturally, I am delighted to put this behind me,'' Reid said.
``It is a real shame that so much time and money and effort has been wasted in the process of getting to the point which we could have reached two years ago''.
Flatley said Reid was abusive and preoccupied with other clients.
&UR; ___ &QC; LONDON (AP) _ George Martin's score for Elton John's ``Candle in the Wind '97'' _ the best-selling single of all time _ will be auctioned off for charity.
The arrangement, written in a hurry by the legendary Beatles producer last year for the tribute to Princess Diana, is expected to fetch about dlrs 100,000 when Sotheby's holds the sale in New York in December, the auction house said.
A special award from the British Phonographic Industry marking 33 million copies of the single sold will be auctioned with the score.
&UR; ___ &QC; DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ A New York-Duesseldorf flight arrived Tuesday with one more passenger than had checked in: a 30-centimeter (12- inch) snake.
A young woman spotted the snake slithering between her feet just before take off.
Still, the flight went on as scheduled.
Another passenger took control of the situation, wrapping the the creature in two plastic bags and setting it in a bathroom for the duration of the trip, Duesseldorf airport officials said.
Police were called to meet the plane to identify the snake, which turned out to be harmless and was turned over to a zoo.
It was unclear how the snake got on board the plane.
&UR; ___ &QC; BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A woman awoke in bed Tuesday to find a carpet snake wrapped around her arm and its teeth embedded in her leg.
Katherine Bell, 34, said she was sleeping alongside her 6-year-old daughter Carla when she felt a pain in her leg at about 4 a.m.
``I thought it was my cat playing on my bed,'' said Bell, of Brisbane.
``I went to move my arm to turn on the bedside light but it (the snake) was wrapped around my arm and its mouth was biting my knee''.
Bell staggered out of bed, flailing wildly to free herself from the snake.
Loosing herself from the two-meter (two-yard)-long reptile, she threw it to the floor before fleeing the room.
The snake escaped into nearby woodlands through a sliding door.
Ambulance officers took Bell to nearby Redland Bay Hospital for treatment to puncture wounds on her leg, knee and finger while police called in a snake handler, who found the reptile.
Carpet snakes are not poisonous, but can inflict a painful bite.
&UR; ___ &QC; JERUSALEM (AP) _ It could be a bad omen for the Wye summit.
A plane chartered by a prominent rabbi to encircle Israel seven times and deliver prayers for the successful conclusion of the Mideast peace talks was forced to make an emergency landing.
A little more than an hour into Monday's flight, the small plane's electrical system malfunctioned.
``We changed the subject of the prayers from the plight of the Israeli people to our plight,'' said Yitzhak Batsri, the son of Rabbi David Batsri and one of four passengers aboard.
``My father...
called out the names of chapters in Psalms, chapters named after angels, and then he asked them to come and help,'' the younger Batsri said.
The pilot eventually brought the plane down safely in northern Israel, and Yitzhak Batsri said the passengers' deliverance was proof that a similar miracle could happen at the Wye, Maryland, talks .
NEW YORK _ Only 18 months ago, NBC's executives were riding a wave of prime-time success that had raised the network to record-setting profits.
The executives were so confident that they were occasionally suggesting that they did not merely want to be the No.
1 network; they wanted to be the only network.
NBC was convinced it had a sound strategy for maintaining its elevated position in the ratings and could be the first network to avoid the ride down the bad side of the ratings wheel of fortune.
But some of the edge came off that confidence last Christmas, when Jerry Seinfeld announced that he was stopping production on the comedy series that had led NBC to its record profits.
Now, in the first season of no ``Seinfeld,'' NBC finds itself in a suddenly altered position: on the downside of dominance.
As it did in the early 1990s, NBC is once again struggling to counteract a combination of familiar factors: the hit that could not be replaced, the suddenly dry pipeline of new hits, the ball-and-chain encumbrances of commitments to previous hit makers and the internal executive turf battles.
And once again the network is looking to a new entertainment executive to help stem the downward turn of the programming cycle that has inevitably hit every network that reached a position of prime-time dominance in the last two decades.
If there were ever any doubts about the ratings clout of ``Seinfeld,'' they have now been erased.
NBC's ratings are off by more than 20 percent this fall, a figure surely higher than NBC expected when it calculated how badly it would be hit by the departure of ``Seinfeld''.
Tellingly, the network's biggest losses have been among younger men, the biggest fans of ``Seinfeld''.
Some of that is also the result of NBC's abandonment of National Football League games this year.
But even when all sports programming is factored out (NBC had the World Series and the Super Bowl last year), among men between the ages of 18 and 49, NBC is still off by 22 percent.
Among men between 18 and 34 the figure grows to 31 percent.
That is the state of play that the new executive, Scott Sassa, encounters as he joins the network as the president of entertainment.
Sassa, 39, former head of all entertainment operations for the Turner Broadcasting cable channels, was appointed to replace the longtime NBC programmer, Warren Littlefield, last week.
NBC called the move the first step in a planned transition that would bring Sassa into total control of NBC entertainment operations.
For at least a year he will work under Don Ohlmeyer, the executive brought in the last time NBC, a unit of General Electric, faced a clouding-over prime-time picture.
That was in 1993, and things were much worse then.
Ohlmeyer, who is now widely credited with providing the leadership that turned NBC around, had to start almost from scratch.
NBC's executive reorganization this time comes at a far earlier point in NBC's ratings decline.
Still, senior NBC executives acknowledge that they must make moves now to level off the network; and they believe they can.
NBC's position remains reasonably secure for the moment, because no other network is making a strong upward movement that would help force NBC down further, and because NBC still possesses a core of television's strongest shows _ ``E.R.
,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Friends'' and ``Law and Order''.
But NBC is also embroiled in a bitter standoff with the Hollywood studios that supply all those hits.
NBC has demanded an ownership stake in all new programs and the studios have refused.
Instead, they have begun what is in effect a boycott of NBC.
For the moment, that means those studios will not be supplying NBC with any of the hits the network needs to pull out of its current slide.
NBC must have those hits because for the last three seasons, no compelling new program has been added to NBC's store.
Network executives concede that program development has been weak and no real hits have emerged in the last three years.
The strength of ``Seinfeld,'' along with the ratings garnered last year by the World Series and the Super Bowl, helped mask the problems for a time.
The network's focus on maximizing profits also led to what several NBC executives said were some questionable strategic moves, such as attempting in the fall of 1997 to flood the NBC schedule with comedies, a record 18 of them, primarily because comedies generally get a higher price from advertisers than any other kind of programming.
Looking to capitalize on that, NBC also dropped its Monday night movie, which had been reasonably successful.
That led, according to NBC executives, to internal turf battles as NBC's top movie executive, Lindy DeKoven, was squeezed out by the rest of the program department.
But few of the comedies NBC introduced worked.
Reflecting a widely held view, one former top program executive from a competing network suggested a couple of reasons for this.
``It was a combination of so many shows with the same upscale urban premise and simple lack of execution,'' the executive said.
Indeed, NBC seemed fixated on one kind of show: a vehicle for a female star playing a single woman in some media surrounding, usually in New York.
The list of shows with that premise introduced by NBC during the last three years includes ``Caroline in the City,'' ``Suddenly Susan,'' ``Fired Up,'' ``Naked Truth'' and ``Veronica's Closet''.
Each of these shows was tried in the program slot between ``Seinfeld'' and ``E.R''.
_ arguably the most advantageous place to build an audience for a new show ever created by television.
But not one of the shows has developed into a bona fide hit.
``We went with this cookie-cutter approach,'' one senior NBC executive said.
``It just didn't work.
And it meant we wasted that 9:30 slot behind `Seinfeld' instead of finding the hit that could help replace it''.
Because no hit emerged from all those attempts, NBC was forced to move its next best comedy, ``Frasier,'' to Thursday at 9, where ``Seinfeld'' lived.
That did help shore up Thursday, which has been NBC's stronghold for almost two decades.
But in so doing, NBC drastically weakened Tuesday.
Thanks to ``Frasier,'' NBC had erased ABC's former dominance on Tuesdays.
Now ``Frasier'' is relocated and another longtime comedy hit, ``Mad About You,'' is fading in its last season.
With some stronger ABC comedies on that night, NBC has again fallen well back of ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co.
Tuesday's decline has also been advanced by the failure of one hoped-for new comedy, ``Encore!
Encore''! That is being pointed to as evidence that NBC, despite previous assurances that it would not let commitments to stars or producers of previous hits pull it down, has fallen prey to the mistake of putting deals instead of shows on the air.
``Encore! Encore''! was produced because NBC had a deal with its star, Nathan Lane, and the producers of ``Frasier''.
But the show has been a severe disappointment that has damaged another promising comedy, ``Just Shoot Me,'' which NBC had hoped would maintain the network's strength on Tuesdays.
``Encore! Encore''! is far from the only failure in the current fall crop, however.
One drama, ``Wind on Water,'' has already been canceled.
Another, ``Trinity'' (created as a result of a deal with the producer of ``E.R.''), is endangered.
Another comedy, ``Conrad Bloom,'' is listing badly on Mondays.
Only ``Will and Grace,'' a comedy about a gay man living with a straight woman, has shown some signs of promise.
But that may only be because it has been up against weak competition.
When CBS broadcast a repeat of its best comedy, ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' against ``Will and Grace'' last week, the show took a big fall.
Still, NBC, because it owns ``Will and Grace'' and needs it to succeed, plans to move the show to Thursday, probably in the spot now occupied by ``Veronica's Closet,'' another significant disappointment.
But several senior NBC executives said the network could not move ``Veronica'' until 13 episodes have been broadcast this year as a result of the huge deal with its production company, Warner Brothers, owned by Time Warner, for the continuation of ``E.R''.
That deal cost NBC $13 million an episode, of course, wiping out its profitability for NBC.
The enormous cost of that deal hardened NBC's position about insisting on an ownership stake in all its new shows, and the studios responded by refusing to deal with NBC.
Bob Wright, president of NBC, said he believed NBC would solve its impasse with the studios, but that it did not necessarily need to.
``We aren't that dependent on the studios,'' he said.
Sassa, however, seemed to signal that he would take steps to resolve the standoff.
And another senior NBC executive said, ``Scott will solve that''.
What Sassa will do to solve the drought of hits is less certain.
The cupboard is all but bare at the moment, with only two possible replacement series in production.
And neither of those, a comedy, ``Lateline,'' and a drama, ``Providence,'' is thought to resemble a cavalry charge.
Some competing programmers suggested in interviews that NBC might be wise to circle its wagons and place its strongest lineup of shows on Tuesday and Thursday for the time being.
One show several other programmers said NBC might try to rely on is ``Third Rock From the Sun,'' a once highly regarded comedy that NBC used as a weapon on Wednesday night to try to damage the ABC hit ``Drew Carey,'' only to see ``Third Rock'' suffer badly.
NBC might also consider returning the Monday night made-for-television movie, several programmers suggested, pairing it with the ever-expanding news magazine ``Dateline,'' and dropping some of its weak Monday comedies.
But the movies that filled that slot were taken out of development and it would take months to get any stockpile of movies established.
Ohlmeyer is expected to take a much more hands-on role in developing the next batch of NBC shows while Sassa learns the details of running the entertainment division.
Sassa himself refused to say in what direction he planned to take NBC programming.
``I can't give you the secrets to the nuclear code,'' he said.
PASADENA, CALIF.
_ Is there life after ``Seinfeld''?
Some viewers, surveying the mostly feeble comedies that remain since Jerry and the gang left prime time in 1998, may have glumly concluded that no, there is not.
But is there life after ``Seinfeld'' for the show's cast?
Michael Richards is about to find out.
For nine seasons, Richards played Kramer, a human pinball who was perpetually careening through Jerry Seinfeld's apartment door when he wasn't concocting loony get-rich-quick schemes with Newman the mailman.
Kramer became a cult figure on one of the most successful sitcoms of all time.
Now, the 52-year-old Richards is bringing his mobile features and his gift for slapstick to a new NBC sitcom titled ``The Michael Richards Show,'' which premieres Oct.
24 on WHDH-TV (Ch.
7). He will play Vic Nardozza, a disguise-wearing private investigator who specializes in undercover work, and whom Richards describes as ``an American Inspector Clouseau''.
Clouseau, not Kramer: Like most actors, Richards seems leery of being typecast.
He says NBC was ``wide open to a new invention'' that's not a mirror image of his most famous creation.
``They didn't say `Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, we like the concept.
Now, are you going to have your hair up?
How are you going to come through the door'?
'' Not that Richards is entirely leaving ``Seinfeld'' _ or Seinfeld _ behind.
For one thing, the team that assembled his new show consists of three former ``Seinfeld'' writers, including Spike Feresten, author of the legendary ``Soup Nazi'' episode.
For another, Richards has already reached out to Seinfeld for advice on building a better sitcom.
``He flew in, and we sat around for an afternoon together,'' said Richards.
``And he had a few line suggestions, and then said, `Well, there you go,' and that was it, he was off''.
Because Richards will be an executive producer as well as the star of the series, he also tapped Seinfeld's knowledge of the ``logistics'' of the former role.
The biggest logistical challenge may be in getting viewers to accept Richards in a non-Kramer role.
Co-creator Gregg Kavet touched on the conundrum the ``Michael Richards'' team faced.
``You're dealing with Kramer, probably one of the best-loved characters ever on television,'' said Kavet.
``And it's something where everyone is expecting to see that, but they're also reluctant to see the exact same thing again.
So what we've tried to do is basically figure out ways to exploit Michael's strengths,. . . continue to use things like physical comedy and the disguises, certain characteristics that came up with Kramer, without having the same type of person''.
Offscreen, there seems to be little of Kramer in Richards.
The actor's speaking style is deliberate, even ponderous, a far cry from Kramer's extraterrestrial outbursts.
Richards referred to himself several times as an ``artist,'' and lapsed frequently into performers' jargon.
But his love of his craft, especially physical comedy, comes through when he discusses some of his comic heroes, the likes of Ernie Kovacs, Peter Sellers, Charles Chaplin, and Jacques Tati.
By July, when Richards spoke to TV critics gathered here, ``The Michael Richards Show'' was the subject of much speculation because NBC executives, after seeing the pilot and concluding that the show relied too heavily on Richards, asked for a complete overhaul of the show.
The sitcom's team did so, principally by fleshing out the supporting cast around Richards.
``There's no trouble here,'' Richards insisted.
He did emphasize, though, his hopes that the show will develop the kind of ensemble strength that became a hallmark of ``Seinfeld''.
Toward that end, Tim Meadows (``Saturday Night Live'') and William Devane (``Knot's Landing,'' ``Turks'') were added to the cast as, respectively, an associate of Nardozza's with a Peeping Tom fetish and the owner of the investigative agency.
``I don't feel like it's all hinged on me,'' said Richards.
``I have a driving style, and certainly (some of the) capers will circulate around the character that I'll be playing.
But I feel that this is going to be an ensemble-driven show''.
Though Richards and Meadow are the professional comedians and Devane is known for a glowering intensity in film and TV dramas, it was Devane who showed a deadpan, even Seinfeldian, touch when he explained how he got his role.
``They were looking for an older guy, and I'm an older guy,'' he said dryly.
``So that all kind of worked out.''
NEW YORK (AP) --A judge threw out a $100 million lawsuit filed by a man who claims Jerry Seinfeld and his TV producers stole his identity for the character of George Costanza.
State Supreme Court Justice Harold Tompkins said Michael Costanza's suit was frivolous.
Costanza, a real estate agent who lives on Long Island, said his rights were violated when the show used his ``name, likeness and persona'' to create the neurotic and nutty George for ``Seinfeld''.
Costanza said the show portrayed him in a negative, humiliating light, and that ``Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David defamed him when he called Costanza a ``liar'' and ``flagrant opportunist'' trying to cash in.
Tompkins said he found the lawsuit baseless and assessed sanctions of $2,500 each against Costanza, 43, and his lawyer, Jonathan Fisher.
(OMAHA, Neb).
_ His short tour of the Midwest is a dress rehearsal for a cable TV show he'll call ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time,'' but a better title would be ``Don't Stop Me If You've Heard This One''.
Two months after laying to rest his famous TV show, comedian Jerry Seinfeld is performing last rites on his old standup routine, preparing for a finale in his hometown, New York City, that will be aired live as an HBO special on Aug.
9. ``After that,'' he has promised, ``I won't use that material ever again''.
Friday night, in the lovely and historic Orpheum Theater (downtown Omaha's version of the Midland Theatre), Seinfeld delivered a 75-minute medley of his greatest hits.
The theater, which seats about 2,800 people, was nearly full for the second of four shows at the Orpheum last weekend.
The Omaha World-Herald, however, reported Friday that the event's promoter, Contemporary Productions, had given away an average of 500 tickets per show, mostly to local media outlets.
The newspaper cited the $60.50 ticket price as the reason for slightly sluggish sales.
Despite the price, the familiar routines and a few rough spots (his transitions need sanding and polishing), most of the crowd reacted as if each joke had been baked fresh that day.
Maybe, like most ``Seinfeld'' fans, they're accustomed to laughing at reruns.
There were plenty of those: - On why men don't like to write checks: ``To men, a check is like a note from your mother.
A check says, `Sorry, I don't have any money with me right now, but if you contact these people, they'll give you the amount of money I wish I had'.
'' - On bathrooms in airplanes: ``There's a slot for used razor blades.
What I want to know is, who is shaving on the airplane?
And shaving so much that they're using up razor blades.
Is the Wolfman on the plane''? - On the rubber divider at the grocery checkout: ``We use the rubber divider because we don't want someone else's items fraternizing with our own.
The rubber divider is the universal signal for `Back off'!
'' - On the high price of candy at movie theaters: ``That's why they put it in a jewelry case.
You feel like you're buying a diamond: `Excuse me, I'd like to see something in a Milk Dud'.
And then they bring you one Milk Dud on a black velvet pillow ''... - On pain relievers: ``Everything is `extra-strength' now.
You can't even get `strength' anymore; `strength' is off the market.
But for some people, extra-strength isn't enough.
They need `maximum strength,' which is like telling the drug companies, `Figure out how much will kill me, pull back a little and give me that'.
'' - On skydiving: ``What exactly is the helmet for?
Let me tell you, if you're skydiving and your parachute doesn't open, your helmet is wearing you for protection''.
- On dating: ``A date is a job interview that lasts all night.
The only difference: There's no chance you'll end up naked at the end of a job interview''.
Toward the end of the evening, Seinfeld delivered some newer (or lesser-known) material _ and more evidence of his comic brilliance.
Like few other comedians (a younger George Carlin comes to mind), Seinfeld examines the enduring quirks and oddball habits that afflict so many of us in the Western world.
`Seinfeld' was more about everything _ about so many of our common behavioral tics _ than about nothing.
For example, as he talked about men and how ``in their own minds they live lives of super heroes,'' he sketched this observation: ``Most of you have seen this: a guy driving down the street with a mattress or box spring tied to the top of his car, and he's got his arm out the window and he's holding on to the mattress _ with one arm.
Here's what this guy is thinking: If a big gust of wind were to catch the mattress and lift it, breaking the rope, he'll be able to hold the mattress to the roof _ with one arm _ and prevent it from flying off the car.
`It's OK; I got it'.
'' For his encore, Seinfeld spent several minutes taking questions and a few gifts from his audience: ``Will you do movies''?
``I don't think so.
You watch a bad movie, it only costs you two hours.
You do a bad movie, it costs you two years''.
When a woman presented a bouquet of flowers to him, he said, ``Thank you very much.
But you know what most men think (when) they get flowers from a woman?
`Oh, great.
Now I gotta take care of these'.
'' He ended the show by following his own advice (to his TV buddy George): Leave on a high note.
After someone from the back of the balcony bellowed, ``Hello, Jerry,'' Seinfeld let rip with a ``Hello, Newman'' that brought most of the house screaming to its feet.
Almost two years after America watched the final episode of ``Seinfeld,'' the second bananas on that popular series are enjoying second careers in advertising.
Madison Avenue has long been enamored of the actors who took the principal roles on ``Seinfeld'': Jason Alexander, who played George; Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Elaine; Michael Richards, Kramer; and Jerry Seinfeld, who in a demonstration of his extraordinary range and ability portrayed Jerry Seinfeld.
Among the blue-chip brands they have peddled are AT&AMP;T, American Express, Clairol, Tommy Hilfiger, Pepsi-Cola, Rold Gold and Visa.
But now, many of the actors who played supporting characters on ``Seinfeld'' are also turning up in campaigns for products ranging from automobiles and candy to soft drinks and prescription drugs.
The sidekicks taking center stage include Estelle Harris, who played George's mother; Wayne Knight, Newman; Phil Morris, Jackie Chiles; and Patrick Warburton, Puddy.
Such interest among marketers and agencies in characters with smaller roles is unusual after a show ends production.
Typically, ad work goes to the actors who were the better known stars of a series, even though it almost always costs more to hire them than their supporting cast.
Examples include Barbara Billingsley, June Cleaver on ``Leave It to Beaver''; Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford, George and Louise Jefferson on ``The Jeffersons''; and Florence Henderson, Carol Brady on ``The Brady Bunch''.
But ``Seinfeld'' broke rules for the content of TV sitcoms; conventional wisdom held that viewers would not warm to characters who were whiny, New Yorkers or identifiably Jewish.
Now the show is breaking rules on the selling front.
```Seinfeld' was so long running,'' said Tom Lom, managing director at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi Health Care in New York, which is using Knight at his Newmanian worst to personify the flu bug in a campaign for the prescription drug Relenza sold by Glaxo Wellcome.
``And it's still on the air in reruns''.
``So people remember the characters from the prime-time run,'' he added, ``and still get exposed to the characters through the reruns''.
The first episode of ``Seinfeld'' appeared on NBC in May 1990 and the last episode appeared in May 1998.
The reruns, syndicated by the Columbia Tristar Television Distribution unit of Sony Pictures Entertainment, are shown on 224 stations.
``Even though the show is not on, the familiarity is there,'' said John Clarke, chief advertising officer at Dr Pepper/Seven Up in Plano, Tex.
, part of Cadbury Schweppes.
For the Diet Dr Pepper soft drink brand, Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising in New York created a commercial with a courtroom theme featuring Morris in his persona as the slick lawyer Chiles.
Morris also donned his Chiles regalia _ mustache, glasses, stylish suit _ for two humorous spots for the Odyssey minivan sold by the American Honda Motor Co.
``Plenty of people in the minivan category, young families, watched or are watching `Seinfeld,''' said Larry Postaer, executive vice president and creative services director at the Honda agency, Rubin Postaer &AMP; Associates in Santa Monica, Calif.
In creating the commercials, ``we thought it might be fun to bring on a celebrity lawyer as a surprise,'' Postaer said.
``But the real ones don't do that _ or shouldn't''.
``This gave us someone who is recognized,'' he added, ``and funny''.
Morris is not the only ``Seinfeld'' second banana doing double duty for advertisers.
Warburton has worked for the Cadillac division of General Motors and the M&AMP;M's line of candy sold by a division of Mars Inc.
``I missed all the shows he was on, but when he played a cop in the Cadillac commercial I came into the office and asked my group: `That guy is great.
Who is he'''? recalled Charles R.
Miesmer, vice chairman and senior executive creative director at the M&AMP;M's agency, BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.
``Every so often, like in sports, a team gets assembled that has four or five Hall of Famers on it,'' Miesmer said.
``That show had so many actors who were so good''.
One benefit of using secondary characters was described by Patrick Sherwood, president of the Los Angeles and Troy, Mich.
, offices of the Cadillac agency, D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles, part of the B Com3 Group.
``They're a little bit below the radar in a commercial context,'' he said, ``which was important for us because we wanted a different voice for the Cadillac brand''.
``Patrick Warburton was seen as engaging, entertaining and credible, not a shill,'' he added.
``Coming from an ensemble cast, he had an ability to react and a degree of spontaneity that was really refreshing.
He was so successful, he did several spots for us''.
Despite the appeal of the ``Seinfeld'' second-stringers, not all of them can expect to be on the first team for advertisers.
For instance, Clarke at Dr Pepper/Seven Up said he would not consider a commercial with Larry Thomas, who played the unwelcoming proprietor of a soup store.
``We try to encourage people to come in,'' Clarke said, laughing, ``not chase them out''. &QL;
LOS ANGELES (AP) --Michael Richards says he wasn't sure if there was life after Kramer.
Acting life, at least.
''At first I didn't really want to work,'' the former ''Seinfeld'' star said.
''There wasn't anything that was really exciting me.
So I thought I was going to retire''.
After earning a reported $13 million on the hit ''show about nothing,'' Richards took it easy.
He traveled, restored his home, read classic books by authors like Herman Melville and did little acting, outside of a role in the TNT version of ''David Copperfield''.
But he's back on NBC next month in ''The Michael Richards Show,'' playing a befuddled detective.
Some of the mannerisms are the same, but Richards told the Los Angeles Times for Sunday's editions he wants the audience to realize he won't simply rehash his ''Seinfeld'' role.
''I'm not the Kramer character,'' he said.
NEW YORK _ Literature it was not: It was only a sitcom script, filled with comma faults and repeatedly misspelled words.
``Alright,'' for example, appears on pages 9, 10, 24, 32, and 43.
All right, so ``Seinfeld'' was not perfect on paper, and bee-quality spelling is not a must for must-see television.
But are sitcom scripts ready to become gallery-quality collectibles worth thousands of dollars?
As they say on television, stay tuned.
On June 18, little more than a month after the quintessentially self-involved quartet from ``Seinfeld'' went the way of the barroom busybodies on ``Cheers'' and the medics on ``MASH,'' Christie's East is scheduled to auction the 68-page script with all the ``alrights''.
Christie's East estimates that the script from the 1992-93 season will go for $1,500 to $2,000.
But some television-memorabilia dealers, like Robert Schagrin of the Gotta Have It gallery in Manhattan, maintain that the bidding could easily go higher because the market for nontraditional Hollywood collectibles is blossoming.
``TV scripts are fast becoming the pop art of the future,'' said Schagrin, who specializes in television-age collectibles like scripts and props from old shows.
``As you enter the new millennium, all of this stuff is going to quite naturally become what 19th-century stuff was to the 20th century''.
Just as location, location, location is a mantra in real estate, television-script dealers value autographs, autographs, autographs.
The ``Seinfeld'' script in the Christie's East sale bears the signatures of the four principal cast members (not Larry David, who wrote it).
On the first page are Jerry Seinfeld's loopy but legible autograph, Michael Richards' hasty-looking flourish and the almost unreadable signatures of Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
``Seinfeld'' fans will recognize the script as the one that introduced the phrase ``master of my domain'' to the language.
``This was one of my favorites,'' chuckled Simeon Lipman, the 23-year-old head of the popular arts department at Christie's East.
``It's an Emmy Award-winning episode, it's an episode that `Seinfeld' fans remember and this is what is known in television jargon as an original `table draft'''.
In other words, the script being sold was used on the set, not an ``as broadcast'' version that codified lines the actors ad-libbed.
Nor is it a mere working draft that contained scenes dropped before the episode was filmed.
Lipman maintains that television memorabilia is an increasingly profitable corner of what trade magazines estimate is the $10 billion market for collectibles.
Dealers say that prices for television scripts have gained altitude in the media-saturated 1990s, propelled by network-television hype that has become an unwitting affirmation of Andy Warhol's notion of creating public awareness.
But dealers maintain that television memorabilia has transcended the short-term hype for a particular series like ``Seinfeld,'' becoming a genuine pop-cultural phenomenon.
The ``Seinfeld'' script is not the first television script to go on the auction block.
Christie's sold 10 scripts from ``The Honeymooners'' for $5,950 in 1996.
Again, value is tied to autographs: Schagrin guessed that if a signed ``Honeymooners'' script existed, it would be worth more than $50,000.
``God, that would be like the four Beatles signing on the music to `The White Album,''' he said.
Last year, a script from the short-lived 1978 revival of ``This Is Your Life'' went for $1,150.
Once again, autographs were essential to its value: The script was signed by Muhammad Ali and his trainer.
Schagrin maintains that scripts are appreciating faster than other film and television collectibles.
A script for an episode of ``MASH,'' signed by the entire cast, sold for $700 in 1995; earlier this year, it went for $4,000.
A signed script from the NBC sitcom ``Friends'' that sold for $550 in 1996 sold recently for $1,800.
And a ``Cheers'' script sold for $900 soon after that long-running sitcom went off the air in 1993.
The owner recently put it on the market for $5,000.
``We didn't sell it,'' Schagrin said.
``While we were working on it, he called back and said, `Sorry, it's gone'''.
In the June 18 sale, Christie's East will also auction the original proposal for ``Star Trek'' by the science fiction writer Gene Roddenberry.
The 26-page typewritten document describes the spaceship Enterprise as ``a wagon train to the stars''.
Most of the characters Roddenberry envisioned did not boldly go before the cameras, though: only Spock (``with a red-hewed, satanic look and surprisingly gentle manners'') made it onto the show.
Christie's East estimates that the ``Star Trek'' proposal will sell for $12,000 to $15,000, a figure that dealers like Lipman hope the ``Seinfeld'' script will someday bring.
Not yet, he acknowledged.
But not to worry, either.
``They're going to replay `Seinfeld' for decades to come,'' Lipman said, ``and it's truly the most iconic of all television series for this time.
`Seinfeld' will have staying power, which can only help with the scripts.''
NEW YORK (AP) --Imagine Jerry Seinfeld inside his Long Island mansion, baby bottle in one hand, burp cloth in the other, musing: Whyyyyy do they call it a burp cloth?
That's right.
First came love (1998), then came marriage (last December)--and now Seinfeld and bride, Jessica Sklar, will soon be pushing a baby carriage.
The big announcement was made Thursday by Seinfeld pal Regis Philbin on TV's ''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee''.
''Yes. It's true.
There will be a new little Seinfeld sometime this fall,'' said Seinfeld's spokeswoman, Elizabeth Clarke.
It is the first child for both Sklar and Seinfeld, who made millions from a TV show that glorified single life and poked fun at commitment.
But that was then and this is now, and soon the 45-year-old Seinfeld will be up to his diaper bag in commitment.
Seinfeld apparently asked Philbin to serve up the news for him.
Philbin did it gladly, informing viewers that the little Seinfeld is scheduled to arrive in October.
Clarke did not want to pinpoint the due date.
The new arrival may have the undevoted attention of his dad, who retired his series in 1998.
Baby Seinfeld will also have plenty of room for all that kid stuff like swing sets, playhouses, bicycles and building blocks.
The couple are reportedly paying as much as $40 million for Billy Joel's 12-acre oceanfront mansion in East Hampton.
And there are other kids in the neighborhood for playdates.
Steven Spielberg has a place nearby and he has five children.
Just asking: Could a minivan be far behind?
&UR; &LR; Some people never can say goodbye.
But not Jerry Seinfeld.
In the spring, the comedian bid a much publicized adieu to his hugely successful sitcom after nine years.
And Sunday night, live from New York on HBO, he said farewell again, this time to the stand-up material he has cultivated so far in his career.
While the special was titled ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time'' most of Seinfeld's fans were probably hearing these jokes for the first time.
Excluding the brief stand-up snippets that bookmarked ``Seinfeld'' in its early years, we've mostly encountered his distinctive view of life in the form of situational gags split among at least three other jokers.
Sunday night, wearing a suit and tie, Seinfeld appeared confident and eager as he stood alone on a stage with a stool and a glass of water, delivering his charmingly trivial observations to an adoring house.
At one point, a woman yelled out that she loved Seinfeld, triggering his ad lib ``I love you too, but I do feel the need to'' _ he gestured at the rest of the audience _ ``see other people''.
Miraculously, he managed not to be diminished by the hype that surrounded the HBO special, his first prime-time appearance since May and the final performance of a world tour that has been heavily promoted.
Seinfeld's hour revolved mostly around his amazement at the strangeness of ordinary things.
Always obsessed with hygiene, he spent some time wondering about New York cab drivers and their body odor.
``How long are these shifts''? he exclaimed.
He thought out loud on the subject of pharmacists, who always seem to dispense their drugs from platforms, and he dwelled on the very specific expiration dates milk companies put on their cartons: ``Maybe the cows tip them off when they're millking them''.
One surprise was the physicality of his performance.
It was Michael Richards as Kramer &UR; &LR; who provided most of the visual humor on ``Seinfeld,'' but Sunday night Seinfeld repeatedly used his body and facial expressions to tell his stories.
He mimicked the way flight attendants instruct plane passengers on how to put on a seat belt and how they point vaguely to the emergency exits.
He did an impression of a wolf man shaving.
And in a riff about a forthcoming visit to Florida, he pretended to be an elderly person backing out of a driveway without looking.
On ``Seinfeld,'' his humor seemed strikingly original and even edgy.
In a stand-up context, it had a more conventional, ``Tonight Show'' feel to it.
There was no envelope pushing, no Robin Williams/Jim Carrey-styled craziness; just an energetic man and his unusual sensibility.
But it was a mostly amusing hour that, like the sitcom, ended just before the laughs began to thin out.
The show left no indication of where Seinfeld hopes to take his comedy, now that he's told these jokes for the last time.
The stand-up routine was preceded by a very short, star-filled film set in a graveyard.
As a group of very familiar faces of comedy stood watching in mock grief, including Garry Shandling, George Carlin, Ed McMahon, Paul Reiser, Alan King, and Jay Leno, Seinfeld buried a coffin filled with pages of his jokes.
Let's hope it's his final act of finality, for this year at least.
It's time to cut another check for Jerry Seinfeld.
In a record cable deal worth more than $100 million, TBS has purchased national cable and metro Atlanta rights to syndicated repeats of ``Seinfeld'' to begin in fall 2002 and last four years.
The Atlanta-based station will reportedly pay more than $600,000 apiece for 180 ``Seinfeld'' episodes, eclipsing the price Lifetime earlier negotiated for cable syndication rights to Ellen DeGeneres' sitcom, ``Ellen''.
Though a cable benchmark, the deal doesn't approach the nearly $286 million a year NBC will pay for first-run ``ER'' episodes for the next three seasons.
But it's still a lot of cash for Seinfeld and his show's distributor, Columbia TriStar TV.
Variety estimates that all `Seinfeld'' syndication deals to date have bumped the show's overall gross to much more than $1.5 billion.
TBS' contract will bump ``Seinfeld'' repeats, a big ratings booster, off WATL in metro Atlanta.
WATL's pact expires in March 2001.
There remains an 18-month period between that date and the start of ``Seinfeld'' on TBS that WATL might purchase.
``'Seinfeld' is one of the three shows in history _ 'I Love Lucy' and 'The Andy Griffith Show' are the others _ to sign off at No.
1,'' said TBS President Bill Burke, who also recently cut deals for syndicated repeats of ``Friends'' (to start in 2001) and ``Home Improvement'' and ``The Drew Carey Show'' (both to start in 2002).
``We're very confident of this show.
We think it has legs''.
So far, ``Seinfeld'' repeats have been a strong performer, especially in metro Atlanta.
The show, now most often airing at 10 o'clock weeknights on WATL, sometimes beats nearly all prime-time programming.
During the May sweeps, the period stations use to set ad rates worth millions of dollars, ``Seinfeld'' repeats averaged nearly 185,000 metro Atlanta homes.
``May was sensational,'' said Don Hess, WATL programming chief.
But four years from now, he said, ``Seinfeld'' might lose its ratings heat.
``That's what happened to 'Cheers'''.
Burke, however, thinks TBS got a deal.
``'Seinfeld' is in a very small class of mega-hit shows,'' he said.
``Networks are not producing a lot of mega-hits anymore.
We think this might be one of the last and wanted to be sure it was on our schedule''.

GENEVA, January 12 (Xinhua) --A Swiss-Belgian team took off from a lake-side mountain in the Swiss Alps Sunday in the latest bid to balloon non-stop around the world, according to reports from Chateau D'oex, Switzerland.
Swiss Bertrand Piccard and his Belgian team-member Wim Verstraeten lifted off this morning in the Breitling Orbiter from Chateau D'oex above Lake Geneva for a journey aimed at circumnavigating Earth.
The round world trip is expected to take about two weeks.
Rival Branson, who owns the British Virgin Group, was on hand here to wish his competitors well.
His own bid to fly around the world non-stop in 18 days was scuttled last Wednesday due to a technical hitch.
CAIRO, Egypt _ After a final night soaring across North Africa, the first balloonists to circle the globe touched down early Sunday morning in the soft sands of southern Egypt _ and then spent hours waiting for a ride home.
The landing, some 300 miles southwest of Cairo, brought a bumpy end to a record-setting journey that had lasted nearly three weeks.
The balloonists, aboard the huge Breitling Orbiter 3, had hoped to land to near the Pyramids of Giza, but unfavorable winds kept them from that storybook ending.
Instead, they scuttled to a stop in the sands of the Sahara, after two aborted attempts, and then had to gouge holes in their still-inflated balloon to keep it from dragging them further across the desolate desert.
Dr. Bertrand Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and Brian Jones, a Briton, landed just after 8 a.m. local time.
Then, after 19 days, 21 hours and 55 minutes aloft, they spent seven hours on a lonely desert plateau before an Egyptian army helicopter arrived to pick them up.
Speaking to reporters in the oasis town of Dakhla, Jones said the flight ``was the most amazing experience''.
Both men appeared elated by their achievement, yet drained by the effort and the endurance it took to claim the elusive prize of having circled the world in a balloon.
``If you ask me now whether I'd do it again, I'd say no,'' Jones said.
``But ask me later''.
Both men said they became firm friends during the trip, squeezed into a capsule that measured just 16 by 10 feet.
``In several stages, we were able to support each other,'' Piccard, a psychiatrist, said at a news conference in Cairo Sunday night.
``When one of us was about to give up, the other would support him''.
Jones said the worst thing was enduring the cold.
``All of our water froze at night, so we waited till day to fill the kettles,'' he said.
``It was very, very cold up there''.
Piccard added, speaking of the trials and tribulations of the flight: ``It was not a matter of setting records; it was a fabulous metaphor of life.
To try is the only way to survive''.
The pair completed their circumnavigation on Saturday, crossing an invisible line in the air far above Mauritania.
After a trip that took them across North Africa, South Asia, the Pacific Ocean, Central America and the Atlantic, they decided to push on, in search of a soft landing and the romance of the 5,000-year-old Pyramids _ one of the world's most enduring symbols of human perseverance.
The two men said that the hours they spent in the desert had given them time to reflect on their experience and to appreciate the extraordinary diversity of the bleak habitat that surrounded them.
``We are not heroes,'' Jones said in Cairo.
``We just proved that dreams could come true''.
It was not clear why it had taken so long for Egyptian helicopters to recover the two intrepid balloonists, whose plans to speak at a news conference in Cairo were postponed for hours because of the delay.
Their landing, timed to take advantage of a postdawn lull in desert winds, was observed by mission controllers aboard a chartered plane, and their exact location was pinpointed by the global positioning satellite system.
In Dakhla, where they answered journalists' questions, the pair appeared drawn and thin.
Asked about the state of their balloon, Jones _ who, like Piccard, wore a blue flight suit and was sipping soda from a wine glass _ said: ``It's completely deflated, like me, really''.
Members of the record-setting team described the landing as having been ``a 10'' on a scale of 1 to 10, and they said that weather conditions had been perfect.
The team's fuel supplies were near empty when they landed, team members said, and there was no question of the pair continuing on for another night.
But Jones, a 51-year-old former member of the British air force, described a scene that sounded somewhat more chaotic, with strong winds tipping the balloon over after the landing.
``We had to run around the balloon with our knives to make holes to keep from being dragged across the desert,'' Jones told reporters in Dakhla.
The Egyptian government spokesman, Nabil Osman, said that the weather-driven changes in plans for the balloon's landing had slowed the military's plans for swift recovery of the crew.
``There was no delay,'' Osman said.
``It was a combination of how to react and how to get the helicopters to that area''.
The huge silver balloon, 180 feet tall, landed atop a remote, plateau about 45 miles north of the desert town of Mut.
Overnight, Egyptian security and tourism officials had advised people across Egypt that they had nothing to fear from the craft that would descend from the skies.
The record-setting mission had received little attention here through most of the long journey.
But the prospect of a landing near the Pyramids _ which would had made for extraordinary publicity _ galvanized the government into action.
GENEVA (AP) --One of two exhausted balloonists trying to become the first to circle the globe nonstop sobbed with joy and relief Friday when he was told they have enough fuel to reach the finish line in Africa.
If all goes as planned, Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard and British adventurer Brian Jones will conquer one of the last great challenges in aviation on Saturday.
On Friday, their 180-foot-high Breitling Orbiter 3 was more than halfway across the Atlantic, being swept along by a jet stream at up to 100 mph.
Their control center in Geneva said they had gained about six hours and were on course to cross longitude 9 degrees west at about midday Saturday (7 a.m.
EST). That's the same line where they began their trip nearly three weeks ago.
At that point, the balloonists are expected to be above Mauritania, on Africa's northwest coast.
They plan to push on, over Algeria and Libya to Egypt, where they believe it will be easier to land and where Jones has long dreamed of ending the odyssey.
But if they're too tired, they will drift down in Mali, flight director Alan Noble said.
``If they want to put down in some part of the desert surrounded by lions, jackals and other dangerous animals, then we will do it,'' Noble said.
``But what we would dearly like to do is to get them down in Egypt near the pyramids''.
Piccard broke into tears when controllers told him there should be enough fuel and that weather conditions were right for a landing in Egypt --a total journey of 29,206 miles.
In a satellite telephone linkup, Piccard said he was using self-hypnosis to calm himself and cope with tension that has accumulated during the 19-day odyssey.
``There's a lot of stress,'' said Piccard, 41, who comes from a family of pioneers and is making his third round-the-world bid.
``It's really not a picnic''.
``It is right down to the wire,'' said Jones, a 51-year-old balloon instructor.
``Of course we're hopeful and we're secretly confident, but we can't sit back in our chairs and make the winds take us there''.
After weeks of frustrating delays, Piccard and Jones set off from the Swiss Alps on March 1.
They drifted down to North Africa and then crossed toward Asia.
Unlike rival balloonists, the Breitling Orbiter crew had an advantage in that they got permission to pass over southern China, a move that saved them vital time.
They then picked up a fast jet stream over the Pacific before grinding to a near halt over Central America.
There the pilots developed breathing problems and got the shivers as their small cabin chilled to 46 degrees.
``We were very stressed and very cold,'' Piccard recounted.
``But now it's all going well again and we've put it behind us as a bad dream''.
The balloon finally picked up a jet stream again Thursday.
Early Friday, they beat the endurance record set two weeks ago by two British balloonists who later ditched in bad weather near Japan.
Once at its destination, the balloon probably will hover and make its final descent at dawn Sunday but a night landing was not out of the question, Noble said.
``We do have night vision goggles onboard, which are fairly powerful.
But the desert is not all sand dunes.
There are quite a few mansions there, which would be uncomfortable.''
GENEVA, March 24 (Xinhua) --The International Olympic Committee said Wednesday that they will award the Olympic Order to balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones who are the first to circumnavigate the world in a balloon.
Piccard of Switzerland and Briton Jones joined the first man on the moon, American astronaut Neil Armstrong, and other aeronautical legends such as Charles Lindbergh as recipients of the higly-valued award.
Achieving what promoters called the last great milestone of aviation, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones joined legends like the Wright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh with Saturday's completion of the first manned round-the-world balloon flight.
At 4:54 a.m.
EST Saturday, the two balloonists crossed the line of longitude from which they had departed on March 1 at Chateau D'Oex, Switzerland, officially earning them the long-sought title of the first balloon circumnavigation of the globe, as well as a $1 million prize.
The pair hoped to land at about dawn Sunday in Egypt, unless their dwindling fuel supply forces them to come down earlier.
Speaking to his ground crew in Switzerland, Piccard acknowledged that much of the achievement was due to forces far beyond the pilots' control.
``We're really grateful for the invisible hand that guided us through all obstacles,'' he said.
Piccard, a 41-year-old Swiss psychiatrist, is the latest in a family of explorers and record-setters.
It was Auguste Piccard, his grandfather, who in 1931 became the first human to reach the stratosphere, the first to see the earth's curvature firsthand, and the inventor of the pressurized cabin, which opened up the frontier of aviation to regular passenger travel.
And it was his father, Jacques, who in 1960 set a record that still stands Sunday for the deepest ocean dive, taking the bathyscaphe Trieste nearly 7 miles deep in the Pacific Ocean's Mariana Trench.
In addition to his illustrious forebears, Piccard grew up among astronauts as his father worked for the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
``During my childhood, I have seen a lot of adventurers, and this gave me the wish to explore something on this beautiful earth,'' Piccard said two years ago, just before making the first of his three attempts at the record.
Despite the millions of dollars spent by each team for equipment and the support crews needed for such voyages, success hinged on a combination of luck, politics and fortitude.
At least two previous attempts that might have had a chance at succeeding were stymied by failure to get overflight permission from China and Libya, forcing them to divert into less favorable wind patterns.
This flight, too, was forced to detour to honor China's requirement to stay south of 26 degrees latitude, but was still able to stay in the high-speed jetstream needed to propel it to the finish line.
There has been an intense but friendly informal competition for the round-the-world title since 1993, using innovative balloon designs.
While one record after another was set for distance traveled and for time aloft, all these earlier efforts ended up being thwarted by bad weather, technical malfunctions, or political obstacles.
But in the process, the design of high-tech versions of the venerable Rozier balloon has progressed enormously, bringing aviation's oldest design straight into the space age.
Satellite navigation systems monitor the balloons' positions, satellite communications keep them in touch with their control centers, and satellite weather monitoring provides the guidance essential to success _ and survival.
Even the most high-tech balloon is still at the mercy of the winds, its only means of control being to rise or fall in order to catch the winds that seem to be going in the most promising direction.
It was the invention of the modern Rozier balloon that made the feat possible, by using modern lightweight plastics for the balloon itself and by combining the advantages of the two principal types of balloons: helium and hot air.
Helium's advantage is that it requires no fuel to maintain its lifting power; its drawback is that as it expands from the sun's heat, it threatens to tear a balloon apart and must be vented, depleting its supply.
Hot air can provide lifting power whenever it is needed, but only by carrying huge fuel supplies to heat the air; when the fuel runs out, the balloon comes down.
But a Rozier combines both, taking advantage of helium's lift during daylight, and supplementing it at night with hot air.
While there is no obvious practical benefit from this spectacular feat, the technological advances in balloon design engendered by the competition may well end up benefiting scientific research.
Scientists already use unpiloted high-altitude balloons extensively to conduct some kinds of environmental monitoring and astronomical studies that require a perch high above most of the atmosphere.
Fellow balloonist Richard Branson, whose latest attempt to circle the world ended with a landing off Hawaii last Christmas because of bad weather ahead, immediately sent his congratulatious to the rival team Saturday, calling it a ``magnificent achievement''.
For the adventurers themselves, the achievement still hadn't quite sunk in.
``We are having great difficulty realizing our dreams have come true,'' Piccard said.
``We are with the angels.''
GENEVA, January 12 (Xinhua) --A Swiss and a Belgium were forced to abandon their attempt to tour around the world without stop by balloon six hours after they took off from the Swiss Alpine resort of Chateau d'Oex this morning.
The two men, Bertrand Piccard and Wim Verstraeten, were rescued by French helicopters in the Mediterranean where their balloon landed because fuel from the heating system had leaked into the cabin, according to a report by Swiss Radio International.
They are reportedly safe and sound.
The pressured cabin in which the two were staying is of five tons with a dimension of five meters long and two meters wide.
CAIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) --After nearly a 20-day voyage, Swiss Bertrand Piccard and British Brian Jones completed their nonstop circumnavigation on a hot-air balloon and landed in southern Egypt smoothly Sunday morning.
The Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon landed gently at 08:03 local time (0603 GMT) at Mut, a town in the Kakhla Oasis 485 kilometers southwest of Cairo, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
The 54-meter-high silver balloon floated over Mauritania Saturday past longitude 9 degrees west to complete the 41,841-kilometer-plus circumnavigation and set a record for an around-the-world voyage without a stop.
Piccard, a 41-year-old psychiatrist, and Jones, a 51-year-old instructor and grandfather, had intended to land near the pyramids on the outskirts of Cairo, but unfavorable winds kept them southwest of their goal.
GENEVA, January 28 (Xinhua) --Three Europeans were preparing Wednesday to set off from Switzerland in the quest to circle the world non-stop in a balloon, spokesman Gerard Sermier said.
Pilots Bertrand Piccard from Switzerland and Wim Verstraeten from Belgium, plus flight engineer Andy Elson from Britain, were planning to depart around 8:30 a.m.
(0730 GMT) from Chateau d'Oex, in western Switzerland, aboard the Breitling Orbiter II.
The balloonists' plan is to soar quickly to nearly 8,000 meters and drift towards Italy and Greece, reaching the Middle East on Saturday.
From there, they hope to ride jetstreams that should move them along in an east-bound direction at around 200 kilometers an hour at 10,000 meters.
If luck holds, Brietling Orbiter II will complete its globe-girdling adventure in 10 to 20 days.
British entrepreneur Richard Branson, who plans to set off from Morocco in a few days in a rival attempt to circle the world, wished the Brietling Orbiter II team good luck.
An Arizona man trying to become the first solo balloonist to complete a nonstop trip around the world was speeding over India Thursday, hoping to steer clear of the Himalayas.
The pilot, Kevin Uliassi, was nearly halfway through his journey, which began in Rockford, Ill.
, on Feb.
22. After some slow going in the early days of the flight, Uliassi's balloon, the J.
Renee, found better winds and at midweek was traveling at about 100 miles an hour, said Scott Lorenz, a spokesman.
``The plan is to fly south of the Himalayas,'' Lorenz said from the mission's headquarters in Homewood, Ill.
, near Chicago.
``Right now it looks like he'll be able to do that''.
Uliassi was flying at 31,000 feet, not much higher than Mt.
Everest, and was anticipating thunderstorms.
Uliassi has permission to fly over China, which he is expected to do in the next several days before heading out over the Pacific.
He packed enough fuel for about 20 days, Lorenz said, and thinks he has enough to complete his trip.
Should Uliassi do so, landing east of Rockford, he would be the third balloonist to circumnavigate the world nonstop.
The first two, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of Britain, completed a 20-day trip together last March, ending in the Egyptian desert.
Like those two, Uliassi is flying a hybrid balloon called a Rozier type, which uses two huge sealed nylon bags, one containing helium and the other air.
The air, heated by propane burners, keeps the helium from contracting at night, helping the balloon to maintain altitude.
Unlike Piccard and Jones, though, Uliassi is flying in an unpressurized crew compartment.
He has spent most of the trip with an oxygen mask strapped on his face, and wears a sensor on a finger that will sound an alarm if the level of oxygen in his blood gets too low.
Uliassi is well rested, Lorenz said, and in good spirits despite the cramped conditions and thunderstorms over Egypt that bounced the craft up and down.
He communicates with his volunteer support team by e-mail and satellite phone.
This is Uliassi's second attempt to fly around the world.
The first, in 1997, ended several hours after liftoff when his balloon burst.
Uliassi, a mechanical engineer, designed the 140-foot balloon with some assistance from his wife, after whom it is named.
In particular, she helped him with the crew compartment, marking the dimensions around him as he lay on the floor of their Scottsdale apartment.
``If he had it to do all over again,'' Lorenz said, ``he'd build it one foot bigger all the way around.''
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) --Fatigued and chilled but exhilarated by their success, two adventurers soared over the Dominican Republic on the back of strengthening winds in a final push to become the first balloonists to circle the globe nonstop.
Pilots Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland have flown further than any balloonist before, traveling more than 21,625 miles after leaving the Swiss Alps on March 1.
``If we could only find a fast jet stream and whiz across the Atlantic, that would be great,'' Brian Smith, a flight controller, said from a control tower in Geneva.
Prospects for a quick Atlantic crossing --the team hopes to make it across and complete the round-the-world odyssey by Saturday or early Sunday -- picked up after the Breitling Orbiter balloon found strong winds at 34,500 feet.
It was traveling at 83 mph.
``They had a low day yesterday when they slowed down and things didn't look very good.
Today it's very positive, they've got better winds than (had been) forecast,'' said Jones' wife, Joanna, working a 14-hour day at the control center.
She said the team was over the Domincan Republic and preparing for the Atlantic crossing.
``I think their spirits will soar when they start a crossing because it's the last leg,'' she said.
Despite thermal underwear, the pilots were shivering in the balloon's cabin, where the temperature was 46 degrees.
The team raced across the Pacific in six days and scooted over Mexico on Wednesday, with winds pushing them to speeds of 115 mph.
But they slowed after being ejected from the jet stream and started to drift.
``It's been a tiring day, one of the most difficult,'' Smith said Wednesday.
He added that the balloonists ``have been fantastic, fatigued but in very good spirits''.
Despite concerns about communications and fuel consumption, Smith said the pilots were confident they would make it to North Africa and complete the trip.
The Anheuser-Busch brewery company of St.
Louis is offering $500,000 to the first balloonists to make it around the world, and an equal amount to the charity of the winners' choice.
In their first attempt at circumnavigating the world, the two have beat the record set last year by American millionaire Steve Fossett, British tycoon Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand of Sweden.
The three ditched their balloon off Hawaii in December after flying 13,751 miles, more than halfway around the globe.
Early today, the chances of Jones and Piccard flying all the way to Egypt's pyramids, as Jones had hoped to do, appeared ``quite improbable,'' Smith said.
The pilots now hope to land further west, in Morocco.
If the two make it, the pair will have conquered one of the last great tests facing balloonists.
``Our No.
1 choice right now would be outside the best hotel in Casablanca, with a large'' parking lot, Smith said.
LONDON (AP) --A pair of British balloonists trying to circumnavigate the Earth had a surprise visit Friday when they crossed the path of a Boeing 747.
Andy Elson and Colin Prescot were flying 25,000 feet over the South China Sea on Friday when the captain of a passing airliner radioed a request to approach the balloon, the team's London spokesmen said.
The balloonists agreed, and when they looked out their observation dome they saw hundreds of passengers peering out of windows and snapping pictures.
``It was an amazing sight for us, particularly seeing so many friendly faces smiling at us after only having each other to stare at during the past 16 days,'' Elson was quoted as saying.
Neither the pilots nor ground control could identify the airline.
By Friday, the two were over the Taiwan Straits southeast of the China coast, heading for northern Japan and a jet stream they hope will catapult them across the Pacific to British Columbia.
With a second balloon team moving steadily along behind them, the British pair hope to pick up speed on the crossing to North America and in about two weeks' time to become the first balloonists to fly nonstop around the world.
Their Cable and Wireless balloon, which launched from Spain on Feb.
17, has broken balloon endurance records for time aloft.
Prescot and Elson have been painstakingly negotiating the winds of North Africa, the Indian subcontinent and south Asia to avoid being drawn into China, which has denied them permission to fly through its air space.
An Anglo-Swiss team of balloonists, meanwhile, picked up altitude and speed over Africa's Sahara Desert after chipping off icicles that weighed down the craft and wasted fuel.
Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Briton Brian Jones climbed out of the hi-tech gondola of the Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon to break off some of the icicles with an ice pick on Thursday.
CHATEAU D'OEX, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard announced Wednesday that he has chosen Brian Jones as his teammate for his next attempt at circling the world in a balloon.
Jones, 52, replaces fellow British flight engineer Tony Brown.
A statement from Piccard's organization said Jones had been training as a backup pilot for more than a year.
Brown stood down by mutual agreement after differences between the pilots emerged, ``particularly in the area of crew resource management,'' it added.
The new Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon is to take off from Chateau d'Oex, a resort in the Swiss Alps, as soon as weather conditions are favorable.
The team says it is technically ready to fly.
It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop.
Four other teams, including a combination of Virgin boss Richard Branson and Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett, are also planning bids for the record.
Branson and Fossett are to take off from Marrakech, Morocco.
The other takeoff points are Alice Springs, Australia; Chicago; and Albuquerque, N.M.
Jones has been responsible for the building of the gondola and flight systems for Piccard's new balloon.
An offer by Brown to give technical expertise and advice during the balloon's flight has been accepted, the Breitling team said.
&UR; (agh-gm)
GENEVA (AP) --The Swiss-British team hoping to be the first to fly a balloon around the world nonstop passed south of Japan today, trying to avoid thunderstorms that ended the flight of a rival team this week.
The adventurers, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of England, steered their balloon over the Pacific Ocean toward Hawaii and California or Mexico, their control center said.
They are expected to fly over the ocean for six days instead of hugging the Asian coastline and hitting North America farther north.
``What frightens us most about crossing the Pacific is bad weather in an area where rescue will be long and possibly difficult,'' the control center quoted Jones as saying.
``I'm just hoping we won't bump into any bad weather''.
Piccard and Jones were flying at 55 mph at an altitude of 26,200 feet.
They have covered about than 12,000 miles since taking off March 1 from the Swiss Alps.
The control center said the balloonists were so concerned about the Pacific they didn't take time to celebrate crossing China, one of the major hurdles of their trip.
The Chinese allowed them to pass through a narrow strip and reminded them three times during the 14-hour crossing that they were sometimes less than 25 miles from the no-fly zone.
Piccard, who had to abandon an attempt last year because he failed to receive permission to cross China, delayed his departure from Switzerland this year until he got Beijing's approval.
British balloonists Colin Prescot and Andy Elson gave up over the Pacific last Sunday after having to detour south because they lacked Chinese permission.
WASHINGTON (AP) --The capsule that carried balloonists on the first nonstop hot air trip around the globe went on permanent display Thursday in the National Air and Space Museum, next to the Wright brothers' plane and the craft that carried man to the moon.
Balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, who made their journey over 19 days in March, beamed as museum officials showed off the neon orange passenger compartment of their Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon.
It rests at ground level in the ``Milestones of Flight'' gallery, adjacent to the Wright brothers' Flyer, Charles Lindbergh's ``Spirit of St.
Louis,'' Chuck Yeager's supersonic Bell X-1 and the Apollo 11 command module.
Officials from the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, an international aeronautics body, also presented Piccard and Jones with papers certifying three world records: distance, duration and shortest time around the world.
``I think for Brian and I, the flight really ends today, because finally, after going around the world, the Breitling Orbiter 3 has landed,'' said Piccard.
``It's almost like a circle has been closed, has been finished''.
Jones expressed amazement at their accomplishment and new honor.
``When people use our names in the same sentence as John Glenn, Neil Armstrong and the Wright brothers, we still tend to look over our shoulders to see who they're talking about.
There is a sense of disbelief which pervades still and, I think, will last a long time,'' he said.
Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and Jones, an English balloonist, began their journey March 1, lifting away from the village of Chateau D'Oex in Switzerland.
They headed south, caught favorable winds around the equator and circled the Earth from west to east in 19 days, 21 hours and 47 minutes.
They landed March 21 in the Egyptian desert.
While the crew's computers showed they traveled 29,056 miles, the federation determined that they had traveled 25,361 miles after subtracting twists and turns.
During the trip, the balloonists lived in a pill-shaped pressurized compartment the size of a minivan, flying as high as 36,000 feet and moving at up to 105 mph.
The gondola contains a galley, two bunks, a toilet and the instruments and controls to operate the balloon.
Some of the cylinders that carried the liquid propane used to heat the balloon's 181-foot-tall envelope still hang on the outside.
The velope itself is too big to be displayed.
Instead, the public will see a piece of it.
Other pieces will be displayed in museums around the world.
Besides earning a place of distinction in the museum --part of the Smithsonian Institution -- Piccard and Jones have already received another reward for their record-breaking journey: Anheuser-Busch Cos.
, the beer brewer, paid them $1 million for becoming the first to circumnavigate the globe in a hot-air balloon.
They said they will use some of the money to start the Winds of Hope Foundation, which will award prizes each March 21 to those who are committed, in Piccard's words, to ``fighting against forgotten sufferances.''
Japan Marks Subway Nerve Gas Attack TOKYO (AP) --Station employees bowed their heads in prayer and victims' relatives placed flowers on subway platforms today in ceremonies marking the fourth anniversary of the deadly nerve gas attack on Tokyo's subways.
At a station in central Tokyo, 30 subway workers and a dozen victims' relatives gathered and offered their prayers at 8 a.m. local time --the time that members of the Aum Shinri Kyo doomsday cult released the poisonous gas on five Tokyo subway lines in 1995.
Twelve people were killed and 5,300 were injured in that attack.
America West Dodges Major Strike PHOENIX (AP) --In last minute negotiations, flight attendants and America West Airlines have reached a contract agreement.
The move ends a four-year fight over pay that brought the airline to the brink of a strike.
The 2,300 flight attendants were free to strike after 12:01 a.m.
EST Saturday, but three days of talks with federal mediators in Washington resulted in a settlement.
A possible strike threatened to leave up to 100,000 passengers stranded this weekend.
Global Balloonists Sail Over Africa GENEVA (AP) --GENEVA (AP) -- Two adventurers neared North Africa early today and their dream of becoming the first people to circumnavigate Earth nonstop in a balloon.
Near exhaustion on the 20th day in their shiny red capsule hanging from a massive silver balloon, Brian Jones of Britain and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland faced the decision of crossing the finish line and touching down soon after, probably in Mali, or riding the jet stream hundreds of miles farther to a more dramatic landing near the pyramids in Egypt.
Peace Monitors Depart Kosovo PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) --International monitors sent here five months ago to shore up a failed cease-fire were leaving Kosovo Saturday, while a determined NATO and defiant Serbs geared up for a showdown over the future of this rebellious province.
Meanwhile in Washington, President Clinton warned that the collapse of peace talks in Paris had raised the stakes and ``if we and our allies don't have the will to act, there will be more massacres''.
NATO has threatened massive airstrikes against Serb-led Yugoslavia if President Slobodan Milosevic does not accept a peace plan providing for sweeping autonomy for Kosovo and NATO troops to police the accord.
Train Crash Investigation Ending BOURBONNAIS, Ill.
(AP) --Federal investigators are wrapping up their work at the site of a deadly Amtrak train-truck accident.
Officials have released a list of the eleven people who were killed in Monday night's collision between a truck and the train.
The question of when the truck driver entered the track crossing remains unanswered.
National Transportation Safety Board investigator J.S.
Dunn said ``a number of people'' claiming to have witnessed the crash that killed 11 had come forward and that their stories would be checked.
Greece Considers Oscar Winner ATHENS, Greece (AP) --Greeks who succeed abroad usually find their greatest admirers back in their ancestral home -- Elia Kazan gets a very different reception.
The filmmaker son of Greek-American immigrants won't receive much applause when he receives a lifetime achievement Academy Award on Sunday --his third Oscar.
Kazan, 89, won Oscars for ``Gentleman's Agreement'' in 1947 and ``On the Waterfront'' in 1954.
But many Greek artists and others refuse to forgive Kazan's decision to identify Communist Party members in Hollywood during the ``blacklist'' hearings in Washington nearly 50 years ago.
Dow Closes Week at 9,903.55 NEW YORK (AP) --A poor showing for the bluest of the blue-chip stocks dragged the Dow Jones industrial average lower Friday, ending its strongest run yet past 10,000.
The Dow fell 94.07 to close at 9,903.55 and the Nasdaq finished at 2,421.49, down 41.47.
Graf Beats Capriati at Lipton KEY BISCAYNE, Fla.
(AP) --Two comebacks collided Friday, as Steffi Graf showed no mercy with a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Jennifer Capriati in the second round at the Lipton Championships.
``That's the best she's ever played against me,'' Capriati said.
The 29-year-old Graf, slowed by injuries for much of the past two years, is seeking her first tournament title since November.
Based on Friday's performance, she's a threat to upstage such youngsters as Martina Hingis and the Williams sisters.
Islanders End Winless Streak VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) --Rookie Mike Watt scored the go-ahead goal as the New York Islanders snapped an eight-game winless skid with a 3-1 win against the Vancouver Canucks on Friday night.
Mark Lawrence and Bryan Smolinski, who sealed the win scoring with 2:03 left, also scored for the Islanders in a battle of last-place teams.
AP NewsBrief by DAN BOYLAN
GENEVA, January 7 (Xinhua) --A Swiss, Belgium and British team aiming to set a round-the-world ballooning record have delayed their start by 24 hours to Friday to take advantage of more favourable winds, a spokesman said on Wednesday.
"The weather is perfect for Friday," Christine Zwingmann said.
The team, composed of Bertrand Piccard, Wim Verstraeten and Andy Elson had been due to lift-off from Chateau d'oex in the Swiss alps on Thursday morning.
However, winds announced for Friday seem to be better, Zwingmann said.
British entrepreneur Richard Branson has declared his bid to jump into the race again in mid-January after an aborted mission in December.
MEXICO CITY (AP) --A Swiss-English balloon team soared over Mexico early today after completing a six-day journey across the Pacific Ocean in an attempt to become the first balloonists to travel nonstop around the world.
``So, that little puddle is what they call the Pacific,'' Brian Jones of England deadpanned in a message sent to the team's support crew in Geneva.
The support crew in Geneva popped open a bottle of champagne as the balloon approached the Mexican coast.
``We're pleased that the Pacific is now behind them,'' flight controller Brian Smith said.
Jones and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland, who lifted off from the Swiss Alps on March 1, were over Belize in Central America this morning.
They were heading into the Caribbean toward Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti, the control center said in a statement.
The team will try to pick up a stream over the eastern Caribbean by Friday and then head for North Africa.
At the moment, it is expected to cross the ``finish'' line in Mauritania --somewhere along longitude 9 degrees west -- Saturday afternoon.
If the team makes it to North Africa, it will have traveled more than 26,000 miles around the world and Piccard and Jones will have conquered one of the last great challenges facing aviators.
``If I get there, I really won't be able to believe it,'' Piccard told Swiss Television.
The Anheuser-Busch company is offering a $1 million prize --$500,000 to the first person or team to make it, and $500,000 to the charity of the winner's choice.
Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett, British tycoon Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand of Sweden were forced to ditch their balloon off Hawaii on Dec.
25 after flying around more than half the globe.
A U.S.-Australian team canceled its planned attempt in mid-January.
On March 7, two British balloonists abandoned their attempt because of bad weather, landing in the Pacific near Japan.
Smith said Piccard and Jones set a record on Tuesday, breaking the old mark for longest distance flown in a balloon: 14,236 miles.
The Pacific crossing was sluggish at first, with the Breitling Orbiter balloon slowing at times to 30 mph.
But the team managed to catch a ride on the jetstream southeast of Hawaii.
The balloonists cruised over Mexico at 53 mph at an altitude of 36,000 feet, their control center reported.
The center said the speed helped conserve propane, which fuels the burners in the lower, hot-air section of the balloon.
The burners are needed to keep the balloon afloat.
The center said it still is unable to predict where the balloon will land if it reaches North Africa, but that it probably won't make it as far as the pyramids, where Jones had hoped to come down It said predictions of the landing spot will probably begin Thursday and will get progressively more accurate.
House Committee Approves Budget WASHINGTON (AP) --Republicans pushed a $1.74 trillion budget for fiscal 2000 through a House committee Wednesday and were a hair's breadth from prevailing in a Senate panel after GOP lawmakers crushed Democratic attempts to block tax cuts.
By a 22-18 party-line vote, the House Budget Committee approved a spending plan by Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, that promises to leave Social Security surpluses alone while reducing taxes and increasing defense, education and several other programs.
Simultaneously, the Senate Budget Committee moved toward approving a similar plan.
That panel planned to complete its work tomorrow.
Weapons Labs Get New Security WASHINGTON (AP) --Energy Secretary Bill Richardson imposed new security measures for national weapons laboratories Wednesday and ordered an internal investigation into whether a department official was prevented from briefing Congress on alleged Chinese espionage.
Richardson outlined the new measures in a closed-door hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
The committee was questioning Richardson on how the Clinton administration responded when it first learned of an inquiry into the alleged Chinese theft of top-secret nuclear warhead technology from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1980s.
Retired Maj.
Gen. Is Fined FORT LEWIS, Wash.
(AP) --A retired Army general who pleaded guilty to conduct unbecoming for having affairs with four subordinates' wives was reprimanded Wednesday and fined $10,000.
In exchange for the plea, prosecutors dropped nine other charges against Maj.
Gen. David Hale, 53.
If he had been convicted on the original charges, Hale could have faced 56 years in prison.
Balloon Team Nears Jamaica GENEVA (AP) --A Swiss-English balloon team was about 300 miles from Jamaica late Wednesday night and hoped to catch the next jet stream over the eastern Caribbean, the control center said.
The pilots, Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland, hope to reach the North African coast at Mauritania, perhaps by Saturday evening.
If they make it, the pair will have conquered one of the last great challenges facing aviators.
Jones and Piccard have traveled more than 20,500 miles since lifting off from the Swiss Alps on March 1.
Tire Marks Key to Train Probe BOURBONNAIS, Ill.
(AP) --Investigators are analyzing tire tracks in the mud to determine whether the truck driver at the center of a deadly Amtrak crash had tried to go around the crossing gates and beat the train.
The crash between the tractor-trailer and Amtrak's City of New Orleans killed 11 people Monday night in the nation's deadliest train wreck in three years.
Tire marks were found on the road, on timbers at the crossing and in the mud along the shoulder of the road, said Bob Lauby, director of the National Transportation Safety Board's office of railroad safety.
Anesthesia Deaths Raise Concern WASHINGTON (AP) --A spate of deaths -- most from cosmetic surgeries, but also among children undergoing dental work or MRI scans -- has experts questioning the safety of sedation in private doctors' offices.
More surgery is moving to such offices, sometimes performed by physicians with little experience in handling powerful sedating drugs and little equipment to save patients who get into trouble, says Dr.
John Neeld, president of the American Society of Anesthesiology.
Nobody counts how many deaths or injuries result from office-administered anesthesia.
Spring Floods Are Forecast WASHINGTON (AP) --The Weather Service's annual spring flood forecast Wednesday pointed to North Dakota and the Pacific Northwest as potential danger spots.
The area of greatest flooding potential is along the Red River in North Dakota and Devil's Lake, N.D.
Each year, floods kill 100-140 Americans and cause an average of $4.5 billion in damage.
Stocks Edge Higher in Japan TOKYO (AP) --Japanese stocks edged higher Thursday as investors snapped up banking and securities shares.
The Nikkei rose 12.23 points to 16,280.34 by midday.
In New York, the Dow ended down 51.06 at 9,879.41.
Heat Beat Hawks 86-85 ATLANTA (AP) --Tim Hardaway scored 24 points and Miami survived a 3-point barrage by the Atlanta Hawks, holding on for an 86-85 victory Wednesday night that stretched the Heat's winning streak to six.
Mookie Blaylock had a chance to win it for Atlanta but missed a desperation jumper from the corner as time expired to end the Hawks' four-game winning streak, their longest of the season.
Miami led nearly the entire game and held an 82-72 advantage after P.J.
Brown hit a 12-foot jumper with 4:11 remaining.
AP NewsBrief by SUZANNE ROWLAND
GENEVA, January 28 (Xinhua) --Three Europeans set off Wednesday from Switzerland in the latest quest to circle the world non-stop in a balloon, organizers said.
Pilots Bertrand Piccard from Switzerland and Wim Verstraeten from Belgium, plus flight engineer Andy Elson from Britain, departed from Chateau d'Oex, in western Switzerland, aboard Breitling Orbiter II.
Their 53-meter-high combined helium and hot-air balloon slowly lifted off at 9:55 a.m.
(0855 GMT) in cold, calm air with 5,000 spectators on hand to wish it a safe journey.
It briefly descended, but rose again when the crew dropped ballast from their bright orange pressurized basket.
The balloonists' plan was to soar quickly to nearly 8,000 meters and drift towards Italy and Greece, reaching the Middle East on Saturday.
Brietling Orbiter II is scheduled to complete its globe-girdling adventure in 10 to 20 days.
BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland is optimistic that China will soon grant a Swiss-based balloon team permission to overfly the country in its quest for the first nonstop round- the-world flight, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said Monday.
The Breitling Orbiter 3 team said last week it had to postpone its attempt due to Chinese irritation over the failure of rivals Steve Fossett, Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand to respect previously agreed conditions.
The Swiss foreign ministry is in constant contact with China and is doing all it can to obtain clearance for pilot Bertrand Piccard and his new partner, Brian Jones of Britain, said ministry spokeswoman Monika Schmutz.
Piccard and Jones, who had obtained conditional permission, had previously said they might take off as soon as Sunday.
It would be Piccard's third attempt to become the first person to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop.
Beijing originally gave British tycoon Branson, Chicago millionaire Fossett and Lindstrand, of Sweden, permission to cross China below 26 degrees north latitude.
The trio, however, drifted further north last Monday.
After diplomatic communications between Britain and China, the balloonists were allowed to continue flying as long as they left China as quickly as possible.
Caught in poor weather conditions, the team splashed down off Hawaii Friday.
Piccard's last round-the-world bid was abandoned after China refused his balloon entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed to speed it over the Pacific.
Another attempt at the balloon record was stalled Monday by strong winds over the Re/Max team's launch pad in Alice Springs, Australia.

GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard and his new teammate, British flight engineer Tony Brown, said Thursday they will be ready later this month for a new attempt to fly nonstop round the world.
Their new Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon will take off from Chateau d'Oex, in the Swiss Alps, as soon after Nov.
25 as weather conditions are favorable, they said.
It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world.
In February the Swiss pilot, along with British flight engineer Andy Elson and Belgian pilot Wim Verstraeten, broke the record for the longest time spent in the air by a balloon, landing in Myanmar, also Burma, after a flight lasting 9 days, 17 hours and 55 minutes.
The balloon's round-the-world bid was abandoned after China refused it entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed to speed it over the Pacific.
But the team has already received conditional permission from China for this attempt, flight director Alan Noble told a news conference in Geneva.
This will be the last flight sponsored by Swiss watchmaker Breitling, he added.
The balloon's route should take it across the Mediterranean Sea, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, China and Japan before crossing the Pacific and North America and returning to Europe, a three-week journey of some 26,700 kilometers (16,600 miles).
Piccard said he believed the two men would work well together in the cramped conditions of the balloon's cabin.
``We are very different.
There will be Tony, there will be me, and there will be both of us together,'' he said.
Two of the Breitling team's challengers, Virgin boss Richard Branson and Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett, are joining forces for their own latest attempt.
In August, Fossett broke his own distance record, traveling more than 24,461 kilometers (15,200 miles) before a storm damaged his balloon, sending it plunging into the sea off Australia.

GENEVA (AP) --The Swiss and British balloonists aiming to be the first to circle the world nonstop floated over the Pacific Ocean Thursday after making it across China, their Geneva control center said.
By early Thursday, Swiss pilot Bertrand Piccard and his British teammate Brian Jones had passed over Taiwan and were setting a course for a six-day journey across the ocean.
If all goes well, the balloon will reach California or western Mexico next.
A spokesman said the two pilots saw little of China because of clouds below them as they crossed inside the zone agreed by the Chinese government.
Piccard and Jones, who took off March 1 from the Swiss Alps, have covered more than 10,500 miles.
The balloon's speed has increased in the past few days.
By early Thursday, it was nearly five miles high and traveling at 95 mph.
Its average speed since launch has been 47 mph.
The control center said the balloon had been forbidden from flying north of the 26th parallel across China because the authorities ``could not guarantee our safety''.
Several times during the 14-hour crossing, the balloon came within 25 miles of the forbidden zone, and Chinese authorities pointed it out to the crew three times, the control center said.
Piccard, who had to abandon an attempt last year because he failed to receive permission to cross China, delayed his departure from Switzerland this year until he got Beijing's approval.
British balloonists Colin Prescot and Andy Elson ditched in the Pacific last Sunday after having to detour south because they lacked Chinese permission.
Budget Approved by House Committee WASHINGTON (AP) --Republicans pushed a $1.74 trillion budget for fiscal 2000 through a House committee Wednesday.
By a 22-18 party-line vote, the House Budget Committee approved a spending plan by Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, that promises to leave Social Security surpluses alone while reducing taxes and increasing defense, education and several other programs.
Simultaneously, the Senate Budget Committee moved toward approving a similar plan.
Weapons Labs To Be More Secure WASHINGTON (AP) --Energy Secretary Bill Richardson imposed new security measures for national weapons laboratories Wednesday and ordered an internal investigation into whether a department official was prevented from briefing Congress on alleged Chinese espionage.
Richardson outlined the new measures in a closed-door hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
The committee was questioning Richardson on how the Clinton administration responded when it first learned of an inquiry into the alleged Chinese theft of top-secret nuclear warhead technology from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1980s.
Train Probe Hinges on Tire Marks BOURBONNAIS, Ill.
(AP) --Investigators are analyzing tire tracks in the mud to determine whether the truck driver at the center of a deadly Amtrak crash had tried to go around the crossing gates and beat the train.
The crash between the tractor-trailer and Amtrak's City of New Orleans killed 11 people Monday night in the nation's deadliest train wreck in three years.
Tire marks were found on the road, on timbers at the crossing and in the mud along the shoulder of the road, said Bob Lauby, director of the National Transportation Safety Board's office of railroad safety.
African Life Expectancy Cut by AIDS WASHINGTON (AP) --AIDS has cut the average life expectancy in Zimbabwe by a quarter-century, the U.S.
Census Bureau reports.
Life expectancy in Zimbabwe is now 39 years, down from 65 were it not for the AIDS epidemic, the bureau said in a report being released Thursday.
Other African nations also have experienced significant reductions in life expectancy because of AIDS.
``AIDS results in higher mortality rates in childhood, as well as among young adults where mortality otherwise is low,'' said a contributing author of the Census Bureau's new report, ``World Population Profile: 1998''.
Balloon Team Flies Over Caribbean GENEVA (AP) --A Swiss-English balloon team was about 300 miles from Jamaica late Wednesday night.
The team hoped to catch the next jet stream over the eastern Caribbean, the control center said.
The pilots, Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland, hope to reach the North African coast at Mauritania, perhaps by Saturday evening.
If they make it, the pair will have conquered one of the last great challenges facing aviators.
Jones and Piccard have traveled more than 20,500 miles since lifting off from the Swiss Alps on March 1.
Hale-Bopp May Be a Cosmic Leftover NEW YORK (AP) --The comet Hale-Bopp may be brimming with some of the primordial material from which the sun and the planets formed more than 4 billion years ago, researchers reported Thursday in the journal Nature.
California Institute of Technology scientists who tuned radio telescopes onto the comet's nucleus as it cut across the solar system in 1997 found vents spewing a volatile mixture of gas and dust into space.
Comets are often called dirty snowballs.
Most orbit far from the sun in the deep freeze beyond Pluto's orbit.
That enables them to remain virtually unchanged over billions of years.
Japan Stocks Close Sharply Lower TOKYO (AP) --Japanese stocks plunged Thursday as investors took profits following a recent dramatic rally.
The Nikkei fell 550.19 points, or 3.38 percent, to finish the day at 15,717.92.
In New York on Wednesday, the Dow ended down 51.06 at 9,879.41.
Spurs Beat Warriors Spurs 82-78 OAKLAND, Calif.
(AP) --Tim Duncan had 17 points and 17 rebounds as the San Antonio Spurs won their ninth straight game with an 82-78 victory over the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night.
Malik Rose had 17 points off the bench for the Spurs and reserve guard Steve Kerr added 14 to help compensate for cold shooting by San Antonio starters David Robinson (1-for-8) and Sean Elliott (2-for-10).

Having floated some 20,000 miles over Europe, Africa, Asia, the Pacific Ocean and Central America, the Breitling Orbiter 3 headed into the home stretch over the Atlantic Ocean Wednesday in its bid to become the first balloon to circle the world nonstop.
The prospect that the Breitling's crew, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, may succeed where all others have failed seemed more promising with each passing hour.
The Breitling ground team in Geneva forecast that the huge Swiss-registered balloon would complete its circuit of the Earth on Saturday, somewhere in North Africa.
As the Breitling balloon entered its 18th day aloft, however, the two pilots were complaining of exhaustion and said they were worried that the propane used in the balloon's burners might run out before the craft reached the finish line: 9.27 degrees west longitude.
But the team spokeswoman in Geneva, Monika Pieren, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that if wind directions and speeds correspond to the meteorological forecasts, the balloon would have enough propane to safely reach Mauritania and the goal line before fuel runs out.
The balloonists will try to avoid landing in Algeria or Libya, where they are uncertain of the political climate.
A ditching at sea has not been ruled out.
When the balloon took off from Chateau-d'Oex, Switzerland, it initially flew southwestward, reaching 9.27 degrees west longitude before catching a favorable jet stream and heading eastward around the world.
Thus, 9.27 degrees west longitude represents the finish line.
If the Breitling team makes it, they will enter the record books as winners of the last great goal of ballooning.
Many have tried before them but all have fallen far short, including the roughly 20 attempts made during the last decade alone.
Only last week a British balloon, the Cable &AMP; Wireless, was forced to end a round-the-world attempt, ditching in the Pacific Ocean.
Piccard, a Swiss psychiatrist, and his co-pilot, Brian Jones, a 52-year-old British balloonist, stand to win a $1 million prize and cup from Anheuser-Busch, the brewing company.
Two years ago the company offered the prize and a trophy, the Budweiser Cup, to the first balloonist to circle the world nonstop.
Gregory Hendricks, a Budweiser spokesman, said Wednesday the challenge remained in effect, and, he added: ``We're wishing good luck to the Breitling crew''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) The Breitling balloon faced staggering problems to get this far.
Besides the vagaries of wind direction and speed, there were storms to avoid and regions of dead air where the balloon might have become stuck until fuel ran out.
There were many technical problems, including the accumulation of ice on the propane burners.
Worst of all, some of the nations along the round-the-world track did not open their airspace to balloons and had to be avoided.
China gave last-minute permission, but only on condition that the balloon remain south of the 26th parallel.
Sometimes the balloon crawled at 20 miles an hour, but in stretches where the crew could exploit jet streams, the Breitling sped at more than 100 miles an hour.
On two occasions, prompted partly by the need to scrape ice off burners and partly to escape the bad-smelling air inside the crew capsule, the balloonists ventured outside their pressurized crew compartment into the frigid, thin air above 20,000 feet.
Wednesday, Piccard reported that he and Jones had been having trouble sleeping.
In his psychiatric work Piccard frequently uses hypnosis and is adept at hypnotizing himself to fall asleep.
But the technique apparently failed during the last few exhausting days. &QL;
The Breitling Orbiter 3, the first manned balloon ever to make a non-stop trip around the earth, will be permanently housed at the Air and Space Museum in Washington, its owners have announced.
The big balloon, which completed its epochal flight on March 21, has been offered a berth at the museum, taking its place with a host of other famous aircraft, including the Voyager airplane, which in 1986 completed the first unrefueled nonstop flight ever made around the world.
The Breitling was built in England, financed and registered in Switzerland and piloted by Dr.
Bertrand Piccard, who is Swiss, and Brian Jones, who is British.
The pilots completed their three-week trip when they landed in Egypt on March 21, after flying 29,055 miles.
No previous attempts came even close.
Walton Ferrell, a spokesman for the Air and Space Museum, said the balloon would arrive in Washington this autumn.
``The Breitling Orbiter 3 will take its place with the Voyager aircraft and with the Winnie May, the airplane in which Wiley Post made a series of solo flights taking him completely around the world,'' he said.
For their feat, Piccard, a psychiatrist, and Jones, a ballooning expert, will be awarded a cup and a $1 million prize from the Anheuser-Busch Corporation, half of which will be donated to charities.
The Breitling company, a maker of specialty watches, announced that the balloon and its crew capsule would be exhibited in Switzerland until mid-July at the Lucerne Transport Museum.
Thereafter, the capsule and most of the balloon will be presented to the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum.
Parts of the balloon envelope will be kept in Switzerland.
A Breitling spokesman said the entire balloon crew, including the pilots and Alan Noble, the mission director, would arrive in New York City Tuesday to begin a tour of the United States.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug.
5: &QL; The tragedy of Mark Barton in no way proves that day trading, in which he lost a lot of money quite rapidly, is evil.
But it is a reminder that technological advances have made it easier to treat stock trading as something like casino gambling.
It must be closely regulated, particularly to assure that the gamblers understand the risks.
Barton is believed to have started his killing spree in Georgia on the day that his account at one day trading firm, Momentum Securities, ran out of money with losses of more than $105,000.
Day traders, so called because they usually engage in quick purchases and sales of securities and try to end each day owning no stocks, can use modern computer technology to take speedy advantage of market anomalies, such as when a brokerage firm is slow in changing the posted price at which it is willing to buy or sell a stock.
Those opportunities were relatively large several years ago, but diminished as rules changed and markets became more efficient.
Many current day traders try to anticipate short-term price moves in volatile stocks.
Some of the most successful day traders in the old days do little trading now, and instead run classes that purport to teach people how to be successful day traders.
Barton took one such class, offered by All-Tech Investment Group, whose Internet Web site warns of risks but also says that it is not necessary to know anything about the stock market to learn to be a successful day trader.
Whatever is required, it appears that most of those who try day trading lose money at it.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and state regulators need to make sure that day trading companies disclose the risks, do not make exaggerated profit claims and do not violate the margin rules that limit how much money can be lent for stock trading.
But the regulators cannot stop foolish customers from gambling their money away.
ATLANTA _ The first civil lawsuit filed in the Buckhead rampage that left nine people dead and 13 people wounded claims a securities firm frequented by mass murderer Mark O.
Barton could have prevented the multiple killings if employees had scrutinized their traders more carefully.
Attorney Michael Weinstock said All-Tech Securities Inc.
, one of the companies where Barton traded regularly, should have known of Barton's volatile personality, given the hundreds of thousands of dollars he lost while trading there and his reaction to those losses.
The complaint, filed on behalf of Dr.
Gulsham Harjee, whose husband, Dean Delawalla, was killed by Barton while he traded at All-Tech on the afternoon of July 29, also claims the firm should have foreseen the killings because of the stressful nature inherent in the day trading arena.
Harjee declined to comment Monday.
``Despite it's knowledge of the extreme pressures of day trading, All-Tech did not screen its clients for criminal or violent tendencies or emotional stability before allowing them to participate as day traders at its facilities,'' the complaint read.
All-Tech officials should have known Barton especially posed a threat to its employees and customers, Weinstock said Tuesday.
``Barton was no choir boy,'' Weinstock said.
``Shouldn't these firms where so much pressure and high-risk trading is done every day check these people out''?
Barton was losing a lot of money, and the company chose not to check him out, Weinstock said.
``They buried their head,'' Weinstock said.
Though he had not seen the 16-page complaint, All-Tech's chief executive officer, Harry Houtkin, said he was not surprised by the suit.
``This is a tragedy,'' he said, ``but in today's litigious society, I expected this to happen''.
Harjee is seeking undetermined damages from the Piedmont Center, Barton Protective Services and Barton's estate.
Barton Protective Services, the company that provides security for the Piedmont Center, a complex of 11 buildings where All-Tech's offices are located, is not connected to Mark Barton.
The security company's chief financial officer, David Brazel, also declined comment on the suit, as did officials of the Piedmont Center.
The complaint also alleges the four parties failed to maintain a safe working environment for Delawalla and other victims and seeks damages for wrongful death, negligence, violation of a private duty, negligent supervision, negligent infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium.
Harjee also seeks assault and battery damages against Barton's estate.
Delawalla and eight other people were shot to death at All-Tech and Momentum Securities, another day trading firm where Barton was a regular.
The killings were initiated at Momentum, directly across the street from All-Tech.
At least 13 other people also were wounded.
In the two days before the shootings, Barton also killed his wife and two children, beating them to death with a claw hammer.
The frustrated chemist-turned-day trader killed himself the night of the multiple murders after two officers surrounded his minivan at an Acworth gas station.

ATLANTA _ Thursday's shootings shined an unwanted light on a high-stakes way to make it or break it: day-trading.
The man identified as the shooter, Mark Barton, was a day trader.
He had lost a total of $105,000 over a period of 15 days, ending July 27 at one of the two day trading establishments he used.
A number of eye witnesses to the shootings said Barton talked about losing money while he was shooting.
Friday, traders bantering in chat rooms discussed the shootings.
One posting asked whether ``the wild risks and intense pressures of market speculation'' were to blame.
``The Atlanta killings are not surprising'' said another member of the Lakeside Trading Club.
``It was only a matter of time before someone who blew out their account couldn't handle the stress and took it out on innocent victims''.
However, James Lee, president of Momentum Securities where Barton traded as late as Tuesday, said Friday in a statement that Barton had _ as all traders do _ signed documents saying he understood the risk.
``It is important to remember, the trading decisions he made were his own,'' said Lee.
Day-trading is not investing, it's more speculative than that.
It is an intricately complex way to try to stay a split-second ahead of the direction of a stock price.
Day-traders feed off a stock's volatile intraday movement.
The shares most often traded are technology stocks, most of which are on the Nasdaq market, which processes trades electronically.
Day traders typically work out of places like All-Tech Investment Group and Momentum Securities, the Atlanta businesses where Barton traded.
These companies provide staff to help the traders and dedicated computers loaded with software on which to trade.
The typical day trader tends to focus on a handful of companies and to buy and sell those stocks many times in a single session to take advantage of spikes in the prices.
At the end of the day, the trader cashes out, returning the next day to roll the dice again.
Tim Bourquin, a 30-year old California day-trader, said traders get a feel for a stock's direction by watching what market makers do.
Market makers are brokerage firms that keep an inventory in a particular stock to sell to customers.
They buy or sell stock to keep an orderly market.
Watching the market makers, lets traders like Bourquin stay a step ahead of the general public.
That step might be only a few-minute lead, but for a day-trader, who can make a trade in a second, a minute is plenty.
The losses and gains can be huge, but almost all traders lose money in their first few months, Borquin said.
The ones who last a year tend to make a living, he said.
Bourquin, like many day-traders, worried that the actions of one man would stain an industry.
``I knew people would try and make this a day-trader thing,'' Bourquin said.
``But it probably had nothing to do with it, or very little.
This guy was just a lunatic.
He could have been a mechanic or a doctor.
What happened in Atlanta has more to do with him being a lunatic than him being a day-trader''.
How difficult is day-trading?
Here are some answers to commonly asked questions about day-trading, compiled with the help of David Floyd, a partner at San Diego-based careerdaytrader.com.
Q: How do day traders know which way a stock will go?
A: They don't.
Many day traders, however, keep a keen eye on S&AMP;P futures.
The reason?
The prices of these tradeable futures contracts and the actual index normally shadow each other quite closely.
When the gap between the futures and the index narrows or widens, day traders see this as a buy or sell signal.
Successful day traders rarely bet against this market gauge.
They buy shares when the futures suggest the market will rise.
Sometimes they're right.
Sometimes they're wrong.
Q: What is the attraction of day trading?
A: Consider the case of IBM, which fell $3 on Thursday to close at $125.38.
A normal investor who owned 100 shares of IBM lost $300.
But a day trader could have ``shorted'' 100 shares of IBM --a bet that the stock would fall, and the only strategy to follow on a day when the S&AMP;P 500 was falling -- until it reached its lowest point.
That day trader could have made as much as $400.
Q: What are the risks of day-trading?
A: Enormous.
Investing is inherently risky.
Day-trading is extreme investing and can be extremely risky.
Doing it without proper training is folly, especially if you buy or sell on margin (with borrowed funds), which geometrically increases the impact of unexpected market events.
This is not the way to invest your retirement savings or bet next month's mortgage payment.
Clothier writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Story Filed By Cox Newspapers For Use By Clients of the New York Times News Service
ATLANTA _ Mark Orrin Barton's life was as unsettled as his death was unsettling.
He changed jobs frequently, lost tens of thousands of dollars in the stock market and, for the last six years, couldn't help but listen to whispers and outright accusations about his role in his first wife's death.
As authorities continued to investigate a three-day killing spree that left 13 people dead, including Barton, even his mother said she couldn't fathom what transformed the 44-year-old chemist-turned-day trader into the worst mass murderer in Georgia history.
``Even though I am deeply hurt by the actions of my son, Mark, I loved him very much,'' Barton's 76-year-old mother, Gladys, said in a statement issued Thursday at her home in Sumter, S.C.
``I wish there was some way to explain why this tragedy occurred or some way that it could have been prevented''.
Police say they have been unable to determine what motivated Barton to kill his wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday, his children, Matthew and Mychelle, on Wednesday, and nine people in two Atlanta office buildings on Thursday before taking his own life.
But the securities firm where Barton began his shooting rampage disclosed Friday that he had lost $105,000 on 15 trading days between June 9 and Tuesday _ the day he went home and killed his wife.
Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard described Barton as ``distraught and troubled,'' a man who ``also felt his wife and his children were suffering and hurting as well''.
From interviews and court records, a picture emerges of a man whose life continually lacked a semblance of the normalcy he tried to display.
``I have come to hate this life and this system of things,'' he wrote early Thursday in a note that police later found in the living room of his Henry County apartment.
``I have come to have no hope''.
It's difficult to trace the origins of Barton's despair.
Certainly it does not appear to be rooted in his rather unremarkable childhood.
An only child whose father worked for the Air Force, Barton moved with his family to Sumter, S.C., when he was 11.
After graduating from Sumter High School in 1973, Barton attended Clemson University but dropped out.
Two years later, he enrolled at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, where he received his bachelor's degree in chemistry and met the woman who would become his first wife, Debra Spivey.
The university's dormitories in Columbia, S.C., were full, and Debra lived at the Wade Hampton Hotel where Barton worked nights.
They were married May 5, 1979.
Soon they were living in Atlanta.
That year, he took a job as a chemist for a company called Zep Manufacturing, which soon transferred him to its Dallas laboratory.
He remained with the company about four years, said Andy Logue, vice president of human resources for Zep's parent company, National Service Industries.
From then on, however, Barton's professional and personal lives followed a rocky path.
In 1984, Barton accepted a job at TLC Manufacturing, a Texarkana, Texas, company that made cleaning compounds.
By 1988, he had been named TLC's president.
He made as much as $86,000 a year and controlled 5 percent of the company's stock.
But two years later, he was fired.
In a deposition, Barton said TLC executives became upset when they learned he was moving back to Atlanta to start his own business.
But Texarkana police records also show that, after being fired from TLC, Barton was arrested Sept.
25, 1990, and briefly jailed on charges that he stole computer discs and notebook binders filled with information from the company.
Charges against him were dropped a day later because TLC board members declined to prosecute him, Texarkana police spokesman Jeff Heminger said.
After moving back to Georgia, Barton started his own company, a chemistry consulting firm called Highlander Pride Inc.
, in July 1990.
But the company was more ``like having a paper route,'' he testified, because it never generated more than a few thousand dollars of business a year.
In January 1992, after resigning from a raw material distribution company in Kennesaw, Barton became a sales representative for Macon-based Lomas International, selling raw materials to manufacturers in the rubber, ink and paint industries, said Julie Van Brunt, a spokeswoman for the company, now known as Lintech International.
With a $50,000 salary and a company Taurus, Barton oversaw sales from North Georgia to the Florida Panhandle.
A year after he joined the company, he met a new employee: 20-year-old Leigh Ann Vandiver, a customer-support telephone operator.
She married David Lang a month after starting work, in February 1993.
By that spring, she and Barton were having an affair.
On the road most of the time, Barton said he always seemed to get Leigh Ann when he called the office.
Leigh Ann told him she liked older guys and had told Barton he was ``pretty,'' based on his photo in the company annual.
``We flirted with each other on the phone,'' Barton said, adding that he began buying new clothes and going to a tanning salon.
They consummated their relationship in May 1993, Barton testified.
Barton was playing golf with his buddies at the end of August when he called Leigh Ann using one of his friend's cell phones.
During this call, Barton testified, she told him she planned to leave her husband.
Barton was scheduled to make a quarterly sales trip through the Florida Panhandle in September 1993, and Leigh Ann was to accompany him to Panama City.
The trip was to take place the weekend after Labor Day _ the weekend after Barton's wife and mother-in-law were killed.
OPTIONAL TRIM Leigh Ann moved out of the home she shared with her husband two days before the bodies of Debra Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59, were found in a travel trailer at the Riverside Campground at Weiss Lake in Alabama.
They had been hacked to death with a sharp, heavy blade.
Danny Edgar Smith, an investigator with the district attorney's office that covers Cedar Grove, Ala.
, where Debra and her mother were killed,said evidence indicated the victims knew their killer, since there were no signs of forced entry or struggle.
Bloody footprints led to the trailer's driveway and witnesses said they saw a car like Barton's company-leased Ford the night of the murders.
He was told not to wash his car, but drove it through a car wash the next day and wiped up the interior after supposedly spilling a Sprite, Smith said.
Investigators said they found blood in Barton's car, garage and home.
Barton's defense lawyer, Michael Hauptman, said in an interview that the killer was an unspecified itinerate roofer who confessed to the killing.
This person is now serving an unrelated prison sentence in Indiana, Hauptman said.
But Smith said this man was ruled out as a suspect after his statements did not match evidence and investigators learned he had spent the night of the murders with friends.
During his deposition, Barton said the last time he saw Debra alive was when she pulled out of their home in her mother's red Thunderbird for the Labor Day camping weekend.
It was the first time he'd kept the children overnight by himself, he testified.
That night, with the children worn out and tired, Barton said he sang them songs, read them stories and then put them to bed.
He played on the computer, listened to a new Mary-Chapin Carpenter album and finished off a six-pack, falling asleep on the sofa, awoke during the night and headed to bed.
ADDITONAL TRIM In the weeks before Debra Barton's killing, her husband had taken out twin life insurance policies _ $600,000 for him, $600,000 for her.
Barton testified Debra insisted she have a policy equal to his own.
``She developed the concept that her worth was equal to mine and that if something happened to her, I would have my hands full taking care of the two kids,'' Barton testified.
``And she wanted the exact same life insurance that I had, rather than having a smaller amount''.
But after Debra and her mother, Eloise Spivey, were found hacked to death, the insurers holding the policies didn't buy Barton's story.
Two companies, Investors Life Insurance Co.
of Nebraska and Primerica Life Co.
, took Barton to court.
Lawyers for Investors Life went so far as to accuse Barton of the slayings.
``I am convinced that he was involved in those deaths,'' Ben Kingree III, an Atlanta lawyer who represented Investors Life, said Friday.
``She was a housewife with no income and a $600,000 life insurance policy.
Come on''.
Investors Life, which filed suit in 1994, settled with Barton in September 1997.
The company paid out $450,000 as part of a settlement, with $150,000 going to a trust fund to Barton's children and almost $300,000 being shared by Barton and his lawyers.
Barton collected $5,000 on another policy and received almost $66,000 on a $100,000 rider policy he had bought for his wife years before from Primerica, according to court records.
In the insurance lawsuit, Smith testified that he believed only Barton could have been guilty.
But the case never went to a grand jury for indictment.
Smith pursued the case through a different tack, though.
He met with Leigh Ann in Macon, he said in an interview Friday, to warn her that she might be next.
``I told her then, whenever she ceased to fill his needs, then he'd kill her, too,'' he said.
``The lifestyle that he had indicated that he needed (required) a young, sexy wife to maintain the status quo.
That's what he felt like he needed.
I told her, I said, `When you cease to fill those needs, you know he's going to kill you'.
'' ADDITONAL TRIM Barton and Lang both resigned from Lomas in October 1994.
The following May 26, they were married in Clayton County.
In the meantime, Barton had taken a sales job with Alchem Chemical Co.
in Atlanta.
Not long after he joined the company, said general manager Chuck Matthews, co-workers began hearing rumors about Barton's suspected role in his wife's death.
``This has always been on the back of everybody's minds,'' Matthews said.
In mid-1997, Barton left Alchem and went to work for Micro-Blend Chemical Co.
In March, the company filed court papers in Clayton County Superior Court over a debt by Barton, records show.
By early 1999, Barton ventured out of the chemical industry for the first time in his career, joining the volatile world of day trading in the stock market.
He opened an account at the Atlanta office of Momentum Securities Inc.
on May 13.
At the time, he claimed a net worth of $750,000, with $250,000 in liquid assets.
His income from Micro-Blend, he said, was $85,000 a year.
His wife, he added, made $40,000.
He told company executives that he had seen their advertisement on the CNBC cable business-news network.
At Momentum, Barton enjoyed little of the success that other investors have experienced.
Between June 9 and last Tuesday, he lost $105,000, according to a letter that Momentum sent Friday to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On Thursday, with his children and wife laying dead in their apartment, Barton sat at the computer he had used to track stock prices and wrote a chilling confession that concluded, ``You should kill me if you can''.
Later, he met with his lawyer, Joseph H.
Fowler of Douglasville, to attend to what Fowler on Friday described as ``routine will and estate issues''.
With stock prices falling, Barton drove his green minivan to the Buckhead secdtion of Atlanta.
He walked into Momentum's third-floor trading room and exchanged routine greetings with other traders and company employees.
``He made comments to the extent it was a bad trading day,'' said Harvard, the Atlanta police chief, ``and something to the effect that it was going to get worse''.

ATLANTA (AP) --The widow of a man murdered by Mark O.
Barton during his shooting spree last month at two day-trading firms has filed the first lawsuit stemming from the crimes.
Gulshan Harjee, wife of victim Dean Delawalla, sued the All-Tech Investment Group, Barton's estate, the owners of the building where All-Tech's Atlanta office is located and the building's security company.
Delawalla, 52, an All-Tech customer, was trading at the office when Barton opened fire.
Among other allegations, the suit filed Friday claims All-Tech negligently failed to supervise Barton and to protect him from large financial losses that may have prompted the shootings.
The ``murderous acts...
were reasonably foreseeable'' by company officials, it says.
Barton, a former chemist who reportedly lost as much as $450,000 while trading at All-Tech and Momentum Securities in the last year, killed nine people and wounded 13 others at the two companies' Atlanta offices on July 29.
Hours later, he committed suicide.
Prior to the attacks, Barton also killed his wife and two children, authorities say.
Michael Weinstock, Ms.
Harjee's attorney, said All-Tech had a responsibility to check the backgrounds of its day traders and should have discovered that Barton was a ``volatile individual''.
``They're creating a pressure environment that, in this case, with the pressure environment on top of a volatile individual ...
it basically exacerbates a dangerous circumstance,'' Weinstock said Tuesday.
Linda Lerner, an attorney for Montvale, N.J.-based All-Tech, did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.
The suit also said Barton Protective Services, which is not related to Mark Barton, failed to provide adequate security in All-Tech's office building.
It also seeks compensation from Barton's estate and the building's owner .
ATLANTA _ A widow kept old sheets on the bed because they smelled like her husband.
A former stock trader even fears going to the bank, worried that someone will shoot him again.
A grandfather can't bear to visit the graves of his granddaughter and grandson, who flank his slain wife and daughter.
One year ago, they faced unimaginable violence; today, and perhaps forever, unfathomable sadness.
All because of Mark Barton.
On July 29, 1999, a year ago next Saturday, the 44-year-old day trader tore through two stock brokerages in the Atlanta financial district on the worst killing spree in Georgia's history.
During the previous two days, he had bludgeoned his wife and his two children.
Later, as police surrounded his green minivan, Barton committed suicide.
At the end, 13 people were dead.
Another 13 were wounded.
A year later, most of the survivors' physical injuries have healed.
The day-trading offices _ Momentum Securities Inc.
and All-Tech Investment Group _ have reopened; fresh paint, wallpaper and carpet cover the remnants of the carnage.
Families of some victims have moved into new homes, trying to escape the memories.
Lawsuits have been filed, relationships have frayed, counseling and antidepressants have failed to eliminate the pain.
``Every time I pray and read my Bible, Kevin's kind of talking to me,'' Buddy Dial, a former All-Pro football player, said of his slain son.
``It's been very difficult, losing Kevin''.
``I still do all the things we used to do together _ jogging and playing tennis _ but now I do it without my partner,'' said Roy Webb, whose son, Scott, was killed.
``I guess that feeling will never go away''.
Some who lived through the day's horror, directly or indirectly, say they've accepted what happened, and even gotten over their anger.
Some won't talk about it at all, and others say they've simply tried to put the event out of their minds.
``My whole stance is, it's still in the past,'' said Scott Manspeaker, back to work as a manager at All-Tech after nearly bleeding to death from two gunshot wounds.
``We're over it''.
``I just don't bring it up,'' said Ginger Lewis, a cousin of Barton's slain wife, Leigh Ann.
``I can be driving down the road and I get a little flash of it and I feel like I'm going to cry, but I tuck it away.
That's what I do with bad things''.
Still others have analyzed and reanalyzed everything that happened.
They've tried to reconstruct every moment of the tragedy, endlessly seeking some truth that will help it all make sense.
What they find, though, are others asking the same question: Why?
``Every week I or somebody I know runs into somebody who was touched by that incident,'' said Nell Jones, who eluded a bullet from Barton but witnessed his rampage at All-Tech.
``It's absolutely mind-boggling that one person could create that much sorrow.
One person''.
`GOD TOOK AN ANGEL' Marie Quinn wonders about Barton.
Why didn't he just kill himself that day in Atlanta?
Why did he have to take so many with him?
And why her husband, Edward?
``I have so much anger in me, it's unbelievable,'' Quinn said recently in the large brick house she and her husband built 14 years ago.
``Even though I go to counseling, I don't think I'll ever be able to let it all out''.
Nights are the hardest.
``I still have trouble going to bed, because I know Eddie won't be there,'' she said.
``After he was killed, I waited a long, long time to change the sheets because they smelled like him''.
Her salvation, she said, has been her first grandson, Bryce.
He was born three months before her husband was killed, and the family treasures its photographs of grandfather and grandson.
``God took an angel,'' she said, ``and, at the same time, gave us an angel''.
Like others who became widows last July 29, Roya Havash has suffered from depression.
Medication has helped, she said, but it hasn't lessened her feeling that her husband, Jamshid, wasn't supposed to be at All-Tech that day.
In her husband's personal effects she found a ticket from the toll booth on Ga.
400 near the shooting scene.
He had passed through just 45 minutes before he was killed.
``I do believe in destiny,'' she said.
``We're Muslim.
The Quran said that when your time comes, you have to go.
There's nothing you can do about it.
.. . In a way, I think it was his time.
But it was too soon''.
Gulshan Harjee thinks of what her husband, Dean Delawalla, has missed the past 12 months.
Their son, Faisal, turned 16 and learned to drive.
Soon he'll start visiting colleges.
Their daughter, Shahla, turns 5 on Friday.
Her birthday will always fall the day before the anniversary of her father's death.
``That's the one thing we'll live with every year,'' Harjee said.
``We need to reclaim the sadness of that day . . . because the children have to have their lives and move on''.
Debra Tenenbaum's three children have given her strength to deal with the loss of her husband, Allen.
But as they grow, she said, she realizes how much time has passed without her husband.
One recent evening, her 4-year-old son, Scott, jumped up from the dinner table.
``I just want to look at a picture of Dad _ I almost forgot what he looked like,'' he told his mother.
SURVIVORS The last thing Kathleen Van Camp ever saw was Barton's face.
She was sitting in an office at All-Tech when Barton came in, pulled out two handguns and began firing.
He shot her twice _ once in the chest, once in the head.
Immediately, her world went dark.
In the year since, Van Camp said, she has undergone ``many surgeries,'' and she expects more.
But she does not expect to regain her sight.
``I'm weary,'' she said.
``I guess I'm getting along''.
She takes classes at the Center for the Visually Impaired.
She visits friends, dines out occasionally, follows the stock market, goes to doctors' appointments.
``That's pretty much it,'' she said.
``I don't really want to go anywhere''.
Before the shooting, Van Camp enjoyed her independence.
Now she relies on her husband of 13 years, Michael Sovereign, and others to take her everywhere.
That loss of freedom, she said, has been the hardest adjustment.
``I was a really self-reliant person,'' she said, ``and suddenly I wasn't''.
The only evidence of former day trader Sang Yoon's wound is a scar along his lower left forearm.
But he, too, has lost his freedom.
When he takes deposits from his dry cleaning business to the bank, he said, he fears someone will shoot him for his money.
In a crowd _ a restaurant, a ballgame _ he is afraid a shooting will erupt.
During a recent power outage at his business, when he heard sounds from an electric pole, he thought they were shots.
He took the rest of the day off.
At home, he said, his temper is short.
``My wife says I've changed,'' he said.
``When my baby is crying, I used to take care of that.
But now I get angry''.
Sometimes, he feels a tickling sensation along his scar.
Pointing to his heart, he said, ``I'm still uncomfortable''.
A BROKEN RELATIONSHIP Helen Brown counted on her son, Russell.
When her husband and oldest son had cancer, it was Russell who nursed them.
And when something needed repairing at her home in Florida, it was Russell who took care of it.
Since Russell was killed at Momentum, Brown has sold her house.
``Everywhere I looked, I saw Russ,'' said Brown, who now lives near her daughter in Orlando.
``He was the project guy.
He came down every other month to fix things around here for me''.
She never wants to visit Atlanta again, not even for a memorial service July 30 for Barton's victims.
Not even to see her son's fiancee of eight years, Patti Balon.
The Brown family has broken its ties with Balon after a disagreement over how to disperse Russell's ashes.
The family insisted that she send them everything of Russell's _ his clothes, furniture, ashes.
Balon and the Brown family no longer speak to one another.
Balon described the estrangement as unfortunate.
She said she's still grieving, but is working 70-hour weeks as a diversion.
``I put it on the back burner and don't think about it unless it hits me right in the face,'' Balon said.
``I am so full of anger still''.
AN OFFICER ALSO GRIEVES Almost every day, Rene Swanson thinks about what she discovered at Barton's apartment in Stockbridge.
Still, her voice breaks when she talks about it.
``There are no words to describe it,'' said Swanson, a detective with Henry County police.
``When I went in there, it was the worst thing I would ever want to see''.
Inside the apartment were the bodies of Barton's children, 11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Michelle, and their stepmother, Leigh Ann Barton.
All three had been beaten to death with a hammer.
Barton admitted to the crimes in a suicide note he left in the living room.
Swanson said she can't come to terms with the ritualistic way Barton killed his children, then washed and combed their hair, dressed them in pajamas, tucked them into bed and surrounded them with their prized possessions.
Beside Matthew he placed a Swiss army knife, Boy Scout patches and Pokemon trading cards; beside Michelle, a doll with a pink dress and blond hair in pigtails.
``You could smell shampoo in their hair,'' Swanson said.
``In some sense, there had to be some kind of love there, too''.
Sorting through her emotions was made easier by a friendship forged out of the case _ with Bill Spivey, the children's grandfather.
Spivey believes his wife, Eloise, and Debra, his daughter and Barton's first wife, were murdered by Barton in 1993, a case which remains unsolved.
Spivey invited Swanson to lunch a few weeks after last year's killings.
This month, he asked Swanson, her husband and their children to join his family for a Fourth of July party.
``It was heartbreaking,'' said Swanson, who normally doesn't socialize with people she meets on her job.
``Michelle and Matthew _ if things were different, it would have been them playing in the pool''.
Spivey doesn't like to talk about the killings.
And he avoids the cemetery where his grandchildren, their mother and his wife are buried alongside one another.
Visiting the grave sites, he said, is too painful.
``All of us have lost our loved ones,'' Spivey said.
``If we can put this behind us and go on and try to have a constructive life, we would all be better off''.
SEEKING PEACE Alyce Wenzel has tried to move on.
But sometimes, just driving the car on an errand, she bursts into tears, remembering her son, Scott Webb.
``Scottie never had a chance to get married or have children, and he loved children,'' Wenzel said.
``I'll just have to learn to take it day by day.
God doesn't give you more than you can handle.
I believe that, or there isn't anything''.
Nell Jones has tried to put the shootings behind her, too.
She returned to day trading for a while, but only as a form of therapy.
Being around others who had lived through the killings helped her regain control of her emotions.
Now, though, she mostly stays at home, close to her family, seeking clarity about life _ trying, she said, to filter out the ``background noise''.
She is haunted by visions of what she witnessed: ``These lovely, innocent people . . . murdered in cold blood''.
``They were there, and they were gone,'' she said.
``If I had been killed, what would I have left behind?
What would I have left undone and unsaid?
And can I look around and do them now''?
One victim especially occupies her thoughts: Vadewattee Muralidhara, over whose body she stepped when she emerged from a closet where she hid during part of Barton's shooting spree.
Muralidhara's husband is haunted, too.
``She was not keen on day trading,'' Kesturkoppal Muralidhara said.
``It was I who was interested.
I forced her''.
He recently moved to a new house, hoping to leave behind happy memories that now seem so painful.
But his wife's clothes hang in his new closet.
When he closes his eyes, he sees his wife in the dress she wore when she died.
He sees her gazing at him from the passenger side of his car, undressing by the bed they shared for 22 years, cooking the evening meal.
``My children come home and sit around,'' he said.
`` `Daddy, where is the food'?
`Look,' I say, `I cannot cook.
Let's go out and eat'.
They want to sit down at a table and all eat together.
We have not done that in almost a year now.
Not one time.
That happiness, I don't think, will ever come back to me''.
A month ago, the Muralidhara family traveled to their native Trinidad for a Hindu ceremony.
Thirty days before the anniversary of a death, Hindus believe, the soul ascends to heaven.
So 11 months after Barton killed her with a bullet to the head, Vadewattee Muralidhara's ashes were scattered in the sea.
Finally, her husband said, this would bring ``peace to her soul''.

LIZELLA, Ga.
_ Leigh Ann Barton's family buried her Sunday with little mention of the husband who killed her.
Instead of being angry at Mark O.
Barton, Pastor Doug Davis asked the congregation of about 200 mourners in Lizella Baptist Church not to give into the ``temptation'' of focusing on last week's ``horrific event''.
``We have 27 years of wonderful memories of her life and only a few hours of shocking memories of her death,'' Davis said.
``Let us remember and celebrate her life today and in the days to come, and not allow her murder to forever cloud our memories''.
But there was evidence the nation was still focused on Mark O.
Barton's shooting spree Thursday at two Buckhead office buildings, where he left nine dead and 12 injured.
He later shot himself in the head in an Acworth, Ga.
gas station.
About 20 news reporters and photographers lined the roadside in front of the red brick church southwest of Macon to capture images of grief for a country that wants to know why.
Why a man would kill his 27-year-old wife and children, Matthew, 11 and Mychelle, 8 with a hammer?
Church members passed out bottles of spring water and cups of ice water to sweat-drenched photographers listening to the service over a loudspeaker outside.
Inside, Leigh Ann Barton's white coffin lay draped with a blanket of pink roses.
``Leigh Ann loved to take photographs,'' Davis said.
``As a result, the family has many pictures of Matthew and Mychelle being accepted and cared for by this large extended family.
Indeed, Matthew and Mychelle were just as much a part of this family as any of the other children''.
Between the hymns of ``I'll Fly Away,'' and ``Amazing Grace'' Davis read a note by Leigh Ann's older sister, Dana Reeves, 32.
``My dearest honey,'' the letter began, using the family's nickname for Leigh Ann Barton.
``I am so very sorry for what has happened to you.
I only wish I could have spared you from all of this.
After the service a half-dozen pallbearers carried Barton's coffin past white columns and down a walkway to a waiting blue hearse.
Organ music played from the outside speaker as parishioners filed out of the church, some sobbing.
One friend among a group of Girl Scouts in uniform cried out loud.
The blue hearse transported Barton's body to Old Valley Grove Primitive Baptist Church, about 110 miles south of Macon.
The family decided to bury Barton in a small cemetery next to the Irwin County church's new social hall.
Barton's mother lives in the community.
Family and friends who made the trip mingled in front of the new building before gathering around the burial tent to lay Barton to rest.
Nearby, expansive fields of green soybean and cotton plants withered in the heat.
Pastor Davis' words back in Lizella lingered: ``God's love is stronger than pain.
God's love is stronger than death.
God's love is stronger than any sickness than a Mark Barton or anyone else can dish out''.

CEDAR BLUFF, Ala.
(AP) --Police always suspected Mark Barton was at the end of the bloody trail that led out the door of the travel trailer where his wife and mother-in-law were hacked to death in 1993.
Barton had the motive, they believed: a $600,000 life insurance policy on his wife and a girlfriend on the side.
Investigators knew he had a temper and an opportunity to kill.
But Barton denied he did it, and authorities lacked the one thing they needed to arrest him: proof he had ever been to the camper where Debra Barton and her mother, Eloise Spivey, were slain.
``We didn't have any witnesses who could put him there,'' said Danny Smith, an investigator with the Cherokee County district attorney's office.
``We didn't have any fingerprints''.
Barton shot and killed nine people in two Atlanta stock-trading offices on Thursday, injuring 13 others.
Afterward, his wife and two children were found dead in their apartment.
They had been beaten with a hammer.
In a letter left at his apartment in Henry County, Ga.
, Barton acknowledged that the murders of his family were similar to the Alabama killings, in which police believe the victims were killed with a hatchet.
But Barton, writing that ``there's no reason for me to lie now,'' continued to deny committing the '93 killings.
In the aftermath of the Georgia rampage, Alabama authorities said Friday they were still troubled by the '93 killings but believed they did all they could.
Barton was the only suspect ever considered.
``I don't know of anything we could have done differently,'' Smith said.
``We knew morally that he had done it, but we could not prove it legally''.
The women were found dead on Sept.
5, 1993, inside a blood-splattered trailer at a campground along Weiss Lake.
As many as 600 people were at the campground when the women were killed.
Investigators found bloody footprints leading out the camper door, but the FBI laboratory could not identify the brand of the shoe, taking away one possible link to Barton.
Police talked with everyone who was at the campground that day, but no one remembered seeing Barton.
Early tests on Barton's company car indicated the possible presence of blood around the front seat.
But before police could analyze the spot again, Barton --a chemist -- claimed to have spilled a soft drink in the vehicle, ruining any potential evidence, Smith said.
Another investigator involved in the case, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police first became suspicious of Barton after he gave ``rehearsed'' answers during an interview.
He also refused a polygraph test.
It was only after that, the source said, that officers found out about the $600,000 insurance policy on Debra Barton that took effect less than a month before she was killed.
Investigators believe Barton, involved with another woman, came to Alabama to ask her for a divorce and she refused, prompting the killings.
Smith said the insurance company, Investors Life Insurance of Nebraska, offered to pay the full amount of the policy, provided all the money went into a trust fund for the couple's two children.
Barton refused and eventually settled.
Court records show the insurer paid $450,000 on the policy, with $150,000 of that going into trust for Barton's children and the remainder going to Barton and his lawyers.
Michael Hauptman, Barton's criminal lawyer, who was not involved in the civil case, said he believed the lawyers got about $100,000.
Alabama authorities said they didn't know whether Barton's second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, was the woman he had been dating during his first marriage.
However, her ex-husband, David Lang, told the New York Daily News that she was, and he said he believes she helped Barton cover up his involvement in the slayings to collect the insurance policy.
Lang did not return messages left by The Associated Press on Friday.
Smith said that after Barton remarried, he would periodically call the investigator and ask why he was a suspect in the slayings.
``It was a game to him.
He got mad at me one time because he couldn't convince me he didn't do it,'' Smith said.
Once, Smith said, ``He told me that he would never go to jail''.
Barton was good to his word.
He committed suicide hours after the Atlanta rampage as they closed in on him.
ATLANTA _ Before he killed his wife with a hammer...Before he murdered his sleeping children...Before he went on a shooting spree that killed nine people and injured 12...
Mark Barton put on a Scout uniform to take his son to a troop meeting.
It was Tuesday afternoon at the Bristol Green apartments in Stockbridge, and Travis Holmes, 14, saw Barton and his son and struck up a conversation with them.
Travis is a Scout, so everyone had something in common.
They talked about merit badges.
They talked about camp.
Travis saw no signs that Barton was about to take the first steps on a terrifying journey that would devestate families, challenge a city's sense of security and rivet the nation with its intimate brutality and horrific randomness.
But another person who saw him Tuesday noticed that something was wrong.
`Something's weird' ``Something's weird about this man,'' Marsha Jean DeFreese remembers thinking when Barton, a troop leader, came to pick up her grandsonwho was friends with Barton's son.
Mrs. DeFreese had lived near the family last year in the Atlanta suburb of Morrow, before Barton split with his second wife, Leigh Ann.
Mrs. Barton had moved Matthew and his 7-year-old sister Elizabeth Mychelle to a Stockbridge apartment.
Sometimes, Mrs.
DeFreese recalled, Barton would not return with the boys until 11 p.m., which she thought was strange.
She chalked it up to their closeness.
There was no way for Travis to know on Tuesday afternoon that he was chatting with a man who, by his own admission, was consumed with hatred.
Or that Mark Barton would cause so much anguish and grief in the next three days, Barton's last three days on earth.
Hours after the ordinary conversation about Scouts, however, Barton killed his wife with a hammer and stuffed her body in a bedroom closet.
The next morning and afternoon, Barton stayed in the apartment with his 11-year-old Matthew, and his daughter, 8-year-old Mychelle, said Capt.
Jim Simmons of the Henry County Police Department.
On Wednesday night, Barton smashed the hammer into his children and then held them down in a bathtub to make sure they were dead.
Authorities said he tidied up, put the kids back in bed and tucked them in.
They said he left a video game on Matthew's body and a stuffed toy on Mychelle's body.
Now he was alone in an apartment with three bodies.
He booted up a home computer and started typing a note for the police.
He addressed it ``To Whom It May Concern'' and dated it Thursday, July 29, at 6:38 a.m.
``I don't plan to live very much longer,'' he said, ``just long enough to kill as many of the people that greedily sought my destruction''.
Trading day got worse About eight hours later, just before 2:30 p.m.
Thursday, Barton strolled into the offices of Momentum Securities Inc.
, a day-trading firm on the third floor of a Buckhead office building.
It's a place where people sit in front of computers to gamble on the stock market, hoping for instant gains.
He had traded many times before in this office and was known to the people who worked there.
They exchanged pleasantries.
Barton told them he wanted to make a few transactions.
He chatted for a minute or two longer.
Police later said he made a chilling remark: ``It's a bad trading day and it's about to get worse''.
Suddenly Barton whipped out two pistols.
``He then shot both guns at the same time, `` Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard said Friday afternoon.
The hunt begins Police got the first call about the gunfire at Momentum's third floor office at 2:56 p.m.
A woman told 911 dispatchers that a man had come into the office and shot people.
Two minutes later, at 2:58 p.m., a man sounding more urgent told police four people were dead at Momentum.
The first Atlanta police officer arrived at the office at 3 p.m., Harvard said.
Blood was everywhere.
A thick trail snaked around the third floor hallway.
``He was immediately told that four people were dead and he went up to Suite 310,'' Harvard said.
``He called for back-up and other officers arrived within seconds''.
As the officers began canvassing the office, stepping carefully over the victims, they heard voices coming from a smaller room just a few feet from where the slain victims lay.
``The officers found several people huddled in the smaller room, they had gone in there to hide,'' Harvard said.
``One of the people had thrown a computer out the window to attract the attrention of someone on the street.
``One of the women in the room shouted out, 'Mark Barton shot us'!
`` While the cops began combing through the other offices on the third floor, another officer circled his motorcycle on Piedmont Road below.
Suddeny shots rang out at a complex of other office building across the street.
It was 3:07 p.m.
Bodies are everywhere Other officers arrived and were told the shots were coming from Suite 215 in building eight of the Piedmont Center, an office complex made up of 11 buildings.
A security guard from Barton Protective Services, Inc.
, _ the company is not related to Barton _ told officers they heard several shots.
The officers went inside and saw five people slumped over their computer terminals.
Several others were hurt.
Barton is missing It was 3:15 p.m.
Barton was nowhere in sight and the officers began their thorough search for the shooter throughout Piedmont Center.
Ambulances flooded Piedmont Road.
Even the seasoned paramedics who patrol Atlanta's toughest neighborhoods said they'd never seen anything like the carnage at two Buckhead offices where nine were slain Thursday.
Dispatchers had alerted medical personnel to expect several victims, both dead and wounded.
But paramedics said what they found was far worse than what they had imagined.
``We see shootings all the time, they almost seen routine,'' said Reginald McCoy, a paramedic with Grady Memorial Hospital.
``But I've never seen anything like that...
the volume.
It was utter chaos''.
Meanwhile, 20 miles south of downtown Atlanta, Miles South, the manager of the Bristol Green apartment complex in Stockbridge was thinking about the quiet apartment unit in building 1300.
The rent was late, and he wondered what was up.
He called Henry County Police at 3:23 p.m., less than 30 minutes after the shooting started in Atlanta, and let an officer in.
Notes on the bodies After seeing one body, the officer called for backup.
Both Matthew and Elizabeth Mychelle were dead, apparently from blows to the head.
They lay in their beds, all but their faces covered.
A handwritten note rested by each child's body.
Their stepmother also was dead, stuffed in a closet and similarly covered, with another scribbled note.
In the living room was a longer letter, this one apparently typed out on the computer Barton so loved.
Barton, meanwhile, was across the city.
Escape in the woods?
At about 3:30 p.m., Lori Woodward and a handful of employees at the Ivy Place Buildingspotted a man wearing a red shirt and khaki pants, running south on Piedmont Road toward the Lenox Road intersection.
Woodard and her colleagues had learned from radio and TV news that police were looking for a shooter wearing those clothes.
``We had no idea he had just shot the people at Piedmont center,'' Woodard said.
``We watched him because he looked strange, He was carrying, like, a knapsack on his back and he was acting nervous.
Woodard said the man ran along the Buckhead Loop in the direction of Phipps Plaza on Lenox Road.
He stopped short however when he spotted an Atlanta police cruiser rolling his way, Woodard said.
``At that point he looked around and then walked up the driveway of a building that's under construction at the corner of Piedmont and Lenox,'' Woodard said.
``He kept looking around and looking over his shoulder.
He noticed two more officers at the top of the driveway, he turned around walked back to the street and then ran into a patch of woods.
We never saw him after that''.
Officers swarm the buildings For hours, officers with shotguns searched the parking decks at Piedmont Center and several office buildings.
Employees remained locked in their offices because officers did not know whether the killer was still around.
Police dogs sniffed the bushes.
And FBI agents dressed for war searched the area along Piemont Road.
Four hours passed before authorities heard from someone who had seen Barton.
Security officers at the Town Center Mall in Kennesaw, about 20 miles from Buckhead, saw Barton's unoccupied van in the mall lot about 7:40 p.m.
About the same time, a woman who'd been shopping at Rich's approached her parked car.
Barton walked toward her.
He had a black bag that hung over the shoulder of his neatly pressed blue short-sleeve shirt.
``Don't scream or I'll shoot you,'' he said, according to a police report.
The woman backed away.
``Don't run or I'll shoot you,'' he said.
She ran.
He did not shoot.
Looming large in a minivan Mannon Smith, who was also at the mall, said she saw Barton in the parking lot and recognized him as the suspect in the deadliest mass murder in Georgia history.
``It was this totally, totally freakish thing,'' Smith said.
``I was absolutely positive it was him.
I was shocked.
You pull up behind a car and here was this guy everone is looking for.
Nobody expected him in Kennesaw.
'' At 6-foot, 4-inches tall, Barton loomed large in the mini-van, Smith said.
She pulled out her cell phone and dialed 911.
Operaters at first were skeptical, but eventually believed Smith when she described the van and read off the license plate.
``I didn't want him looking back and seeing me on the phone reporting him,'' Smith said.
``I really wanted to get off the phone''.
Smith said she briefly followed Barton until he turned onto Barrett Parkway.
He turned right toward I-75.
She turned left.
Smith said she thought briefly about tailing Barton but quickly decided to leave that up to the professionals.
``He had just killed 12 people,'' Smith said.
Meanwhile, mall officials had alerted police.
Officers all over the northern part of Cobb County were looking for the minivan.
Cobb County Police Officer Huel Clements was on I-75 when he saw a minivan matching the description of Barton's minivan.
He relayed the tag number by radio to a dispatcher.
The dispatcher confirmed his suspicion: it was Barton's minivan.
He followed Barton, keeping a safe distance at first so as not to tip off Barton that he was being followed.
He also told fellow officers by radio what he had discovered.
On the run About 7:50 p.m., as the day continued its slow summer surrender to evening, Barton turned off the interstate onto Ga.
92 in Acworth.
``My main cocern was keeping survelliance and waiting for backup,'' Clements said Friday, still wearing the black stripe across his badge to honor the two Cobb officers who were killed in the line of duty last weekend.
Barton passed a service station on his left and turned right just past a McDonald's fast-food restaurant.
Then he turned left and eased into a BP gasoline station.
Officer Clements, still behind Barton, turned on his blue lights.
Then his siren sounded for a second or two.
Dane Pritchett, 14, saw what happened next.
She was in the backseat of a car in the McDonald's parking lot, waiting for her brother and his girlfriend to bring her a fish filet sandwich and French Fries.
She said Barton slowed at the gas pumps, as if he was going to stop, but then pulled up about 35 feet to a spot between the pumps and the BP Car Wash.
Suddenly an Acworth police cruiser whipped into the gas station parking lot and stopped in front of the minivan.
Officer Clements, behind Barton's minivan, leapt out of his car, drew his gun and crouched behind the door of his patrol car.
Pritchett said he trained his gun on the minivan and shouted at its driver.
``He was yelling `Get out!
Get out'''!
Pritchett said.
Within seconds, Cpl.
Curtis Endicott of the Acworth Police Department had whipped his patrol car into the BP parking lot to block a possible escape route for Barton.
``A lot's going through your mind when you have suspect of this magnitude.
I was scared,'' Endicott said.
``I didn't know what he might do''.
As Endicott threw open his door of his police car, Barton raised a 9mm pistol to one side of his head and a .45 caliber pistol to the other.
``We heard a muffled sound,'' Pritchett said, ``and his head fell against the steering wheel''.
It was about 7:55 p.m.
Several of the six Acworth police officers on duty had arrived by this time.
They bounded out of their patrol cars and pointed their guns at the van.
One of the officers walked tensely towards the driver's side door.
``He walked over and with one hand slung the door open and then backed off,'' Pritchett said.
``I guess he saw blood or something''.
Jim Fowler, the clerk at the Amoco service station across the street, said he could tell the danger had passed by watching the officers.
``They all just started holstering their guns,'' he said.
``I guess they knew he was dead.

GIVE GREED A CHANCE As the three-day happening called Woodstock '99 twanged to a halt, a handful of revelers went wild, setting fires, looting and even, by some accounts, raping.
So now historians, who delight in drawing comparisons between generations, can make all sorts of pronouncements about how society has changed in that nice round 30-year interval since the original bash.
Take those $4 bottles of water _ a sign of ``Commercialstock,'' as one festival-goer put it.
But you don't see people burning up trendy bistros after shelling out $7 for a glass of mediocre wine.
As for attacking ATMs in hopes of a shower of $20 bills _ a close cousin to the greed blossoming in the Internet economy, or just plain old greed?
Has life become one big violent video game?
The reports of sexual assaults suggest, grimly, that it has.
Has media madness taken over?
Listen to one who was there: ``I can't wait to get home to watch this on TV''.
And how's this for the prototypical '90s music fan: a professional body piercer who just happened to bring along a gas mask.
But to reduce this to basic reasons for the fire this time: it was wet then, dry now.
How does the poem go?
``Some say Woodstock will end in fire, some say in mud''?
Or something like that.
What now?
Will there be yet another Woodstock, even farther from the town that happens to bear that name?
Or will the turn of the millennium wash away rerun mania and let the world start fresh?
And considering what they now stand for, who will want to wear those Woodstock '99 T-shirts, whether stolen or paid for?

HERRING A SPOT FOR THE ETHICALLY CHALLENGED Oh, how this society loves its sports stars!
It pays them in a single day what, say, a good music teacher earns in a year.
It puts them on towering pedestals.
It deifies them.
Small wonder, then, that these athletes start looking in the mirror and saying: ``Yes, I really am special.
The world's petty rules don't apply to me''.
Consider parking spaces for the handicapped.
Athletes, one might reasonably think, would be the last to need such perks.
Their physical prowess is so _ gosh!
_ awesome that they should be able to leap over vast parking lots in a single bound.
But a group of football players at the University of California at Los Angeles apparently started believing a bit too strongly in their specialness.
Nine of them just pleaded no contest to faking various disabilities, like knee injuries, and then submitting applications signed by nonexistent doctors to get handicapped parking permits for the campus.
The people who really deserve those parking permits were not at all amused.
As the players emerged from the Los Angeles courthouse, protesters in wheelchairs chanted, ``Hey hey, ho ho, parking cheats must go''.
Having a bogus handicapped permit is a misdemeanor that can mean six months in jail, so the players got off easy.
Each one was suspended for two games, put on two years' probation, ordered to pay about $1,500 and must put in 200 hours of community service, half of it with the Special Olympics.
That should get them in shape to jog across a parking lot.

HERRING A KILLING SPREE LEAVES A TRAIL OF BODIES IN GEORGIA A 44-year-old independent stock trader went on a shooting rampage in Atlanta, killing 9 people at two office buildings before killing himself as the police tried to arrest him.
Another 12 people were injured, 7 from gunshot wounds.
The police later discovered that he had bludgeoned his wife and 2 children to death in an apartment in suburban Stockbridge.
The trader, Mark Barton, eluded police for five hours after the shootings, in Atlanta's glitzy Buckhead district.
Officers finally caught up with him in nearby Cobb County.
In a note left near the bodies of his family, Barton vowed to kill ``the people that greedily sought my destruction''.
He wrote that he regretted killing his wife, Leigh Ann, and that he killed the children, Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 8, to spare them the pain of living without parents.
Barton had been the only suspect in the bludgeoning deaths of his first wife and her mother six years ago in Alabama.
The authorities there said they never had enough evidence to charge him.
AN ARREST AND A CONFESSION IN THE YOSEMITE MURDERS In June, the FBI said the people responsible for the murders of three female sightseers at Yosemite National Park last February were safely locked away on other charges.
But after a park naturalist was found beheaded last month, the man arrested in that case, Cary Stayner, 37, confessed to all four murders.
The FBI is now investigating why Stayner, a handyman at the motel where the three sightseers were last seen, was dismissed as a suspect when he was interviewed in February.
_ By EVELYN NIEVES nn
ATLANTA _ The gunman who slaughtered his family and then nine people at two stock trading firms left behind a chilling letter filled with a mix of remorse and revenge but offering few clues as to what caused his three-day rampage.
``I'm sure the details don't matter.
There is no excuse, no good reason.
I am sure no one will understand.
If they could I wouldn't want them to.
I just write these things to say why,'' read a portion of the letter.
In the one-page letter printed from a computer and dated Thursday, Mark Orrin Barton described how he killed his estranged second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, 27, with a hammer Tuesday, then beat and drowned his two children the following day.
``Where the kids were (the 24 hours after Leigh Ann Barton was killed), I have absolutely no way of knowing,'' said Jimmy Mercer, chief of the Henry County Police, the agency investigating the three deaths in Stockbridge, near Atlanta.
``He went to pains to conceal the body so you can't help but think the kids were in and out during that time,'' Mercer said.
Barton's wife was found in a closet in the apartment home.
Barton walked Thursday into the office of two brokerage firms where he traded and fired randomly at traders and employees.
Nine died and 13 were wounded.
Hours later, he killed himself as police pulled over his van.
The letter indicates he killed his children from his first marriage, Matthew, 11, and Michelle, 8, to save them from a painful existence.
Their mother and maternal grandmother were savagely beaten to death with a tool in Alabama in 1993.
Although Barton was considered the prime suspect, he was never charged in that case and denied any involvement in the letter he left.
The former chemist turned day trader in stocks likened his wife's death to the shooting rampage he went on Thursday.
He gave no clear motive for those killings other than he blamed his wife and the people at the companies for his depression.
Officials at one of the businesses, Momentum Securities, said Barton used the Atlanta office for 15 days of trading beginning June 9, and lost $105,000.
The other business, All-Tech Investment Group, would not release his trading history there.
Barton made no reference to his trading in the letter but mentioned his plan to kill others twice.
``I don't plan to live very much longer, just long enough to kill as many of the people that greedily sought my destruction.
You should kill me if you can,'' he wrote.
The letter apparently was signed by Barton and contained names and numbers of three people _ his mother, Gladys Barton; his children's maternal grandfather, Bill Spivey; and an attorney, Joe Fowler.
At first authorities thought the three might be intended targets but later decided they were just people to contact about the deaths.
After the shootings, Barton, 44, shot himself to death in his minivan as police stopped him at an gas station in Acworth, just north of Atlanta.
The letter was found Thursday night lying on a coffee table in the living room of Barton's estranged wife's apartment in Stockbridge, about 30 miles south of Atlanta.
Three handwritten notes also were found on each of the bodies.
Each contained two sentences describing his love for each and asking someone to take care of them.
Copies of the letter were not released, but Mercer read the letter to reporters Friday.
``This letter was left in a very obvious place,'' Mercer said.
``We didn't have to do any searching.
They (the letter and notes with each body) were very visible from the time you walked in''.
The printed letter was addressed ``To Whom It May Concern''.
It began with a matter-of-fact tone: ``Leigh Ann is in the master bedroom closet under a blanket.
I killed her Tuesday night.
I killed Matthew and Michelle Wednesday night''.
Barton wrote of the similarities between the deaths and those of his first wife of 15 years, Debra Spivey Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59.
They were hacked to death six years ago in a camper at Lake Weiss, Ala.
``However I deny killing her and her mother.
There is no reason for me to lie now,'' Barton wrote.
``It just seemed like a quiet way to kill and a relatively painless way to die.
``There was little pain.
All of them were dead in less than five minutes.
I hit them with a hammer in their sleep and then put them facedown in the bathtub to make sure that they did not wake up in pain, to make sure they were dead.
I am so sorry.
I wish I didn't.
Words cannot tell the agony.
Why did I''?
Barton wrote only that he had ``been dying since October'' and since then had terrifying dreams he could no longer live with.
The letter never explained what caused the dreams or his sense of hopelessness.
He only wrote: ``It has taken its toll.
I have come to hate this life in this system of things.
I have come to have no hope''.
The only explanation Barton does reveal is that he killed his children out of what appears to be a distorted sense of compassion.
``I killed the children to exchange for them five minutes of pain for a lifetime of pain,'' he wrote.
``I forced myself to do it to keep them from suffering so much later.
No mother, no father, no relatives.
``The fears of the father are transferred to the son.
It was from my father to me and from me to my son.
He already had it and now to be left alone, I had to take him with me''.
The bodies of the children were found in the other bedroom of the two-bedroom apartment.
Each was lying in a separate bed with blankets and bed coverings pulled up to their faces.
A handwritten note was lying on top of each bed.
``There wasn't any part of the body aside from just a square portion of their face visible,'' Mercer said.
``It was almost like they were sleeping.
There was certainly not any visible blood that I saw...
We saw some blood splatters on the wall, but it also appeared to be this individual went to some extreme in terms of trying to clean up the mess''.
The beds containing the children appeared to be some sort of shrine in tribute to each.
Next to Matthew's body was a video game, and next to Michelle a stuffed toy.
But Barton blamed his wife in the letter.
``I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for my demise, as I plan to kill the others.
I really wish I hadn't killed her now.
She really couldn't help it, and I love her so much anyway''.
Several draft versions of the letter were found on the computer in the home, Mercer said.
That Barton's depression led him to kill at home and the workplace is unusual, said John Vincent, a professor of psychology at the University of Houston.
``It's chilling to hear those words,'' Vincent said.
``This pattern is not nearly as common as a typical outraged employee seeking revenge on a higher authority or a co-worker''.
Vincent said it appeared Barton planned to kill the people at the day trading firms simply because they symbolized those who were profiting at his expense.
``It's a sense of somebody has to pay,'' Vincent said.
Despite the denial of his involvement in the Alabama slaying, authorities there have said they consider the murder case of Debra Benton and Eloise Spivey to be closed now.
Barton had taken out a $600,000 in life insurance on his first wife before her death and eventually settled with the insurance company for $450,000, according to federal court records obtained by The Associated Press.
About $150,000 was to be held in trust for his children.
After legal fees, Barton was left with $194,000.
The AP also reported that Barton lived in Texarkana, Texas, in the late 1980s and was fired from his job as president of TLC Manufacturing after a burglary investigation.
One of the handguns Barton used in the spree, a Colt.45-caliber, was traced to a North Texas gun dealer, police said, and had been registered to another purchaser in 1983.
Barton registered the other, a 9 mm Glock, in 1993.
With the letter and eyewitness accounts of Barton's shooting spree in Atlanta, Mercer said his investigation into the deaths of Leigh Ann Barton and the children is concluded but authorities would continue to search for a motive.
``There will be a number of people for a long period of time trying to put the pieces to the puzzle together to find out why it is that Mr.
Barton was provoked to the extent that he was, that he felt the need to take out as many people as he did,'' Mercer said.
``I don't have those answers at this time and I doubt anyone else does either''.
&QL; XXXX END OF STORY &QL;
Mark Barton, the 44-year-old day trader at the center of Thursday's bloody rampage, was described by neighbors in the Atlanta suburb of Morrow as a quiet, churchgoing man who worked all day on his computer.
Barton, who had split up with his wife earlier this year, had been living with his two children from a previous marriage in the southern suburb.
The three of them moved out over the July 4th weekend, and the children told neighbors they were moving to nearby Stockbridge to live with their stepmother, identified by a neighbor as Lee Ann Barton.
The bodies of Mrs.
Barton and the children were found in Mrs.
Barton's apartment after Barton went on the rampage at two brokerage offices, killing nine people.
Barton later committed suicide when police closed in on him in his dark green van at a gas station in northern Atlanta.
Police in Henry County, where Stockbridge is located, said handwritten notes left on the bodies indicated that Mrs.
Barton may have been killed Tuesday and the children on Wednesday.
The children were in their beds and his wife was in a closet.
Police said a typed note was found in the living room explaining his actions.
Barton had lived in Morrow for about a year, renting a neatly kept, two-story house in a modestly priced residential neighborhood, said Christine Johnson, 58, who lived two doors away.
Barton, a chemist, seldom left his house and was always at work on his computer, Mrs.
Johnson said.
When he did leave the house, it was to walk around the neighborhood for exercise.
``He kept to himself,'' Mrs.
Johnson said.
``If he drove by in his van he threw his hand up.
But that was about it''.
Another acquaintance in Morrow, Marsha Jean DeFreese, said Barton went to church and was a Scout master of her grandson's troop.
She said he took them out every Tuesday.
``He looked odd to me,'' she said.
``I thought something's weird about this man''.
Police said the children, Michelle and Matthew, were ages 7 and 12 respectively.
Cindy Northcutt, 38, who lived on the same street as Barton in Morrow, said Barton ``always seemed preoccupied''.
``He had other things on his mind,'' she said.
``He didn't seem friendly at all.
He was making an effort to have something to do with you''.
Neighbors in Morrow said Mrs.
Barton was active in the Girl Scouts.
On Wednesday, she was expected at an outing, but never showed up.
In 1993, Barton's first wife and mother-in-law were bludgeoned to death at a campground in northeast Alabama.
Authorities said Barton was the prime suspect, but he was never charged.
The couple had two children, who were in Barton's custody after the slayings.
ATLANTA _ (SET ITAL)``I'm sure the details don't matter.
There is no excuse, no good reason.
I am sure no one would understand.
If they could, I wouldn't want them to.''(END ITAL) By the time Mark Orrin Barton sat down at his computer and wrote a chillingly elegant confession, the demons that had haunted him since childhood had consumed him.
As a loner in high school, Barton imagined himself a criminal mastermind when he broke into a drugstore.
As a business executive, he undermined his success by retreating behind a wall of paranoia, sabotaging a colleague's work and belittling his wife to co-workers after she had a miscarriage.
As a supposedly loving father, he shot his daughter's kitten and then, feigning concern, led her on a useless search for the missing pet, which he had already buried.
The details of Barton's slaughter, the largest mass murder in Georgia history, have become painfully familiar.
What remains, then, is the effort to answer the unanswerable: Why would this 44-year-old man _ why would anyone _ commit such atrocities, against the woman who loved him, against the children who cherished him, against casual acquaintances whose only mistake was to be in the way of his barrage of bullets?
A tall, socially awkward teen-ager at Sumter High School in South Carolina, he dabbled in drugs in the early 1970s.
A whiz at chemistry who didn't care much for school, Barton tried to use chemicals to extract a hallucinogen from morning glory seeds, said Milton Grisham, a schoolmate now living in Roswell.
``He ingested a great deal of it.
Then he really overdosed.
He had hallucinations and had to go to the emergency room,'' said Grisham, a psychologist who has worked with rapists and killers.
``It did something very bad to him''.
Afterward, Barton cut off all his hair and became religious.
Bible in hand, he showed up at Grisham's house, where they had sometimes played chess.
He said he'd found the answers to the world.
``He didn't make any sense,'' said Grisham.
``I kind of lost touch with him, he became so strange.
The drugs blew him away''.
Barton was born in Sumter in 1955, but his father, who worked for the U.S.
Air Force, moved the family to Germany for several years.
They returned to Sumter when Mark was 11, and he later entered Sumter High.
It was a tough time for young people in Sumter, a city of 25,000 where the main employers were Shaw Air Force Base and a Campbell's Soup plant.
Air Force brats who had traveled their whole lives shared parks with Southern blacks and whites who had hardly made it out of town.
In 1971, forced integration merged the city's black and white high schools.
When students sat with friends in the cafeteria, they split along the color line.
Windows were smashed; school fights broke out.
``There was a lot of tension in the hallways,'' recalled Alan Feldstott, a member of a group called ``Teens Against Discrimination,'' perhaps the only integrated club on campus.
``If someone didn't fit into a group and find an identity,'' they could just slide through unnoticed, said retired English teacher J.
Grady Locklear.
``Mark is one of those''.
Barton didn't play sports, didn't have a steady girlfriend, didn't care much about anything beyond chemistry and math.
The kid with glasses, who drove a gold Plymouth Duster, appeared in his junior yearbook picture in what seemed to be the same striped shirt he had worn for his sophomore picture.
As a senior, he was among a handful of Sumter High's National Merit Scholar semi-finalists, but he didn't appear in a group photo.
In fact, he disappeared from the yearbook altogether.
``He was angry about not fitting in,'' said Grisham.
``He figured, `I'm an outcast.
Why should I participate'''?
Back in his red brick home on Wren Street, a tree-lined suburban road in the nicer part of town, there was also turmoil.
``He didn't like his father,'' said Grisham.
``His dad was very stern and strict''.
His mother, Gladys, served more than 20 years as the church secretary for St.
James Lutheran Church.
Mother and son remained close when he moved away soon after high school.
His father, Truman, died in 1997.
At 14, Barton was busted for breaking into a drugstore.
At 20, he did it again and got off with counseling, no jail time.
``He fancied himself a mastermind criminal,'' Grisham said.
``He was always a schemer''.
TROUBLE IN TEXAS Armed with a chemistry degree from the University of South Carolina, Barton moved through a string of jobs in the chemical industry, building his confidence as he built his resume.
In 1984, his career path led him to Texarkana, a distinctly unlovely city cut from the flat, piney woods of East Texas.
He had a good job that paid well, and he earned a promotion.
He bought a brand new house and joined a church.
He and his wife had their first child, a chubby blonde they named Matthew.
Under the veneer of normalcy, Barton's troubles were fermenting.
At TLC Manufacturing Inc.
, where he started as a chemist in 1984 and became president two years later, Barton continually retreated into his office, locking the door behind him, recalled LeeAnn Burke, his secretary for four years.
``He thought people were out to get him,'' said Burke, who remembers her old boss as ``paranoid''.
Barton, she said, would surreptitiously tape telephone conversations with other employees.
He so disliked one salesman, she said, that he would alter orders the salesman placed in the company computer system to delay deliveries to his clients.
``He had a quick temper,'' Burke said.
``When somebody got on his bad side, you stayed there''.
Barton's home life seemed just as volatile.
When his wife, Debra, suffered a miscarriage, he belittled her pain at work.
When he talked about her with co-workers, he referred to her by a demeaning nickname: ``Stupid''.
``He was real controlling,'' said Burke, who screened Barton's telephone calls.
``She couldn't do anything without his permission.
She couldn't leave the house without telling him first where she was going to go, and what she was going to do, and when she was going to be back''.
The Bartons rarely socialized, former neighbors said, spending evenings alone in their brick ranch house on a dead-end street.
In 1989, the year after their son was born, the Bartons joined First Baptist Church of Texarkana, a sprawling facility with a theaterlike sanctuary on the outskirts of town.
But in a church with 3,000 members, they barely left a mark.
The pastor, the Rev.
D. Terry Land, could remember nothing about Barton or his wife, even after finding the couple's picture in an old church directory.
Mark, holding baby Matthew, was smiling.
Debra was not.
Despite his public smiles, his life was anything but happy.
Complaining about Barton's management abilities, TLC's board of directors fired him Sept.
13, 1990.
According to a Texarkana police report, he walked out the door ``visibly angry and upset''.
He would soon return.
The following week, in an elaborate late-night caper, Barton broke into the building through a loading dock door, police said.
Once inside, he moved a refrigerator in the break room, allowing him to reach a window that he knew was never locked.
He crawled through the window to reach the executive offices.
Barton downloaded financial data and the formulas to TLC's products from two computers and erased the machines' hard drives.
On his way out, he grabbed two 3-inch-thick file folders that contained similar information.
Police and company officials immediately suspected Barton.
When he was questioned by police, he denied the crime but inadvertently implicated himself.
He told officers that anyone could have entered through the loading dock door, even though they hadn't told him how the crime was executed.
Then, when his wife came into the room, Barton told her, ``They think I stole the formulas''.
But the officers hadn't told him the formulas had been taken.
Barton was charged with felony burglary.
But he was released a few hours later, after the company declined to prosecute.
Barton had struck a deal with the company, according to police records, but executives declined to comment this week.
After he got out of jail, Barton returned home, put his wife and child in his car and drove to Georgia.
A CLOUD OF SUSPICION With no house, no job and no prospects, Barton still landed on his feet in his Georgia exile.
Soon, he had a sales job with a chemical company, later, a better job at another firm.
The next year, the Bartons had a daughter, Mychelle, and they bought a five-bedroom house in Douglasville with plenty of space for their two children and two cats.
Barton gave the appearance of a happy father, devoted husband, successful businessman.
On Saturdays, he cooked bacon and pancakes or waffles for his children.
They would watch cartoons on television and, if Debra wasn't home, Barton said later, ``run through the house and beat each other with pillows and just get totally out of hand''.
Again, though, the facade crumbled.
Not long after Mychelle's birth, he testified in 1995, every time he traveled on business, Debra suspected he was having affairs.
She was right.
In early 1993, Barton began dating newlywed Leigh Ann Lang, 21, a receptionist at the Macon chemical company where he was a salesman.
That June, a friend of Leigh Ann's said, Barton told her and another woman that he had never loved anyone like he loved Leigh Ann.
By October, he said, he would be ``free''.
Leigh Ann left her husband just before Labor Day _ the same weekend Debra Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Spivey, took a trip to the Spivey family's cabin in Alabama, where they were killed.
From the time their bodies were found, Barton was the prime suspect.
His demeanor _ cool, dispassionate _ only made authorities more determined to pursue him.
When an Alabama investigator drove him to the crime scene, ``there was nothing about him grieving over the loss of his wife,'' said Michael Hauptman, a former Barton attorney.
And when investigators asked him whether he was having an affair when his wife was killed, according to court documents, he lied _ twice.
He eventually admitted to the affair, but that wasn't enough for authorities to charge him with the killings.
Nevertheless, he spent the rest of his life under a cloud of suspicion.
State social workers investigated an allegation that Barton had molested his daughter, but sought no criminal charges.
Debra's family continually insisted in news interviews and to police that he had killed his wife and mother-in-law.
And Alabama authorities remained on the case.
Shortly after the killings, Alabama crime investigator Danny Smith visited Leigh Ann, warning her that Barton said he would always need a ``young, sexy wife''.
``When you cease to fill those needs,'' Smith recalled warning her, ``you know he's going to kill you''.
MADNESS AND MURDER It was late October 1998 when Leigh Ann Barton got a call at her Atlanta office, where she was a customer service trainer.
A despondent Mark Barton was on the line.
He told his wife he had nothing more to live for and that he was going to kill himself, said Henry County homicide Detective Rene Swanson, the lead investigator in the Barton family murders.
But when Leigh Ann arrived at the family's house, things had changed.
``Never mind,'' Barton told his wife.
``I've already killed the cat''.
Worse, investigators said, is the charade that followed, when he spent two days helping his 8-year-old daughter, Mychelle, look for the missing pet.
``That's what convinced Leigh Ann to finally leave him,'' said Swanson, who interviewed Leigh Ann's close friend, Rhonda Lassiter, and family members.
By last November, Leigh Ann was alone at Bristol Green Apartments in Stockbridge.
She leased a two-bedroom apartment, modestly furnishing it with a dining room table, a love seat and a slew of pictures of her with Barton's children.
At Christmas, Barton told her he had lost all his money in day trading.
``I need help,'' he said, according to Leigh Ann's sister.
In one three-day binge, he'd lost $153,000, according to a trading report from Momentum Securities in Atlanta, where his shooting rampage began.
His losses ultimately totaled $450,000.
By July 4, 1999, he had convinced her that he and the children had no place else to go.
They soon joined her in the apartment.
But the night of July 27, Barton slammed a claw hammer into his wife's head as she slept and hid her body in a hallway closet.
The next morning, Barton took his kids to get haircuts.
That night, using the same hammer, he struck Matthew and Mychelle as they slept in their beds, then immersed each child in the bathtub to make sure he and she were dead.
(SET ITAL)``I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for my demise,'' Barton said in the letter he left in the apartment.
``I killed the children to exchange them for five minutes of pain for a lifetime of pain.''(END ITAL) Barton placed the children in their beds, a stuffed animal beside Mychelle, a computer game beside Matthew.
(SET ITAL)``I don't plan to live very much longer.
Just long enough to kill as many of the people that greedily sought my destruction.''(END ITAL) Lt.
Tony Biello was the first officer to reach the bloody scene at Momentum Securities.
``There were bodies everywhere,'' Biello said.
Witnesses told police of Barton's unflinching demeanor as he slowly walked through two trading offices, blasting away his victims at close range.
It was in stark contrast from Barton's customarily bright and social character.
Loretta Jolly, one of the women at the complex's cafeteria, said they had nicknamed him ``Big Money,'' since he was always bragging about his stock profits as he ordered cheeseburgers and chili.
Traders at All-Tech and Momentum called him ``the Rocket'' for his boisterous personality, and the firms often placed him in the middle of other traders because of his infectious enthusiasm.
But when he finally crashed, Barton had murdered 12 people and wounded 13 others.
Fleeing from police in his green minivan, he was cornered at a BP gas station in Acworth, and he shot himself in the head.
Police searching the family's Stockbridge apartment saw that Barton had tried to scrub the blood in the bathroom and bedroom carpets with soap and water.
Detectives also found a kitten, meowing in hunger.
``Tigger'' is now with Leigh Ann's parents in Macon.
The apartment refrigerator was stocked with food, especially children's snacks: Star Wars Fruit Chews, Juicy Juice, Hi-C.
A child's Boy Scout uniform was on a bed.
There were permission slips for a Boy Scout field trip that Barton had organized to the USS Yorktown in South Carolina for late August.
``Everything they had was for the children,'' said detective Swanson.
``You walked in there, and if it hadn't been for the fact it was a murder scene, it just seemed like the most normal place in the world''.
THE BARTON EPILOGUE (SET ITAL)Words cannot tell the agony.
Why did I?''(END ITAL) In the red brick house where Barton grew up, the only survivor of his twisted life has retreated from the world.
Barton's 76-year-old mother, Gladys, watches the television news reports about the killings, but does not speak publicly about the killings.
When a reporter left a letter outside her house asking for an interview, she responded with an immaculately type-written note.
``You want to know how I feel''? she wrote.
``There are not words in my vocabulary to express my feelings, but Psalm 94:17 says it all.
`If the Lord had not been my help, my soul would soon have dwelt in the abode of silence'''.

ATLANTA _ With his slain wife stuffed into a closet at home and the battered bodies of his children tucked into their beds, Mark Barton paid a cordial visit to his lawyer Thursday morning to update his will.
Some four hours later, Barton went on to commit the worst slaughter in Georgia history.
``He did not have beady eyes or a stubbly beard or anything like that,'' said Joe Fowler, a prominent attorney in Douglas County with deep roots in the community.
``He just seemed real normal, just talking.
I guess he easily could have had a weapon with him.
The people in the office (looking back on the then-innocuous meeting) are just freaking out''.
It's a surreal episode in the spiraling end of a deranged man, who, while struggling with internal demons that drove him to kill himself and others, was also tying up loose ends _ just finishing some errands.
``It's odd that someone who has done this would be able to act with such deliberateness, such coldness,'' Fowler said of the 15-minute, otherwise forgetTable encounter.
Barton had also come to Fowler's office Monday to make ``routine'' changes to his will.
He returned for the short visit Thursday to again tinker with the document.
It was concerning simple matters that Barton did not even have to come in person to do, Fowler said.
The attorney said Georgia State Bar Association guidelines prohibit him from talking about the will until it is sent to court to be probated.
That will occur after a death certificate is signed in a week or so.
On Thursday afternoon, Fowler was contacted by Henry County police, who were concerned about his safety.
Fowler's name was cc'd on a note that Barton left in his apartment with the bodies.
Fowler and his staff were given police protection until Barton later killed himself.
However, Fowler does not believe that Barton meant him any harm.
Barton first approached Fowler not long after the 1993 slaying of Barton's wife, Debra, and his mother-in-law, Eloise Spivey, for help with some legal matters, including estate planning.
Part of that work later included a $450,000 settlement in 1997 from an insurance company on a $600,000 policy Barton took out on his wife two months before her slaying.
About $150,000 went to Barton's two children, Matthew, then 9, and Mychelle, then 6.
The insurance company initially fought the payment, accusing him of the murders.
Police also strongly suspected Barton of the savage bludgeoning slayings, as did the Spivey family and others in Douglas County.
Fowler, a deeply Christian man, was ambivalent about his own thoughts.
``Yeah, I heard the talk and Mark did, too,'' said Fowler.
``As a lawyer, you can't separate it.
You cautiously presume the best until shown otherwise.
``I saw him as a man in grief and my job was to help him with the details to carry on living''.

ATLANTA (AP) --Mass killer Mark O.
Barton's first victim in a murderous rampage last week --his wife, Leigh Ann -- had been worried for her safety but loved Barton's children and wanted to continue to be involved in their lives, her sister said Saturday.
``I'm sorry it happened to my sister but I'm not surprised,'' said Dana Reeves, Leigh Ann Barton's older sister.
``I've felt that this has been coming for a couple of years''.
When Barton killed his 27-year-old wife with a hammer Tuesday, it was the beginning of the bloodiest mass killing in Atlanta's history.
The next night he killed his two children from a previous marriage as they slept in the family's suburban apartment.
The slayings were discovered Thursday when Barton, a chemist turned day stock-trader, walked into the offices of two brokerage firms and fired randomly at traders and employees.
Nine died and 13 were wounded, with four still in critical condition Saturday.
Hours later, Barton killed himself as police pulled over his van.
The first funeral was Friday for Allen Charles Tenenbaum, a 48-year-old father of three.
The grocer was gunned down while trading at All-Tech Investment Group.
Dean Mohammed Delawalla, 52, of Atlanta was buried Saturday after a one-hour, 15-minute Islamic service at a funeral home in suburban Lilburn.
A spokeswoman for the family, Zeenat Hussain, estimated that 2,000 attended the service, much of which took place on the asphalt parking lot with the media looking on from a nearby hill.
``Dean was a very devoted member of this community,'' Ms.
Hussain said.
A private memorial service was held in Buckhead for family members of the victims.
Afterwards, relatives of one of the dead, Edward Quinn, walked solemnly down Piedmont Road to the building where he was killed.
There, they said prayers and placed flowers.
Services for Mrs.
Barton were scheduled for Sunday.
Ms. Reeves, who lives in Macon, said her sister left Barton in October, in part because she was frustrated after supporting her jobless husband for about a year.
She worked as a sales representative for a company that sells cleaning supplies.
Ms. Reeves said she was wary of Barton after learning that his first wife and her mother had been hacked to death in Alabama in 1993.
Barton was the prime suspect in the slayings, but police said they never had enough evidence to charge him.
``There was never really a comfortable feeling with him after that,'' Ms.
Reeves said in a telephone interview.
Barton was having an affair with then-Leigh Ann Vandiver at the time of the Alabama slayings.
If Barton killed his first wife, Ms.
Reeves said, her sister knew nothing of it.
``She's just an innocent victim that something terrible has happened to,'' she said.
Police found Mrs.
Barton's body covered with a blanket in a bedroom closet of the apartment.
In a computer-printed suicide note Barton left for police, he said he was sorry for his wife's murder.
``I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for my demise as I planned to kill the others,'' Barton wrote.
``I really wish I hadn't killed her now.
She really couldn't help it and I love her so much anyway''.
Ms. Reeves said her sister would talk of fights with Barton, but would never answer directly when asked if he abused her.
``I know she had fears from him,'' she said.
``The last deep-down, heart-to-heart conversation we had, I asked her was she comfortable or scared.
She said, `Yes, but my apartment has this security system and that makes me feel comfortable'''.
The couple separated in October but Mrs.
Barton allowed her husband to move into her apartment a few weeks ago, her sister said.
Ms. Reeves said she thinks her sister tried to reconcile with Barton because she missed his children --Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 7.
She said Mrs.
Barton treated the children as if they were her own, coaching Matthew's soccer team and leading Mychelle's Brownie troop.
``I know she had some concerns about the kids, wanting to be with them and wanting to be involved in their life like she had been,'' she said.
Ten shooting victims remained hospitalized after one woman was discharged Saturday from Grady Memorial Hospital.
Four were in critical condition, including a 38-year-old woman shot in the temple and who may be blinded permanently.
ATLANTA _ While relatives of Mark O.
Barton's victims continued making funeral and memorial arrangements Saturday and wondered why tragedy had struck so close to home, family members of the victim closest to Barton _ his wife, Leigh Ann _ struggled with questions and doubts of their own.
Leigh Ann Barton's grandmother, Pauline Vandiver, 78, sat with family in the antique-packed living room of her home in Macon, Ga.
, remembering the soft-spoken woman who was killed by a man they never quite trusted.
As family and friends delivered foil-wrapped banana bread and a fruit basket tied with a yellow ribbon, the Vandivers struggled with whether they should have foreseen the carnage.
Ginger Lewis, Leigh Ann Barton's cousin, said the whole family was aware that Mark Barton was a suspect in the 1993 slaying of his first wife, Debra Barton, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey.
Several family members, including Lewis, thought he must have done it.
``I had to ride in the car with him all the way back to Macon,'' Lewis said, recalling her trip from the Atlanta wedding to Macon for a reception while Mark Barton's children rode with Leigh Ann.
``I was so scared, you know, if he killed his wife.
He didn't talk the whole time.
Not one word''.
According to family members, Joe Vandiver told his daughter outright that he believed Mark Barton was guilty of the crimes.
Leigh Ann insisted he wasn't, family members said.
On Saturday, they laughed as they told stories about Leigh Ann sucking her thumb as a little girl, and they fought back tears as Vandiver remembered a gift basket of lavender goodies Leigh Ann brought for what turned out to be her last visit home _ Mother's Day.
They described her as lady-like with a Christian school background.
And she never forgot a family event.
But they also remembered a woman torn between a husband she wanted to leave and the children she wanted to stay with.
Leigh Ann didn't want to have children, but she came to love Mark Barton's son and daughter like they were her own, her grandmother said.
``Those kids thought more of her than they did him,'' great-uncle Larry Vandiver said of Leigh Ann, 27, and Mark Barton, 44.
``They called her Momma''.
``She said, `If I ever leave Mark I'm going to take these kids,''' Pauline Vandiver recalled her granddaughter saying during the Mothers' Day trip.
In a note left for authorities, Barton said he killed Leigh Ann on Tuesday and placed her body in a closet of her Stockbridge apartment.
Barton said he killed his two children, Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 8, the next evening.
One day later, he went on a shooting spree through two Buckhead office buildings.
Leigh Ann Barton's family learned with television viewers that she and the children were dead.
They will bury her at 1 p.m. today in Macon.
``Reality's setting in since they got the body home,'' said Vandiver.
Meanwhile, with metro Atlantans trying to cope with the latest blast of violence, the sad parade of funerals and memorials continued.
Pastors and rabbis were trying to draw some sense from these tragic events.
And many people were gathering for comfort, healing and reflection on one man's bizarre behavior.
On Saturday, the friends and family of Dean Delawalla, 52, gathered for his funeral services at the National Cremation Society Memorial Center in Lilburn.
The former attorney and businessman, a devout Muslim, had been preparing for his daughter Shahala's birthday when he was killed in the storm of bullets.
A memorial service is set for today for Allen Charles Tenenbaum, a 48-year-old father of three.
More than 1,000 people attended his funeral Friday.
The memorial service will be at noon today at Congregation Or VeShalom, where Tenenbaum served as president.
His chair at the pulpit will be covered for at least a month in his memory, said Jack Arogeti, vice president.
``Goodness was his nature,'' Arogeti said.
The immense outpouring of sympathy for the nine people shot to death prompted the scheduling of a memorial service Saturday at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Buckhead.
Afterward, a walk was planned down Piedmont Road to the two office buildings _ Securities Centre and the Piedmont Center _ where the killings occurred.
Funeral arrangements for Barton himself have been kept secret by the family.
At the Henry County apartment where Barton killed his wife and two children, mourners placed a half-dozen small flower bouquets at the front door.
``Rest in Peace, Leigh Ann, Matthew and Michelle,'' read a note left in a hanging basket outside.
``May God be with You,'' was the inscription on a torn peace of paper in a potted plant.
During the day, the only activity inside the apartment was cleanup by a crime scene crew.
Three employees of Metro Crime Scene Disposal spent three hours removing pillows and blankets.
They also cut out sections of mattresses and carpet for transportation to medical incinerators.
``There was very little bloodshed'' at the apartment, said company representative Gordy Powell.
He said the scene was consistent with Barton's note describing how he beat the children unconscious, then drowned them.
He described the apartment as a neat, ``middle-income family setting'' that reflected a woman's taste in ``country decor''.
Among the possessions left behind, to be claimed by family members, were some Happy Meals toys.
Neighbors said things are returning to normal at the apartment complex, as the numbers of sightseers and camera crews dwindled.
At a gas station a mile from the Stockbridge apartment, a clerk who recognized Barton from news photos said he would frequently buy $1 or $2 worth of gas and complain in a serious tone that the station's prices were too high.
Some metro Atlanta religious leaders said they would discuss the slayings in services today.
The Rev.
Randy Stamper, considering what he may tell his assembly at Faith Free Full Gospel Church in Buford, commented on Barton: ``Some people seem to lose all hope, and they don't have any major foundation in life but money.
When he lost that, he lost it all''.
Meanwhile, Atlanta's grief reached to Littleton, Colo.
, where four months earlier 13 people were killed at Columbine High School.
The two gun-crazed students, like Barton, also committed suicide.
``It's one sickening tragedy after another,'' said Rick Castaldo, who moved with his second wife across the country to be with his 17-year-old son, Richard, left paralyzed from the Columbine attack.
Even some people in the Denver area whose families were not directly affected by the Columbine shootings said a familiar wave of disbelief washed over them Thursday.
``It's happening all over again in Atlanta and we still have no answers in Littleton,'' said Katryn Stienmark, who works for St.
Frances Cabrini Catholic Church, the Littleton church where many families and students sought solace and several of the slain were eulogized.
``We're thinking, `My God'''!
In the meantime, 10 people injured in the shootings remain hospitalized, some in critical condition in intensive care units.
One wounded victim was released from the hospital Saturday.
Derek Schimming, a branch manager for All-Tech, said the four All-Tech employees still in the hospital are ``progressing.
They're still not out of the woods, but they're doing better''.

ATLANTA _ A third lawsuit resulting from Mark O.
Barton's July 29 killing spree at two day trading firms has been filed in Fulton County State Court.
Alyce F.
Wenzel, the mother of 30-year-old shooting victim Scott Allyn Webb, claims in her lawsuit that Momentum Securities, Jones Lang LaSalle Americas and Barton Protective Services failed to prevent the killing of her son.
Momentum should have known Barton was engaging in high-stakes trading and suffering major losses, the lawsuit said.
``Momentum. . . knew or should have known through exercise of due care, that the business of day trading is a high risk, stressful and volatile enterprise,'' according to the lawsuit.
Furthermore, the three companies ``should have known of the potentially dangerous conditions contained on the premises and failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the invitees within the office complex from the reasonably foreseeable criminal acts of a third person''.
Momentum Securities is the company where Webb and three other people were shot and killed July 29 by Barton.
Five other people were shot to death across the street at a second day trading firm.
Jones Lang LaSalle Americas is the owner and manager of the building at 3500 Piedmont Road where the killings took place, and Barton Protective Services is the company responsible for the building's security.
Barton's estate is also named as a defendant.
Momentum Securities released a brief statement expressing sympathy for the victims of the shooting rampage, but said it is not responsible for it.
``It is important to remember that Mark Barton, not Momentum Securities, is the one who was and is responsible for these tragic and unforeseeable events,'' the statement read in part.
Other defendants either declined comment or could not be reached.
Wenzel is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, court costs and attorney's fees.
In August, two weeks after the shooting, the family of Dean Delawalla, who was shot to death, filed a similar lawsuit.
On Sept.
27, the family of Yuzef Liberzon, who is recovering from gunshot wounds at Atlanta's Shepherd Center, did the same.
Meanwhile, a fourth lawsuit is likely on the way, said Jan P.
Cohen, an attorney for the victims' relatives.
Cohen declined to identify who would be filing the fourth lawsuit.

ATLANTA (AP) --Nothing in the second building where Mark Barton opened fire was going to stop him from killing.
Not the unmonitored video cameras, not the unarmed security guard, and especially not the police across the street.
Besides trying to understand why Barton killed his family and then nine people at two Atlanta brokerages, authorities spent Friday assessing how Barton traversed one of the city's busiest thoroughfares unimpeded to continue his rampage.
He then fled, spurring a five-hour manhunt.
``We don't know how he got away,'' said Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard.
``We did everything exactly as it should have been done, and the officers did an excellent job, especially when it came to response time''.
Barton's first stop was Securities Centre, which houses Momentum Securities, a day-trading firm where the 44-year-old had traded.
``Mr. Barton was a regular client, and one of those people who would have never been stopped,'' said Magnes Welsh, spokeswoman for Jones Lang Lasalle, the Chicago firm that manages Security Centre.
``There was nothing unusual about his arrival at all''.
The seven-story building features unarmed guards at the entrance, while customers and employees come and go at will during regular office hours.
The same is true at Barton's second stop, Perimeter Center, another seven-story building.
Ms. Harvard said Barton loitered at Securities Centre for about 30 minutes before drawing his guns.
She said witnesses recalled him saying ``It's a bad trading day, and it's going to get worse''.
Four died after Barton opened fire.
He then crossed Piedmont Avenue, one of Atlanta's main north-south arteries.
Momentum Securities is on the third floor, but other workers in the building weren't surprised he was able to get out so quickly.
``There are four elevators and they come pretty quick,'' said Beth Lavender, a client service specialist for Financial Development Corp.
, a floor below the shooting.
``And there are two doors in and out, so he probably was able to get out fast''.
At Piedmont Center, Barton opened fire again, killing five more at All-Tech Investment Group --another day-trading firm where Barton had been a client.
Authorities responded to the first call within four minutes, but then a backup officer heard shots across the street.
By the time he arrived, Barton was gone.
But police, thinking he was still inside, began a painstaking search of the complex.
``You've got to remember that it was the end of the business day,'' Ms.
Harvard said.
``And we are talking about Piedmont Avenue, one of the busiest streets of the city.
There were a lot of people coming and going''.
It was unclear how Barton carried his two handguns, a 9 mm Glock and a Colt.45, as he walked around Buckhead --an upscale district north of downtown.
Two other guns --a .25 caliber Raven semiautomatic pistol and a .22 caliber Harrington &AMP; Richardson revolver -- later were found along with a duffel bag filled with 200 rounds of .45 ammunition and two pairs of handcuffs in Barton's minivan.
Barton purchased the Glock at a store in Warner Robins in 1993 and the H&AMP;R revolver at a pawn shop in South Carolina in 1976, said a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
The .45, with which Barton later committed suicide, was purchased by a gun dealer in Texas in 1983, but it was unclear how Barton got it.
And the Raven was bought at an unspecified Georgia pawn shop in 1992, but not by Barton.
The identity of the previous owner was not disclosed .
ATLANTA _ Last Christmas, Mark O.
Barton sat down with his estranged wife and confessed to huge financial losses as a day trader in the stock market.
``I lost it all.
I need help,'' he told Leigh Ann Barton, one of the 12 people he would kill in July in a bloody rampage that spanned three days and about 30 miles, from Stockbridge to the office suites of Buckhead, ending in his suicide at a BP service station in Acworth.
As the story unfolds of a man haunted by mounting debt and persistent accusations he had killed his first wife, new details emerge daily about the astounding losses Barton suffered in the market.
Barton lost as much as $450,000 gambling on Internet stocks in the past year, ventures financed by money he obtained from his first wife's life insurance settlement and possibly by tapping into a trust fund set up for his two children, according to family members and police.
In addition, Atlanta police said Wednesday, Barton was in debt to fellow traders, some of whom were among the nine people he methodically killed last Thursday when he opened fire in two stock trading offices in Buckhead.
The man other traders called Rocket because of how excited he got when a stock soared knew that he had a problem: He couldn't afford the day trading and he couldn't stop, Kelly Argo, his sister-in-law, said Tuesday.
Last October, about the time his wife left him, Barton went to a Macon suburb to see Argo and her husband, Gary, Barton's confidant.
The Argos said Barton told them he had lost $250,000 and had only about $20,000 left.
``He's called Gary before in tears when he has lost big amounts of money,'' Kelly Argo said.
By the time Barton faced Leigh Ann at Christmas, the losses were approaching $300,000.
She was furious with him, Kelly Argo recalled.
But Barton couldn't stop his day trading, nor stem the losses.
In March, according to his sister-in-law, Barton told Gary Argo that he had tapped the children's trust fund and that he was facing a repayment deadline.
If he missed it, he thought he would go to jail.
Later, the Argos said, Barton told them he had obtained the money and met the repayment deadline.
Shortly afterward, Barton left All-Tech Investment Group, the first place he had traded, and went to Momentum Securities Inc.
He eventually gunned down five people at All-Tech, including four traders, before going across Piedmont Road to Momentum, where he killed four more.
The size of Barton's debts at the trading offices could not be verified, because such trading information is not public record.
But the Wall Street Journal, quoting unnamed sources, has reported that Barton lost $400,000 at All-Tech before leaving there in April.
Several of the day traders killed or injured in the Buckhead shootings had lent Barton money to pay off numerous debts, according to Atlanta police.
Police declined to say how much money Barton had borrowed from his colleagues.
In addition to those killed, 13 people were injured in the Buckhead shooting rampage before Barton fled and killed himself when cornered by police in Cobb County.
By that time, police had learned that Barton used a hammer to kill his estranged wife in her Stockbridge apartment on July 27 and to take the lives of their children Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 8, the same way the next day _ the day before he packed his van with four pistols and set out for Buckhead.
He had set up a meeting that morning with a Momentum manager, purportedly to pay off his debt at the firm, said Detective Steve Walden, the lead Atlanta homicide investigator on the case.
``He had no money,'' Walden said Wednesday.
``He had no intention of going to pay off his debt _ he knew exactly what he was going to do over there'' Witnesses told police that the Momentum manager was not available when Barton first arrived.
Barton waited about 25 minutes, exchanging small talk with other traders in the room, and then could wait no longer.
``People said he began shutting the blinds in the office,'' Walden said.
``Then he closed one of the doors in the office.
He turned around and whipped out two guns, one in each hand''.
The gunfire was not erratic or ill-planned.
``This wasn't a shooting spree,'' Walden said.
``His shots were intentional.
Everyone was shot at close range.
Some people had gone under their desks and he just stepped up to them and fired''.
Said Atlanta homicide commander Lt.
Tony Biello.
``He was proficient with his firearms and he was methodical''.

DECATUR, Ga.
(AP) --It's been a painful year for the families and friends of the nine people killed last summer at two Atlanta brokerage offices.
Many of them came together to share their experiences at a memorial service in a suburban Atlanta church Sunday, a year and a day after former trader Mark Barton began firing randomly through All-Tech Investment Group's trading office.
Liz Webb, whose brother Scott Webb was killed July 29, 1999, said she decided to visit the building where her brother traded and died.
But it didn't ease her grief, she said.
''It never leaves,'' Webb said after the service, wiping tears from her eyes.
''It never goes away''.
The service was organized by Dr.
Gulshan Harjee, whose husband was killed in Barton's spree at All-Tech and Momentum Securities.
Harjee said she hoped the service might allow victims' families to visit and offer each other solace.
Police said Barton, who had reportedly lost more than $400,000 from his investments, killed his wife and two young children the day before his rampage.
The three --Leigh Ann Barton, and her children, Matthew and Michelle -- were included in the service bulletin, and a candle for each victim was lighted at the front of the church.
Hours after the shooting, Barton fatally shot himself when police stopped his minivan at a convenience store northwest of Atlanta.
The incident has prompted close public scrutiny of the industry, in which people rapidly buy and sell shares electronically, hoping to profit from the market's slight price swings.
Victims and their relatives also have filed 10 lawsuits in the past year, naming as defendants the brokerages, their landlords, their security firms and Barton's estate.
But Sunday, the focus remained the pain of loss and the search for strength coping with it.
About 2,000 people attended the ecumenical service at The Cathedral at Chapel Hill, an interdenominational church.
''Sometimes survival depends on our ability to cry, to feel the hurt,'' said Archbishop Earl Paulk, the church's founder, urging the families to strive for a ''sense of forgiveness'' even if they consider Barton's actions unforgivable.
A year later, ''it's no longer who was wrong, it's no longer who made the mistake, it's about how we deal with it,'' he said.
For some at the service, dealing with it is almost a full-time occupation.
''Every single day, it's a reminder.
Every single day,'' said Shala Havash, whose brother, Jamshid Havash, was killed.
''I can't forget that day.''
ATLANTA (AP) --Authorities are grimly piecing together what they know about Mark O.
Barton, the 44-year-old father, investor and former murder suspect who walked into two Atlanta brokerages and killed nine people.
Some questions may never be answered: Barton sped away after the shooting rampage, driving to a suburb where he killed himself Thursday evening as police closed in.
Authorities later said he had killed his wife and two children before committing one of the worst workplace massacres in the nation's history.
Twelve people were injured, some by bullets and others by their frantic attempts to avoid the killer.
Seven remained in critical condition today.
This morning, both buildings where the shootings happened were open.
Someone left a bouquet of spring flowers --red carnations, yellow chrysanthemums and white daisies -- outside each with a card that said, ``I'm so sorry.
God bless you''.
At the building where the first victims were killed, Allegiance Telecom sales manager Eric Blaier was already at work but took a break to sip a Diet Coke and gaze at the TV satellite trucks parked outside.
``In the game of telecom sales, it's business as usual,'' said Blaier, who works on the same floor where four victims were killed.
``Unfortunately true''.
Speculation on a motive has centered on Barton's work as a day trader, investors who dabble in risky, moment-by-moment changes in the stock market, which dropped sharply Thursday.
But Barton's family was slain earlier in the week and company officials said he hadn't traded since April at the firm where five of his victims died.
``We have no idea what caused Mr.
Barton to begin shooting,'' Mayor Bill Campbell said.
Clues may be found in notes left with the bodies of his family.
Police have not disclosed their contents, except to say that they had found a list indicating Barton had intended to kill at least three more people.
The shooting rampage --the third in the Atlanta area in little more than two months -- and the ensuing manhunt stunned the city of 3.1 million and quickly captured national attention.
It was the latest in a grisly wave of mass slayings at schools and workplaces, and President Clinton today expressed sadness at the bloodshed.
Barton, dark-haired and 6-foot-4, was wearing khaki shorts when he walked into the Momentum Securities brokerage at the Two Securities Centre building in the trendy Buckhead section of Atlanta about 3 p.m.
Thursday. Four people were dead within minutes.
``I saw a lot of blood in the hallway,'' said Chris Carter, 32, who works on the building's third floor.
``There was a trail of blood leading from one end of the hallway to the other''.
It wasn't immediately clear what relationship Barson had with the Momentum firm, if any.
Barton then walked across a busy six-lane road and into the All-Tech Investment Group, a day trading firm in the Piedmont Center building where he had been a client.
Five died there.
Barton, who was carrying a pistol in each hand, at one point reportedly said: ``I hope this doesn't upset your trading day''.
Barton came into the office ``and after speaking with our branch manager, suddenly stood up and for no reason opened fire on the manager and his secretary,'' Jai Ramoutar, director of All-Tech, said in a statement released from the company's headquarters in Montvale, N.J.
``This man then went into our main trading room and began indiscriminately shooting the customers''.
Nell Jones, 53, a day trader at All-Tech, said she was sitting at her computer when she heard shots.
``I was sitting outside the door when he exited, so I was the first person to look into his eyes,'' Ms.
Jones told WSB-TV.
``He was someone who was very calm and determined, no feelings.
The bullet missed me and then he turned to shoot at other people, so I was able to escape,'' Campbell said the victims were shot with 9 mm and.45-caliber handguns.
For the next five hours, the mayor and police did not know where Barton was and SWAT teams and helicopters swarmed Buckhead to look for him.
Police told workers to stay in their offices and lock the doors; some huddled in their cubicles four hours after the shootings.
``We put the furniture up against the door and barricaded ourselves in,'' said Morgan Lyle, 51.
``We had no idea what was going on so we just got really quiet and tried to stay calm''.
About five hours after the shootings, Barton showed up at Town Center Mall in Atlanta's northwest suburbs, where he approached a woman in the parking lot, said Cobb County police spokesman Dana Pierce.
``She was able to run away and contact security,'' he said today.
``What his intentions were with her is a still part of the investigation''.
He wasn't sure if she recognized him from news reports or was afraid because of something he had said or done.
She contacted mall security, and around the same time, someone else also spotted Barton's dark green minivan.
Police were alerted and began chasing Barton up Interstate 75.
The chase ended when Barton shot himself as police cornered him at a service station in Acworth, 30 miles northwest of Atlanta and roughly five miles from the mall.
``He was pulled over, and then killed himself,'' Campbell said.
The bodies of Barton's 27-year-old wife, Leigh Ann, and children, 11-year-old Matthew and 7-year-old Elizabeth Mychelle, were found in their home in Stockbridge, 16 miles southeast of Atlanta.
Police said they had been bludgeoned to death perhaps as long as two days before the office shootings.
The children's bodies were in their beds, with sheets pulled up to their necks and towels around their heads so only their faces showed, said Jimmy Mercer, police chief in Henry County.
Mrs. Barton's body was in a closet.
A handwritten note was left on each body and a computer-generated note left in the living room explained ``why he did what he did,'' Mercer said.
He did not elaborate.
Barton's first wife --the mother of the children who were slain this week -- and mother-in-law were bludgeoned to death in 1993 in Cedar Bluff, Ala.
No arrests were made.
``He was the No.
1 suspect all the way through and still was,'' said Richard Igou, the district attorney at the time of the killings.
The current prosecutor declined to say whether Barton was still a suspect.
Barton worked as a chemist before he began trading stocks, Campbell said.
``He had swings up and down,'' said the mayor.
``He apparently was concerned about losses, at least expressed that''.

Atlanta is still reeling from earlier shootings, including a domestic dispute July 12 that left seven people dead.
In May, a 15-year-old student shot six students in nearby Conyers, none fatally .
ATLANTA (AP) --Colleagues who had lent Mark Barton money were among those killed in his shooting spree last week at two day trading offices, the lead investigator in the case said.
``We have no way of knowing if he had paid them back or whether he was going to pay them,'' Detective Mark Walden said Thursday.
Walden said it was not known if Barton picked his victims before opening fire in the two offices on July 29, killing nine and injuring 13 before killing himself five hours later.
In the days leading up to the gunfire, he killed his wife and his two children in Stockbridge.
Also Thursday, one week after Barton's rampage, there was more workplace violence.
In Pelham, Ala.
, a man shot two people to death at his company's office and then killed a third at a business where he used to work.
Police charged 34-year-old Alan Eugene Miller of Billingsley with three counts of capital murder.
``To a degree it's really frightening that all of a sudden...
someone is copying this,'' said Fred Herder, a day trader who was released from the hospital Wednesday.
Walden said that Barton's attack did not consist of random shooting, but at times he pulled the trigger at point-blank range at people cowering under desks and chairs.
In a note left in the Stockbridge apartment where he killed his family, Barton wrote that he planned to live ``just long enough to kill ...
the people that greedily sought my destruction''.
Officials with the two day trading companies, Montvale, N.J.-based All-Tech Investment Group and Houston-based Momentum Securities, said loans made to cover margins, or money borrowed to buy stock, are common and are usually repaid the next day, with interest.
The Wall Street Journal and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported this week that Barton lost $400,000 to $450,000 trading at All-Tech and Momentum in the past year.
Momentum officials previously disclosed that Barton had lost $105,000 since June, including $20,000 just days before the shooting.
Herder, who sat next to Barton for the nine months Barton was at All-Tech, recalled loaning Barton money once but could not recall the amount.
``We know that he lost a considerable amount of money and that money may have been one of the issues that possibly caused this to happen,'' Walden said.
``But there are a lot of questions that will never be answered.''
CEDAR BLUFF, Ala.
(AP) --Long considered the only suspect in the hacking deaths of his wife and mother-in-law in northeast Alabama, Mark Barton once made a chilling claim to an investigator in the case.
``He told me that he would never go to jail,'' Danny Smith recalled Friday.
Barton upheld the vow.
He committed suicide hours after a killing rampage in Atlanta left 12 people dead: nine people in two trading offices, plus his two children and his second wife.
Police always believed Barton was to blame for the grisly slayings of his first wife, Debra Barton, and her mother, Eloise Spivey, in 1993.
Barton had the motive, they believed: a $600,000 life insurance policy on his wife and a girlfriend on the side.
Investigators knew he had a temper and an opportunity to kill.
But Barton denied he did it, and authorities lacked the one thing they needed to arrest him: proof he had ever been to the camper where the women were found butchered, apparently with a hatchet.
``We didn't have any witnesses who could put him there,'' said Smith, an investigator with the Cherokee County district attorney's office.
``We didn't have any fingerprints''.
Barton shot and killed nine people in two Atlanta stock-trading offices on Thursday, injuring 13 others.
Afterward, his wife and two children were found dead in their apartment.
They had been beaten with a hammer.
In a letter left at his apartment in Henry County, Ga.
, Barton acknowledged that the murders of his family were similar to the Alabama killings.
But Barton, writing that ``there's no reason for me to lie now,'' denied committing the '93 killings.
In the aftermath of the Georgia rampage, Alabama authorities said Friday they were still troubled by the '93 killings but believed they did all they could.
Barton was the only suspect ever considered.
``I don't know of anything we could have done differently,'' Smith said.
``We knew morally that he had done it, but we could not prove it legally''.
The women were found dead inside a blood-splattered trailer at a campground along Weiss Lake.
As many as 600 people were at the campground when the women were killed.
Investigators found bloody footprints leading out the camper door, but the FBI laboratory could not identify the brand of the shoe, taking away one possible link to Barton.
Police talked with everyone who was at the campground that day, but no one remembered seeing Barton.
Early tests on Barton's company car indicated the possible presence of blood around the front seat.
But before police could analyze the spot again, Barton --a chemist -- claimed to have spilled a soft drink in the vehicle, ruining any potential evidence, Smith said.
Another investigator involved in the case, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police first became suspicious of Barton after he gave ``rehearsed'' answers during an interview.
He also refused a polygraph test.
It was only after that, the source said, that officers found out about the $600,000 insurance policy on Debra Barton that took effect less than a month before she was murdered.
Investigators believe Barton, involved with another woman, came to Alabama to ask her for a divorce and she refused, prompting the killings.
Smith said the insurance company, Investors Life Insurance of Nebraska, offered to pay the full amount of the policy, provided all the money went into a trust fund for the couple's two children.
Barton refused and eventually settled.
Court records show the insurer paid $450,000 on the policy, with $150,000 of that going into trust for Barton's children and the remainder going to Barton and his lawyers.
Alabama authorities said they didn't know whether Barton's second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, was the woman he had been dating during his first marriage.
However, her ex-husband, David Lang, told the New York Daily News that she was, and he said he believes she helped Barton cover up his involvement in the slayings to collect the insurance policy.
Lang did not return messages left by The Associated Press on Friday.
After Barton remarried, he would periodically call Smith and ask why he was a suspect in the slayings.
``It was a game to him.
He got mad at me one time because he couldn't convince me he didn't do it,'' Smith said.
ATLANTA (AP) --The investor who killed his family and nine people at two brokerage firms vowed in a note to kill ``the people that greedily sought my destruction,'' police said today.
Mark O.
Barton left the computer-generated note in the living room of his family's apartment in suburban Stockbridge, describing how he killed his wife and two children by hitting them in the head with a hammer Tuesday and Wednesday, said Jimmy Mercer, police chief in Henry County, where Stockbridge is located.
The note made no direct reference to Thursday's slayings at the two brokerage firms in Atlanta, except the reference to greedy people.
``I don't plan to live very much longer, just long enough to kill...
the people that greedily sought my destruction,'' he wrote.
Barton wrote that he killed his children --11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Mychelle -- to spare them the pain of living without parents.
Using a hammer ``just seemed like a quiet way to kill and a relatively painless way to die,'' he wrote.
``There was little pain.
All of them were dead in less than five minutes''.
Barton also expressed regret for killing his 27-year-old wife, Leigh Ann, ``my honey, my precious love''.
``I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for my demise as I planned to kill the others.
I really wish I hadn't killed her now.
She really couldn't help it and I love her so much anyway,'' he wrote.
Barton, 44, killed himself Thursday evening as police closed in on him in Atlanta's northern suburbs about five hours after the shootings in Atlanta.
Thirteen people were injured at the two brokerage firms, some by bullets and others by their frantic attempts to avoid the killer.
Four remained in critical condition today.
Six years ago, Barton was a suspect in the bludgeoning deaths of his first wife and her mother, authorities said.
But Mercer said Barton's note denied responsibility for those slayings and wrote, ``There's no reason for me to lie now''.
Speculation on a motive has centered on Barton's work as a day trader, an investor who attempts to profit from moment-by-moment changes in the stock market, a risky trading method.
The shooting rampage --the third in the Atlanta area in little more than two months -- and the ensuing manhunt stunned the city of 3.1 million and quickly captured national attention.
It was the latest in a grisly wave of mass slayings at schools and workplaces, and President Clinton today expressed sadness at the bloodshed.
Barton, dark-haired and 6-foot-4, was wearing khaki shorts when he walked into the Momentum Securities day trading firm in the Two Securities Centre building about 3 p.m.
Thursday. Four people were dead within minutes.
``I saw a lot of blood in the hallway,'' said Chris Carter, 32, who works on the building's third floor.
``There was a trail of blood leading from one end of the hallway to the other''.
Barton then walked across a busy six-lane road and into the All-Tech Investment Group, a day trading firm in the Piedmont Center.
Five died there.
Barton, who was carrying a pistol in each hand, ``made comments to the extent that it was a bad trading day and something to the effect that it was going to get worse,'' Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard said today.
He had been a customer of both firms.
Nell Jones, 53, a day trader at All-Tech, said she was sitting at her computer when she heard shots.
``I was sitting outside the door when he exited, so I was the first person to look into his eyes,'' Ms.
Jones told WSB-TV.
``He was someone who was very calm and determined, no feelings.
The bullet missed me and then he turned to shoot at other people, so I was able to escape,'' For hours, the mayor and police did not know where Barton was and SWAT teams and helicopters swarmed Buckhead to look for him.
Police told workers to stay in their offices and lock the doors; some huddled in their cubicles four hours after the shootings.
``We put the furniture up against the door and barricaded ourselves in,'' said Morgan Lyle, 51.
``We had no idea what was going on so we just got really quiet and tried to stay calm''.
Barton's unoccupied minivan was eventually spotted by security guards at Town Center Mall in Atlanta's northwest suburbs, said Cobb County police Cmdr.
D.E. Cook.
Around the same time, Barton approached a woman in the parking lot and attempted to take her vehicle, telling her he would shoot her if she screamed, he said.
``She was able to run away and contact security,'' police spokesman Dana Pierce said today.
Barton returned to his van and police began following him north on Interstate 75.
The rampage ended when Barton shot himself as police cornered him at a service station in Acworth, 30 miles northwest of Atlanta and roughly five miles from the mall.
``He was pulled over, and then killed himself,'' Mayor Bill Campbell said.
Ms. Harvard said two weapons, a 9 mm Glock and a .45-caliber Colt, and a duffel bag full of ammunition were recovered from Barton's van.
The Glock was registered to Barton, who bought it in 1993, but the Colt was registered to someone in Texas, and ``we are not sure why or how Mr.
Barton came into possession,'' she said.
Barton's first wife --the mother of the children who were slain this week -- and mother-in-law were bludgeoned to death in 1993 in Cedar Bluff, Ala.
No arrests were made.
``He was the No.
1 suspect all the way through and still was,'' said Richard Igou, the district attorney at the time of the killings.
Barton worked as a chemist before he began trading stocks, Campbell said.
``He had swings up and down,'' said the mayor.
``He apparently was concerned about losses, at least expressed that''.
All-Tech requires each day trader to put up at least $50,000 in equity to open an account.

This morning, both buildings where the shootings happened were open.
Someone left a bouquet of spring flowers --red carnations, yellow chrysanthemums and white daisies -- outside each with a card that said, ``I'm so sorry.
God bless you''.
At the building where the first victims were killed, Allegiance Telecom sales manager Eric Blaier was already at work but took a break to sip a Diet Coke and gaze at the TV satellite trucks parked outside.
``In the game of telecom sales, it's business as usual,'' said Blaier, who works on the same floor where four victims were killed.
``Unfortunately true.''
ATLANTA _ After bludgeoning his wife and two children to death with a hammer, and just eight hours before slaughtering nine people in the brokerage houses where he traded, Mark O.
Barton typed a chilling confession on his computer and warned that he planned to live just long enough to kill ``the people that greedily sought my destruction''.
The letter, which Barton apparently wrote near sunrise Thursday and then left in the Stockbridge, Ga.
, apartment where he had killed his family, suggested that he was tortured by his estrangement from his wife, by financial troubles and by unexplained fears that he said had been ``transferred from my father to me and from me to my son''.
Police in Henry County, Ga.
, which includes the Atlanta suburb of Stockbridge, released the letter Friday as the authorities searched for clues to the motive behind Thursday's killing spree, the deadliest in the state's history.
Because Barton, 44, shot and killed himself in his van as he was apprehended by police Thursday night, law enforcement officials said they were unlikely to ever know exactly what caused him to snap.
But the often rambling letter, printed neatly on Barton's letterhead and signed robustly in large script, offered a remarkable glimpse into the twisted thinking of a man who seems to have carefully calculated his three-day rampage.
The letter, along with recollections from people who knew Barton, suggests that the rage that played out on a hot afternoon in a glitzy suburb here had its roots in the earliest years of his life.
And perhaps, authorities say, he had expressed the rage before.
He was the only suspect in the 1993 bludgeoning deaths of his first wife and her mother.
The next year, he was under investigation for possible molestation of his then 3-year-old daughter.
As a course of that investigation, a clinical psychiatrist evaluated him as someone who was ``certainly capable of homicidal thought and homicidal action''.
Barton's mother, Gladys Barton, who lives in South Carolina, released a statement Friday afternoon saying that she was deeply saddened by the shootings, but that she loved her son.
``I wish there was some way to explain why this tragedy occurred or some way it could have been prevented,'' she said.
Barton's father, Truman, died almost two years ago.
Barton, a chemist and securities day trader, wrote in his letter that he killed his current wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday night and his two children, 11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Mychelle, on Wednesday night.
``There was little pain,'' he explained, in the letter, which police said was left on a living room coffee table.
``All of them were dead in less than five minutes.
I hit them with a hammer in their sleep and then put them face-down in the bathtub to make sure they did not wake up in pain, to make sure they were dead.
I'm so sorry.
I wish I didn't''.
Barton went on: ``Words cannot tell the agony.
Why did I?
I have been dying since October.
Wake up at night so afraid, so terrified that I couldn't be that afraid while awake.
It has taken its toll.
I have come to hate this life and this system of things.
I have come to have no hope''.
Capt. Jim Simmons of the Henry County police said that Leigh Ann Barton moved out of the couple's rented house in Morrow, Ga.
, in October, and moved into the two-bedroom apartment in nearby Stockbridge.
Three weeks ago, he said, Barton and his two children from his first marriage, showed up at the apartment, needing a place to live.
Leigh Ann Barton took them in.
Barton wrote that he killed his wife because ``she was one of the main reasons for my demise,'' but then added that he regretted killing her.
``She really couldn't help it and I love her so much anyway''.
He said he then killed his children to exchange ``five minutes of pain for a lifetime of pain''.
Barton also left handwritten notes on top of each child and his wife, said Chief Jimmy W.
Mercer of the Henry County police.
Each note paid brief tribute to the victims.
The children had been placed in their beds and covered.
A stuffed teddy bear was left on top of Mychelle's body and a Game Boy computer on Matthew's.
Ms. Barton's body was found in a bedroom closet, placed behind boxes and under clothes, presumably so that it would not be discovered by the children, Mercer said.
He said the suspected murder weapon, a hammer, also was found.
Barton noted in his letter that investigators might notice similarities between the deaths of his family members and those of his previous wife, Debra Spivey Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59, both of whom were found in a camping trailer, bludgeoned with a sharp, heavy blade.
But he denied killing them.
``There's no reason for me to lie now,'' he wrote.
``It just seemed like a quiet way to kill and a relatively painless way to die''.
Because of the Alabama slayings at a lakeside campground near Cedar Bluff, Barton's dark, troubled side was hardly unknown to the authorities.
And several months later, in February of 1994, Georgia child welfare officials and the Douglas County, Ga.
, district attorney's office began an investigation after Barton's daughter, then 3, told a day care worker that he had molested her.
``We were extremely concerned because of the context, that he was the prime suspect in a murder case,'' said David McDade, the district attorney, who said the reports he read ``make me shudder to this day''.
Ultimately, nothing could be done to challenge Barton's custody because the child was too young to testify, McDade said.
But during the investigation, Barton was evaluated by a clinical psychologist who, McDade said, found he ``certainly was capable of homicidal thought and homicidal action''.
nn Suspicion fell on Barton in the Alabama case, investigators said, because he had taken out a $600,000 life insurance policy on his wife four days before her death, because they were known to be having marital problems, and because he was already having an affair with the woman who would become his second wife, Leigh Ann Vandiver.
``He was the number one suspect all the way through and still is,'' said Richard Igou, the district attorney in Cedar Bluff at the time.
Investigators found traces of what they thought might be blood in Barton's car, but before they could conduct further tests, the chemist told them he had spilled a soft drink on the area, ruining any potential evidence.
He gave what they felt were ``rehearsed'' answers to questions and refused to take a polygraph test, investigators said.
``The reason he was not charged was they could not place him inside the campground,'' said Paul Dale, then a reserve captain in the Cherokee County, Ala.
, sheriff's department.
Dale, who was one of the first officers on the scene, said there were no fingerprints or witnesses.
`'When I heard the name, and heard the way the two kids and the second wife died, it didn't come as a real surprise''.
Investor's Life Insurance of Nebraska, which issued the policy, settled Barton's claim for $450,000, with $150,000 going to a trust fund for the children, court records show.
Barton had been carrying on an affair with Ms.
Vandiver, a co-worker at a chemical company, Lintech International, where he had been a salesman and she a customer services assistant, the investigators said.
In October of 1993, a month after the slaying of his first wife, Ms.
Vandiver divorced her husband, David K.
Lang. A year later, both left their jobs at Lintech, according to Julie H.
Van Brunt, the company's administrative manager, who declined to discuss the reasons for the resignations.
They were married on May 26, 1995.
They lived in Morrow, a middle-class suburb south of Atlanta, where their house at 6475 Sinclair Place was notable only for the multiple phone lines and banks of computers on which Barton did his work, mostly at home.
He dressed in casual clothes and helped out with the local boy scouts.
But the recent months had been troubled, apparently at least partly because of financial problems due to Barton's losses as a high-risk day trader.
As winter came, a neighbor, Cindy A.
Northcutt, said the children confided to her that Ms.
Barton had left her husband.
In May, she said, Barton held a yard sale.
But it was not the type that people have to get rid of old, unused junk.
She said it seemed as though Barton was trying to sell virtually every item of furniture he possessed.
Ever since the unsolved murders of his first wife and mother-in-law, Barton had been quietly pursued by his former father-in-law, William Spivey.
``I feel like that if those people in Alabama had done their job that there'd be 12 people alive,'' Spivey said in an interview, fighting to contain his outrage that it took the Atlanta shooting spree to spark fuller scrutiny of the earlier slayings.
Atlanta's police and political leaders remained grim and devastated Friday as they reviewed the details of Thursday's carnage.
In addition to the eight men and one woman who were killed, 13 people were injured, some of them critically, in the two brokerage houses where Barton sprayed fire with two handguns.
Ten people remained hospitalized Friday.
Family members of Allen C.
Tenenbaum, 48, a synagogue president and father of three who was killed while visiting All-Tech Investment Group Inc.
, held the first funeral for a victim Friday.
Gov. Roy E.
Barnes ordered that flags at the state Capitol be flown at half-staff and Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell announced that a citywide interfaith memorial service would be held on Wednesday.
On Thursday morning, Barton visited the office of his lawyer, Joseph H.
Fowler, to work on some ``routine will and estate issues,'' Fowler said.
The bodies of Barton's wife and children were found at about 3:30 p.m. that day, shortly after he had finished his shooting spree in Atlanta's Buckhead financial and entertainment district.
They were discovered by an apartment manager who had been called by a concerned co-worker of Ms.
Barton, Simmons said.
Atlanta's police chief, Beverly Harvard, said that police received their first emergency call at 2:56 p.m. from a woman reporting that shots had been fired in the offices of Momentum Securities Inc.
at Two Securities Centre on Buckhead's bustling Piedmont Road.
She said Barton spent about 30 minutes at the office, where he had been trading for several months, before pulling his weapons and firing.
``He had made comments to the extent that it was a bad trading day and something to the effect that it was going to get worse,'' Ms.
Harvard said.
Four people were killed in that office.
James Lee, president of the Houston-based company, said Friday that Barton met the firm's financial requirements for trading and had signed documents saying he understood the risks of day trading.
He did not say whether Barton had suffered significant losses.
By 3:07 p.m., Barton had crossed Piedmont Road and entered All-Tech's office in Building 8 of the sprawling Piedmont Center office complex, where he had traded until April.
``He acted normally and said he hoped he wasn't disturbing anyone's trading day,'' said Linda Lerner, the general counsel of the Montvale, N.J.-based company.
Ms. Lerner said Barton entered the branch manager's office and spoke to him and his secretary for several minutes before pulling his weapons and shooting the two employees.
Both were seriously injured but survived, she said.
In the ensuing shooting spree, however, five customers were killed.
Ms. Harvard said Friday that Barton fired 40 rounds from his 9 mm Glock semiautomatic handgun and his.45-caliber Colt semiautomatic pistol.
She said he purchased the Glock in 1993 from a gun shop in Warner Robins, Ga.
, and had properly registered it.
The Colt, however, was registered to a Texas man who bought the gun in 1983, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
Ms. Harvard said she did not know how Barton had obtained the weapon.
A third gun, a .22-caliber pistol, also was recovered by authorities at the apartment, but the ATF spokesman said it apparently was not involved in this week's shootings.
Two other weapons, an H&AMP;R .22-caliber pistol that Barton purchased from a South Carolina pawnshop in 1976 and a .25-caliber Raven semiautomatic pistol that was purchased from a Georgia pawnshop in 1992 by someone else, were found in the van where Barton killed himself, the spokesman said.
Police also found 200 rounds of ammunition in the van.
After Barton escaped, police first learned of his whereabouts when he tried to steal a woman's car at 7:40 p.m. at Town Center Mall in Cobb County, northwest of Buckhead, according to Cobb County police.
By about 8 p.m., police had trailed Barton's green Aerostar minivan to a BP service station in nearby Acworth, where he killed himself as officers approached him with guns drawn, Ms.
Harvard said .
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) --A small plane carrying John F.
Kennedy Jr.
, son of the former U.S. president, was reported missing early Saturday, and a search was under way off the coast of New York's Long Island, official sources said.
The plane left an airfield in New Jersey State at 8:45 p.m.( local time) Friday and was believed to be carrying Kennedy and his wife Carolyn Bessette to Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts State, where the Kennedy family was gathering for a wedding.
The U.S.
Coast Guard confirmed it was searching for the plane with help from the Air National Guard.
The search was being conducted in water off eastern tip of Long Island, along the presumed flight path of Kennedy's plane.
Jamie Gaspar, an operations specialist at Martha's Vineyard Airport, said Kennedy's plane was supposed to arrive Friday night, but never did.
"I'm a little worried, because I know him personally," Gaspar said.
Eddie Martin, who described himself as a friend of the family, said he was told Kennedy was headed for Martha's Vineyard and was then to go to the wedding of a cousin, Rory, daughter of the late Sen.
Robert F.
Kennedy, in Martha's Vineyard.
According to an earlier announcement from the office of U.S.
Senator Edward M.
Kennedy, the couple was to be married Saturday before 275 guests in a private ceremony.
The Kennedy family contacted the U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) when the plane was overdue, and the agency began checking airports along the route, a source said.
The Coast Guard and Air National Guard then started a search.
Kennedy, 38, is the only surviving son of the 35th president, and was born just two months before his father's inauguration.
His father's assassination immediately thrust him into the public eye with the poignant photo of the little boy saluting as his funeral procession passed.
Unlike other family members, Kennedy never entered politics.
After graduating from Brown University, he went to law school and joined the Manhattan district attorney's office.
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) --U.S.
Kennedy family and friends paid their last respects Friday to John F.
Kennedy Jr, son of the former U.S. president, his wife and her sister in a private memorial service in a New York church.
Some 350 people attended the memorial service including U.S.
President Bill Clinton, his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea.
The service was held well out of the gaze of the public, which has followed every detail since Kennedy, his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister Lauren Bessette were killed in a plane crash a week ago.
Kennedy, 38, his wife, 33, and her sister, 34, were killed when the small private plane Kennedy was piloting crashed into the Atlantic off the Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts State of the United States on July 16.
The bodies were recovered Wednesday, and the ashes of the three were committed to the sea, near the spot where they died, in a simple and private ceremony on a U.S.
Navy destroyer Thursday.
An employee of Martha's Vineyard Airport alerted federal aviation officials that John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s plane was unaccounted for nearly four hours before a phone call from a Kennedy family friend early Saturday morning triggered a massive air and sea search.
The first phone call _ which cited Kennedy by name _ prompted no action by the Federal Aviation Administration.
It was made at 10:05 p.m.
Friday, only 25 minutes after Kennedy's plane was lost on radar and presumably crashed into the ocean.
``Actually, Kennedy Jr.'s on board.
He's, uh, they wanna know, uh, where he is,'' Adam Budd told an unidentified FAA employee at the Bridgeport Automated Flight Service Station.
Until the plane is found, there is no way to say whether an earlier search would have made a difference in the survival chances of Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, or her sister, Lauren Bessette.
However, a transcript of Budd's call, obtained by the Globe, adds fuel to questions about whether the FAA responded as promptly as it should have, and as quickly as its own regulations specify, to concerns about Kennedy's missing plane.
FAA officials said they responded appropriately to the call.
``We've researched the matter and found the FAA was not told that the aircraft was overdue, or that there was any indication there was a problem or a cause for concern that would raise warning flags,'' said Eliot Brenner, a senior FAA spokesman.
Kennedy was flying to Martha's Vineyard to drop off Lauren Bessette, after which he planned to fly to Hyannis to attend the wedding of his cousin Rory Kennedy.
A well-dressed couple with a child who had come to the airport to meet Lauren Bessette grew concerned when the plane did not arrive as expected by 10 p.m.
They sought help from Budd, 21, a Bridgwater State College student from Sharon, Mass.
In a telephone interview Monday night, Budd said he is also a licensed pilot who has worked for the past month as a ramp attendant at the airstrip.
Budd said he first called the airport tower, but was told Kennedy's plane was not expected _ Kennedy had filed no flight plan _ and that it had made no radio contact.
Budd then called the FAA outpost in Bridgeport, Conn.
, which is a repository for flight plans and also provides pilots with weather information and notices about flight restrictions.
During his conversation with the unidentified FAA employee, Budd asked if the FAA could track an airplane.
Budd said he was with airport operations at Martha's Vineyard, then mentioned Kennedy's name and provided two possible aircraft numbers for Kennedy's plane.
The employee questioned Budd repeatedly about who he was and where he was calling from.
After Budd gave his name, the FAA employee asked if he was, in fact, with airport operations.
He ultimately told Budd, ``We don't give this information out to people over the phone''.
At that point Budd gave up, saying, ``I'll just have 'em wait,'' and then, ``All right, it's no big deal''.
In the interview, Budd said the transcript tells only part of the story.
``You have to hear his tone of voice, because the guy was kind of rude to me, making me feel uncomfortable,'' he said.
``I've called before and they were happy to help me out.
The guy might have been having a bad day or something.
I don't know''.
Brenner, the FAA spokesman, said the problem with the tone was Budd's.
``There was no tone of concern in the voice or anything out of the ordinary,'' Brenner said.
``There needed to be some expression that this airplane is overdue''.
No action was taken until a 2:15 a.m.
Saturday phone call from Carol Ratowell, a Kennedy family friend.
Her call to the Coast Guard set in motion the multiagency search that began with calls to airports around the region and officially became a search-and-rescue mission at 3:28 a.m.

WOODS HOLE, Mass.
_ John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s powerful single-engine aircraft plummeted toward the Atlantic Ocean at 4,700 feet per minute in the seconds before the fatal crash that killed him, his wife and her sister, federal officials said Monday.
Although officials with the National Transportation Safety Board were coy about characterizing the descent rate, it was far faster than first believed and other pilots said that it would have been virtually impossible for Kennedy to have pulled his Piper Saratoga II HP out of such a freefall.
``That airplane would not come down that fast in any normal configuration,'' said Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.
``The normal rate of descent you're shooting for as a pilot is 500 to 700 feet per minute for passenger comfort''.
NTSB officials released more information Monday from additional radar data received from a Nantucket airport that showed Kennedy's plane dropped 1,100 feet in only 14 seconds on that hazy Friday night as the plane flew about four miles southwest of Martha's Vineyard on its final approach to the island's airport.
Robert Pearce, the NTSB's chief investigator in the case, said the new numbers paint ``a different picture'' for investigators, but he and others with the NTSB declined to characterize the plane's rapid descent as being out of control.
Searchers recovered other small pieces of debris from the crash, but failed to pinpoint the plane's underwater location.
Although investigators believe they have several promising sites within the 24-square-mile ``target area'' off the Martha's Vineyard coast, a team of 10 divers from the Massachusetts State Police were unable to find the main portion of the wreckage.
Police divers will be joined this morning by the USS Grasp, a Navy salvage and recovery vessel based in Little Creek, Va.
The Grasp, with a crew of 100 _ including 22 Navy divers _ arrived at the scene Monday afternoon, but dive preparations were not concluded in time to send divers into the 68-degree waters.
Those divers are expected to search the area this morning, weather permitting.
Capt. Jack Gallant, a public information officer with the Navy, said the divers would make tethered dives, meaning they would not be as limited in time and depth as divers with oxygen tanks might be.
Should the wreckage be located, Gallant said, the Grasp would be able to bring it to the surface, using a 40-foot crane with a 200-foot depth capacity.
Ocean depths in the search area are generally between 60 and 80 feet.
Coast Guard Rear Adm.
Richard Larrabee said that, while Monday had been primarily ``a day of preparation,'' today's operations would be ``extensive''.
Several other ships from the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will join in the operation.
Federal investigators with the NTSB have been interviewing witnesses at the Essex County Airport in New Jersey, from which the 38-year-old Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her 34-year-old sister, Lauren Bessette departed Friday night.
Based on those interviews and on the few maintenance records investigators have reviewed, there appears to have been no obvious mechanical problems with the plane, which Kennedy bought for a reported $300,000 only three months ago.
Pearce said witnesses led investigators to believe most of the plane's maintenance records were on board at the time of the crash.
However, an annual inspection of the 1996 model plane was conducted June 28 and showed that the plane had logged only 622 flight hours since its manufacture.
Kennedy last refueled the plane on July 11, topping off the tank with 62 gallons.
Pearce said there were no indications that the plane had been flown between that refueling and Friday's fatal crash.
Pearce also noted that the plane's magnetic compass was readjusted two days later.
Because no witnesses have reported seeing or hearing the plane anywhere along its flight path after its takeoff at 7:38 p.m.
EDT, investigators are unable to determine what type of trouble Kennedy may have had.
NTSB officials also confirmed Monday that Kennedy's plane was equipped with a relatively new voice recorder.
Pearce said the recorder appears to have been the type that records the last radio transmissions made from the plane, although it was unknown if Kennedy, a novice pilot, was familiar with the equipment.
Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the NTSB, said Monday that, when operating, the system is automatically activated every time the microphone key is depressed.
In the meantime, as the reality of the tragedy of the three deaths finally became obvious Monday, the families of the victims briefly broke their silence.
After Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
, traveled to Bridgehampton, N.Y., to meet with and console John Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the Kennedy family released a statement.
``We are filled with unspeakable grief and sadness by the loss of John and Carolyn and of Lauren Bessette.
John was a shining light in all our lives and in the lives of the nation and the world that first came to know him when he was a little boy''.
And in Connecticut, another grieving family came to grips with the loss of two of its members.
``Each of these three young people...
was the embodiment of love, accomplishment and passion for life,'' said a statement from Carolyn and Lauren Bessette's parents.
``John and Carolyn were true soul mates, and we hope to honor them in death in the simple manner in which they chose to live their lives''.
The statement was read in the Bessette family hometown of Greenwich, Conn.
, by family friend Grant Stinchfield.
Condolences also poured in from other quarters, with both President Clinton and GOP presidential hopeful Gov.
George W.
Bush addressing the families.
Bush, who like Kennedy is the son of a former president, said he sent letters of condolence to Caroline and Ted Kennedy.
``This is a family that has endured a lot of incredible heartbreak,'' Bush said Monday.
``I wish God's blessings on them all''.
Clinton, who spent much of the day in meetings and at a news conference with newly elected Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, said the tragedy represented ``a moment of sadness for the United States,'' and for his own family.
``This has been a very difficult thing for us personally,'' the president said.
Barak offered his country's ``prayers and thoughts to the Kennedy family''.
In New York, outside the TriBeCa apartment where Kennedy and his wife lived, a memorial of flowers and notes continued to grow as neighbors and strangers gathered to pay tribute.
``To John John from a Cuban exile,'' read one note, written in Spanish and wrapped around a large bundle of red roses.
&QL; XXXX END OF STORY &QL;
NEW YORK (AP) --When John F.
Kennedy Jr.
and his wife died, many people wondered what had happened to the couple's dog, Friday, who was frequently seen around the city with them.
The black and white dog is safe --it was apparently taken to Massachusetts by a close friend of Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, shortly after their plane disappeared last weekend, said a law enforcement source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The Daily News first reported on Thursday that the dog was alive and living in Massachusetts with the couple's relatives.
It was not immediately known if the Kennedys' cat was also in Massachusetts.
AQUINNAH, Mass.
_ Between a beach he loved and the site where his life ended in a terrifying crash, John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s ashes and those of his wife and sister-in-law were given up Thursday to the waters that had brought joy to his family for generations.
In a private, closely guarded ceremony aboard a US Navy destroyer, the remains of Kennedy, 38, his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and Lauren Bessette, her 34-year-old sister, were laid in the choppy Atlantic Ocean.
The ceremony occurred in view of the shorefront estate of Kennedy's late mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and near where his small plane plunged into the sea last Friday night.
Invoking the mercies of God, a Roman Catholic priest and two Navy chaplains presided over a brief, solemn ceremony on the deck of the USS Briscoe.
Meanwhile, three miles away, the USS Grasp, a Navy salvage ship continued retrieving the wreckage of Kennedy's shattered aircraft.
One to three members at a time, the grieving family members cast the ashes to the ocean.
A Navy brass quintet played, but the familiar strains of Taps was not heard at this non-military ceremony rarely allowed on a Navy ship for a civilian.
All along the shoreline of southwestern Martha's Vineyard, vacationers and Vineyarders, gripped for days by news of Kennedy's disappearance and the grim discovery of his remains, watched with the drama from afar.
``I just feel devastated,'' said Pat Mutolo, a vacationer from Rochester, N.Y., whose voice broke with emotion as she watched the Briscoe's progress.
``I woke up to the news Saturday morning and said, `Oh, my God'.
No family deserves this''.
The service, which concluded nearly a week of intense emotions after JFK Jr.'s plane was reported missing last Friday, began at 9:30 a.m. as the funeral party, led by Kennedy's uncle, US Sen.
Edward M.
Kennedy, left the family compound at Hyannis Port for Woods Hole.
There, the Briscoe, a guided-missile destroyer transported them to the burial site.
The warship moved at a processional pace past the jagged Gay Head cliffs and the beaches where bits of Kennedy's airplane were found.
The service, which began shortly before noon, was witnessed by about 15 members of the Kennedy and Bessette families, including Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; his cousins Maria Shriver and William Kennedy Smith, and the Bessette sisters' mother, stepfather and sister.
The party listened as the clergymen conducted the moving ritual of committing human remains to the sea.
Kennedy's sister and uncle spoke at the somber service, which fulfilled John Kennedy Jr.'s wishes to be buried at sea _ and away from the public spotlight.
Shielded by Coast Guard vessels, the crew of the Briscoe ensured that privacy in a strictly enforced security zone that kept the news media, in chartered boats and TV helicopters, far away.
Defense Secretary William Cohen approved the use of the Briscoe, which was diverted from maneuvers in the North Atlantic to become the platform for a nationally riveting funeral.
The bodies of Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law were recovered Wednesday afternoon, and their ashes scattered less than 24 hours after Navy divers lifted the bodies feet from the ocean floor.
Despite the rapid turn of events, hundreds of mourners and the curious lined the southwest shoreline of Martha's Vineyard from Gay Head to the wild beaches along Moshup Trail, near the estate that Kennedy and his sister had inherited from their mother.
Cami Stephens of Hyannis, watching the Briscoe return to Woods Hole, said she wanted to bid farewell to Kennedy, someone she knew and admired.
``He was down-to-earth _ someone who'd get coffee up the street, someone who'd say `Hi,' '' explained Stephens, who said she has been part of many get-togethers at the compound in Hyannis Port.
Kennedy and his family ``would make you feel like you were someone,'' she said.
``This, to me, it's like a nightmare''.
The mourners arrived in Woods Hole about 9:30 a.m. and were quickly transported to the Briscoe by the Coast Guard vessel Sanibel.
Close to 10 a.m., the Briscoe pulled up anchor and began its journey around Gay Head in choppy seas.
At 11:20 a.m., four miles off the southern shore of Martha's Vineyard, the ship stopped.
The crew then completed preparations for a ceremony that lasted roughly 30 minutes.
The service was attended by dozens of Briscoe crew members outfitted in dress-white uniforms.
After the service, the mourners returned to Woods Hole at 3:30 p.m.
Sen. Kennedy and the funeral party then proceeded to Hyannis Port for a private reception.
Ethel Kennedy, the widow of assassinated Sen.
Robert F.
Kennedy, and most of John Kennedy Jr.'s cousins did not attend the ceremony on the Briscoe's deck.
Kennedy, a fledgling pilot, was at the controls of a newly-purchased, high-performance airplane from Fairfield, N.J. to Martha's Vineyard last Friday just after sunset, en route to a cousin's wedding in Hyannis Port the next day.
At 9:39 p.m., about an hour into his flight _ and less than 20 miles from the Martha's Vineyard airport _ Kennedy's plane vanished from air-traffic control radar screens.
Though the exact cause of the crash is not yet known, authorities believe Kennedy lost control of the single-engine airplane as he turned off the coast toward Martha's Vineyard in the murky night sky.
The plane plunged into the sea in a terrifying corkscrew spiral at speeds of more than 5,000 feet per minute.
Thick haze that night undoubtedly hampered Kennedy's vision, aviation specialists said, and his limited experience in piloting the high-performance Piper Saratoga may also have contributed to the crash.
After a four-day, full-scale search involving several Coast Guard ships and aircraft, rescue divers and high-technology government sonar equipment and remote-control submarine cameras, Kennedy's airplane was pinpointed within a search field early Wednesday, about four miles off the coast of Gay Head.
The victims reportedly were discovered upside-down, strapped into their seats in or near the fuselage whose top was said to have been sheared away.
By midafternoon Wednesday, Navy divers had retrieved the bodies of Kennedy, his wife and Bessette.
At 7:15 p.m. that night, the remains were transported to Barnstable County Hospital in Bourne, where autopsies conducted by Chief Medical Examiner Dr.
Richard J.
Evans and Dr.
James Weiner were completed by 11:15 p.m.
In a move to further protect Kennedy's privacy, the victims' families asked that photographs not be taken during the autopsies, fearful that the images eventually might surface in the tabloid press or on the Internet.
A memorial Mass for Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette is scheduled for 11 a.m.
Friday at St.
Thomas More Church in New York, where Kennedy's mother often prayed.
President and Hillary Clinton plan to attend.
A memorial service for Lauren Bessette is set for 7 p.m.
Saturday at Christ Church in Greenwich, Conn.
BOSTON (AP) --One year ago, a late-night plane crash off the coast of Martha's Vineyard claimed the life of one of America's favorite sons.
An entire nation grieved the loss of John F.
Kennedy, Jr.
, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette.
Flowers were mounded outside the New York building where the couple had lived, and photos of the former president's son filled the newsstands.
But on Sunday, the first anniversary of the July 16, 1999, crash passed quietly as relatives and friends mourned in private.
A small driftwood memorial was built on the Vineyard's Philbin Beach, closest to the area where the plane went down.
But aside from the wooden cross, which bore only the words: ''John, Carolyn and Lauren,'' little was done to publicly recognize the tragic anniversary.
''We don't need to be reminded or have a memorial,'' said Anne McGhee, a Harvard University professor who has a home on Martha's Vineyard.
''We just know''.
Ann Freeman, mother of Carolyn, 33, and Lauren, 34, released a statement from her home in Greenwich, Conn.
, last week saying the family would not mark the anniversary publicly.
Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
, an uncle to Kennedy, 38, planned to spend the weekend with his family at the Kennedy compound in Barnstable's Hyannis Port section.
''It's been very, very quiet,'' said Barnstable Police Officer James Ellis.
''We've had patrols out all week and we haven't had a problem yet''.
Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga fell into the waters late at night, seven miles south of the Kennedy home on Martha's Vineyard as he was flying from New Jersey to attend his cousin Rory Kennedy's wedding.
The National Transportation Safety Board determined the cause of the crash was pilot error and said Kennedy likely became disoriented in the night sky.
Just after dusk on Friday, John F.
Kennedy Jr.
, hobbled by a broken foot, limped to the flight line of a small airport in Fairfield, N.J. to inspect his Piper Saratoga HP airplane.
Satisfied with the plane's condition, Kennedy eased himself into the left pilot's seat and prepared for the routine 125-mile flight to an airport near his late mother's homestead on Martha's Vineyard.
His wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her older sister, Lauren Bessette, climbed aboard the six-seat plane.
The engine turned.
The instruments came to life.
Within minutes, the powerful single-engine plane roared down Runway 22 and climbed into the hazy evening sky.
No one has seen it since.
Although his trip to Massachusetts was routine, the series of decisions Kennedy made that night _ flying a complex aircraft without a flight plan, choosing not to have his flight instructor accompany him in marginal weather conditions, and piloting an airplane with a foot injury _ have grown in significance against the backdrop of a massive search-and-rescue operation under way just off Aquinnah, Mass.
The Piper Saratoga vanished from radar screens after a rapid descent at 9:38 p.m.
Friday, about an hour into his flight and about 17 miles away from Martha's Vineyard airport.
Sunday, searchers recovered bits of the aircraft's fuselage and interior; on Saturday, they had found a wheel strut and a piece of canvas luggage with one of Lauren Bissette's business cards attached.
While Kennedy had not mastered all the intricacies of the plane's equipment, officials hope he was familiar with at least one: the cockpit voice recording equipment that had been installed in the Saratoga by its first owner in 1997.
``It was an easy on-off switch,'' said Munir Hussein, its second owner, who sold the plane to Kennedy through a broker in April for $300,000.
``I used it several times and it worked perfectly''.
Investigators say the recorder, which captures the words of a pilot uttered both on the radio and within the cockpit, can shed light on what could have caused the plane to dive 700 feet in 29 seconds and apparently plunge into the Atlantic Ocean just off Aquinnah, known as Gay Head.
The details of what happened in the hour before Kennedy's plane disappeared may not be known until _ or unless _ the aircraft is recovered.
But investigators do know the flight seemed routine until the very end, according to the review of radar tapes from at least a half-dozen Federal Aviation Adminsitration facilities along the south coast of New England.
Kennedy had intended to make a daytime flight Friday, but was delayed when his sister-in-law couldn't leave work early enough, and he encountered traffic coming out of New York, the Associated Press quoted a friend as saying.
But family friends told the Globe they believed Kennedy had planned to leave when he did.
After takeoff, Kennedy cruised eastward, flying at 5,500 feet, a standard altitude for a plane flying east under visual flight rules, procedures that govern pilots who are qualified only to fly by what they can see.
As he flew through gathering darkness, only a few stars emerged through the haze, and a slim crescent moon glowed in the night sky.
Two other pilots familiar with Kennedy's flight experience _ fewer than 100 hours of time alone _ shook their heads as his plane lifted off.
They knew that Kennedy was learning to fly the Saratoga by instruments alone, but that he wasn't yet qualified to do it on a solo flight.
In fact, Kennedy told a business associate in Canada last Monday that for the time being, he'd rather fly with a copilot because his broken foot made it difficult for him to operate pedals controlling the plane's rudder.
Radar stations along the southern New England coast tracked the plane.
But because Kennedy chose not to file an official flight plan, and had no contact with air-traffic controllers after leaving New Jersey, no one knew his precise route _ or that he was piloting the airplane.
Warren Morningstar, a private pilot and spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, said it was not unusual for a pilot to fly without filing a plan.
Still, Morningstar said, ``a flight plan is really an insurance policy, not an air traffic control document''.
``Would a VFR flight plan have started search and rescue earlier''? he said.
``Yes, it probably would have''.
But for most of Kennedy's flight, everything went smoothly.
At 9:39, nearly an hour after it had taken off from New Jersey, Kennedy's plane was about 10 minutes away from the Martha's Vineyard airport when it began a sudden and steady descent.
Over the next 29 seconds, the plane dropped 700 feet.
It then disappeared from all radar screens.
Investigators said Sunday that the air controllers at the Martha's Vineyard airport did not realize that Kennedy's plane was overdue until sometime Saturday morning.
The air-traffic controller at Martha's Vineyard airport was scheduled to leave at 10 p.m.
Friday, and the airport's runway lights were dimmed.
To brighten them, an approaching pilot must tune his or her radio to the tower frequency and click the microphone five times in five seconds, or seven times in seven seconds to reach their maximum wattage.
Until the plane's sudden drop, the radar tapes from the FAA facility used to guide planes in and out of T.F.
Green Airport airspace in Rhode Island indicate a normal flight.
``We had a plot on him, we were able to determine which plane was his and he was flying at 5,500 feet,'' said Howard Barte, the controller's union local president in Rhode Island.
``He came within 17 miles west of Martha's Vineyard, and then in the last few minutes he seemed to descend rather steeply for that airplane.
The last hit was at 1,800 feet and then we lost contact.
``It was just over the last couple of minutes of the flight that this happened,'' Barte said.
``Maybe in five more minutes he would have contacted the Martha's Vineyard tower and begun his descent, but this rate of descent was not normal.
``When you see something like this, you have to ask: Was there something wrong with the plane, or with the pilot?
Because that is all there is''.

CHILMARK, Mass.
_ John F.
Kennedy Jr.
, his wife, and her sister died instantly when their plane plunged into the ocean off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, the Massachusetts coroner said Thursday.
Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board's investigation continues.
One source close to the probe said that all the wreckage of the Piper Saratoga HP II had been brought up, including the crumbled fuselage and the cockpit panel.
The panel, which contains the flight instruments, including plane's air-speed indicator and attitude indicator, could provide a wealth of information on the plane's performance at the moment it hit the water.
All three victims were probably alive when the plane hit, but died instantaneously, according to the report of Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner Richard J.
Evans. After an examination that occurred sometime within a four-hour period, Evans reported that all of them died from ``multiple traumatic injuries''.
But investigators would not comment further on the condition of the bodies or the details of coroner's report.
And they would not say whether their study yielded insight into the biggest lingering question: Why Kennedy lost control of his plane the night of July 16.
The autopsy of a pilot or a passenger in a plane crash is usually less complex than that of a murder victim, experts in forensic pathology said Thursday.
The cause of death is generally known, and the bodies often don't lead investigators closer to the cause of the wreck.
Still, the autopsies in the Kennedy case were performed especially quickly, pathologists said.
The remains were taken to a Bourne hospital at about 7:15 p.m. on Wednesday night, and released to the victims' families at 11 p.m., according to the medical examiner's office and the Cape &AMP; Islands District Attorney's office.
Many jurisdictions refuse to perform autopsies at night, said Robert Kirschner, a former deputy chief medical examiner for Cook County, Ill.
The haste in this case, he said, could lead to questions about the investigation's thoroughness.
In a high-profile case, he said, the pressures are high, and so are the risks of carelessness.
He pointed to other ``autopsies associated with the Kennedy family'' _ the botched investigation that followed President John F.
Kennedy's assassination, and the questions surrounding the death of Mary Jo Kopechne 30 years ago, in the Martha's Vineyard car crash that has come to be known as Chappaquiddick.
``You can't let. . .those kinds of pressures alter your routines,'' he said.
``If you alter your procedure and do things differently, then you're always going to run into problems''.
Still, Jay Dix, chief medical examiner for several Missouri counties, said autopsies can usually be completed anywhere from 45 minutes to several hours, depending on the circumstances of the death.
In a plane crash case, pathologists first try to determine whether a medical condition, such as heart disease or a brain rupture, could have led the pilot to lose control, Kirschner said.
Examiners might look at the pilot's lower extremities, checking for the impact of a rudder on the bottom of a shoe, or some other sign of what the pilot was doing.
Pathologists also follow a complex set of rules that govern the testing of a pilot for drug and alcohol use, Dix said.
After every plane crash, the NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration send investigating pathologists a box of containers and bags, used to collect a series of specimens.
Autopsies of the plane's passengers aren't always needed, Dix said, though pathologists will usually perform x-rays to determine the victims' injuries.
Passenger autopsies are also useful, Kirschner said, if a victim's family sues for damages related to the crash.
A medical examiner could determine whether the victim suffered in the moments before death, or survived in the minutes or hours after the crash.
The timing of the Kennedy investigation, Kirschner said, makes it highly unlikely that pathologists performed autopsies on Carolyn Bessette Kennedy or Lauren Bessette.
``You can't possibly do three investigations in four hours,'' he said.
Still, Dix said, the speed of the investigation, and the fact that it was performed at night, probably won't affect the results.
``You have qualified people doing it,'' he said.
Signals from the authorities in the Kennedy case _ the local district attorney and the state coroner _ indicate an unusual intensity to complete the autopsy, presumably in time for the burial.
Officials were especially reluctant to give out information on Thursday, citing concern for the families.
Deference to a family, especially a famous family, is typical and reasonable, Kirschner said.
``You just have to be careful not to be too deferential,'' he said.
``Because when you're too deferential, you're not thinking of the things you should be thinking of.''
A wheel.
A headrest.
A piece of support.
As the weekend wore on, the different pieces of airplane that washed ashore on Martha's Vineyard were the sole physical clues to the fate of John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s flight.
But experts in airplane crashes said those bits of debris, and the radar signals that tracked Kennedy's plane just before it disappeared Friday night, are enough to confirm a much-feared fact: that a plane could not have survived such a crash intact.
``If you're finding the airplane in parts, that means it has come apart,'' said Arthur Alan Wolk, a Philadelphia pilot and lawyer who specializes in air crash cases.
``It's no longer a single airplane''.
Kennedy's plane followed a familiar trajectory as it fell into the ocean, Wolk said _ so common that air crash investigators have given it the macabre name ``graveyard spiral''.
It begins, Wolk said, when one wing dips down and the plane no longer generates upward lift.
The nose points downward as the plane begins to plunge at ever-increasing speed.
To escape such a catastrophic dive, Wolk added, a pilot must try to level the wings, reduce speed, and lift the nose back above the horizon.
But Kennedy, who had already started his descent toward Martha's Vineyard, had less than 30 seconds, according to Wolk's calculations of radar records of the doomed flight, to do all this before he hit the water _ not enough time to pull out of a steep dive.
His plane would have been traveling at least 4,500 feet per minute when it crashed, Wolk said.
``It's almost like landing on pavement at that point,'' said Len Carroll, operations manager at Wiggins Airport in Norwood, Mass..
Finding more debris or any signs of Kennedy, his wife, and sister-in law might take some time, Carroll said.
In similar crashes off the Martha's Vineyard coast, Carroll said, locating wreckages has sometimes taken weeks.
Tides and currents can carry debris far from a crash site, he said.
And the depth of the water _ 25 feet to 100 feet _ where Kennedy's plane is believed to have plunged makes a search more difficult.
From above the water's surface, it is hard to see objects that have sunk below 10 feet.
Federal investigators cautioned Sunday that the search could take months and that the cause of the crash might never be determined.
But that didn't stop amateur pilots from speculating over what could have gone wrong.
Intense discussion has focused on Kennedy's relative inexperience in the cockpit, the difficult visibility on a hazy, moonless night and Kennedy's recent upgrade to a more powerful plane than the one he'd used for flight training.
But Wolk believes the facts, so far, suggest that airplane malfunction was as likely a potential cause of the crash as pilot error.
A sudden change in altitude after a seemingly normal flight could indicate, Wolk said, one of several mechanical errors: a malfunction of the autopilot, the ``artificial horizon'' that feeds information to the autopilot, or the vacuum pumps that drive the plane's gyroscopic information.
``All of these small planes have a long history of malfunction of various components,'' Wolk said.
Kennedy's plane may have crashed, he said, because of ``something that suddenly overcame him''.
But Carroll said physical malfunctions are far less common than pilot error.
``Mechanical things don't happen a lot,'' he said.
``Most of it's something a pilot does.''
NEW YORK (AP) --Federal investigators have concluded pilot error caused the plane crash that killed John F.
Kennedy Jr.
, his wife and his sister-in-law, NBC News reported Thursday.
The National Transportation Safety Board is finalizing its report, which is expected to be released in the next several weeks, according to the network.
Rather than use the words ''pilot error,'' however, the NTSB is likely to attribute the cause to Kennedy becoming ''spatially disoriented,'' which is when a pilot loses track of the plane's position in the sky, NBC reported.
The NTSB also is likely to point to a host of factors the night of July 16, when the plane Kennedy was piloting crashed off the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard: thick haze, the darkness of night, and the fact Kennedy was flying over open water with no lights below to guide him.
But the NTSB is not expected to criticize Kennedy's experience, and will not address the question of whether pilots without instrument rating should be allowed to fly at night, NBC said.
Kennedy did not have instrument rating, meaning he was not qualified to fly by instruments alone.
Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga crashed as he was flying with his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren, from Fairfield, N.J., near New York City, to Martha's Vineyard.
NTSB spokesman Terry Williams told The Associated Press that he had no information about the Kennedy crash report, saying only that the report will be released in several weeks.
NEW YORK _ A small plane carrying John F.
Kennedy Jr.
, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister disappeared late Friday off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's Vineyard.
Officials said the debris included part of the plane's landing gear and a prescription bottle with Carolyn Kennedy's name on it.
Also recovered was a black suitcase with a business card bearing the name of Lauren G.
Bessette, 34, an investment banker for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Kennedy's sister-in-law.
The suitcase and other debris were found on a beach about two miles from the Martha's Vineyard estate once owned by Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
Kennedy, who was piloting the plane, was flying to the wedding of a cousin, Rory Elizabeth Kennedy, the youngest daughter of Senator Robert F.
Kennedy, in Hyannis Port, Mass.
Ms. Kennedy was to be married yesterday before 275 guests.
The wedding was postponed indefinitely.
Coast Guard cutters and an Air National Guard helicopter equipped with an infrared scanning device continued through the night to search for any survivors from the single-engine plane the Kennedys were in.
``We're not ready to give up on this yet,'' said Rear Adm.
Richard M.
Larrabee of the Coast Guard.
The plane, a Piper Saratoga owned by Kennedy, left from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J., at 8:38 p.m. on Friday and was scheduled to land on Martha's Vineyard about 10 p.m.
The Federal Aviation Administration reported that the last contact with the plane came at 9:39 p.m. when it was 17 miles southwest of Martha's Vineyard, the Coast Guard said in a statement.
When the plane did not arrive, the Kennedy family notified the FAA.
At the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port Saturday, a white tent stood by the sea, and a flag at full staff billowed in the breeze.
A Mass was said on the porch of the house of Rory's mother, Ethel Kennedy, with about 50 family members and three priests praying ``for the safety of the loved ones, as well as for Rory'' and her fiance, Mark Bailey, said a family spokesman, Brian O'Connor.
Kennedy, 38, is the only surviving son of John F.
Kennedy, the 35th president.
He was born on Nov.
25, 1960, weeks after his father's election, and was known to the nation as ``John-John''.
After his father's assassination, the enduring image from the funeral came when Kennedy, then a little boy in a blue coat and shorts, saluted his father's casket outside St.
Matthew's Cathedral in Washington.
It was his third birthday.
Given his celebrity and pedigree, word of Kennedy's disappearance touched off an extraordinary reaction, from the corridors of the White House to the major networks, which broke into their schedules for live reports from their anchors.
President Clinton, spending the weekend at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, was told about the plane's disappearance shortly after 7 a.m.
Saturday, the White House said.
The president called several members of the Kennedy family, including Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy; his uncle, Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
and Housing Secretary Andrew M.
Cuomo, the husband of Kerry Kennedy, a sister of Rory Kennedy.
``All our prayers and thoughts are with the families of those on board,'' Clinton said in a statement.
The cause of the plane's disappearance remained a mystery Saturday.
Kennedy, who obtained a pilot's license last year, did not file a flight plan and did not make radio contact with air controllers during the flight, officials said.
For that reason, the initial search covered a broad swath of the Eastern Seaboard, from Long Island to Cape Cod.
About 3:30 a.m.
Saturday, the Coast Guard received a signal from an emergency beacon off Long Island, but it proved to be unrelated to the Kennedy airplane.
Later Saturday morning, two boaters found some debris floating off the Connecticut coast.
That, too, was a false alert.
Other agencies joined the search.
The Air National Guard dispatched a C-130 cargo plane.
Fifteen planes from the Civil Air Patrol were searching, too.
New York Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the Police Department, acting on a request from the Kennedy family early Saturday, had dispatched officers to Kennedy's Manhattan apartment to make sure he was not there.
The search continued along the presumed flight path of Kennedy's plane, until the discovery of debris off Martha's Vineyard early Saturday afternoon.
That, combined with an analysis of information captured by air-control radar towers, focused the search efforts along a 17-mile expanse of water southwest of Martha's Vineyard, the resort community where Kennedy had planned to drop off Lauren Bessette before flying on to the wedding at the Kennedy compound.
Another clue came from a man who was fishing on Friday night off Squibnocket, a rock formation on the southern shore of Martha's Vineyard.
Officer Henry Meyer, of the West Tisbury Police Department, said the fisherman reported to the police Saturday morning that he saw a small airplane flying several miles off shore between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m on Friday.
The man, a lawyer whom Meyer refused to identify, said the plane was flying extremely low, perhaps 40 feet over the water.
On Martha's Vineyard, law enforcement authorities quickly closed off public access to the beach along Gay Head.
Coast Guard officials refused to speculate on the fate of the passengers, and they insisted they had not given up hope.
But as the day wore on, it became clear that hopes of finding survivors were fading with each passing hour.
Navy salvage experts were consulted.
An oceanographic survey ship, the Rude, was called in to use its sonar equipment to examine the ocean floor, a rippled plain of fine sand which reaches depths of up to 100 feet in the search area.
Currents are moderate in the area and should not interfere with searchers, said John Fish, the president of American Underwater Search and Survey, a Massachusetts company that searches for sunken airplanes.
Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates all plane crashes, announced it will conduct an investigation of the plane's disappearance.
The Safety Board sent investigators early Saturday to the airport in Fairfield and later dispatched investigators to Martha's Vineyard.
Kyle Bailey, 25, a merchandising analyst and a pilot from Cedar Grove, N.J., who has flown from the Essex airport for 13 years, said he saw Kennedy and his wife about 8 p.m.
Friday as they walked toward Kennedy's plane at the airport.
Bailey said he watched as Kennedy walked around the outside of the plane and then went through a routine series of preflight checks.
One thing about Kennedy's routine struck Bailey as odd.
Usually pilots take their planes down the runway a bit to do their engine ``rev-ups,'' to avoid creating too much noise in the parking area, he said.
But he said Kennedy did his rev-ups in the parking space.
``The impression I got was maybe there was something wrong with the plane,'' Bailey said.
``It just caught my attention, like, `Why is he doing this here'''?
He said Kennedy's plane took off without incident, first heading south before turning toward Martha's Vineyard.
Bailey, who flew to Martha's Vineyard two weeks ago, said the route over water can be hazardous, especially at night.
Aircraft like the Piper do not carry flight data recorders or cockpit voice recorders, the ``black boxes'' that investigators use to piece together the details of jet crashes.
The plane was flying under visual flight rules, meaning that the pilot took responsibility for picking his route and avoiding other traffic, rather than relying on air traffic controllers to guide the plane.
Though wind conditions were mild on Friday night, visibility in the area was poor, pilots said.
``It was very hazy, and it was very dark, and it was very hard to see the horizon,'' said Michael C.
Bard, a private pilot, who left Martha's Vineyard about 9:15 p.m. on Friday and flew back to his home in Danbury, Conn.
``If you're not instrument rated, it could be difficult maintaining the airplane in an upright condition,'' he said.
Larry Lorenzo, the owner of Caldwell Flight Academy, which operates at the Essex airport, said he believed Kennedy was in the process of getting his instrument license, which allows pilots to fly in cloudy or bad weather using only instruments.
While his family roots run deep in Boston, Kennedy came of age _ personally and professionally _ in New York City.
He grew up with his mother on Fifth Avenue, and later moved to a loft in TriBeCa.
After graduating from New York University Law School in 1989, he went to work for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.
Through it all, Kennedy was the constant object of media attention.
He was crowned ``The Sexiest Man Alive,'' and ``America's Most Eligible Bachelor''.
The rise and fall of his romance with the actress Daryl Hannah spilled across the front pages of the tabloids.
When he twice failed his bar examination, that, too, was front-page news.
It seemed a minor miracle, then, that Kennedy managed to marry Ms.
Bessette in 1996 in near secrecy on a secluded island off Georgia.
Ms. Bessette Kennedy, who had worked in public relations for Calvin Klein, was immediately anointed a ``symbol of American style,'' by Liz Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar.
There seemed no limit to the public appetite for gossip about the couple.
Even a quarrel with his wife _ videotaped by a stranger _ was broadcast on television.
In recent years, Kennedy seemed to have settled into his work as editor of George, a flashy monthly magazine about politics that he started in 1995.
Ms. Bessette Kennedy, 33, is a year younger than her sister, Lauren Bessette, who is a principal in the investment banking division at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
A graduate of Hobart College, Ms.
Bessette joined the company about six years ago, and was based in Hong Kong for several years.
She has an identical twin, Lisa.
Their mother, Ann Freeman, a teacher and administrator, and their stepfather, Dr.
Richard Freeman, an orthopedic surgeon, live in Connecticut.
A woman who answered the telephone at their home declined to comment Saturday.
Their father, William Bessette, an architectural engineer, did not return a telephone call.
In Hyannis Port, a Kennedy wedding became a vigil.
Christina Rivers of Hyannis was to dress the hair of the bridal party before attending the wedding as a guest.
``It was just wonderful over there last night, just exciting,'' Ms.
Rivers said.
``It's just not fair.''
NEW YORK, July 17 (Xinhua) --The U.S.
Coast Guard and the Air National Guard are conducting a massive search off the coast of Long Island, N.Y. for a small plane carrying John F.
Kennedy Jr.
, son of the 35th U.S.
President, U.S. media reported Saturday.
The search began Saturday morning in an area covering some 1,000 square miles, presumably the flight path of Kennedy's plane, searchers said.
The plane carrying also Kennedy's wife and his sister-in-law reportedly took off from Caldwell, N.J. at 8:40 pm Friday and was due to arrive at Martha's Vineyard, Mass..
a little more than one hour later, but it did not.
The first report about the missing of the single-engine plane came from members of Kennedy family, airport sources said.
John F.Kennedy Jr.
, 38 and living in New York, is the founder of George magazine.
Before going to publishing, he was an assistant district attorney in Manhattan of New York.
John F.
Kennedy Jr.
was a relatively new pilot, apparently relatively cautious, flying a new, expensive and well-equipped private plane.
Kennedy earned his private pilot's license in early 1998, according to officials at the Federal Aviation Administration, who did not have a more precise date Saturday.
Public records show that he was still a flight student in December 1997.
He apparently did not have an instrument rating, meaning that he was not qualified to fly in conditions that required reliance on instrument navigation, but the weather on Friday night was suitable for a pilot of his rating.
The flight may have been challenging, though, authorities said, because on the most direct route, the distance to shore far exceeds the distance that the plane could glide if the single engine failed.
Kennedy had registered the plane, a Piper Saratoga, in April.
A pilot who flies from the same airfield, Essex Airport in Fairfield, N.J., said that he and Kennedy used the same flight instructor, and that Kennedy frequently flew with the instructor to Martha's Vineyard on Friday nights, and returned on Sunday nights or Monday mornings.
The instructor, the pilot said, was not aboard the Saratoga on Friday night; he was in Europe.
Kennedy had been flying from Essex Airport for about a year, said James Paganelli, chairman of the Essex County Improvement Authority, speaking at a news conference at the airport.
About 350 planes are registered there, he said.
The pilot, who asked not to be identified by name, said he saw the Kennedy party preparing to depart Friday night at about 8:15.
Kennedy was dressed in white slacks and T-shirt; his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, wore black pants and black T-shirt, and another woman was wearing a beige dress, he said.
(Other reports said that Ms.
Bessette Kennedy's sister, Lauren Bessette, flew with them).
Kennedy appeared to have an injury to one foot or leg, the pilot said, and was ``pivoting around on one spot''.
He had what appeared from a distance to be a crutch, but was not using it, the other pilot said.
The plane's rudder is controlled with foot pedals.
It was not clear Saturday whether Kennedy's apparent injury might have affected his ability to control the plane.
The pilot said he had previously spoken to Kennedy about their mutual instructor.
``He always said he had an instructor fly with him a lot in the Saratoga,'' said the pilot.
``He may have been getting accustomed to a new plane, and trying to enhance his skills, even though he had the license''.
Aviation experts said he might have been practicing for obtaining an instrument rating.
The instructor, the pilot said, had said that ``he had a good time'' flying with Kennedy.
An air traffic controller, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Kennedy had been given clearance by the tower to take off, but had not contacted the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, which would be the first air traffic control office with jurisdiction over a flight under instrument rules.
But under visual flight rules, which were in effect during the flight, if Kennedy chose to take responsibility himself for spotting other air traffic and staying a safe distance away, and if he did not need to ask about weather conditions ahead, he was under no obligation to check in.
Private planes commonly do not fly under air traffic control.
The plane carried a transponder, a device that automatically responds to a query from FAA radar, stating the airplane's identity and altitude.
But for private flights like this one, the transponder would be responding with a generic code meaning it was a general aviation flight and not giving its precise identity.
FAA technicians Saturday were sorting through all such flights the previous night.
Kennedy's Saratoga was almost new, the pilot said.
The Saratoga can carry six or seven people, including two people in the front, each of whom has flight controls.
The plane has a single, 300-horsepower, six-cylinder engine, a little bigger than an engine in a large car.
It can carry about 1,100 pounds, including people, baggage and fuel.
It carries about 100 gallons of fuel.
List price on new Saratogas is $419,000 for the base model, with various options available.
Small private airplanes typically do not carry cockpit voice recorders or flight data recorders, but accident investigators can usually determine from the wreckage such questions as whether the propeller was intact and rotating at impact, and whether the plane broke up in flight.
Radar can also give useful information, including the path of the descent.
WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) --The wreckage of John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s small plane was located Wednesday, with Kennedy's body still aboard, off the coast of Martha's Vineyard in the Massachusetts State of the United States, senior government sources said.
"They've got the fuselage and John Kennedy's in it," said a government source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation.
There was no immediate information about the bodies of Kennedy's wife and sister-in-law, who also were on board the plane when it crashed on July 16.
Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, and Coast Guard Rear Adm.
Richard Larrabee, who was overseeing the search, canceled a round of morning TV appearances and went to the USS Grasp, the ship where the wreckage was to be deposited after being raised from the ocean floor.
The heightened activity took place after ships from the Navy, Coast Guard and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration spent Tuesday night scouring a site 11 kilometers southwest of the Martha's Vineyard coast, a spot that investigators had speculated was the likely splash point for the plane.
The plane crashed while carrying Kennedy, 38, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her sister Lauren Bessette, 34.
Kennedy, the pilot, planned to drop off his sister-in-law on the island and continue to his cousin's wedding in Hyannis Port.
One of John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s flight instructors, believing him unprepared for a solo flight over water on a dark, hazy night, offered to fly with him on the night of Kennedy's fatal crash.
But Kennedy responded that he ``wanted to do it alone,'' the instructor told the National Transportation Safety Board.
The instructor's concerns and Kennedy's reply were revealed in the board's final report on the July 16, 1999, accident which was released Thursday.
The report concludes that, during the flight from New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard, Kennedy became disoriented in the hazy night over the Atlantic Ocean and lost control of his airplane, which crashed, killing him, his wife Carolyn, and her sister.
The report, like many issued by the NTSB in the wake of general aviation accidents, offers only a simple description of the accident's probable cause and never identifies the pilot, passengers, or persons interviewed by name.
But appended to the report is an unusual extended narrative portrait of Kennedy's skills as a pilot and his training.
The narrative reveals that Kennedy and his instructor had flown his Piper Saratoga II to Martha's Vineyard on the night of July 1 _ about two weeks before the crash _ when visibility was restricted at the island airport.
The instructor told investigators that Kennedy ``seemed competent. . . but may have had difficulty performing additional tasks under such conditions''.
The unnamed instructor told investigators he was not aware that Kennedy had ever previously flown the Saratoga without an instructor on board.
And he said he believed at the time that Kennedy would need additional training before he would be ready to be tested on flying by instruments alone.
The instructor ``also stated that he would not have felt comfortable with the accident pilot conducting night flight operations on a route similar to the one flown on, and in weather conditions similar to those that existed on the night of the accident.
The instructor further stated that he had talked to the pilot on the day of the accident and offered to fly with him on the accident flight.
He stated that the accident pilot replied that `he wanted to do it alone,' '' the report states.
The report, whose basic conclusions were revealed in news stories last month, states the accident was caused by ``the pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation.
Factors in the accident were haze, and the dark night''.
Spatial disorientation refers to the confusion that can occur when no horizon is visible and a pilot loses a sense of how the plane is headed.
The pilot may believe the plane is flying with wings level when it is out of control, or, conversely, feel that the plane is turning or rolling when it is not.
The NTSB findings confirm early speculation that pilot error caused the crash.
No mechanical problem with the aircraft was found after the wreckage was recovered in about 120 feet of water seven miles off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.
Kennedy's uncle, Senator Edward M.
Kennedy, had no comment on the report, a spokesman said.
The 24-page narrative appended to the NTSB report describes Kennedy as a generally competent pilot for his experience level _ he had more than 300 hours of flight time, with about 260 in the two years before the crash.
But, also in keeping with his level of experience and training, Kennedy was viewed as a pilot who could find it difficult to handle several cockpit tasks at once.
Kennedy also appears to have been eager to obtain a rating that would have permitted him to fly in poor visibility using only cockpit instruments for guidance _ the sort of skills he would have had to rely on the night of the crash.
On March 12, 1999, he completed the Federal Aviation Administration written test on airplane instruments and received a score of 78 percent, eight points above a passing grade.
And in April, he returned to Flight Safety International (where he had enrolled in 1998 in a pilot training program and got his license) in Florida to begin an instrument rating course.
Kennedy's instructor there told investigators that he had completed the first 12 of 25 lesson plans and had no problems until lesson 11, which is designed to develop a student's familiarity with radio beacon navigation aids while flying under guidance from air-traffic controllers.
It took him four attempts to pass that section.
The flight instructor ``stated that the pilot's basic instrument flying skills and simulator work were excellent,'' according to the report.
``However (the instructor) stated that the pilot had trouble managing multiple tasks while flying, which he felt was normal for the pilot's level of experience''.
Kennedy had flown his Piper Saratoga II airplane, which he bought in April 1999, for some 36 hours, fewer than 10 of them at night.
Most of the flights were with instructors from New Jersey, where the plane was based, and they included several flights from Caldwell, N.J., to Martha's Vineyard, at least one of which required the use of instruments to land.
Kennedy handled that feat, according to the report, but he needed assistance with the rudder pedals because of a broken ankle he suffered while hang gliding.
Another New Jersey flight instructor flew with Kennedy in several airplanes for 39 hours, including 21 at night, and nearly an hour in instrument conditions.
An unspecified amount of that flight time was in the Saratoga.
And still another flight instructor who signed Kennedy off in the high-performance Saratoga said that once or twice the airplane's autopilot turned to a heading other than the one selected, which required turning the autopilot off and then on again.
In the final moments of Kennedy's flight before it went into a steep dive, falling more than 4,700 feet per minute, the plane made some turns in course and changes in altitude that indicate either the autopilot was turned off or was malfunctioning.
Investigators also interviewed several pilots who flew that night.
The FAA told Kennedy that visual flight conditions existed all along the route, meaning that Kennedy did not technically need to have an instrument rating to continue his flight to the Vineyard, where he planned to drop off his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette.
John and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy then planned to continue on to Hyannis for the wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy.
One pilot flying to Nantucket told investigators that his global positioning system told him he was over Martha's Vineyard.
``He looked down and `there was nothing to see.
There was no horizon, no light.
. . . I turned left toward Martha's Vineyard to see if it was visible but could see no lights of any kind nor any evidence of the island.
. . . I thought the island might have suffered a power failure,' '' the report quotes the pilot as saying.
And as the pilot neared Nantucket, he turned on to a final approach and had to use his instruments because he could not hold his altitude by observations of the horizon or the ground.
The narrative also revealed that, earlier in the flight, Kennedy may have violated a rule requiring all pilots to contact air traffic and get clearance before entering controlled airspace around busy airports.
Apparently Kennedy's plane wandered into such airspace near the Westchester County Airport.
An American Airlines Fokker 100 was preparing to land when air-traffic controllers alerted the plane to an unidentified airplane nearby that was ``not talking to anybody''.
The planes were close enough that the on-board traffic collision avoidance system sounded an alert on the American Airlines plane.
No course correction was required and the American plane landed safely.
The NTSB report indicates that a review of radar data correlated the unknown aircraft with the track of Kennedy's final flight .
HYANNIS PORT, Mass.
_ Members of the Kennedy family gathered at their summer home here Saturday to pray and await word from a massive search for a missing airplane carrying John F.
Kennedy Jr.
, his wife and sister-in-law.
A piece of luggage and what appeared to be airplane parts, dragged from the surf by beachgoers on the western tip of the nearby island of Martha's Vineyard, appeared to be grim and undeniable confirmation that Kennedy's single-engine plane had crashed into the ocean.
The 38-year-old son of former President Kennedy was reported missing early Saturday on a flight from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J.
Also aboard the plane, which Kennedy was piloting, were his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette, her elder sister, according to officials and a family spokesman.
John and Carolyn Kennedy were on their way here to attend the wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy, youngest daughter of the late Sen.
Robert F.
Kennedy, who like his brother the president was assassinated in the 1960s.
The wedding was postponed.
The mood inside the Kennedy compound here was somber but hopeful, said Brian O'Connor, a family spokesman.
He said three Catholic priests were present and that a mass was held for family members Saturday morning on the porch of the home of Ethel Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's widow.
Guards and barricades kept hordes of tourists and reporters about a block away from the white houses topped with weathered gray shingles that have served as a resort and a refuge for the extended Kennedy family for more than half a century.
Inside the compound, an American flag flew at full mast as an expression of hope.
The compound had served as a family's _ and a nation's _ focal point for tragedy in the past, and fears grew that yet more sadness awaited the country's most prominent political clan.
As darkness moved over the relatively calm waters west and south of Martha's Vineyard, the Coast Guard kept up what it insisted was a search for survivors from John Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga airplane.
Coast Guard Rear Adm.
Richard M.
Larrabee said his service and the Federal Aviation Administration began searching for the aircraft shortly after midnight when members of the Kennedy family said the plane had not arrived at an expected landing on Martha's Vineyard Friday night.
However, actual visual search of the area could not begin until shortly after daylight Saturday and did not focus on the waters near Martha's Vineyard until after the luggage and debris conformed to be from the plane were spotted.
``We have a debris field that really is the center of our search, but we're searching an area probably from Woods Hole (on the coast of the Massachusetts mainland) south about 10 to 15 miles south of Martha's Vineyard,'' Larrabee told a news conference in Boston.
Larrabee said a National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration research vessel equipped with sonar was to arrive in the search area early Saturday night and begin scanning the ocean floor for the missing aircraft.
Kennedy, who recently obtained his private pilot's license, was flying under conditions that other pilots said could be treacherous _ haze that made it hard to distinguish land from water.
Kennedy was not trained in instrument-assisted flying procedures and would have been forced to rely on his visual perception of the terrain as he approached Martha's Vineyard in the 300-horsepower, six-passenger aircraft.
The Kennedy plane took off from the Fairfield airport at 8:30 p.m.
EDT Friday and was due to land on Martha's Vineyard at 10:30, according to the Coast Guard.
Kennedy had not filed a flight plan, and none was expected for that kind of trip, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
Larrabee said FAA records indicated radar had tracked Kennedy's plane as far as Martha's Vineyard.
He reportedly had planned to drop off Miss Bessette at Martha's Vineyard before proceeding on with his wife to Hyannis Port.
Despite a self-described love of privacy not unlike that of his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, John Kennedy Jr.
had been in the nation's limelight for most of his life.
He became an enduring symbol of national grief when, as a 3-year-old toddler known as ``John-John,'' he was caught by television cameras saluting the flag-draped coffin of his father, the slain president.
When he failed the New York bar examination, dated movie stars, worked in a New York district attorney's office and got married, it was always in front of the news media.
In 1988, People Magazine proclaimed him the ``sexiest man alive''.
Only his Sept.
21, 1996 wedding, in the seclusion of Georgia's Cumberland Island, was private.
Although often mentioned as a potential political candidate who might carry on the legacy of his father and uncles, Robert and Edward, he chose journalism instead and founded George magazine, which blended politics and celebrity.
President Clinton was receiving reports on the search at his weekend retreat at Camp David, according to the White House press office.
``All our prayers and thoughts are with the families of those on board,'' press secretary Joe Lockhart said in a statement.

NEW YORK (AP) --The latest George magazine -- a tribute to founder John F.
Kennedy Jr.
--is without a celebrity cover for the first time.
The October issue, which comes two months after Kennedy's death, has a blurry image of the American flag.
The issue contains several interviews Kennedy did, including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrahkan, Fidel Castro and President Clinton.
The magazine quotes Kennedy as saying: ``In the most challenging of times, men and women of courage and conviction make a difference''.
Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette died in July when the plane he was piloting crashed off the shore of Martha's Vineyard.
WASHINGTON (AP) --The U.S.
Coast Guard incurred costs totaling $287,402 in the first two days of the search for John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s missing aircraft, a spokesman said Friday.
The search and rescue effort began early Saturday morning and ended when it became clear that Kennedy's plane had crashed into the Atlantic off Martha's Vineyard, Mass.
That initial search involved patrol boats, helicopters and other aircraft stationed along the East Coast, including bases in Cape Cod, Mass.
Montauk, N.Y; Newport, R.I. and Woods Hole, Mass.
, according to Coast Guard spokesman Mike Lapinski.
The costs include fuel, maintenance and salaries and were covered by the Coast Guard's annual congressional appropriation for operating expenses, Lapinski said.
WOODS HOLE, Mass.
_ On the fifth day of a search that framed a great national wake, a red sonar blotch led searchers to the bodies of John F.
Kennedy Jr.
and his two passengers, entombed in the shattered fuselage of his plane on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.
Kennedy's remains were located before dawn by an underwater camera checking objects detected by sonar.
Several hours later, Navy divers in heavy-duty gear adjusted the crumpled wreckage and found the passengers on his flight through black haze last Friday night _ his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and his sister-in-law, Lauren G.
Bessette. The three bodies, found at 110 feet, about seven miles off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, were raised at about 4:30 p.m.
Just after noon, Sen.
Edward M.
Kennedy, wearing shorts and looking exhausted, boarded a Coast Guard helicopter at his compound in nearby Hyannis Port and was taken to a Navy salvage ship, the U.S.S.
Grasp, to witness the recovery.
He was accompanied by his sons, Rep.
Patrick Kennedy and Edward M.
Kennedy Jr.
Senator Kennedy accompanied the bodies on Wednesday night to the Coast Guard station in this fishing village at the toe of Cape Cod.
Because the deaths were accidental, the bodies were to be autopsied before being turned over to the families.
The water temperature, about 52 degrees, helped preserve the bodies, an investigator said in an interview.
John Kennedy, 38, was piloting a single-engine Piper Saratoga with his wife and sister-in-law aboard when it was lost in the Atlantic Friday night.
He had intended to drop Lauren Bessette off at Martha's Vineyard, then fly on to Hyannis P ort for the Saturday wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy.
Kennedy family members, anxious to avoid having a spectacle made of John Kennedy's final resting place, are making preparations for him to be buried at sea in a Navy ceremony, according to a family adviser.
The family decided after much internal debate to hold an intimate memorial service, which will be closed to the press.
The service will be held at a Roman Catholic Church that Kennedy's late mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, attended, the Church of St.
Thomas More in Manhattan's.
The stone church seats just 350.
The service for Kennedy and his wife will be held Friday at 11 a.m.
The White House said President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton will attend.
A candelight memorial service for Lauren Bessette will be held on Saturday at 7 p.m. at Christ Church in Greenwich, Conn.
Captain Christopher C.
Murray, the Navy's superintendent of diving, said in an interview that Kennedy's body was in the largest of several pieces of wreckage found near each other.
Murray said the divers made the recover in difficult conditions; visibility was less than eight feet, the current was strong and the ocean floor was littered with rocks and boulders.
The divers, who descended in elevator cages, were attached to the Grasp by oxygen and radio lines, and other divers stood by on the ship in case one of those beneath got hurt or tangled in the wreckage.
Now that the bodies have been removed, divers will use straps and cables to form slings around the pieces of plane before hoisting them on the Grasp's boom, which can lift 40 tons.
Clinton, who has talked continually with Kennedy family members since the plane was reported missing, said on Wednesday he had authorized a continuation of the unusually long search, which has been criticized as excessive for three private citizens.
``Because of the role of the Kennedy family in our national lives and because of the enormous losses that they have sustained in our lifetimes, I thought it was appropriate to give them a few more days,'' Clinton said Wednesday afternoon during a news conference on other topics.
``If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at fault _ I am'' Clinton said.
``It was because I thought it was the right thing to do under the circumstances''.
According to the official announcement by the National Transportation Safety Board, ``a large portion of the fuselage'' was discovered at about 11:40 p.m.
Tuesday. Kennedy's body was identified within three hours.
Then in a 45-minute dive that began just before noon, Navy divers located the other two bodies.
On Wednesday afternoon, a second set of divers recovered the bodies.
The debris field, which investigators call the plane's ``splash point,'' is just off Gay Head, the western tip of Martha's Vineyard, and very near a private beach that was once owned by Mrs.
Onassis and now belongs to her last surviving child, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg.
Investigators have said Kennedy's plane was plunging at 5,000 feet per minute just before radar contact was lost Friday night, and pilots and aviation authorities said the description that has been provided seems to indicate a ``graveyard spiral,'' a corkscrew descent in which the pilot becomes disoriented and loses control.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn The death of Kennedy, who grew up before the nation from a rich scion to a ruggedly glamorous entrepreneur, has provoked an outpouring of mourning and nostalgia for America's best-known political family.
As crowds thronged the Kennedys' home in New York and anyplace with a Kennedy connection, the John F.
Kennedy Hyannis Museum, operated by the Hyannis Area Chamber of Commerce, added an easel on Wednesday afternoon featuring a quote from President Kennedy, who was assassinated when his son was 3.
``We are tied to the ocean,'' Kennedy said in 1962 at a dinner celebrating America's Cup.
``When we go back to the sea, whether it is to sail or to watch it, we are going back from whence we came''.
A Navy destroyer, the U.S.S.
Briscoe, which had been training in the area, moved toward Cape Cod on Wednesday in case the family decides to hold the funeral ceremony at sea.
A Navy official said ``commitment at sea,'' as the ceremony is known, is typically performed for active or retired members of the service, and their dependents.
But Navy regulations allow for the service to be performed for ``notable service or outstanding contributions to the United States''.
Burial at sea is a ritual that extends back to the ancient Greeks, who dropped a coin in the mouth of the deceased for the toll at the River Styx.
Paul L.
Stillwell, the director of history at the Naval Institute, a private educational organization, said the service has become more rare now that bodies can be airlifted off ships at sea.
For the ceremony, the body traditionally was sewn into sailcloth and weighted by a cannonball.
The service also can be performed with a coffin.
Either way, the body is put on a board and tipped into the sea, to the accompaniment of three rifle volleys.
With a cremation, the ashes are allowed to blow off the stern of the ship, Stillwell said.
The National Transportation Safety Board.
said its investigation into the crash will continue for six to nine more months.
James Hall, the chairman, said the agency will make no other comment until all memorial and funeral services are complete.
Visibility wasn't optimal.
He wasn't licensed to fly using instruments only, and some fellow pilots suggest he should have brought a flight instructor.
He had just upgraded to a more powerful and complicated plane.
But as he headed for the small airport on Martha's Vineyard Friday night, John F.
Kennedy Jr.
knew where he was going.
``He was a good pilot and as familiar with this airport as someone of his experience could be,'' said Arthur Marx, chief pilot for Flywright Aviation at Martha's Vineyard Airport, where Kennedy and his first plane, a Cessna Skyline 182, were seen frequently over the last year.
Kennedy purchased his new plane _ a 1996 model Piper Saratoga II TC, a 300-horsepower, single-engine six-seater _ in April for an estimated $300,000.
It was originally used by a private North Carolina company, then by Munir Hussain of Hasbrouck, N.J., who sold it to Kennedy through a broker.
Government and company records indicate no history of mechanical problems.
Kennedy learned to fly at Flight Safety International in Lakeland, Fla.
, and obtained his basic pilot's license two years ago.
Since then, fellow pilots estimate he probably logged at least 200 hours of flying time _ not a rookie, but not deeply experienced _ in smaller, less powerful planes such as the Cessna.
Then he ``traded up'' to the Saratoga, doubtless looking for more carrying capacity and power, fellow pilots say.
The Saratoga has state-of-the-art equipment, including an automatic pilot.
It also has a second fuel tank that the pilot must remember to select to avert disaster.
``You're very busy in the cockpit,'' said Myron Goulian, head of Executive Flyers Aviation in Bedford, Mass.
, a 35-year-old family-owned flight school.
``That might have been a little bit too much plane for him''.
Goulian also questioned why Kennedy took off Friday evening from the airport in New Jersey in the first place.
Pilots were reporting poor visibility due to haze, he said.
Kennedy was not licensed to fly using instruments only, did not have a flight instructor accompanying him and may have had an injured foot as well _ although one N.J.-based pilot, Larry Lorenzo, said Kennedy could have operated the rudder pedals on the plane fairly easily.
``If he could walk, he could fly''.
Kennedy also didn't file a flight plan with authorities, though he was not required to, and did not ask for a private service that tracks private flights, either.
``He shouldn't have been in the air, in my opinion.
He should have been at home or in a bus or a train,'' Goulian said.
``That was a bad judgment call, to leave, especially that late at night.
From what I hear it was a horrible night''.
The less-than-perfect visibility conditions _ known in flying parlance as ``marginal VFR (visual flight rules),'' made Kennedy's trip more challenging than normal, agreed Warren Morningstar, director of media relations for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, a general aviation lobbying group.
Pilots under those conditions would have ``a more difficult time discerning the horizon.
The ability to see the horizon, or having a view of the ground, is needed for spatial oreintation to keep the plane upright,'' Morningstar said.
Concerning the more powerful aircraft, Goulian said, ``you just adjust to the performance capability of the airplane, and you need the experience level to keep up with it.
It's great as long as you're ahead of the airplane.
Some pilots jump from a 90 m.p.h training airplane to a 220 m.p.h. plane that's very slippery and high-performance, and they get through that phase.
Others don't''.
Morningstar said the Saratoga ``is not the sort of plane you would want to learn to fly in, but it should not be a handful for a low-time pilot who had proper training in the aircraft.
They are very solid''.
``It is really easy to fly.
My 6-year-old son can and has kept it flying straight,'' said Michael Danziger, a Lincoln, Mass.
pilot who owns a Saratoga and flies frequently to the Vineyard.
The plane has sophisticated avionics including GPS, or global positioning system, which would enable Kennedy to be sitting on the ground in Caldwell, N.J., plug in Martha's Vineyard and get the distance and compass heading he should target.
Among other things, GPS can tell a pilot where the nearest airport is in case of emergency.
The plane also has an autopilot, that with the press of two buttons, will keep the craft at a designated altitude and heading, and by moving a dial on a compass, the pilot can turn the plane even though the auto pilot is still engaged.

In a final report issued Thursday on last year's July 19 crash of the aircraft near Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts State, the United States,the NTSB said Kennedy, son of the late U.S. president, had become disorientated during a descent over water at night.
Killed were Kennedy, 38, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her 34-year-old sister, Lauren Bessette.
The crash probably occurred because of "the pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night," the report said.
Kennedy's piloting difficulties were likely to have been caused by "spatial disorientation," a problem when pilots lose track of the position and motion of their plane relative to the earth's surface, it added.
This type of disorientation is one of the leading causes of fatal aircraft accidents, according to a U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration report.
Investigators said they could not find any mechanical problems with Kennedy's Piper Saratoga II, and autopsies on all three victims found no abnormalities.
BOSTON --Forty-eight hours after John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s plane plunged into the ocean off Martha's Vineyard, federal officials Sunday ended their search for survivors, effectively declaring Kennedy, his wife and her sister the victims of a fatal crash.
The move came as an announcement by Coast Guard officials that the intensive, multiagency mission had shifted from ``search and rescue'' to ``search and recovery,'' a bureaucratic way of saying hope had ended of finding them alive.
``This is not the result that we were looking for.
This is not the result we were hoping for,'' said Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard Larrabbee.
Meanwhile, Larrabbee said divers from the Massachusetts State Police would begin work Monday investigating two ``potential targets'' identified by sophisticated sonar as unusual objects on the ocean floor.
He strongly cautioned that, based on the information available Sunday night, the targets ``don't in any way represent an aircraft or any parts of it''.
He said the objects were in 60 feet to 80 feet of water.
Larrabbee said the decision to end the rescue efforts were made in consultation with the National Transportation Safety Board and had been communicated to Kennedy's family and the family of his passengers: his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister, Lauren Bessette.
``I've spent some very painful moments with the families tonight,'' a somber Larrabbee said.
``It was very difficult for me to share the information with them''.
He said the move was based on four factors: the expected length of survival time in the 68-degree waters is just 12 to 18 hours; the plane had no emergency survival equipment; the two days of searching found nothing to indicate anyone had survived; and the NTSB's experience in assessing the probability of survival in this type of crash.
Meanwhile, federal safety investigators said a rare feature aboard Kennedy's small plane _ a voice recorder _ might provide clues to the Friday night crash.
Also Sunday, questions arose whether search and rescue operations might have begun five hours earlier had proper procedures been followed when a Martha's Vineyard Airport employee tried to alert authorities that the flight was overdue.
Even before Larrabee's announcement, the mood grew increasingly somber at the Kennedy family's Hyannis Port compound, where three priests clad in white celebrated Mass under a white tent.
Senator Edward M.
Kennedy held a wine chalice while one of the priests distributed Communion wafers.
Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F.
Kennedy, also served consecrated wine to the dozen or so people who attended the service.
At an afternoon press briefing, the chairman of the NTSB cautioned that the investigation into the crash would take six to nine months, and the cause might remain elusive.
``At this point we do not know.
We will not know for some time.
There is even a possibility we will never know,'' NTSB Chairman James Hall said.
Sunday, Coast Guard searchers turned up only bits of a headrest and foam insulation they believe came from Kennedy's single-engine airplane.
The insulation, in pieces ranging from 2 to 10 inches in diameter, were found along a mile-long stretch of beach by Aquinnah, an area known as Gay Head.
Coast Guard officials said widespread reports of an oil slick near the search area Sunday were unrelated.
On Saturday, investigators found a seat, a headrest, a nose wheel, several other airplane parts, a suitcase belonging to Lauren Bessette, and a prescription bottle belonging to Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.
Kennedy's six-seat Piper Saratoga II HP did not have ``black boxes,'' devices required on all commercial planes that record cockpit conversations and radio transmissions as well as many parameters of an airplane's performance.
However, Kennedy's plane did have a manual voice recorder, a device that is mostly unheard of on all but the most recent models of private planes.
The voice recorder, installed after the plane left the factory, would capture any radio transmissions and possibly some of Kennedy's utterances to his passengers, but would have had to be turned on by the pilot for it to operate.
It was unclear whether the recorder would yield much information.
An official with the NTSB, which assumed control of the investigation Sunday, said a review of radio traffic showed that ground controllers received no communications or distress calls from the plane in the last 40 minutes it was known to have been in the air.
Still, investigators were hoping that Kennedy turned on the recorder before he taxied out to takeoff and that it might capture something that air traffic controllers never heard _ a mayday call, or something that would reveal details of the final moments of the flight.
The NTSB assigned an investigator to track down the person who installed the device in an attempt to learn more about it, federal sources said.
Questions about the response time of the search effort were prompted by the actions Friday night of Adam Budd, a ramp attendent at the Martha's Vineyard Airport.
Budd, 21, of Sharon, Mass.
, said he waited with a couple and their young daughter for the Kennedy plane to arrive.
After 10 p.m., the anticipated arrival time, Budd said, he checked with the tower but was told there was no sign of the plane and there was no indication that Kennedy had radioed a request to land.
Budd said he then telephoned Bridgeport Automated Flight Service Station in Connecticut, an FAA-run facility where pilots sometimes file their flight plans.
Kennedy was not required to file a flight plan, and had not done so.
Budd said he talked to an operator at the Bridgeport station, whose toll-free number is well-known to area pilots.
``I told him the tail number (of Kennedy's plane), and I asked them if they had the tail number'' on a flight plan, Budd said.
The operator was unresponsive, Budd said: ``He just didn't want to talk to me''.
George Mackie, an operations supervisor at the Bridgeport station, said Sunday that Budd's call should have triggered a search by the center.
Even if a pilot is flying under visual flight rules, as Kennedy was, and has not filed a flight plan, the flight service is expected to begin searching for an aircraft once it has been identified as late, Mackie said.
``If someone calls us and tells us an airplane is late, we will begin a search that usually starts with telephone calls,'' he said.
The telephone inquiry usually consists of contacting small airports in the area, the FAA, and, eventually, the Air Force's Air Rescue Coordination Center in Virginia, Mackie said.
As it turned out, a search was not initiated until after a Kennedy family friend called the Coast Guard at Woods Hole at about 2:15 a.m.
Saturday. The first search vessel was launched at about 4:30 a.m.
The FAA, which oversees the Bridgeport center, has declined to comment on the investigation and the response time.
Excitement that the plane might have been found was triggered Sunday when Coast Guard officials said a beacon signal was heard at about 3:30 p.m. by a huge Air Force C-130 that has been providing in-flight air control for the intensive air, water, and land search that began early Saturday.
The Coast Guard immediately dispatched the Rude (pronounced Rudy), a 90-foot ship belonging to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration that is equipped with sonar capable of creating detailed images of objects beneath the surface.
Sunday night, however, Larrabbee said the beacon signal appeared to have been a false alarm, possibly set off by a marker the Coast Guard had placed in the water to keep track of areas already searched.
An earlier beacon signal picked up before dawn Saturday off Montauk, Long Island, also was said to be unrelated to the Kennedy search.
The tent at the Kennedy compound where the Mass was said had been intended for 275 guests invited to the wedding of Rory Kennedy, the youngest daughter of RFK.
John F.
Kennedy Jr.
, 38, and his 33-year-old wife had planned to attend the wedding Saturday after dropping off Lauren Bessette, 34, on Martha's Vineyard.
The wedding was postponed indefinitely, and would-be wedding guests began trickling into Barnstable Municipal Airport in Hyannis Sunday to catch flights home.
A friend of the Kennedy family said hope had dimmed by Saturday evening, and talk of survivors had been replaced by discussions of memorial services.
Inside the compound at Hyannis Port, where so many of the family's joys and tragedies have been played out, the Kennedys had no illusions about the news from Martha's Vineyard, family friends and associates said Sunday.
``They are doing as they always do: getting through this and dealing with it,'' said Robert Shrum, a friend and adviser of Edward Kennedy.
``It is obviously very difficult''.
Also Sunday, NTSB officials gave the most complete account to date of Kennedy's fateful flight.
Robert Pearce, an NTSB regional director who is heading the Kennedy investigation, said the plane took off at 8:38 p.m. from Runway 22 at Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J.
Kennedy had to make an immediate 180-degree turn to point his plane in a northeasterly direction.
He headed north at an altitude of 5,600 feet along the Connecticut coast.
He passed over Westerly, R.I., at 9:26 p.m., at that same altitude.
He then began his descent toward Martha's Vineyard, though Pearce said his precise rate of descent was not clear.
At 9:40 p.m., two radar stations at Cape Cod picked up the plane at 2,500 feet, 17 or 18 miles west of Martha's Vineyard Airport, which means he was about 10 or 11 miles off the island's coast.
During the next 29 seconds, the plane dropped from 2,500 to 1,800 feet.
After that point _ at 9:40:29 p.m.
_ the plane disappeared from radar.

When John F.
Kennedy Jr.
climbed into the cockpit of a small plane Friday night, he was, by all accounts, in for a difficult ride.
The plane was small but powerful, the conditions tough for navigation.
The disappearance of Kennedy's plane has raised familiar questions about the rules regarding flights, the safety of flying small aircraft, and the weather conditions that might have made Kennedy's flight especially difficult.
Here are some of the issues that may have come in to play when Kennedy's six-seater plane took off from New Jersey: &QL; &QL; Q.
What was the original schedule for Kennedy's flight?
A. Kennedy took off from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J. at 8:38 p.m.
Friday night, flying a Piper Saratoga single-engine plane.
On board were Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren.
The flight was expected to arrive at Martha's Vineyard Airport at about 10 p.m., but never did.
The last radar signal from Kennedy's plane was received at 9:38 p.m., as the plane made its approach into Martha's Vineyard.
&QL; &QL; Q.
What were the conditions at the time of the flight?
A. According to the National Weather Service, visibility at Essex County Airport was 4-5 miles in haze, with clear skies, at about the time Kennedy took off.
Those are considered marginal conditions for the use of Visual Flight Rules: piloting a plane by using visual or ground references to guide you.
If visibility is 1,000 to 3,000 miles and the cloud ceiling is between 500 and 1,000 feet, pilots are required to use Instrument Flight Rules, using a plane's mechanical systems to guide the flight.
Flying under IFR requires additional certification, which Kennedy did not have.
Flight instructors say hazy conditions are difficult for VFR flying, especially at night, and especially over the water, where pilots have no visual reference points to guide them.
At the time Kennedy was due to arrive at Martha's Vineyard, visibility had improved, increasing to 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.
&QL; &QL; Q.
Are runway lights on at the Martha's Vineyard Airport at all times?
A. The lights would have been on as Kennedy's plane made its final approach to Martha's Vineyard at about 9:30 p.m.
Lights are turned off when the airport tower closes at 10 p.m., but pilots can turn them on by radio.
The airport operates 24 hours a day.
&QL; &QL; Q.
Should anyone in the airport have been concerned that Kennedy's flight did not arrive, or that his radar dropped off?
A. Probably not.
Kennedy was not required to file a flight plan for his trip to Martha's Vineyard.
If a plane has not filed a flight plan, and is not in radio contract with controllers, any deviation would not cause alarm.
It is unclear whether Kennedy communicated with the control tower at Martha's Vineyard.
Airport officials Saturday declined to comment.
&QL; &QL; Q.
What kind of flight certification did John F.
Kennedy, Jr.
have? A.
Kennedy received his basic pilot's license two years ago in Florida, and frequently flew in his Cessna Skyline 182.
In April, he purchased the Piper Saratoga plane, which has far more engine power and requires additional training to fly.
&QL; &QL; Q.
What are the requirements for flight certification?
A. To receive an initial certification, a student pilot must complete a written exam, log at least 40 hours of flight time, and pass a final ``check ride'' with an FAA examiner.
Most students log 60 or 70 hours before seeking certification.
To fly a plane with complex gear or a more powerful engine, a student needs further instruction and the endorsement of a flight instructor.
It is not known now whether Kennedy received additional instruction before or after buying a more powerful plane.
&QL; &QL; Q.
Is there anything special about the type of plane Kennedy was flying, and what is its safety record?
A. The Piper Saratoga II is a 300-horsepower six-seater with a maximum speed of 192 knots and a cruising range of 188 nautical miles, or about five hours of flying time if the fuel tanks are topped off.
Manufactured by The New Piper Aircraft Inc.
of Vero Beach, Fla.
, it is described in company literature as the ``SUV of single-engine planes''.
More than 7,500 are in use worldwide, flying 500,000 hours annually.
The plane is equipped with an Emergency Locating Transmitter, which can be triggered manually by the pilot, or is automatically activated by impact with the ground or water.
The transmitter emits a radio signal but does not work underwater.
There is no flight data recorder as with large commercial jets.
Since 1996, the Saratoga has been involved in 118 accidents or incidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, and 26 crashes in which a fatality occured.
OTIS AIR FORCE BASE, Mass.
(AP) --Two flatbed trucks under police escort transported wreckage from the John F.
Kennedy Jr.
plane crash to the Coast Guard hangar where it will be examined in detail by federal investigators.
Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga, described as ``twisted metal,'' arrived late Friday night, a Coast Guard official said.
The National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation, hopes to learn what happened July 16 that caused the plane to dive into the sea off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.
However authorities have acknowledged they may never find the reason for the crash that killed Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law.
Reports have emerged that there was no mechanical failure in the engine or with the craft's propellers.
CBS news reported Friday night that preliminary reports showed pilot error is suspected to be the cause behind the fatal accident.
Ordinarily, only one regional investigator would be assigned to examine the cause of a small plane crash, NTSB spokesman Paul Schlamm told the Boston Herald.
In the Kennedy crash, a team of eight or nine people will investigate, Schlamm said, including specialists such as metallurgists, meteorologists and structures experts.
The safety board will examine all the available parts to figure out how the plane broke up --and the cause of the break-up.
``Was it an impact break?
Was there a crack?
Was there something pre-existing''?
Schlamm said.
Officials are also examining radar data from five states to create a more accurate picture of the plane's path before it crashed about 7 miles off the coast of Aquinnah.
They will analyze the plane's history and maintenance records as well as Kennedy's pilot experience for more clues to the flight's final records.
No more of the plane's debris is expected to be recovered, Navy Lt.
Cmdr. Victor Beck said.
About 90 percent of the wreckage has been removed from the ocean floor, he said.
``Everything's aboard that's coming aboard,'' Beck said.
``The Navy's work here is done.''
ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) --Turkey's prime minister has promised stricter building rules to prevent any more of the shoddy construction blamed for the thousands of deaths from last week's massive earthquake.
Meanwhile, eight days after the powerful 7.4-magnitude temblor reduced a wide swath of western Turkey to rubble, searchers said they still held out hopes --though slim -- that more people could be found alive.
The government on Tuesday said the death toll rose to 17,997, but revised that figure down to 12,514 early today.
In Cinarcik, a suburb of the resort town of Yalova, rescuers rushed to the site of a collapsed building after residents reported hearing sounds from under the crushed concrete.
Lt. Col.
Numan Arslanyer, head of the crisis center in Yalova, said four brothers were believed buried in the building, and that Turkish, Bulgarian and German rescuers were working intensively to dig them out.
``We have not lost hope to find people alive, and we will not lose hope,'' he said today.
The last live rescue was Monday, when a 4-year-old boy was saved.
A new tremor 200 miles away sent residents running into the streets in panic Tuesday night.
The 4.7-magnitude quake was centered near Haymana, 40 miles south of the capital, Ankara.
A 4.2-magnitude aftershock followed.
Haymana residents spent the night in parks and their cars, fearing more tremors.
Even more than a week after the quake, counting the dead was proving a difficult task.
An official at the government's crisis center in Ankara, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a mistake had been made while entering data into a computer, resulting in the erroneous report that nearly 18,000 people had died.
Two days of rain have deepened the misery of the estimated 200,000 people left homeless by the quake, many of whom have complained bitterly that the government has been slow in responding to the crisis.
Turkey's leaders defended their actions.
``Of course the people have the right to be nervous, have the right to complain, but this is a natural disaster,'' Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said in an interview with CNN on Tuesday.
Many of the buildings that collapsed like houses of cards in the quake were built with concrete that had been mixed with ordinary sea sand.
Rescuers say they have even seen seashells in the crumbled concrete.
``Mistakes have been made in the past with regard to the unofficial control of constructions...
and we are determined as a government to take the necessary steps,'' said the prime minister, without elaborating.
The Anatolia news agency today quoted one major building contractor as acknowledging he used sea sand in his concrete.
He said he hadn't understood the dangers.
``I don't have a contractor's license --I am not a builder,'' the report quoted contractor Veli Gocer as saying.
He said nearly one-sixth of the 3,000 apartment units he built had collapsed in the quake.
Veli spoke to Anatolia from in hiding, but told the agency he would surrender to police when passions calmed.
Overwhelmed by the crisis, Turkey has appealed for aid, including disinfectants, tetanus vaccines, bungalows, tents, flashlights, blankets, heavy machinery for clearing rubble and garbage trucks.
A Dutch group said it would send 30,000 prefabricated shelters designed to withstand quakes and winter cold.
The United States plans to send 3,500 all-weather tents, reports said.
International efforts to assess the damage were gathering speed, with a European Community delegation arriving today and due to visit the quake zone Thursday.
Tarja Halonen, the foreign minister of Finland, was accompanied by the EU's external relations commissioner, Hans van den Broek.
Finland holds the rotating EU presidency.
Despite rescue efforts like the one today in Cinarcik, the search for survivors was winding down.
But there was a strong reluctance to officially declare that there was no longer hope for pulling anyone from the rubble alive.
Out in hard-hit cities like Golcuk and Izmit, heavy earthmoving equipment was at work at many sites, marking an effective end to the delicate rescue efforts of previous days.
Meanwhile, relief workers were turning their attention to the quake's devastating psychological effects.
A French group said it was beginning counseling for 500 children in quake-damaged Izmit, and Turkey's Psychological Association said it would send 50 therapists to the quake zone.
The association was also distributing leaflets meant to help people mentally cope with the losses they had suffered .
ISTANBUL (Turkey), August 21 (Xinhua) --Blaze in a refinery in western Turkey has been under control after the strong efforts made by foreign rescue experts, a Turkish official said on Saturday.
Turkish private NTV quoted Ismail Alakoc, the chairman of the boarding committee of Turkish Petrol Refineries Company as saying that the strong fire of the Izmit Refinery in Kocaeli province caused by Tuesday's monster earthquake has been under control with the help of foreign countries.
Germany, Azerbaijan, Greece, France, the Netherlands, Kazakistan, Ukraine and Russia have been participating in the fight against the blaze that threatened to engulf the entire field of 30 storage tanks containing 1 million tons of crude oil.
The fire fighting aircraft dropped special chemical foam to control the flames in the Izmit Refinery, about 110 kilometers southeast of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey.
Alakoc added that the fire has burnt 250,000 tons of the crude oil in the Turkey's largest oil refinery.
Turkish experts are expected to make research for the pollution caused by the burning, which has spread to large areas around the Izmit Refinery, he said.
Due to the devastating fire, the Turkish government has made an urgent appeal for delivering crude oil to Turkey.
Many taxi drivers in Istanbul have been lining up for filling LPG as the Izmit Refinery stopped supplying petrol to the city.
ANKARA, August 24 (Xinhua) --The death toll in the monster earthquake in western Turkey on August 17 reached 17,997 on Tuesday as the suffering of the survivors are mounting.
In the face of threats ranging from a typhoid epidemic to lack of shelters under heavy rains, the survivors are seized with depression, especially while seeing bulldozers ripping into the heaps of rubble which have become the graves of their loved ones.
As the estimated 200,000 survivors have turned into refugees, Turkish officials broadcast appeals on Tuesday for everything from tents to bulldozers to help begin rebuilding living shattered by the earthquake.
However, more immediate medical worries began to emerge as the death toll reached some 18,000.
The Prime Ministry Crisis Administration Center stated Tuesday that the regional coordination center established in Izmit, epicenter of the devastating earthquake, will start operations later Tuesday.
Meanwhile, education and entertainment facilities in the affected regions, and in neighboring provinces, were evacuated and prepared for the earthquake victims.
The government has decided to urgently purchase 150 ambulances and all necessary measures have been taken to prevent any kind of failure in telephone lines, especially when Turkey is facing bad weather conditions.
Heavy rains lashed the quake-stricken regions for a second day.
The muddy quagmires left by the downpours increased fears of disease from mosquitoes and flies attracted by the foul-smelling pools.
Thousands of decaying bodies are believed to be still buried under the rubble.
The Turkish military decided to cancel the four-day Victory Day celebrations set to begin on Thursday, marking the Turkish expulsion of other forces in 1922.
Foreign rescue teams started leaving a week after the 7.4 killer quake struck western Turkey.
IZMIT, Turkey _ A strong tremor shook already devastated towns in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday, bringing several buildings crashing down and causing at least one death.
It was the strongest tremor to hit the area since the shattering earthquake of Aug.
17, which killed more than 14,000 people.
Thousands more are still missing and hundreds of thousands are homeless as a result of that quake.
Tuesday's tremor, which shook the Earth back and forth for about 10 seconds, struck shortly after 11 a.m. and was followed by an aftershock about 20 minutes later.
The principal observatory in Istanbul said the first tremor measured 5.2 on the commonly used scale of magnitude and the aftershock measured 4.6.
Seismologists with the U.S.
Geological Survey put the strength slightly higher at 5.4 for Tuesday's initial tremor and 4.7 for the aftershock.
Here in Izmit, where many homeless families are living in tents and railway boxcars, 166 people were admitted to hospitals and clinics after being hit by debris.
A 30-year-old man was killed when masonry fell on him as he was fleeing a building that had been weakened in the Aug.
17 quake.
Seven buildings were reported to have collapsed.
A man broke his leg in the town of Adapazari when he jumped from the third floor of a swaying building.
The local governor sent aides into the streets with loudspeakers to urge residents not to panic.
In Golcuk, a town on the Sea of Marmara that was one of the hardest hit by the Aug.
17 quake, which had a magnitude measured at 7.4, Tuesday's tremor sent people racing away from blocks of already weakened buildings.
Many buildings shook, but none fell.
Tuesday's tremor was also felt in some parts of Istanbul, which is about 65 miles from the apparent epicenter near Izmit.
Dishes rattled in some homes, and desks shook in one of the few schools where the academic year had already begun.
But in Istanbul as in other areas, the main effect was psychological.
``Even if it doesn't do more damage, I don't like it,'' said Yusuf Ozkul, a carpenter in Golcuk who lost his home in the earlier quake and who is now living in a tent beside the Sea of Marmara.
``It makes me nervous, because I've seen what these things can do.
I hate it when the ground shakes, even if it only shakes a little''.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) The tremor struck minutes after J.
Brady Anderson, administrator of the U.S.
Agency for International Development, left Golcuk after a tour of the devastated area.
He chatted with several survivors living in tents.
They expressed gratitude for the American relief aid and said their greatest need now was housing.
The weather in this part of Turkey usually turns cold around mid-October.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has announced that she will visit Turkey on Sunday.
She will be in the region on a tour of Middle Eastern capitals and added Turkey to her itinerary at the last moment.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) Prosecutors in the town of Duzce, on the eastern edge of the devastated area, issued warrants for the arrest of 33 contractors, engineers and building owners.
They were charged with using low-quality concrete, weak reinforcing rods and shoddy construction techniques that led to the fatal collapses of their buildings in the Aug.
17 quake.
``I've been a construction engineer for 30 years, and I've never seen reinforcing rods that are completely smooth like the ones I saw here,'' said Fred Stolaski, a relief worker from Florida.
``I didn't even know they still made them''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) One Turkish contractor who is being sought by police, Veli Gucer, gave a telephone interview to the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag.
Gucer, who spoke from an undisclosed location, built a large apartment complex in the seaside town of Yalova in which several hundred people are believed to have perished.
``There's no reason for me to have a guilty conscience,'' he was quoted as saying.
``Naturally I sympathize with the victims and their families, but I don't understand why I'm being made a scapegoat.
I began building the Bahcekent complex in Yalova about six years ago.
Naturally I didn't know much about the business.
I studied literature in school.
I'm a poet, not a structural engineer.
``I remember visiting my first construction site.
I saw workers using beach sand to make concrete.
When I asked about it, the architect told me it was completely normal.
Only later did I learn that this is a completely wrong and dangerous technique.
So I gave the order to stop doing such a disgusting thing.
Unfortunately, half the complex was already finished by then.''
ANKARA, August 22 (Xinhua) --Another strong earthquake with a magnitude of 5.0 struck western Turkey on Sunday, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
The agency quoted officials of Bogazici University Kandilli Observatory as saying that the quake, which happened in Sakarya (Adapazari), was confimed as an aftershock following the devastating earthquake measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale on August 17.
The aftershock occurred at 17:30 local time (14:30 GMT), but no serious damage or injuries from the jolt have been reported.
The epicenter of the aftershock was about 130 kilometers about east of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, Over 60 aftershocks measuring at least 4.0 on the Richter scale have occurred since the quake hit western Turkey in the early hours of August 17.
The massive quake has killed over 12,000 people and injured over 33,000 others in the region since then.
IZMIT, Turkey (AP) --It has been a year since Ayse Karatas grabbed her 3-year-old granddaughter, wrenched open a window and jumped out of her apartment building to escape a shattering earthquake.
Since surviving the quake, Karatas and her family have been living in a tent donated by the U.S. government and using a nearby garden hose to fill jugs with water for drinking and washing.
They are not alone.
Some 26,000 survivors of the Aug.
17, 1999, quake that devastated Turkey's industrial heartland are living in tent cities.
An additional 150,000 people live in cramped prefabricated homes that are oppressively hot in summer and bitterly cold in winter.
''We have nothing,'' said Karatas, as she sat outside her green tent sucking on an ice cube in the stifling heat.
''The state doesn't care about us''.
It's a bitterness that was widely felt after the 7.4-magnitude earthquake destroyed poorly built apartment houses, crushing some 17,000 people as they slept.
The quake virtually leveled parts of Izmit, 60 miles east of Istanbul, and other towns in western Turkey.
But anger is fading toward a government that at first appeared ineffective and slow to react.
People no longer question whether the state is still there to help them.
Criticism of rescue efforts led by the military, the most respected Turkish institution, is dissipating and the Turkish press rarely mentions the thousands of people like Karatas, the wife of a retired baker, who are too poor to find their own homes.
''It's sad, but it seems that they are an afterthought,'' said Alan Makovsky, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Initially, the Turkish response to the disaster was so disorganized that foreign rescue teams had to ask civilians for advice on where to go.
But Turks feel their government has handled the post-quake cleanup well.
The number of people in tent cities has fallen from some 120,000 after the quake to 26,000 today and the government expects that number to decline sharply in the coming months.
The cash-strapped state gives some 56,000 families $155 a month in rent subsidies and has provided free meals to some 195,000 survivors for most of the past year.
When a second, much smaller quake struck in November, the government and the military reacted quickly.
Relief teams were dispatched and, although almost 1,000 people died in that quake, the rescue efforts appeared to be well coordinated.
''It seemed to be a statement that the government has learned its lesson,'' Makovsky said.
''I think that the government has recouped its honor''.
The government also received a boost when the European Union in December agreed to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership, bringing the country one step closer to its long cherished goal of integration with the West.
The government has taken extensive measures to prepare for a new quake, which seismologists warn could happen at any time.
In Izmit, the hard-hit town where Karatas lives, mobile rescue teams are prepared for deployment within four hours of a disaster.
A quake coordination headquarters has been built in a field, far from any tall buildings.
Government officials have walkie-talkies in their offices so that they can be reached if phone lines are cut.
For new buildings, inspections and insurance will be required, officials said.
''We are ready,'' says Muhammet Uygun, deputy disaster area coordinator.
But that news is of little help to Karatas.
Although the state gives rent credits to people whose apartments were destroyed, Karatas had no lease and was unable to prove that she had been renting an apartment in the quake zone.
Although her husband receives a pension of $155 a month, rents have skyrocketed since the earthquake, which damaged more than 100,000 homes in her home province of Kocaeli alone.
A small apartment would cost the family's entire monthly income.
''The state doesn't care about us,'' Karatas said as her eyes turned red and swelled with tears.
''They would rather we die''.
It's an anger that newly confident officials dismiss with disdain.
''Our citizens are a bit ungrateful,'' Uygun said.
''They always want something else no matter what you give them.''
ISTANBUL, August 22 (Xinhua) --Some 12,040 people have so far been confirmed dead in Tuesday's killer earthquake in northwest Turkey and 33,495 others were reported as injured, the Government Crisis Center of Turkey announced Sunday morning.
According to the latest statistics, Kocaeli (Izmit) province posted the highest casualty as 5,179 bodies had been discovered and 14,718 people were injured.
Sakarya (Adapazri) province, which used to be a district of Izmit, ranked second with 3,046 deaths, followed by Yalova with 2,400, Istanbul with 984, Bolu with 248, Bursa with 122, Eskisehir with 58 and Zongulbak with three, the center said.
Preliminary estimates have put direct economic loss of the quake at between 20 and 40 billion U.S. dollars, though no concrete figures could be concluded as rescue works were still going on.
The massive quake, with a magnitude of 7.4 degrees on the Richter scale, rocked heavily-populated northwest Turkish provinces near the Marmara Sea at 3:02 a.m.
(0002 GMT) Tuesday.
Since then, there have been 1,300 aftershocks in the region, dozens of which registered at four degrees or above.
WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) --The United States offered help to Turkey on Tuesday after a severe earthquake there killed hundreds of people.
President Bill Clinton said Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen.
Henry Shelton was in Ankara for military meetings, and he offered military support for recovery efforts.
"We will continue to determine what further help is needed," he said.
White House National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said Shelton, who was in Turkey when the earthquake took place last night, had offered helicopters, tents and blankets from U.S. bases there.
Assistant Secretary of State for Europe Marc Grossman said a 70-member search-and-rescue team was expected to leave for the worst-hit city, Izmit, southeast of Istanbul.
Another team of eight disaster experts was being sent to Istanbul to help the Turkish authorities coordinate rescue work, Grossman said.
The United States has military facilities in several parts of Turkey, including at the air base in Incirlik in the east of the country used for U.S. warplanes patrolling over the imposed no-fly zone in northern Iraq.
ISTANBUL, August 25 (Xinhua) --More than a week after the August 17 killer earthquake in northwestern Turkey, people with quake-related injuries were still flooding to hospitals.
In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city which straddles Europe and Asia, alone, the number of people suffering from quake-related diseases surpassed 4,100.
Quake survivors with injured heads, broken arms and legs overflew the 120 private and 38 state hospitals in the metropolis.
Nearly half of the patients in Istanbul's hospitals are suffering from bone fractures.
Some of them were sent here by ambulances or helicopters from other quake-hit areas where public hospitals were demolished and the makeshift field hospitals, set up by medical staff from internal or foreign countries, did not have necessary facilities to deal with some serious injuries.
In a number of state hospitals, the personnel had to go without sleep for 40 hours or more.
Thousands of people were treated for minor injuries and then discharged.
Some of the survivors, who had been buried under rubble for days and were rescued recently, had developed kidney problems due to lack of water.
Medical conditions were tougher in other quake-stricken areas.
In Adapazari, about 130 kilometers east of Istanbul, several field hospitals were operating along with a public hospital which was half-ruined in the quake but returned to partial functioning lately.
In a field hospital by a busy intersection, a woman doctor said she and her colleges, all volunteer medical personnel from surrounding areas like Istanbul, Izmit, Bolu or Yalova, were working here in clinic tents in groups of three persons.
They would be working for three-four days non-stop before being replaced.
Due to limitations of medical facilities, some patients were transferred to the nearby Israeli military field hospital which was better equipped.
Those patients who were beyond the treatment were sent to Istanbul or the Turkish capital of Ankara.
Another doctor said he and his two colleges in a tent had received over 70 patients since eight o'clock in the morning through afternoon.
ISTANBUL, August 21 (Xinhua) --Turkish monster earthquake measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale has caused about 20 billion U.S. dollars in economic loss, accounting for half of the country's budget in 1999, Turkish experts has said here.
Local private NTV Saturday quoted the experts as saying that the economic loss caused by the killer earthquake also accounts for half of Turkey's domestic debt of 40 billion dollars.
According to the latest figures, at least 10,059 people have been killed, 45,000 others injured in the quake which was one of the largest in this century in Turkey.
Over 10,000 people are estimated to be still trapped in the ruins of the destroyed buildings and houses in the stricken provinces of Istanbul, Kocaeli (Izmit), Sakarya (Adapazari), Yalova, Bursa, Bolu, Eskisehir, Zonguldak, and Tekirdag.
The experts said that the fire in the Izmit Refinery of the Turkish Petrol Company, about 110 kilometers southeast of Istanbul, has cost at least 5 billion dollars.
The fire, caused by Tuesday's earthquake, has been taken under control with the help of foreign rescue experts.
The tremor also caused a loss of 15 billion dollars in the industrial production and bases in the stricken regions, and for trade economy, said the experts.
The Turkish government has made an urgent call for providing aid for the quake-hit areas.
A lot of Turkish citizens both at home and abroad are active in donating money and materials for the victims.
Figures available Saturday on the earthquake that struck Turkey early Tuesday.
*DEAD: At least 12,018 *MISSING: Estimates range up to 35,000 *INJURED: 33,515 currently under medical treatment; thousands of others have been treated and released from medical facilities *WORST AREAS AFFECTED: Izmit 4,179 dead, 10,759 injured Adapazari 3,046 dead, 6,884 injured Yalova 2,400 dead, 5,559 injured Istanbul 984 dead, 2,924 injured Golcuk 1,000 dead, 3,959 injured Bolu 226 dead, 1,159 injured Bursa 122 dead, 1,866 injured Eskisehir 58 dead, 344 injured Zonguldak 3 dead, 26 injured Tekirdag 35 injured *DESTRUCTION: More than 100,000 homes and other buildings destroyed across a 400-mile stretch from far northwestern Turkey to areas near Ankara.
*RESCUE OPERATION: 50,000 Turkish soldiers and more than 2,000 foreign rescue workers.
*INFRASTRUCTURE: The quake damaged bridges, highways, power stations, telephone lines, and triggered a fire at Turkey's largest oil refinery.
Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said the fault line that ruptured in Turkey Tuesday, producing a devastating earthquake, had been identified more than two years ago as a particularly dangerous one.
A team of MIT scientists has been studying the region for a decade, but said new equipment now being installed to monitor the fault's motion, which might have provided enough warning to save some of the estimated 2,000 people who died, was not yet in place.
The quake's center near the town of Izmit was on a stretch of the North Anatolian fault where the MIT team, working with scientists from Turkish universities and the nation's science foundation, ``marked it two years ago as an area to be watched closely,'' said M.
Nafi Toksoz, a Turkish-born MIT professor of geophysics and seismology who has been studying earthquakes in Turkey since 1971.
``I have walked just about every foot of that fault zone,'' he said.
So far, in addition to the thousands killed and injured, the quake did extensive damage to residential and industrial buildings in Izmit and nearby towns in a major industrial center, and left more than 100,000 homeless.
The damage is expected to run to billions of dollars.
For the last decade, the MIT-Turkish team has been monitoring the motion of the ground along both sides of the fault line using one of the world's most advanced networks of GPS (Global Positioning System) satellite receivers, which can pinpoint locations to within one-tenth of an inch.
It was readings from these instruments that showed that ``this was the region where most of the stresses were accumulating,'' Toksoz said.
But these GPS readings have only been taken once a year; a new system, using GPS receivers that continuously send position information, is being installed to replace the decade-old stations.
But only one station is operational.
If a network of the new monitors had been in place, Toksoz said, ``we might have been able to predict the quake and provide some warning''.
That warning might have been anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours before the shaking began, he said, providing enough time for people to leave vulnerable buildings, and perhaps even to store water and supplies.
A real-time warning based on GPS data has never been issued, Toksoz said.
But the only similar networks of monitoring stations in the world, one in Japan and one in southern California, have shown distinct signs of some impending earthquakes when scientists have looked back at the records after a quake occurred.
``People have detected precursor motions,'' Toksoz said, ``but not in real time''.
With the added impetus of this quake, he said, ``we'll push on with it''.
He said earthquakes have been gradually migrating westward along the North Anatolian fault, as stress builds up in the rock and is then released.
The largest earthquake ever recorded on the fault was a magnitude 8.2 quake in 1939, which killed 20,000 people, and there have been six other quakes greater than magnitude 7 since then, each spanning a 60- to 100-mile segment of the fault.
Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, with a population of 12 million, lies just 65 miles west of Izmit, and may be the next place to feel the fault's wrath.
The fault line, which closely resembles California's San Andreas fault, passes just a few miles from the city.
Geologists call both faults right-handed strike-slip faults.
The Izmit earthquake may actually have increased the stresses on the Istanbul segment of the fault, increasing the odds of a major quake there in coming years.
``We're very much concerned about what might happen in that area,'' Toksoz said.
``There is the potential for a major earthquake''.
There is an earthquake building code in place in the city, he said, ``but unfortunately, implementation is lax''.
As a result, he said, a major quake striking the city ``could be an economic disaster as well as a human disaster''.
Even this week's quake, though centered 65 miles away, did some property damage and caused a few deaths in Istanbul.
``But with warning, we could at least prevent some of the human casualties''.
This quake's magnitude, still being worked out by scientists in Turkey, the United States and other countries, has been identified as magnitude 7.5 by the MIT scientists, 6.8 by Turkish scientists, and 7.8 by the US Geological Survey.
Bill Smith, a geophysicist at the US Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in Colorado, explained that such numbers are ``still subject to change.
Some of these magnitude calculations are very labor intensive.
.. . Magnitude is not a precise measurement, it's really an art''.
Smith said scientists use six to eight different magnitude numbers, computed using the various waves produced by a quake.
But, he said, ``In most cases, the numbers agree better than on this one''.
It is not yet clear what this unusual disparity might mean, he said.
Toksoz added that readings based on measurements farther from the site usually give a more accurate representation, because instruments close to the quake can be ``saturated'' by the intensity of the shaking and get a lower reading.
Hundreds of aftershocks have been recorded since the main quake, which occurred at about 3 a.m. local time.
The largest of the aftershocks was magnitude 5.3, just over three hours later, but activity is continuing and will be closely monitored.
The quake was the largest recorded in Turkey since 1976 .
IZMIT, Turkey _ Nuri Tekin shuffled to the back entrance of the city's prized indoor skating rink, looking for his nephew.
Inside, people in green surgical masks walked gingerly, using flashlights to cut the misty darkness, up and down rows of horizontal, covered shapes on the ice.
Numbly handing over Recet Tekin's identity card to a woman at a desk by the entranceway, he was told he now could take with him Number 415 _ just a blanketed bundle on watery, puddly ice _ the body of his 15-year-old nephew.
``We have identified almost all of them,'' said Suna, the city employee behind the desk, a surgical mask around her neck and a look of exhaustion in her eyes as she tried to put yellow slips of paper on all the bodies being brought to this just-completed rink.
Over the clacking of a generator laboring to keep the ice solid in sweltering heat, Tekin tried to connect the inert figure _ one of more than 500 bodies inside the rink, one of more than 7,000 people who perished in Turkey's deadliest quake in six decades _ with the boy he had loved.
``He died when our building collapsed,'' Tekin managed to say, ``now we have come to bury him''.
Words seem insufficient to describe the changed state of this seaside city, near the epicenter of Tuesday's quake.
Behind Tekin, dozens of still-dazed people stood at the edge of the rink's parking lot, many crying.
``No, I don't want to go in''! shouted an elderly man, being dragged inside by his wife and other relatives.
``Our grandson, we are looking for him,'' sobbed his wife as she tugged at her husband's arm.
Nearly 72 hours after an earthquake leveled thousands of buildings in an arc stretching from the outskirts of Istanbul through the industrial heartland of Izmit, the search for survivors is turning into a collection of the dead.
With official morgues long filled, any place that offers temperatures cold enough to stop bodies from decaying are being pressed into service.
But with the fear of disease rising, not even the makeshift morgues or the cemeteries working overtime can cover the number of bodies being dug out of the rubble.
In scores of devastated areas, the odor of rotting flesh is wafting through the wreckage.
And in one town east of Izmit, Sakarya, authorities have buried 1,000 bodies in a mass grave.
Throughout Izmit and many communities in northwestern Turkey, neighborhoods were leveled, electric wires are down, water lines have been cut, roads cracked and bridges collapsed.
The country's stock market has been shut since the quake, parliament was recessed and phone lines in areas hit hard are only partly being restored.
To protect against explosions, natural gas lines running through heavily damaged areas have been turned off.
Towns around Izmit's state-owned oil refinery Tupras were evacuated because of the fires that broke out in the oil storage tanks after the earthquake.
Low-flying planes Thursday dropped special chemicals on the tanks, which spewed out flames into a sky so black with smoke that at midday the sun was blocked in this area just outside Izmit city.
But officials said the fires were coming under control, with a diminishing risk of flames igniting tanks holding liquefied petroleum gas, which would send poisonous chemicals into the air.
A few miles away from blazing refinery, rescue workers and volunteers continued their frantic search for the living and their resigned digging for the dead.
``After 36 hours the chances of someone surviving in the rubble drops by 50 percent and after five days it's more a miracle than anything else if someone can be brought out alive,'' said Ellinor Von Kauffungen, from the Swiss Disaster Relief organization.
She was part of a team of some 10 orange-suited Swiss rescue workers desperately trying to reach two young men buried, but still alive, under about 20 feet of rubble of what once was a five-story apartment building.
A long hose was dropped into a hole to try and bring water to the young men, whose weak cries were monitored by rescue workers pressing their ears against the heavy sheets of concrete that blocked their access to the men.
``My nephew's son Recep was going to go the next day back to the army and there was a party for him that night when the earthquake hit,'' said Bayram Bayraktar, standing anxiously at the edge of the collapsed building.
``For two days we dug with our own hands to try and reach people, and we managed to get some 15 people out, but we could not get to Recep and his friend _ all I could tell them was to stay calm and maybe help would come,'' said Bayraktar, who lost eight relatives in the quake.
But despite the hope of life for Bayraktar's nephew and his friend, many people in Izmit city and the province, where some 1.4 million people live, were looking for the dead.
The sign was often a bulldozer pushing through the rubble, which meant it no longer mattered if concrete blocks shifted wildly because nobody was left alive.
Thursday night, Turkish officials, worried about the chance of dangerous aftershocks, ordered millions of people still in their buildings to sleep outside.
In Istanbul, where some 1,000 people died in the quake, tens of thousands of terrified residents streamed into parks to spend the night.
ANKARA, August 22 (Xinhua) --Blaze in a refinery in western Turkey has been put out thanks to the strong efforts made by foreign rescue experts, a Turkish official said on Sunday.
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency quoted Ismail Alakoc, the chairman of the boarding committee of Turkish Petrol Refineries Company as saying that the strong fire of the Izmit Refinery in Kocaeli province caused by Tuesday's devastating earthquake has been put out with the help of foreign countries.
Kocaeli is the most seriously devastated province after the monster quake hit the western Turkey.
However, he said the strong fire had destroyed seven storage tanks and damaged two other ones in the refinery which held 30 storage tanks containing 1 million tons of crude oil.
He said the blaze in the refinery was brought under control on Friday and only one storage tank was burning at that time, adding that one chimney in the refinery had collapsed.
Germany, Azerbaijan, Greece, France, the Netherlands, Kazakistan, Ukraine and Russia participated in the fight against the blaze that threatened to engulf the entire field of the 30 storage tanks.
Turkish experts are expected to make research about the pollution caused by the burning, which has spread to large areas around the Izmit Refinery.
ISTANBUL, Turkey _ At least seven people died Monday and hundreds were injured when a severe tremor shook Turkey in the same region where more than 15,000 people were killed in a huge earthquake less than a month ago.
The tremor, which came in mid-afternoon, was felt in Turkey's three biggest cities _ Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir _ which are separated by hundreds of miles.
An Istanbul observatory reported that the quake registered 5.8 on the Richter scale (last month's quake registered 7.4).
It caused dozens of buildings to collapse and sent thousands of people racing from their homes.
At least 239 were injured, many suffering broken bones after jumping from their windows.
``These aftershocks have created panic,'' said President Suleyman Demirel.
``I am worried that people who were already nervous are now panicking''.
Turkish television stations showed ambulances racing through the streets of Izmit and Adapazari, towns near the reported epicenter of the tremor.
Other scenes showed people running through the streets of Golcuk.
Buildings were reported to have collapsed in all three cities, which were devastated by the Aug.
17 quake.
Hundreds of people gathered in streets and in parks, unwilling to return to their homes.
Monday was the first day of the school year for most Turkish children, and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit ordered schools in the affected areas closed until further notice.
Some parents said they would keep children at home indefinitely.
Ecevit also sent a team of government officials to survey the damage by helicopter.
Many Turks had criticized him for not responding quickly when the big quake struck last month.
Traders at the Istanbul stock exchange also felt the tremor.
Stock prices quickly began to fall, and after the index had dropped more than 2 percent, trading was suspended.
Domestic and international telephone service was disrupted in much of the region, making an accurate assessment of damage difficult.
Three of those killed Monday were driving a car through Golcuk when a building fell onto their vehicle.
Three others were crushed by debris near Izmit, and a woman died of a heart attack as she rushed from her home in Adapazari.
The willingness of people to run and jump from buildings at the first sign of a tremor reflected the new sense of vulnerability that many Turks feel.
There have been hundreds of aftershocks since the Aug.
17 earthquake, and seismologists say some can be classified as quakes in their own right.
Seismologists have warned that aftershocks and tremors may shake Turkey for months and possibly years.
Most say there is little chance of another major disaster anytime soon, but many Turks, especially those in the devastated areas, have seen the damage a quake can do and are evidently unwilling to take chances.
``These aftershocks may continue, and I hope they will not be as violent as the one today,'' Ecevit said.
``We will have to learn to live with them''.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Thousands of people remain homeless after surviving the Aug.
17 quake, which shook the country's industrial heartland and has riveted the attention of the nation.
A new report by the country's largest business federation describes that quake as ``the biggest one of the 20th century affecting a large, populated industrialized area''.
It said the economic cost may exceed $15 billion.
``The increased uncertainty will negatively affect all economic activity in Turkey,'' the report said.
``The damage necessitates the influx of vast sums of funds to restore normal life in the region''.
Last week a quake struck neighboring Greece, killing more than 100 people.
These seismic movements have given Greeks and Turks a sense of shared destiny that is having important political implications as the countries' governments move closer together.
Seismic movements in Turkey over recent weeks, and the government's widely perceived failure to respond to them, continue to shake the political landscape here.
``Leaders of the state should come here and see what it's like,'' one women in the zone that was shaken Monday told a television interviewer.
``No one can live here any more.''
ANKARA, August 17 (Xinhua) --Some 27 aftershocks have jolted western Turkey in the past several hours after a strong earthquake rocked the area early in the day, Turkish news reports said mid Tuesday.
The most powerful one of the aftershocks, with a magnitude of five degrees, occurred at 12:02 local time (0902 GMT).
Another three aftershocks were measured at over four degrees on the Richter scale, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
At least 600 people have been confirmed dead and thousands of others injured in the 6.7-degree earthquake which ripped through western Turkey at 3:00 am (0000 GMT).
The epicenter is located at about 70 kilometers southeast of Istanbul, near the industrial city of Izmit in north-western Turkey.
The number of casualties may still increase as the rescue workers are continuing sifting through piles of rubble of the collapsed buildings in the tremor-hit cities in search for survivors and the bodies of the dead.
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and Interior Minister Saadettin Tantan have arrived at the sites to inspect the situation.
Heavily crowded Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey, is the hardest hit one in the jolt and 107 bodies have been recovered in the debris and the injury toll have been put at onking Adapazari and the center of Izmit was destroyed and an area near Istanbul Ataturk Airport was seriously hit by the earthquake.
Traffic jams and accidents have rocketed along the highways near the quake-stricken area as people are driving cars to flee the area.
Israel and Germany have announced to dispatch aid groups to the quake-stricken areas, Turkish media reports said.
Israel has announced to send a 120-staff rescue group of medical workers and German and injuring over 1,500 in and around the southern city of Adana.
ANKARA, August 20 (Xinhua) --The death toll from the powerful earthquake in Turkey has risen to 7,085, with 33,559 injured, the government crisis center said early Friday, two days after the quake hit the northwestern part of the country.
In Izmit region, where the epicenter situated, 3,261 people were killed and 11,759 injured.
The earthquake, measuring 7.4 on the open-ended Richter scale, hit Turkey at 3:02 a.m.
(0002 GMT) on Tuesday and lasted some 45 seconds when people were sleeping in bed.
ANKARA, August 17 (Xinhua) --Some 26,000 survivors of the August 17, 1999 earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents one year after the quake.
Turkey's Daily News reported on Thursday that an additional 150, 000 people live in cramped prefabricated homes that are extremely hot in summer and bitterly cold in winter.
Some victims who survived the disaster complained about their grievance, saying that "the state doesn't care about us".
It is a bitterness that was widely felt after the 7.4-magnitude earthquake destroyed jerry-built apartment buildings, crushing some 17,000 people as they slept.
The quake almost leveled parts of Izmit, 60 miles east of Istanbul, as well as other towns in western Turkey.
The government has done a lot to handle the post-quake cleanup, and the number of people in tents has fallen from some 120,000 immediately after the quake to 26,000 at present.
The government expects that number to decline sharply in the coming months.
It also has taken extensive measures to prepare for a new quake, which seismologists warn could take place at any time.
ANKARA, August 31 (Xinhua) --A 5.2-magnitude earthquake, followed by another one of magnitude 4.6, rocked western Turkey Tuesday, but the casualties from the quake are not immediately known.
The Bogazici Kandilli Observatory reported that the quake hit Izmit, about 110 kilometers west of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, at 11:11 local time (0811 GMT), driving people into a panic, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
Izmit, also called Kocaeli province, was the epicenter of the 7.4-magnitude killer quake that hit western Turkey on August 17, killing over 14,000 people and injuring over 27,000 others.
IZMIT, Turkey _ From the streets to government offices, earthquake relief workers and international agencies Friday pleaded with Turkey to turn its attention from the more than 10,000 dead and 35,000 missing from Tuesday's disaster to the hundreds of thousands of survivors left homeless, many at risk of disease.
``They are overwhelmed and now they are completely concerned with the total number of dead,'' said Richard Van Hazebrouck, a UN humanitarian aid coordinator.
``They are not thinking of the next step, but we are putting pressure to get some figures of what the Turkish authorities need for the survivors,'' he said.
Cargo planes from all over the world have brought in medical supplies, blankets, plastic sheeting and even field hospitals to help the living after Tuesday's 7.4 magnitude quake, which authorities say could be the world's deadliest in nearly a decade.
But international relief workers are worried that this is not enough to care for the hundreds of thousands of people who will never be able to go home.
``We don't need any more rescue teams on site.
Now we must move into the second stage, which is looking after the survivors,'' said Hazebrouck.
With water pipes broken and electric lines down over a huge swath of Turkey's northeast, relief workers are also concerned about the possible spread of disease, especially with the thousands of corpses rotting under the rubble.
An epidemiologist from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta flew into Turkey Friday to help assess health needs, along with two US water sanitation experts.
``You want to be sure, especially with this sweltering weather, that you're not looking at an outbreak of contagious diseases,'' said Hugh Parmer, assistant administrator of the US Agency for International Development's humanitarian relief department.
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, dressed in black, echoed Parmer's concern.
``Perhaps the greatest problem now facing us is that of epidemic,'' Ecevit told reporters in Ankara.
Foreign engineers and architects are expected to arrive in Turkey over the next few days to help officials decide which buildings must be knocked down because of heavy damage and which can remain standing.
Many still-standing buildings in the hard-hit Izmit and Yalova areas are clearly unsafe, lurching down at one end or leaning dangerously out into the street.
Five aftershocks, ranging between 4.3 and 4.6 on the Richter scale, rocked the disaster zone Friday.
For now, many people are living out in the open, along the side of roads and in parks in the city center.
Families string up sheets and blankets for privacy, the few possessions they managed to save carefully arranged in the only place they can now call home.
``People must understand that there is an urgent need for portable toilets, cleaning materials, garbage collection - the local authorities are not able to cope with the scale of these things,'' said Karen Lever, an International Red Cross logistical worker in the makeshift tent hospital located in Yalova's football stadium.
She spoke outside a tent in which staffers were preparing for an expected upsurge of infectious diseases.
``The water will be a problem _ clean water.
And sewage and disposing of bodies with all these people outside in (95-degree) heat''.
Her voice trailed off.
But for many of those who did manage to get out alive after the 45-second quake that destroyed so much, the only issue was whether more people could be pulled from the wreckage.
For four days, large swaths of Izmit were forbidden to rescue workers while firefighters battled a blaze at the nation's biggest petroleum refinery.
The ruins of the shattered houses there now conceal an unknown number of dead, and, perhaps, injured.
Foreign search and rescue teams managed to find at least three people Friday, raising hopes that others may have survived underneath the collapsed buildings, despite the heat and the lack of water.
A 70-member American team that arrived on Wednesday in Izmit has been scouring the crumbled building remains one by one, with German Shepherds trained to sniff any smell of life.
Saturday another team of about 90 people will arrive.
But on the wreckage of what was once a six-story apartment building, the yellow-helmeted rescue workers could do little for the relatives of a young woman and her father, whose weak shouts had been heard until about mid afternoon.
``Make a sound, any sound''! shouted the aid team's Turkish translator, kneeling over a small hole between two huge slabs of concrete.
``With whatever strength you still have scream, please scream, scream''! she cried, while a sensitive microphone was dangled into the hole.
Within a few minutes one of the rescue workers turned toward the dozens of anxious Turks who were waiting across the street.
``This machine will pick up anything, heartbeats, breathing, and there's no real indication that there's anything down there _ we're not going to stay here,'' Daniel Bickham announced to the crowd.
But the pleas of a young Turkish soldier _ who had heard some sounds just a few hours earlier _ convinced the team to give it one more try.
Two hours later, the rescue workers finally walked away, leaving behind the anguished cries of onlookers and what rescue workers were certain were two corpses buried in the rubble.
It was the same scene on Yalova's Stadium Street, now devoid of the apartment buildings where hundreds of families had lived before 3:04 a.m.
Tuesday. For 10 minues, French rescue workers and Turkish volunteers stopped working to huddle together in total silence, straining to hear anything from their delicate microphones.
After a few minutes, they stood back from the rubble, their heads shaking.
On one street in Izmit, not even the rumble of bulldozers ripping through concrete and crushed furniture could convince 26-year-old Ilkay Yildiz that his 20-year-old fiance with the long brown hair and quick smile was dead.
Every day since the quake he has been waiting at the edge of the rubble for Hacer Subasi to appear.
Even after the foreign rescue team left a day earlier _ convinced that there was nobody left to save _ and the bulldozer started digging for corpses, Yildiz refuses to move.
``She is the most beautiful, wonderful girl in the world and she cannot be dead,'' he murmured, falling to the ground and beginning to cry.

ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) --The earthquake that struck western Turkey earlier this week was made up of two consecutive quakes, a leading geologist said Sunday.
Prof. Aykut Barka of Istanbul Technical University said the tremors were 20 seconds apart, and their epicenter was near the northwestern town of Izmit, 90 miles east of Istanbul.
Together, the two quakes lasted about 45 seconds at 3 a.m.
Tuesday, Barka told the private NTV television station.
The death toll in the 7.4-magnitude quake has surpassed 12,000 and some officials have predicted as many as 40,000 could have died.
Several U.S. and European seismologists have arrived in Turkey to study the quake.
Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist with the U.S Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
, said it is common for large earthquakes to occur in multiple surges in rapid succession.
``Almost every earthquake bigger than a 6-point magnitude is a multiple event,'' he said.
``It's almost impossible to break a chunk of rock that long in one instance''.
Only in the last 20 years has technology allowed scientists to detect multiple events in a major quake, he said.
IZMIT, Turkey (AP) --The car-repair shop where Cihan Cakiroglu worked is twisted wreckage, his boss is dead, and the August paycheck thatis now homeless family needs will never come.
At the nearby Goodyear tire plant, the blue steel walls still stand, but most of the employees are too busy searching for relatives or shelter for their families to show up for work.
Turks nationwide are struggling to recover from the massive, 7.4-magnitude earthquake that struck the country's industrial heartland early Tuesday.
The social and economic costs appear to be staggering.
Thousands of homeless people like Cakiroglu are demanding that the government help them buy new homes and furniture and find them new jobs.
Experts say each day remaining factories like the Goodyear plant remain idle leads to a loss of $300 million.
The government, already struggling to cut back a federal budget deficit, is strapped for the cash needed to repair basic infrastructure, including roads, bridges and electrical lines.
And the area hit provides almost half the tax revenue, meaning the government will have even less income to count on.
The cost to the economy could top $20 billion --10 percent of the country's gross national product and enough to drag the country back into recession, experts say.
Government spokesman Sukru Sina Gurel said the economic damage to the country could ``be beyond what any tragic event in the history of Turkey has caused''.
Bulent Akgerman, head of the Aegean Young Businessmen Association, has suggested a six-day work week to overcome the impact of the quake.
Other industrialists are demanding aid from the international community, which has already provided $500 million in loans and grants.
``Hopefully, we will be able to deal with it smoothly if we receive support from international organizations,'' said Tevfik Aksoy, chief economist of Istanbul's Bank Ekspres.
``I seriously doubt that Turkey will be left alone on this one''.
He also pointed out that the crucial cement, automobile and tire factories that make western Turkey so important to the economy have been left largely undamaged.
They are expected to reopen soon, which will no doubt help ease the strain of the earthquake damage.
The Goodyear plant in Izmit, for example, was built with steel walls and survived the earthquake, unlike many local homes and buildings made of cheap cement, said engineering manager Mehmet Turkel.
Some equipment was damaged, he said, but the plant should be able to reopen quickly, and its 500 employees should return to work.
``If you come here in a week, you'll see this plant running,'' he said.
``People want it to happen''.
But the plant will wait a few days more for the search for survivors and possessions to end.
Five of the plant's workers are believed to have been killed in the quake, and almost half have lost their homes.
Personnel manager Harun Savas said the plant is offering tea and sandwiches to workers who come in to help assess damage.
``We have to start a new life,'' said Savas, who pulled the bodies of five of his relatives from the wreckage of their homes and later helped bury them.
His house survived the earthquake, but his 12-year-old son, Cagdas, was too frightened to stay in Izmit and has gone with Savas' wife and daughter to live with relatives on the Black Sea coast.
``I think the major problem will be how to get people back to work,'' said Haluk Tukel, the secretary-general of TUSIAD, the country's leading organization of industrialists.
But for many people, there is no longer any work to speak of.
In a grassy lot in front of a 50-foot pile of rubble, Cakiroglu stood beside his new home --a brown blanket held up by a few sticks of wood.
It is here that he sleeps with his wife and 3-year-old daughter.
``I'm willing to do anything, even sell pretzels on the street,'' Cakiroglu said.
IZMIT, Turkey _ On a stretch of grassy promenade in front of the Sea of Marmara, the Meckeli family has built a living room of sorts, with an overstuffed couch, matching chairs and a small coffee table holding warm cans of soda.
Their real apartment was made unlivable by the earthquake that devastated a huge part of Turkey's industrialized region.
And now, like so many others living out in the open air, the Meckelis are trying to hold on to a semblance of their old life while they wait for the government to help them build a new one.
``The important thing is that we made it out alive, but sooner or later somebody has to tell us what's going to happen to us, how long will we be out here, will we ever get any money for our losses''? said Ismail Meckeli, a married factory worker with two sons.
Almost two weeks after the earthquake, which killed more than 13,000 people and left at least 200,000 homeless, officials are struggling to come up with a plan to provide housing for quake survivors who often lost everything.
Japan and the Netherlands have promised prefabricated housing to ensure that the homeless get out of tent camps by the start of winter.
Other countries have donated money and supplies to help people get through the next few months.
This is a temporary measure, until the government organizes a program for rebuilding the 10,000 buildings _ 60,000 apartments _ that collapsed or that were seriously damaged in the 45-second earthquake that hit Turkey's most industrialized region.
A state minister and government spokesman, Sukru Sina Gurel, said last week that Turkey planned to provide free housing to those who had lost their homes, but added that it would be more than a year before everyone was permanently rehoused.
``I think we also have to consider establishing some new residential areas, because some places were perhaps built on areas that are too prone to serious earthquake damage,'' he said.
Engineering experts warn that before construction starts, Turkey must put together stronger rules to ensure that buildings can withstand quakes in this temblor-prone region.
Many engineers say that lax building codes, and unscrupulous contractors and politicians, contributed to the disaster by allowing substandard buildings on fault lines.
``We've learned a lesson from this earthquake about how things should be built, and now the issue is that we want to ensure that standards are met and that the government institutes necessary laws for this,'' said Murat Celik, chairman of the Modern Lawyer's Association.
The association is one of several groups trying to sue the government _ from Turkey's president to Istanbul officials _ for not ensuring that buildings were constructed according to earthquake standards.
The lawsuits also might help survivors to get compensation.
Because home insurance is rare, and contractors are not required to carry insurance, few of those who lost their homes can count on being recompensed for their losses.
Estimated costs to Turkey from the earthquake range from $4.5 billion, for the loss in production, to about $17 billion for the added damage to apartment buildings and the infrastructure.
This is expected to push Turkey's economy this year into a gross domestic product loss, or ``negative growth''.
But business groups say the economy should start bouncing back by the year 2001, partly because of the construction boom that the earthquake has necessitated.
``Of course the human tragedy is foremost in people's mind,'' said Erkut Yucaoglu, chairman of TUSIAD, the country's main industrialists' association.
``But we would expect a great deal of economic activity over the next two to four years because of the reconstruction,'' Yucaoglu said.
Turkey is also expecting loans and grants to help it shoulder the burden of rehousing people and restoring damaged infrastructure.
Water lines are still down in most of the quake-hit region, electricity is just being turned back on, and roads and bridges need repair.
A team of US engineering experts was in the region surveying the damage to make recommendations on how Turkey can house people, given constraints of time and money.
One issue is how many of the damaged buildings _ some of which were built by people who put in all their savings as an investment _ need to be torn down and which ones can be reinforced.
``We can put a man on the moon but at what cost''? said Roger Sullivan, sent as part of Washington's assistance program to Turkey after the earthquake.
``From an engineering standpoint it's easier to knock down a building and start again than try and reinforce, but it's tough to tell people that you're going to wipe out their structure where all their savings went,'' he said.
But some groups are not waiting for help from the government, which was accused by many of being slow to react after the earthquake.
Along with volunteers who flocked to the region to distribute food, water, and clothing, many factories in the Izmit area have started caring for their displaced workers, setting up their own tent camps.
This makes sense for businesses eager to get back to work and worried that their workers will go elsewhere in the search for temporary shelter, but it also reflects the way in which nongovernmental groups have jumped in to help survivors while governmental efforts are still somewhat disorganized.
At the Pakmaya yeast factory in Izmit, a private company that exports to 100 countries, officials said they were preparing to break ground to build 80 housing units for workers who lost their homes.
``The employees contributed to our earnings over the years, and now it's our turn to share these gains with our workers,'' said Tuncay Yurdesin, factory manager.
SAN FRANCISCO _ Earthquake forecasters apparently predicted the devastating quake in Turkey in an article published in a scientific journal in 1997.
It might have been just a lucky guess.
Still, if it was a guess, it was a remarkably good one.
In the scientific article, two U.S.
Geological Survey researchers from Menlo Park and a Turkish colleague forecast a small possibility of ``a large event south of the major western port city of Izmit,'' probably centered on the Sapanca Fault, within the next 30 years.
Early Tuesday morning, a magnitude 7.4 quake struck a few miles south of Izmit.
Early indications are that the epicenter was on the Sapanca Fault, which stems from the larger North Anatolian Fault system.
The article, published in Geophysical Research International and titled ``Progressive Failure on the North Anatolian Fault Since 1939 by Earthquake Stress Triggering,'' was written by veteran USGS researchers Ross S.
Stein and James H.
Dieterich and Aykut A.
Barka of the department of geology at Istanbul Technical University.
``The earthquake occurred right in this area that we described,'' Dieterich said in an interview Wednesday.
``This earthquake does fit what we had roughly described in this paper''.
At the same time, he said, ``I'm a little bit reluctant to claim that we forecast the earthquake,'' mainly because they assigned only a 12 percent probability to it.
Stein, Dieterich and Barka based their forecast partly on their study of a remarkable long-term trend in Turkish earthquakes.
Since 1939, 11 quakes have occurred at sites along the North Anatolian Fault that are almost always progressively farther to the west with each occurrence, ``like falling dominoes,'' as the scientists described it.
The quake sequence along the North Anatolian Fault zone is unusual in that no other fault zones on Earth show such a neat, domino-style pattern of occurrence.
According to geological theory, a quake changes crustal stress in a region and might increase the possibility of a future quake in that region.
According to the calculations by the scientists, a 1967 quake immediately to the east of Izmit increased stress in that region.
In the paper, they forecast that the increased stress could eventually cause a major quake on the Sapanca Fault.
On this basis, the three scientists proposed in their article that over the next 30 years, there was a 12 percent probability for a large event south of Izmit, which lies farther west than the 1967 quake.
They also forecast a 15 percent probability of a quake measuring at least 6.7 magnitude east of the eastern center of Ercinzan.
The Ercinzan region is far from the site of the Tuesday quake.
Whether their forecast was a true prediction or just a lucky guess, it reinforces Dieterich's confidence in an emerging paradigm of earthquake science: the importance of crustal stress changes in triggering or inhibiting future quakes.
In recent years, quake specialists have developed computer models to understand how quakes change the stress on Earth's crust.
Some research suggests that past California quakes have been either triggered or inhibited by stress changes induced by quakes elsewhere.
The most dramatic example might be the great San Francisco quake of 1906, USGS geophysicist Bob Simpson said.
``The 1906 earthquake was such a big earthquake that it pretty much relaxed every fault in the Bay Area,'' Simpson said Wednesday.
As a result, for most of the 20th century California was relatively quiet, quake-wise, compared with the shaky 19th century.
ISTANBUL, Turkey _ More than 1,000 relief workers from 19 countries joined the frantic search Wednesday for victims of Tuesday's devastating earthquake as grieving survivors raised an outcry over shoddy construction practices and lax government regulations.
Although rescue workers continued to find people alive under the rubble of collapsed buildings, the death toll climbed steadily: By Wednesday night, according to an official count, 3,879 bodies had been recovered.
More than 16,000 people were listed as seriously injured.
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit warned that the death toll could rise further.
He said rescue teams had been unable to reach some areas because roads are impassable and communications disrupted.
Parliament met in special session, and members listened gravely as the minister of Public Works and Housing, Koray Aydin, described the extent of the calamity.
``We are facing the greatest natural disaster in the history of the Turkish Republic,'' Aydin said.
``For the first time, we have had an earthquake that affected the area where 45 percent of the Turkish population lives''.
Foreign help is especially vital because early rescue efforts by the Turkish authorities have been plagued by inexperience, poor organization and lack of supplies.
In some stricken towns, newly arrived foreigners found no organized rescue effort under way and took charge themselves, directing battalions of eager volunteers.
News commentators pilloried the government for what they said were inexcusable lapses, both in preparing for an earthquake that scientists said was sure to come and in dealing with it after it struck.
``The rescue effort is a fiasco,'' one Istanbul newspaper asserted.
Another said, ``Rescue and relief is coming late or not at all''.
Several experts blamed unscrupulous contractors and ineffective inspectors for having contributed to the scope of the catastrophe by allowing the construction of flimsy buildings that could not withstand a quake.
``The inevitable happened, despite years and years of repeated warnings,'' said Ahmet Ercan, a professor of geophysics at Istanbul Technical University.
``Officials refused to face facts.
They never insisted that contractors survey the risks and build earthquake-resistant structures.
Maybe after this bitter experience, we will update our regulations along the lines of Japan, the United States and Mexico''.
The epicenter of the quake was near Izmit, about 55 miles east of Istanbul.
There, an astonishing number of the destroyed buildings were new, built within the past five years.
Semiha Adiyaman, a plump and vigorous grandmother in her sixties, lived in an apartment, one of five five-story buildings perched together on a hilltop just outside of Izmit.
Wednesday she stood by possessions that workers had extracted from the rubble: a pile of clothing, suitcases that did not close, curtains, a kitchen chair.
Then she clambered over concrete debris to the fringes of the rock pile that was once her home.
``This is what you should look into,'' she said angrily, grabbing hold of quarter-inch steel rods jutting out of the concrete.
``This is too thin and it was done to save money.
Somebody needs to look into this and ask if the buildings were too weak''.
Many other residents of Izmit posed similar questions, complaining that contractors had scrimped on the amount of cement used to bind the concrete.
In Darica, a suburb of Izmit, the central shopping area reopened more or less normally Wednesday.
The weekly street markets bustled, selling everything from fruit to shoes.
Yet on the hilltop where Mrs.
Adiyaman lived, perhaps a mile away, three out of five identical apartment buildings had been flattened.
Fatal earthquakes are common in Turkey, occurring about once every two years.
But most strike the rugged and sparsely populated eastern provinces.
This one hit the country's densely populated industrial heartland, the region southwest of Istanbul.
Some neighborhoods in Istanbul itself were also damaged, but Tuesday's quake was not the enormous one that some scientists say is likely to strike this teeming metropolis sometime in the coming decades.
Historic monuments such as the Haghia Sophia, once the seat of Byzantine power, and Topkapi Palace, from which Ottoman sultans ruled, were unscathed by Tuesday's powerful quake.
The U.S.
Geological Survey said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 7.8, but downgraded that to 7.4, one of the strongest of the century anywhere in the world.
Turkish seismologists put its strength at 7.4.
``It's an extremely serious quake, really terrible,'' said a foreign diplomat who toured the affected area by car and helicopter.
``You see these huge heaps of rubble and you ask, `How are they ever going to get anyone out of there'?
It's a God-awful mess''.
There were no new aftershocks on Wednesday, but many Turkish families in the earthquake zone have nonetheless chosen to remain in tents or other outdoor shelters for a few more days.
With so much effort being made to rescue those who are believed still alive, there has been little time to assess long-term damage.
But television footage from many towns showed utter destruction that will certainly cripple Turkey's effort to climb out of the economic troubles into which it has fallen this year.
nn (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Teams of rescue workers arrived steadily at the Istanbul airport on Wednesday.
Officials carrying clipboards wandered through the arrival lounge asking passengers, ``Are you rescue people''?
Among emergency workers who arrived Wednesday were 70 from the United States, most of them firefighters who rushed to Izmit, where the country's largest oil refinery burned through the day as emergency crews awaited specially equipped French and German planes that were used to extinguish oil well fires after the Gulf War.
Nearly every European country sent money, relief workers or equipment, including Greece, which is Turkey's principal rival in the eastern Mediterranean.
The European Union contributed $2.1 million in emergency aid.
Relief planes also arrived from non-European countries including Egypt, Jordan, Algeria, Pakistan and Japan.
The largest foreign contributor so far has been Israel, which dispatched two firefighting planes, teams of dogs trained to track buried humans, and 350 relief workers, some from specialized military units that joined the search for survivors after U.S. embassies in Africa were bombed last year.
Israel has also pledged to send a fully equipped field hospital within a few days.
Turkey and Israel have forged a strong strategic partnership over the last few years, and Israel is evidently anxious to show that it can be a good friend when Turkey is in need.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) Turkish television stations broadcast nearly non-stop coverage of relief efforts.
The most poignant scenes showed victims being brought out from the wreckage of collapsed buildings.
Overwrought spectators cheered and sobbed each time a survivor was found, and simply sobbed when bodies, including many of small children, were seen to be lifeless.
Although Izmit and the nearby town of Adapazari were believed to have been the hardest hit, another focus of the relief effort is the port of Golcuk on the Sea of Marmara.
The navy base there was destroyed, and local officials said that 100 others may lie beneath the rubble.
Turkey sits atop some of the world's most unstable geology.
Scientists said Tuesday's earthquake was along the Anatolia Fault, a 100-mile arc that winds beneath northwestern provinces near Istanbul.
``It was certainly no surprise,'' said Ahmet Mete Isikara, director of an observatory in Istanbul and a leading specialist on earthquake risk.
``There is no technique for predicting earthquakes, so we couldn't say when it would happen.
But we knew it would, sooner or later.
``This Anatolia fault zone is quite complex, but certainly the possibility of an even bigger earthquake, even one in Istanbul, is still there.
Most probably we will get a lot of lessons from this quake.
We have to, otherwise we will suffer the same thing in the future.''
The concept of organic food --products grown in the optimal ecological environment and subject to a thorough quality control process -- first appeared in China ten years ago.
Products and processes are standardized and trademarked to protect consumers.
Organic food has become an area of vigorous development in China's agriculture and food production.
The total output of China 's organic food was up to 8.4 million tons by the end of 1998.
The sales volume of last year was about 28.5 billion yuan (about 3.3 billion US dollars).
The rapid development of China's organic food industry has attracted the international attention.
In 1998, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) of the United Nations emphasized China's experiences of development and management of organic food in the Asia-Pacific region.
Talking about the future of the organic food industry, Liu Lianfu said organic food has already become a rising market with great potential.
It is estimated that in the coming years, the scale of the world's organic food market will reach 100 billion US dollars and Europe, the United States and Japan will take the lead.
In China, the average consumption of fruit and vegetables is still far behind that of developed countries, thus it has a good opportunity to develop organic food, Liu said.
When it comes to sales of organic food, the British are leaving the Americans in the dust.
After sputtering along for years, sales there are expected to be five times as much this year as in 1996, compared with a less than threefold increase in this country over the same period.
Organics are mainstream in Britain, in some part because of the introduction of genetically modified ingredients from America to which there has been widespread opposition.
Anger and fear over GM products reached a peak last summer and has since died down, but interest in organics is stronger than ever.
Ads for organic food are found in newspapers and in supermarket magazines, particularly those of Waitrose and Sainsbury, the two chains leading the organic charge.
Overhead signs in their stores direct customers to the organic sections, and the products themselves are clearly marked.
That these organic products are free of genetically modified ingredients is occasionally emblazoned on the packages as well.
And unlike the United States, where the bulk of organic sales are in natural food stores, 70 percent to 80 percent of the sales in England are in conventional supermarkets.
Sainsbury has about 440 stores, and Waitrose has more than 120.
Other supermarket chains are also making a point of stocking organic ingredients, but not with quite the same fervor.
A number of factors account for the differences between the two countries.
The simple answer is a series of food scares there that have made consumers uneasy.
``We have lived in a culture of food scares,'' said Alan Wilson, an agronomist and organic food consultant for Waitrose, citing organophosphates in carrots, salmonella in eggs and BSE in cattle.
The latter refers to mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, which destroys the brain.
For several years, the British government insisted that it could not be passed from cattle to humans.
Then, in 1997, the government acknowledged that BSE could be transmitted.
The admission was followed by the appearance of genetically modified foods, and for Britons that apparently was the last straw.
Wilson said the furor last year over genetically modified foods occurred because ``it threatened to take away choice from British consumers''.
He continued: ``Any science that comes to market has to benefit consumers, and the presentation of GM foods here was very, very poor.
So GM was just another gift to the organic movement,'' helping to speed up its popularity.
As in the United States, organic means free of genetically modified ingredients.
Despite food scares in the United States _ salmonella in chickens and eggs, listeria in ready-to-eat meats and E.
coli O157:H7 in a number of products _ Americans appear to trust government food safety agencies more than the British.
Craig Sams, an American who is founder and president of Whole Earth Foods in England and lives there but travels often to the United States, said there were three fundamental differences between attitudes here and there: regulations, the press and the English connectedness to the countryside.
He could have added vegetarianism.
For generations, meatless diets have had a much higher profile in England than in this country, where few even knew what vegetarians were until the 1960s.
The United States has no national organic standards, Sams said, which ``undermines the market and deters big companies from going in''.
When the European Union's organic rules took effect in 1993, it improved credibility, he said, ``because everyone knew what organic meant''.
In England, the press has been very supportive of organics, Sams said.
Food writers there are continually exposed to information from the Soil Association, which is a nationwide organic certifier and has as much clout as all of this country's organic institutions combined.
And, finally, Sams believes that the British are more connected to their environment.
``The English love to go for long rambling walks in the countryside,'' he said.
``You don't do that in the States, so you don't have the same sense of the country''.
Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade Association in Greenfield, Mass.
, the country's largest organic organization, agreed with Sams' assessment.
In addition, she said, supermarkets have not been around as long as they have in the United States, and so the ``British still feel the loss of neighborhood green grocer, the butcher, the baker,'' DiMatteo said.
``You can see how people would be very emotional about their food supply, and organic seems to answer these kinds of emotional concerns and issues,'' she added.
The deep involvement of Prince Charles in organics and genetic engineering issues has also not been lost on his subjects, she said, and he has developed a line of organic foods under the Duchy label.
Finally, because of Britain's size, trends spread more rapidly there.
``Even if you wanted to buy organic in many parts of this country,'' DiMatteo said, ``you wouldn't be able to except on the West and East Coasts, the upper Midwest and the Southeast''.
On my visit to London in May, I was coming out of the underground when I was confronted by a front-page headline in The Daily Mail.
It warned, ``Organic Mushrooms Were Contaminated With Deadly Bacteria''.
Not until the fifth paragraph did the reader learn that the headline was false, that the E.
coli found in the mushrooms was not E.
coli 0157:H7, which is deadly, but the generic variety, which is not.
No sources were cited for the findings.
Only one of Britain's many newspapers repeated any part of the story.
These weren't the first false charges.
Last year, according to The Guardian, the ``agri-industrial food establishment'' mounted ``an ill-informed and unjustified smear campaign'' that tried to link organic food to the hazardous form of E.
coli. The thriving organic movement in Britain must have agribusiness and biotech industry worried.
&UR; &QL; &LR; &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR; Like much of the rest of the world, the United States continues to lurch toward a national standard for organic food.
The Department of Agriculture gathered the last of some 41,000 public comments on the proposed national organic standard in June.
By fall, a final version of the regulations should be ready for adoption.
It will take another 18 months, USDA officials estimate, to actually put the standards into practice.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has said that the pending national organic program will be ``the most comprehensive and strongest organic standard in the world''.
Meanwhile, the U.S. organic industry continues to see unprecedented growth.
Average organic-food sales are expected to grow by almost 25 percent a year for the next decade, according to USDA estimates.
The United States is not alone in the organic revolution.
An estimated 130 countries are producing significant amounts of certified organic food, according to Organic Perspectives magazine.
Advances abroad include: &UR; _ Japan.
&LR; A new organic certification and production system is set to take effect in April.
But because only a limited amount of food meets the new standards, many producers are likely to use alternative labels like ``reduced chemical''.
&UR; _ Australia.
&LR; The sale of organics rose by about 30 percent last year, driven by concerns over food safety, the environment and a fear of genetically engineered food.
But the Australian organic market is still relatively small, with about $150 million in sales a year.
&UR; _ New Zealand.
&LR; An office to certify organic products for export is expected to be in place by March.
Exports will focus on produce, but could expand to include meat and poultry products.
&UR; _ France.
&LR; The French are going wild for organic milk.
In 1999, production of organic milk in France rose 77 percent to about 25 million gallons.
French officials expect that figure to rise to 40 million gallons this year.
Back in the United States, the proposed regulations offer a national definition of the term ``organic''.
Currently, organic food is certified by various private and state organizations that each use their own standards for the term.
The national standard will establish clear labeling criteria so consumers know exactly what they are buying.
Among other rules, the regulations will prohibit the use of genetic engineering, sewage sludge and irradiation in the production of food products labeled ``organic''.
Antibiotics in organic livestock production and feed will also be banned.
The regulations, first introduced in 1997, will make it easier for organic farmers to export their products because international trade officials prefer to deal with one national standard rather than multiple state and private standards.

There have been virtually no corn exports from the United States because the genetically modified corn cannot be separated from the rest of the crop, costing American farmers about $200 million a year.
Some of the largest exporters, including Archer Daniels Midland, have said they will no longer accept altered corn for export and have let farmers know they want conventionally grown corn.
A consortium of major European retailers, including Sainsbury and Marks &AMP; Spencer from Britain, Migros from Switzerland, Carrefour from France and Esselunga from Italy, are shopping for sources of products that have not been genetically modified.
The impact of these actions on American farmers, who are already in deep financial trouble, can be devastating.
In trying to keep a dialogue going with America's European trading partners, Glickman sought to tone down the administration's rhetoric, which has included calling Europeans ``irrational'' because of their opposition to genetically modified foods.
Glickman said he had spoken to ``White House people'' before he made his remarks at the National Press Club in Washington, but one other administration official said the speech had taken them by surprise.
Genetic modification is the insertion of genes from one species of animal or plant or from microbes into another, permanently altering its genetic code.
It can confer resistance on plants to certain insects and diseases that would in some cases require the use of pesticides.
Soybeans have been genetically altered so that they can tolerate applications of an herbicide that kills the weeds in the same field.
Those who oppose genetic modification of food do so on two grounds: The safety of these foods has never been tested and they are harmful to the environment.
The Food and Drug Administration does not require testing, just assurances from the company that manufactures the genetically modified food that it is safe.
Glickman acknowledged that none of the agencies responsible for the safety of genetically modified foods _ USDA, FDA or Environmental Protection Agency had enough staff or resources to conduct such testing.
Environmental questions are more problematic.
The Environmental Defense Fund, a public interest lobbying group, filed a petition with the EPA Tuesday asking it to require farmers to plant conventional corn around the fields of the genetically modified corn to prevent the escape of toxic pollens into areas where butterflies feed.
There is also concern that the pesticide resistance engineered into plants could transfer to weeds and insects, producing superweeds and superbugs.
Even Americans who do not necessarily oppose genetic engineering believe that such products should be labeled.
In a survey conducted by the European company Novartis, more than 90 percent called for labeling.
In addition, more than 500,000 people signed a petition to the FDA demanding mandatory labeling of such foods.
The Center for Food Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group, has filed a lawsuit against the FDA to reclassify genetic modification as an additive that would require labeling.
When the Agriculture Department proposed organic food regulations, more than 280,000 people filed comments protesting the inclusion of genetically modified foods as organic.
Glickman, known as a strong supporter of biotechnology, said in his speech Tuesday that it was important to ``encourage the development of these new food production systems''.
But, he added, ``We cannot blindly embrace their benefits.
We have to ensure public confidence in general, consumer confidence in particular''.
In a speech earlier this year at Purdue University, he said, ``We also can't force these new genetically engineered food products down consumers' throats''.
And he compared biotechnology today to nuclear power 20 years ago.
``We have a way in this country of latching on to solutions, pursuing them to the exclusion of others, and then watching them sometimes backfire,'' he said.
``We did that in the late '70s when we embraced nuclear power as the primary source of our energy needs.
Then, Three Mile Island happened.
Now nuclear power is still part of our energy grid, but it's not the only part.
``Let's not put all of our eggs in the biotech basket''.
It is a comparison that the biotech industry considers invidious but opponents believe is valid.
WASHINGTON (AP) --Farmers doubled the nation's organic crop acreage in the 1990s, and production of organic eggs and milk increased even more to meet rising consumer demand, the government says.
The amount of certified organic cropland grew from 403,000 acres in 1992 to 850,000 in 1997.
The number of organic laying hens jumped from 43,981 to 537,826 during the same period, a time when public concern about bacterial contamination of eggs was on the rise.
The number of organic milk cows grew from 2,265 to 12,897.
''Organic farming became one of the fastest growing segments of U.S. agriculture during the 1990s and producers, exporters and retailers are still struggling to meet consumer demand,'' according to a study by the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service.
Organic farming is still a very small part of U.S. agriculture, however.
About 0.2 percent of U.S. cropland was certified organic in 1997, compared with 1.5 percent in Europe, where farmers are offered government aid to convert to organic agriculture.
The amount of organic pasture and rangeland actually declined from 1992 to 1997, from 532,000 acres to 496,000 acres.
Economists say organic production of meat and poultry lagged during the decade because they could not be labeled as organic until February 1999.
A summary of the USDA study was released Thursday.
Organic farming practices prohibit the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for crops or antibiotics or hormones in livestock.
New national standards for organic food that the department announced earlier this month are expected to stimulate growth in the industry by bolstering consumer confidence and making it easier to export the products.
But the study said it remains difficult for farmers to switch to organic practices for a number of reasons: the cost and risk involved in shifting to the new methods, insufficient numbers of processors and distributors, and limited access to capital.
While organic products can fetch significantly higher prices than conventional ones, farmers cannot sell their crops as organic during the three-year conversion period required to be certified.
Nationally, 2 percent of apple, grape, lettuce and carrot acreage was organic in 1997, along with 1 percent of oats, dry peas and tomatoes.
There is evidence that organic agriculture has continued to expand since 1997.
California Certified Organic Farmers, one of the top certifying agencies in the state, estimated its 1999 acreage at 96,878, up 38 percent from 1997.
Idaho estimated its 1999 organic cropland at 85,061 acres, up 55 percent from 1997.

WASHINGTON (AP) --Americans hunger for any food promoted as natural, consuming $6 billion worth of products labeled organic, often with no guarantee they actually were grown and processed without synthetic chemicals.
That should change with the release, as early as Tuesday, of the first national standards for organic food.
The rules, expected to take effect this summer, will spell out for the first time what it means for foods to be labeled organic.
They also will bar the use of genetically engineered crops or irradiated ingredients in organic foods.
Food grown and processed in accordance with those rules can carry a seal of approval from the Agriculture Department, agency officials say.
The rules ''give the consumers assurance that they've been looking for that the products meet a set of standards that have been enforced and that those standards are the same regardless of the state it was grown in,'' said Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade Association.
''That will build consumer confidence in the label and certainly will encourage sales''.
Critics of the organic industry say the rules could lead consumers into thinking organic products are safer or more nutritious than conventional food.
There is no evidence that is true, said Christine Bruhn, director of the Center for Consumer Research at the University of California-Davis.
''I hope they will understand what organic means and make this an informed choice,'' she said.
Out of the 10,000 farms nationwide that claim to be organic, only 6,600 are approved by the 88 different state or private certifying agencies around the country.
Nineteen states have no regulations for organic farming.
Eleven others, including California, have production standards but no certification process for ensuring that farmers comply with them.
Meanwhile, the industry has been growing at a rate of 20 percent annually over the past decade.
Sales are expected to reach $6 billion this year, according to the trade association.
Some of the nation's biggest food manufacturers are getting into the natural-foods business, including General Mills Inc.
and H.J.
Heinz Co.
General Mills has a new organic cereal and announced in December that it was buying Small Planet Foods, a leading producer of organic food products.
Nearly half the population eats organic products at least occasionally, a recent ABC News Poll found.
The organic market is likely to continue growing at a double-digit pace for years to come, said David Nelson, a food industry analyst with CS First Boston.
''Consumers are buying food less as a staple or basic fuel and more as an expression of lifestyle, like clothing or choice of car.
It's a niche market certainly, but rapidly growing,'' he said.
The rules are expected to: --equire that farmers go through a mandatory planning process and have their practices certified by an approved state or private agency.
--estrict the pesticides, fertilizers and seed treatments they can apply.
--imit the kind of additives and packaging processors can use.
Banned will be additives like sulfites, nitrates or nitrite, for example.
Congress ordered national organic standards in 1990.
Seven years later, rules proposed by USDA were rejected by the industry because they left open the possibility of allowing irradiated and genetically engineered food and the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer.
Those possibilities have been ruled out in the new proposals, said Andy Solomon, a spokesman for Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
Producers and processors are expected to have 18 months to comply; enforcement is left to states and private agencies approved by USDA.
In the absence of national standards, foods claiming to be organic are labeled in many different.
Some list a certifying agency, others do not.
''They can charge more if it says organic and it may not be,'' said Jennifer Brenner, who was shopping Saturday at a Fresh Fields natural foods store in Falls Church, Va.
''It's healthy whether it's truly organic or not, but it would be nice to know for sure''.
The store carried four varieties of organic apple sauce: One claimed certification by ''OCIA,'' a reference to the Organic Crop Improvement Association; a second was certified by Vermont Organic Growers; a third cited a private California certifying agency, Quality Assurance International; the label on Fresh Fields' house brand simply said it was grown in accordance with California law.
NEW YORK _ Readers often send me questions that are of interest to more than an audience of one, and lately they have almost all involved fruits and vegetables.
One reader was anxious about the pesticides in strawberries, and whether cooking the fruit reduced any risk.
I checked the most recent ranking of produce by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research organization in Washington.
The rankings reflect the number of pesticides in various fruits and vegetables, and the percentage of each category that is cantaminated with pesticides.
Apples were at the top, followed by spinach, peaches, pears, strawberries, Chilean grapes, potatoes, red raspberries, celery and green beans.
As for whether cooking reduces the levels of pesticide in a fruit or vegetable, it depends on the type of fruit or vegetable and on how long it is cooked.
Turning apples into applesauce or tomatoes into tomato paste reduces levels significantly.
Freezing produce has virtually no impact.
Another reader wondered if peeling vegetables reduced the pesticide level.
Generally, peeling fruits and vegetables will reduce the level, but some pesticides are systemic and taken up through the roots.
Readers interested in more data on pesticides in food can log on to the Web site of the Environmental Working Group, which is at www.foodnews.org.
For those who are truly concerned about pesticides in conventional food, the safest alternative is organic food.
On another issue, a reader wondered about the nutritional value of vegetables in soup, explaining that her husband called soup ``dead vegetables'' because they are cooked so long.
Water-soluble vitamins B and C do leach out of vegetables when they are cooked in liquid, but in this case they go directly into the soup.
To keep the vegetables from looking dead, add the most tender ones just long enough to cook and contribute some flavor without turning to mush.
Still another reader wanted to know how pineapple juice and carrot juice can still have fiber in them after they have been processed.
The best source of that kind of information is Harold McGee, the author of ``On Food and Cooking'' (Scribner, 1984).
As he explains, there are two kinds of fiber, soluble and insoluble.
Pectin, which is used to gel jellies, is soluble fiber.
It doesn't appear to have any texture, but it does, so you might not be able to tell it was in the juice.
Cellulose and lignin are insoluble fibers.
The fiber in a glass of pineapple or carrot juice is soluble, and it cannot be seen because it is suspended in the liquid.
Insoluble fiber, if it is there, is the sediment, what eventually falls to the bottom of the glass.
Another reader had a more pressing question: Can you make a low-fat blue cheese dressing like the bottled kind at home?
Yes and no.
You can make a low-fat blue cheese dressing, but not like the one in the bottle.
In my version, which is given below, there is no guar gum, used as a thickener.
Because blue cheese has such a strong flavor, not much is needed, and that keeps the calories and fat down.
This dressing is delicious on ripe tomatoes or Belgian endive and as an alternative to the usual dressing for coleslaw or potato salad.
To make enough for four people, mash two ounces (four tablespoons) of blue cheese with six tablespoons of plain nonfat yogurt, two tablespoons of brandy and a couple of pinches of cayenne.
Mix well.
The dressing will keep for a week or two in the refrigerator, tightly covered.
WASHINGTON (AP) --New federal rules for organic food will assure consumers that the products are grown and processed to the same standards nationwide.
That doesn't mean, however, that organic is better than conventional food, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said.
''Just because something is labeled organic does not mean that it is any more superior, any safer or more healthy than conventional food.
All food in this country must meet the same high standards of safety, regardless of their classification,'' Glickman said in releasing the proposed rules Tuesday.
The rules, almost a decade in the making, would bar the use of genetically engineered crops, disease-killing irradiation treatments or industrial sludge as a fertilizer.
Products grown and processed according to the standards and contain at least 95 percent organic ingredients will be allowed to carry a seal of approval that says, ''USDA Certified Organic''.
Foods that are least 50 percent organic could be labeled ''made with'' organic ingredients.
The new standards, intended to replace a hodgepodge of state and private rules, also would prohibit the use of antibiotics in livestock production and require the use of organic feed.
The rules also restrict the kind of fertilizers, pesticides and food additives that can be used.
With a few exceptions, synthetic chemicals would not be allowed.
The Agriculture Department first proposed a set of national organic standards in 1997 but withdrew them after farmers and others in the $6 billion-a-year organic industry strongly objected to allowing biotech crops, irradiation and sewage sludge.
The proposed rules ''will preserve the well-defined production practices that characterize organic agriculture,'' said Hiu Newcomb, who runs organic vegetable farms in the Washington area.
But the National Food Processors Association said USDA ignored scientific evidence in deciding to block the use of genetically engineered crops or irradiation.
Conventional meat and produce can be irradiated to kill harmful bacteria.
''While the public's views are important, rules governing food labeling and food safety must be based on sound science, and sound science cannot be determined by public opinion polling,'' said Kelly Johnston, a spokeswoman for the group, which represents major food processors and manufacturers.
Sen. Patrick Leahy, who wrote a 1990 law that required USDA to develop the rules, said they should provide a boost to the organic industry, which has already been growing by 20 percent a year.
Without such standards, ''there are limits to consumer acceptance and export potential,'' the Vermont Democrat said.
Enforcement of the rules will be left to states and private certifying agencies.
Out of the 10,000 farms nationwide that claim to be organic, only 6,600 are certified by a state or private agency.
USDA will take public comment on the rules from March 13 through June 14 before putting them into effect.
Farmers and processors will then be given 18 months to get into compliance.

The USDA continues to work on guidelines to have a national standard for ``organic'' food.
_ (Visit the Star-Telegram's online services on the World Wide Web: www.star-telegram.com) nn
WASHINGTON _ More than two years after the federal government's first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win public approval, the Department of Agriculture is announcing much tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified ingredients in products carrying the organic label.
The rules also prohibit the use of irradiation to decontaminate the products and the application of sewage sludge as fertilizer.
The rules, to be announced next week, could take effect by the end of the year.
Of the more than 275,000 comments received in response to the original proposal in 1997, virtually all of them opposed those three processes, which the Agriculture Department had considered allowing.
The new rules indicate an about-face in the department's attitude toward organic farming and represent one of several steps it is taking to help the small- and medium-sized farmers who have mainly been ignored or even discriminated against by the agency for decades.
The national standards could help U.S. producers sell organic food abroad, where there has been substantial opposition to the use of genetically modified crops and other new food technologies.
``This could turn out to be the most important rule USDA has issued in 20 years,'' said Dr.
Margaret Mellon, the director of the agriculture and biotechnology program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy group in Washington that had urged the agency to toughen its earlier proposals.
``The Agriculture Department's policies have made small farmers an endangered species,'' Mellon said.
``Now it is trying to construct a system to allow small farmers to help them survive, to help them flourish.
It is also a turning point in its relationship to consumers.
The agency has never before been responsive to consumers' desires or demands''.
In an interview, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said that if the public thought the standards were too strict they should let the department know during the 90-day comment period before the agency enacts the final rules.
``I'd rather go from too strict standards and ease them than going the other way,'' Glickman said.
The agency is clearly moving towards stricter definitions of what constitutes organic food.
After initially ignoring many of the recommendations of the National Organic Standards Board, which had been set up to help the agency formulate the regulations, the Agriculture Department has now taken all of the board's advice, including total prohibition of antibiotics in animals raised as organic; the use of 100 percent organic feed; and the requirement of outdoor access for animals.
Sales of organic food have been increasing about 20 percent a year.
When Congress passed the Organic Foods Production Act in 1990, sales of organic food had reached $1 billion: projected sales for 1999 are $6.46 billion.
Under the new rules, raw products could carry the federal agency's organic seal on the front of packaging if they were 100 percent organic, meaning that they are grown and manufactured without the use of added hormones, pesticides or synthetic fertilizer.
Processed food that is made from at least 95 percent organic ingredients could also carry the seal.
And processed food containing at least 50 percent organic ingredients could be labeled ``made with organic ingredients'' and list up to three of them.
Irradiation, genetic modification and the use of sludge would be prohibited not only in the organic ingredients but in the conventional ingredients in foods made partly with organic ingredients.
Products made with less than 50 percent organic ingredients may use the word organic only in the list of ingredients on the side panel; in this case, the prohibition against those three processes would not apply.
Several advocates of organic farming who have seen the revised rules say that the standards are stricter than those developed in any other country and have set the bar very high for organic farmers in the United States, possibly discouraging rather than encouraging them to grow organic crops.
``The document is certainly much closer to meeting industry expectations than the first one but the pendulum may have swung too far,'' said Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade Association.
``The standards seem to be written in a vacuum and do not take into account what supplies, ingredients and production materials are actually available.
I am afraid that some people are not going to bother to be organic anymore''.
One of the areas of concern that has been left vague in the new rules is how to treat organic crops that have been contaminated with drift from nearby genetically engineered crops.
An Agriculture Department official said that no level for drift had been set but a farmer would not be penalized if some low level of contamination occurred as long as he had followed all of the organic procedures required.
As part of a larger effort to help the more than 12,000 organic farmers, the administration's budget for the first time includes a $5.5 million request for organic research.
In addition, the Agriculture Department has a pilot project for crop insurance for organic farmers and is studying other things that might help them.
``Frankly, I want to preserve family farming,'' Glickman said.
``We need economic avenues for small- and medium-size farms and this is one way to do this.
Clearly organic agriculture is a way farmers can make more money''.
The public can send comments to the Agriculture Department by mail or on the Internet at www.ams.usda.gov/nop.
American shoppers would be surprised to know that much of the food they buy has genetically engineered ingredients.
But they cannot tell just how much, because the United States, unlike many other countries, does not require the labeling of gene-modified food.
Most consumers are unaware of the amount of genetically engineered food that is available, making it difficult to judge their resistance to such products.
When the government granted Monsanto Co.
permission to sell rBGH, recombinant bovine growth hormone, which increases cows' milk production, and milk containing a gene-altered hormone went on sale, some states and several dairies tried to label their products as free of the hormone.
Monsanto threatened to take them to court.
Some capitulated.
But a number of dairy products are now labeled to show that they do not contain rBGH.
With only a few consumer groups seeking wider labeling, the greatest awareness of genetically engineered food comes from the organic-food industry.
Whole Foods Market Inc.
of Austin, Texas, which has 91 supermarkets in 18 states, requires its suppliers to guarantee that none of the products they sell to the company have gene-altered ingredients.
Last year, when the Agriculture Department proposed national standards for organic food that included genetically altered food, more than 200,000 comments were received protesting the proposed regulations.
The inclusion of genetically modified food was one of the reasons most often cited, and the proposal was withdrawn.
On Jan.
1 the government gave the green light to genetically modified soybeans, cotton, corn, summer squash, potatoes, canola oil, radicchio, papayas and tomatoes.
The amount of genetically modified soybeans, cotton and corn on the market is significant.
According to one study, the gene-altered corn crop in the United States this summer is estimated to be 32 percent of the total, for soybeans 38 percent and for canola oil, from Canada, 58 percent.
There is no estimate for cotton.
There are no figures for the smaller crops like papaya and radicchio, and just because a crop has approval does not mean that it is being sold.
But within a year or two such crops are quite likely to be available.
The Consumers Union, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Center for Science in the Public Interest are among those pushing for labeling.
Norway and India are leading the fight to require the strictest labeling on all foods.
And virtually all European Union countries want some labeling for gene-altered food.
A senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, Rebecca Goldberg, said the United States might be forced to require some labeling because of international trade.
``Many products made abroad,'' Ms.
Goldberg said, ``will be labeled, and in order for the United States to sell food products abroad we may have to label them.''
WASHINGTON (AP) --The government today released new national standards for growing and processing organic food that will bar the use of genetic engineering or irradiation.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the standards, which are expected to go into effect later this year, will be the ''most comprehensive, strictest organic rules in the world''.
The rules will allow products that meet the standards to carry a seal of approval that says, ''USDA Certified Organic''.
USDA first proposed a set of national organic standards in 1997 but withdrew them after farmers and others in the organic industry strongly objected to provisions that could have allowed the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer, as well as genetically engineered and irradiated ingredients.

PACIFIC GROVE, Calif.
(AP) --Farmers upset by the overly broad label of ``organic'' foods may find relief later this year with an expected government ruling that will limit the kinds of foods receiving that definition.
``I'm telling you we are looking at every possible way to protect the integrity of your industry,'' Keith Jones of the Department of Agriculture's National Organic Program told farmers at the Ecological Farming Conference on Thursday''.
The government is planning to issue rules prohibiting the label ``organic'' for any food that is irradiated, genetically engineered or treated with antibiotics.
The new labeling plan responds to an outcry from farmers last year against an earlier set of rules the farmers considered too permissive.
``I'm very encouraged'' by the government's promises, said Bob Anderson, who runs Walnut Acres in Penn Creek, Penn.
, and is a member of the National Organic Standards Board, a coalition of organic farmers.
``There's nothing like 280,000 comments to get the government's attention''.
The department is developing the first national standards on organic food labeling to replace a hodgepodge of state rules and industry guidelines.
U.S. sales of organic foods have grown by 20 percent annually for the last seven years.
In 1996, they exceeded $3.5 billion.
Once a small minority, now there are more than 10,000 U.S. farms trying to raise organic crops and livestock, the Organic Farming Research Foundation said.
Farmers have their own informal guidelines for what they call organic, which they hope will be adopted by the government.
For instance, fruits and vegetables shouldn't have pesticides, herbicides or preservatives.
Livestock should be raised in open-air environments, without antibiotics or hormones.
Last year, the USDA proposed allowing food to be labeled ``organic'' even if it was irradiated to kill germs, genetically engineered, or subjected to sewage sludge.
The rules also would have permitted applications of chemical sprays currently prohibited by industry groups.
Organic farmers, marketers and consumers sent more than 280,000 protest letters, prompting Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to withdraw the proposal and try again.
Some farmers at the conference remained skeptical that his verbal assurances may not hold once rules are published again.
``We farmers in West Texas joke about never having seen rain but we still believe in it.
That's kind of where we are in this process,'' said Michael Sligh, representing the Campaign for Sustainable Agriculture, based in Chapel Hill, N.C.
``The ethics of organics is what separates us from others,'' said Howard-Yana Shapiro, vice president of Seeds of Change, a Santa Fe, N.M. company.
``For many of us, this is a continuation of a lifetime of work.
First it was civil rights.
Then it was anti-war.
Now it's food security''.
The new rules will probably be published this summer in the Federal Register and could take effect in the fall, said Jones.
The New York Times said in an editorial for its editions of Thursday, March 9: In late 1997 the Department of Agriculture proposed rules that would have established a nationwide certification program for organic foods.
During the 90-day comment period that followed, it became clear just how badly the department had stumbled.
Rather than heed the advice of its own National Organic Standards Board, the agency would have allowed the use of irradiation, sewage sludge and genetically modified organisms in the growing and preparation of foods to be called organic.
Whatever one thinks of those particular practices, they are hardly what most people would consider ``organic''.
The outcry from consumers and organic farmers forced reconsideration.
On Tuesday the agency released a Revised Proposed Rule.
It is a dramatically improved document that may signal a significant new direction at Agriculture.
To quote the department's own press release, the new rule ``specifically prohibits the use of genetic engineering, sewage sludge, and irradiation in the production of food products labeled `organic'''.
It also offers a strict standard defining what constitutes an organic food, a step that should do a great deal to enhance consumer trust that a food labeled organic really is organic.
For raw products to be deemed 100 percent organic, for example, they must be grown or manufactured without added hormones, pesticides or synthetic fertilizers.
The new rules do not reflect a judgment on the relative safety or quality of organic foods as compared with conventional foods.
Rather, they govern marketing claims.
The department's response to the community of organic farmers may herald a welcome new sensitivity to a sector of the farming world that has suffered from official neglect.
The Clinton administration now needs to approve a final rule before it leaves office.
The Agriculture Department should take what it has learned in developing these regulations _ especially the act of listening intently to farmers _ and apply it to other programs that affect small farmers.
For their part, consumers and farmers should recognize the power they wield when they work together. &QL;
Dennis T.
Avery wants organic food to go away.
And he doesn't care what it takes.
Four years ago, he said that organic food could not feed the world without destroying the environment.
Now, he says it's lethal.
In an article in the fall issue of American Outlook magazine, published by his employer, the Hudson Institute, a conservative research group, Avery wrote, ``Organic foods have clearly become the deadliest food choice''.
This is the case, he said, because organic farms use animal manure and do not use chemicals or permit pasteurization.
The last assertion is untrue, as were several other statements in the article.
The accusation might have gone unnoticed, but excerpts from the article were published in The Wall Street Journal and continue to be picked up around the country, by The Associated Press, The Tampa Tribune and trade industry publications.
The simplest definition of ``organic'' is food grown without hormones, pesticides or synthetic fertilizers.
Avery, however, used the terms ``organic,'' ``free-range,'' ``natural'' and ``unpasteurized'' interchangeably.
``I grant you that I've mixed together natural and organic,'' Avery, the author of ``Saving the Planet With Pesticides and Plastic'' (Hudson Institute, 1995), said in an interview last week.
``But to me they are distinctions without significant difference in terms of public health''.
His most combative accusation is based, he said, on 1996 data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, showing that ``people who eat organic and `natural' foods are eight times as likely as the rest of the population to be attacked by a deadly new strain of E.
coli bacteria (O157:H7)''.
Yet some of the foods that caused the outbreak, which he called organic, were not, like unpasteurized Odwalla apple juice.
Avery's claim that ``consumers of organic food are also more likely to be attacked by a relatively new, more virulent strain of the infamous salmonella bacteria'' was based on a Consumers Union study in 1998 showing that ``premium'' chickens had higher levels of salmonella than regular supermarket chickens.
But the premium chickens were not organic.
In the article, Avery took the Food and Drug Administration to task for failing ``to issue any warnings to consumers about the higher levels of natural toxins their researchers regularly find in organic foods''.
In the interview, he said that that assertion was based on a statement by Dr.
Robert Lake, an official in the agency's Center for Food Safety and Nutrition.
Lake denied making such a statement, saying, ``We don't go out of our way to sample organic food, and hence I don't think we are in a position to say anything one way or another about it''.
Avery wrote that because ``organic farmers use animal manure as the major source of fertilizer,'' there are higher levels of harmful bacteria in organic food.
Katherine DiMatteo, the executive director of the Organic Trade Association, said that manure is not the major source of fertilizer on organic farms (it is also used in conventional farming) and that, when it is used, certain rules must be followed for safety.
Avery said he had never ``bothered that much about consumer safety aspects of organic food until O157:H7''.
His real goal, he said, is to prevent organic agriculture from becoming the norm.
``My big concern is that we do not have room on the planet to feed ourselves organically,'' he said.
The attack on organic food by a well-financed research organization suggests that, even though organic food accounts for only 1 percent of food sales in the country, the conventional food industry is worried.
NEW YORK (AP) --It's a marriage aimed at putting fish on the table of the world's rich and poor for generations to come.
With research showing that global fish stocks are vanishing, business and industry are joining forces with environmental groups to back a new seal of approval --for fish caught from waters where they will be replenished.
``We're in the business of saving fish so we can eat them,'' said British lawmaker John Gummer, chairman of the Marine Stewardship Council, an international nonprofit organization which unveiled the seal and announced the first independent global standard to certify fisheries on Tuesday.
According to the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization, about 60 percent of the world's 200 most valuable fish species are either depleted, overfished or only slowly recovering.
Some species, such as the Atlantic halibut and the bluefin tuna, have been fished to the brink of extinction.
The spawning of bluefin tuna in the western Atlantic has fallen by nearly 90 percent since 1975, the council said.
A large quality bluefin can fetch as much as $30,000 dockside, it added.
At the Tsukigi fish market in Japan, the bluefin can go for the $60,000 and cost $200 a plate at the sushi bar.
The aim of the council's campaign, which already has backing from more than 200 corporate, government and voluntary organizations around the world, is to get ``market power behind the battle to save our fishing stocks,'' Gummer said.
The council hopes the seal --a line drawing of a fish whose back and tail fin are shaped like an approving check mark -- will bolster consumer demand for fish that are being replenished, Gummer said.
The turquoise-and-white logo will begin to appear later this year in Europe and North America on fish products, restaurant menus, and advertisements.
Gummer announced the first American companies to sign on --Boston-based Legal Sea Foods, a seafood processor and restaurant company, and Shaw's Supermarkets which has 127 stores in the six New England States.
Whole Foods Market Inc.
, based in Austin, Texas, which has 92 stores around the country selling gourmet and organic food, also signed.
``If the fish supply is no longer sustainable, then Legal Sea Foods as a business is no longer sustainable,'' said Roger Berkowitz, the company's president and chief executive officer.
``We can't suddenly switch gears and sell poultry or meat''.
The London-based council was the brainchild of Unilever, one of the world's largest buyers of frozen fish, and the World Wide Fund for Nature, who wanted to bring together public and private-sector efforts to reverse the crisis from overfishing and pollution.
Since the council was established in 1997, he said, it has consulted fishermen and experts around the world to come up with a global standard for fisheries that will augment existing local, national and international laws, standards and agreements.
To receive council certification, fisheries must be well-managed, maintain and replenish healthy fish stocks, and preserve the surrounding ecosystem.
The council will accredit specialist organizations or commercial companies to independently certify that fisheries meet their standards --and ensure that they continue to do so.
``We will be certifying quality fish caught in a way which doesn't endanger future fishing,'' Gummer said.
WASHINGTON (AP) --A growing trend of genetically altering crops with an ingrown biological pesticide is too risky for the environment, a coalition of environmentalists and organic farmers charged in a lawsuit Thursday.
They want to force the government to end its approval of what are known as Bt crops.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S.
District Court by Greenpeace International, the Center for Food Safety and the International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements charges the Environmental Protection Agency with ``wanton destruction'' of Bt, which it calls the ``world's most important biological pesticide''.
``This is just another short term fix that industry is willing to use up,'' said Jane Rissler, a senior scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Added Kalee Kreider, a Greenpeace spokeswoman, ``These crops are an environmental disaster waiting to happen''.
The complainants are concerned that using the pesticide in genetically altered plants poses environmental risks that will change the ecological balance as well as hurt organic farmers who don't want to use genetically-altered products.
They complain that EPA has failed to address their concerns since approving the product.
EPA approved the use of Bt in potatoes in 1995 and has since agreed to its use in corn and cotton.
The lawsuit demands that EPA cancel registration of all genetically engineered Bt plants; cease approval of any new Bt plants and immediately perform an environmental impact assessment.
``We can no longer sit idly by,'' said Joseph Mendelson, legal director for the Center for Food Safety.
``EPA has shown a blatant disregard for federal law and its own regulations by approving Bt crops without fully assessing their environmental safety''.
Bt is actually a soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, that produces toxins to kill insects.
It has been used for years as a spray by farmers and gardeners who like the fact that it kills insects while remaining nontoxic to mammals.
But the use of Bt has changed in recent years with advances in genetic engineering.
Scientists are now able to develop plants that contain a gene for Bt toxin, giving the crops built-in protection.
The move has been controversial, however, as many groups have raised concerns that insects will become resistant to Bt, which would seriously hurt organic farmers who are permitted to use Bt insecticides as their only emergency pest control option.
An EPA spokesman defended the agency's decision.
``EPA carefully makes sure that the biotech products we review fully comply with all legal requirements designed to ensure that they are environmentally sound and environmentally beneficial,'' said spokesman Dave Cohen.
``We believe the actions we've taken with regard to Bt will be sustained against this legal challenge''.
Some organic farmers say an even bigger threat is pollination from the genetically-altered plant seeping from conventional farms to organic farms.
Charles Walker, president of Terra Firma Inc.
--an organic food company in Hudson, Wis.
, said he was forced to recall over $100,000 worth of organic tortilla chips that had been contaminated with genetically-engineered corn.
He blames pollination from another farm.
``Unless Bt corn is withdrawn, it will soon contaminate every corn field in the country,'' Walker said.
NEW YORK _ ABC News said Monday that a report challenging the assumed benefits of organic food was partly based on research that did not exist.
It said it would make a correction on Friday night's ``20/20'' program.
In the report, the correspondent John Stossel said research commissioned by ABC News showed that conventional produce did not necessarily have more pesticide residue than did organic produce.
``Our tests, surprisingly, found no pesticide residue on the conventional samples or the organic,'' he said in the report first broadcast on Feb.
4 and again on July 7.
But the two researchers who were commissioned to do the testing _ Dr.
Michael Doyle, a scientist with the University of Georgia, and Dr.
Lester Crawford, director of the Center for Food and Nutrition Policy at Georgetown University _ said they had never tested produce for pesticide residue for ABC.
In a statement released Monday night, ABC confirmed that pesticide tests were never performed on produce.
But it steered blame away from Stossel.
``In making that statement, Mr.
Stossel was relying on inaccurate information that had been provided to him,'' it said.
Executives said David Fitzpatrick, producer of the segment, was responsible for the error, and they were trying to determine how it appeared.
But, they said, they believed it was an honest mistake and did not think Fitzpatrick would be disciplined.
Stossel will make the correction.
Top ABC News executives began looking into potential problems with the report two weeks ago, after The New York Times addressed them in an article.
But it was not the first time the issue had been raised with ABC News.
Problems with the report were first brought to light by the members of the Environmental Working Group, which supports the consumption of organic food.
They had learned that Stossel's assertion about the pesticide tests was in error after speaking with the researchers.
They apprised Stossel of their findings in a letter dated Feb.
8. They were answered by Fitzpatrick, who, in a letter, asserted that ABC did, indeed, test produce for pesticide residue.
After the report was rerun, Stossel re-emphasized the pesticide assertion in an on-the-air conversation with Cynthia McFadden, a ``20/20'' anchor.
Executives at ABC, a unit of Walt Disney, said they were trying to determine why the group's assertion about the supposed pesticide tests was not properly addressed when it was first raised.
The Environmental Working Group also contended that Stossel's report had inappropriately implied that ABC's tests had detected dangerous strains of E.
coli bacteria in the organic food when, in fact, the tests did not establish the presence of the dangerous type of E.
coli. Executives said they were still looking into that accusation. &QL;
WASHINGTON The Department of Agriculture announced Thursday that it would allow farmers who raise meat and poultry without pesticide-treated feed, growth hormones or antibiotics to label their meat ``certified organic''.
That meat will be the only organic food with a certification process approved by the federal government.
State regulations for years have allowed organic labels on many other foods, but meat and poultry have always been in a different category, subject to more stringent federal labeling regulations.
The federal rules go into effect immediately, and need no legislative approval.
They are welcomed by companies that grow organic meat, who have been frustrated in attempts to market a premium product.
Many foods labeled organic sell for 10 percent to 50 percent above the price of similar nonorganic foods.
For decades, the Agriculture Department treated the organic food industry as if it did not exist.
But as sales grew more than 20 percent a year through the 1990s, organic food came to account for $1 of every $100 spent on food, and in 1997 the agency took notice, proposing national organic standards for all food.
The proposal met with stiff resistance from more than 275,000 people who said they opposed the federal standards because they would lower the state standards already in place.
In an unusual move the agency withdrew the proposal.
An Agriculture Department spokesman described the new meat and poultry policy as ``an interim step,'' until national standards exist, which may come next year.
``This is a boon for small companies like us,'' said Allen Shainsky, owner of Petaluma Poultry Processors in Petaluma, Calif.
Shainsky's company sells around 120,000 birds per week, and he said he hoped to be selling 15,000 organic birds a week within a few months.
Allen Moody, a feed coordinator for the Coulee Region Organic Produce Pool, or Cropp, in LaFarge, Wis.
, which sells its products under the Organic Valley label, said: ``This means a lot to us.
We have not been able to get full value out of our beef cattle, our dairy cattle.
``In terms of going out with a national marketing program, it has been impossible, and we have not been able to realize the true value of our animal production,'' Moody said.
``It has held the livestock industry back''.
Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman said he hoped Thursday's announcement would also help the meat industry, particularly hog farmers who have seen prices for pork as low as 9 cents a pound.
The current price is 28 cents a pound for live hogs, compared with 35 cents last year.
Ultimately, Moody said, there is more profit in organic meat than in conventional meat.
He said he expected to sell organic pork for 60 to 70 cents a pound.
The Agriculture Department will rely on state and industry certifiers as it allows producers to use the organic label.
Those standards require third-party certification that the meat and poultry are raised on organic feed, without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones, that they have access to the outside and that there is a manure management plan.
If an animal becomes ill and must be given antibiotics it can no longer be sold as organic.
``I think this announcement is a sign that organic is one of the Secretary's top priorities,'' said Katherine DeMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade Association in Greenfield, Mass.
, ``that he is serious about working out details of the final rule for national organic standards.
The secretary has seen that this will create new opportunities to help small farmers''.
Glickman acted after a letter-writing campaign in the fall from small meat and poultry producers.
Opposition from the national beef industry was quite mild.
Alisa Harrison, a spokeswoman for the National Cattlemen's Association, said the association was ``generally supportive of niche marketing and giving consumers a choice''.
Our only concern, Ms.
Harrison said, ``is that consumers understand that products labeled organic are not safer than products that are not labeled organic.''
WASHINGTON (AP) --Consumers once could find organic food products only in specialty stores.
Today, with more organic choices than ever, from beef to baby food, and with more markets stocking the goods, organic is going mainstream.
Stores are selling meats and poultry products carrying organic labels, which the Agriculture Department approved in January.
Last month, food giant General Mills introduced its organic cereal, Sunrise.
Organic vegetables and fruits, already well known to consumers, now are being used in a variety of products, including baby food.
For years organic foods were bit players in the food industry.
The growing number of organic offerings, supporters say, shows a mainstream acceptance --and a victory for farmers, merchants and consumers.
``In the last few years, when you talk about organic, usually it's lettuce, vegetables, fruit,'' said Bob Scowcroft, executive director of the Organic Farming Research Foundation.
``You devote your life to this and it's just hard to envision.
... Overnight, it's the ad in the middle of the evening news''.
Analysts say the organic industry is growing at least 20 percent each year in the last five years, with overall 1997 sales of about $4.2 billion.
The increased demand has caught the attention of the estimated 5,300 farmers growing organic products, Scowcroft said.
Each day, his office hears from dozens of farmers wanting information about making the transition to organic.
``The quantity that General Mills is buying and their projected expansion. . . shows up on the radar screen (for farmers),'' Scowcroft said.
The new Sunrise cereal contains organic whole wheat, corn, oats and barley as well as organic sugar, said Scott Lutz, vice president for new enterprises at General Mills.
``One of the bigger challenges was to make sure there was an ample supply of organic grains and organic sugar,'' Lutz said.
The company spent about four years developing the product.
``The reaction has been very positive,'' Lutz said.
``We've been hearing from consumers for quite some time that they wanted another choice.
We tried to make organic cereals accessible to the mainstream''.
Consumers will also benefit from the introduction of organic meat in stores across the country, activists say.
Organically-grown meat typically comes from animals that have been fed vegetarian diets free of pesticides, fertilizers and antibiotics.
The animals are also free range, meaning they are able to roam and are not confined to small pens that sometimes house hundreds of animals.
In a much-anticipated announcement, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman in January said the agency would allow meat to be certified and labeled as organic.
Many in the industry had complained that it was unfair to allow vegetables, fruits and milk to be labeled organic, while placing restraints on the meat industry.
California-based Petaluma Poultry, which has marketed antibiotic-free chicken for several years, plans to introduce its Rosie the Organic Chicken next week to consumers in California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.
Organic Valley, a Wisconsin-based company that has marketed vegetables and milk, already offers frozen hot dogs and hamburger patties.
In June, Organic Valley plans to introduce the first organic bacon and ham as well as whole organic chicken and chicken breasts.
A line of sausage products is expected in the fall.
The fresh products first will be marketed in the Midwest while the frozen items will be distributed nationally, said Theresa Marquez, Organic Valley's marketing director.
Allen Shainsky, president of Petaluma Poultry, said if the growth of his company's antibiotic-free chicken line is any indication of what is in store for organic, the industry should do well.
``We've seen the reaction to our antibiotic free business become bigger and bigger,'' Shainsky said.
``You hear how everyone wants organic.
We'll see how well we're received.''
NEW YORK _ There was a time, not too long ago, when you were a fine pet owner as long as you fed your pet table scraps or chow, took it to the vet when necessary, and maybe bought a latex toy for it to chew on.
Today, you would border on negligence.
The pet owner of today, according to a growing number of health-conscious animal lovers, should provide organic food, nutritional supplements, interactive toys and videos, and holistic remedies such as acupuncture, massage and aromatherapy.
Over the past 15 years or so, an entire industry has sprung up to supply organic nutrition and holistic care to pets.
``Supermarket pet food is full of crap,'' says Norma Otero, the manager at Whiskers Holistic Pet Care, a 13-year-old store in the East Village.
``Would you want to eat road kill and factory byproducts?
Why would you give that to your pet?
Even a human can eat my food''.
Whiskers sells organic, all-natural pet foods.
The list of ingredients on any package of food reads like a regular grocery list: chicken, corn, carrots...
There are no chemical ingredients ending in ``-ide'' or ``-ate,'' which appear frequently on most of the lists on most processed pet foods.
Feeding a pet those processed foods all the time ``is like giving your kid Trix versus Grape Nuts or Cheerios,'' says Amy Shapiro, owner of two natural pet stores, the eight-year-old Barking Zoo in Chelsea and the newly opened Another Barking Zoo in Tribeca.
But advocates for natural pets disagree about premium brands such as Iams and Hill's Science Diet.
Barking Zoos carry them, but Whiskers does not, because they are processed.
``They do OK with that food,'' says Dr.
Roger Valentine, a Los Angeles veterinarian who specializes in cats.
``But when people switch to those premium brands after having their cat on organic food, the cats get dandruff and loose stools and hairballs and things like that''.
But Valentine says there is not enough data to say that cats on organic food are actually living longer.
Lara Strazdin, manager of public relations for Iams Co.
, isn't persuaded, either.
``We have not seen any studies that show organic foods are better than non-organic,'' she says.
``If we did see that, then honestly, we would switch''.
Iams is processed, but it considers itself all-natural, because it has no artificial preservatives, no color or flavor enhancers, and no salt or sugar.
Officials at Hill's Pet Nutrition, maker of Science Diet, did not return calls seeking comment.
But these days, the conscientious pet owner has to consider much more than food.
Owners also have an array of pet vitamins and food supplements to choose from, which aid digestion, improve the health of skin and fur, repel pests and prevent urinary, kidney and liver problems.
There are special foods for pets with injuries, diabetes, allergies or weak immune systems, and heart, kidney or gastrointestinal problems.
``There's been tremendous growth in the industry in the last 10-15 years,'' says Shapiro.
``So many people are inventing new products and gadgets.
More people are finding that the pet market is a viable marketplace''.
In part, the success of this market is braced by the strong economy.
More Americans than ever can afford extras for their pets.
In addition, people have grown more knowledgeable and open to healthy living and alternative medicine in general.
But the biggest boon to the pet industry may be the Internet.
``The Net has done wonders,'' Shapiro says.
As people have gone online to research their own health and alternative medicines in particular, pet owners have also educated themselves about pet-care options on hundreds of informational Web sites.
Many pet stores now have online outlets, so for people who don't live near a Whiskers or a Barking Zoo, natural pet supplies are just several clicks away.
But while the Internet has helped build awareness and a customer base for natural pet supplies, some store owners see a downside.
Shapiro says she appreciates the added business from her online customers, but worries that independent pet stores are getting squeezed out by big online outlets such as pets.com and petopia.com.
The local stores have one important advantage.
Pets and owners can visit them on their walks.
Inside, people can see how certain products go over with their pets before buying.
Aside from the myriad food choices, there are organic bones and treats as an alternative to rawhide, which Otero says is difficult to digest and contains bleach and glue.
There is a cat litter, World's Best, made from 100 percent kernel corn, which is recommended because it is flushable and the cat will digest it easily if it licks the litter off its paws afterward.
There are books and videos on alternative pet therapies, such as acupuncture, Chinese and Western herbology, massage, aromatherapy, color therapy and homeopathy.
So how much will it cost you to become a natural pet owner?
A lot.
A seven-pound bag of World's Best cat litter costs more than twice as much as the more mainstream Fresh Step at the Barking Zoos.
A 13-ounce can of organic dog food costs up to $3.99 at Whiskers, while a same-sized can of Friskies' Alpo costs 69 cents at RiteAid.
In the long run, ``It may be more expensive, but your pet is healthier and happier, and you'll spend less at the vet,'' says Shapiro, who owns a greyhound.
Customers agree.
``It's a big expense,'' admits Noel Canfield, who has shopped for her seven cats at Whiskers ever since it opened.
She used to buy processed cat food, but after she lost a cat to cancer, she started studying what was in the food and switched to organic.
``It's been worth it because no one's been really sick in my cat family,'' she said.
``It boosts their immune system.
I'm a nurse, and I feel like I'm being a good parent, if you will''.
In addition, she says, organic food looks and smells better.
After all, money spent on pets is really spent on owners.
People see pets as benefits to their own health.
Recent studies say pets lower stress and blood pressure.
Some hospitals are even using pet-facilitated therapies.
``People are valuing animals more than ever, and want to take care of them,'' says Canfield.
``I want them to be around as long as possible''.

CHICAGO (AP) --Europeans and Japanese don't want gene-altered crops.
Frito-Lay, McDonald's and Gerber have rejected them, too.
But grocers say American consumers don't seem to care one way or the other --at least not yet.
''It's a non-issue.
They're not even thinking about it,'' said Richard Ramsey, who runs a Piggly Wiggly supermarket in Blountstown, Fla.
''I've not heard anything,'' said Dave Eber, who manages a Marsh store in Indianapolis.
However, support for crops that produce genetically engineered food is slipping, even if a majority of consumers still back the technology, according to a poll released at the supermarket industry's annual convention, which opened Sunday.
Sixty-three percent of shoppers surveyed in January said they would be very or somewhat likely to buy a new variety of produce that had been genetically engineered to resist insect damage.
That's down from 77 percent in a similar poll four years ago.
Fifty-four percent said in January they were very or somewhat likely to buy produce that was modified to taste better or stay fresh longer, compared with 58 percent in 1996.
The new survey, conducted by Research International USA for the Food Marketing Institute, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
A summary of the poll's findings said ''consumers are less inclined to purchase these products'' than they were in 1996.
The government has approved approximately 50 varieties of genetically engineered crops, and gene-altered soybeans and corn can be found in foods throughout the supermarket.
More than half of this year's soybean crop and 20 percent of this year's corn plantings will be of biotech varieties that are resistant to a popular herbicide or insect pests.
Biotech animals, including leaner hogs and fast-growing salmon, are in development.
A few food processors, including Frito-Lay and Gerber, have stopped buying genetically engineered ingredients, citing fears about consumer resistance.
Most people, however, don't realize how widely used these so-called biotech ingredients have become, said Thomas Hoban, a North Carolina State University sociologist who tracks consumer attitudes about food.
Nearly four in 10 questioned in the January poll said they had heard nothing about biotech food.
In Europe, ''not only has the support for food and agricultural biotechnology gone down but also support for medical biotechnology.
... The U.S. is maybe overly positive.
It will swing down, maybe,'' Hoban said.
Consumers who don't want to eat biotech food are expected to provide a boost to the $6 billion-a-year organic industry.
The lone major grocery chain to reject biotech food so far is Whole Foods Market, which focuses on natural foods and stands to gain if consumers turn away from gene-altered products.
Biotech food ''is not as much of an issue nationally as it will become,'' said James Hopper, senior vice president of natural food group operations for Tree of Life Inc.
of St.
Augustine, Fla.
''People who are aware of GMOs (genetically modified organisms) and don't want to be exposed to GMOs will definitely go to organic''.
Ray Agah, who designs supermarkets for the 97-store Save Mart chain in northern California, isn't so sure.
What matters most to consumers is the price and appearance of their food, he said.
Organic food usually costs more than the conventional variety.
''They like to talk about (organic food), but they don't buy it,'' he said.
Critics of the biotech industry say there isn't enough known about the possible environmental or health risks from genetically altered plants and animals.
They have been demanding tougher testing standards and mandatory labeling of the products.
The Clinton administration last week announced several steps meant to assure the public that biotech food is safe, including a more formal process for reviewing new products.
But it said mandatory labeling was not warranted.
Food manufacturers fear such labels would scare away consumers.
PACIFIC GROVE, Calif.
(AP) --In a reversal, the government is planning to issue rules prohibiting the label ``organic'' for any food that is irradiated, genetically engineered or treated with antibiotics, a top agriculture official told farmers Thursday.
The new labeling plan responds to an outcry from farmers last year against an earlier set of rules the farmers considered too permissive.
``I'm telling you we are looking at every possible way to protect the integrity of your industry,'' said Keith Jones of the Department of Agriculture's National Organic Program.
The department is developing the first national standards on organic food labeling to replace a hodgepodge of state rules and industry guidelines.
U.S. sales of organic foods have grown by 20 percent annually for the last seven years.
In 1996, they exceeded $3.5 billion.
Once a small minority, now there are more than 10,000 U.S. farms trying to raise organic crops and livestock, the Organic Farming Research Foundation said.
Farmers have their own informal guidelines for what they call organic, which they hope will be adopted by the government.
For instance, fruits and vegetables shouldn't have pesticides, herbicides or preservatives.
Livestock should be raised in open-air environments, without antibiotics or hormones.
Last year the organic farmers defeated USDA proposals to allow irradiation, genetic engineering and sewage sludge in organic production.
The original rules also would have permitted applications of chemical sprays currently prohibited by industry groups.
Organic farmers, marketers and consumers sent more than 280,000 protest letters, prompting Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to withdraw the proposal and try again.
Jones shared key details of the department's latest proposals Thursday with the nation's largest gathering of organic farmers at the Ecological Farming Conference.
Holding a hand-drawn paper target to his chest, he conceded that the federal agency has failed the organic farmers in the past.
``It seems that in the current environment the USDA can't do anything right,'' he said.
``But I can tell you today we have a commitment to get it right''.
He got a generally sympathetic reception.
``I'm very encouraged'' by the government's promises, said Bob Anderson, who runs Walnut Acres in Penn Creek, Penn.
, and is on the National Organic Standards Board, a coalition of organic farmers.
``There's nothing like 280,000 comments to get the government's attention''.
However, some farmers were skeptical that his verbal assurances may not hold once rules are published again.
``We farmers in West Texas joke about never having seen rain but we still believe in it.
That's kind of where we are in this process,'' said Michael Sligh, representing the Campaign for Sustainable Agriculture, based in Chapel Hill, N.C.
``The ethics of organics is what separates us from others,'' said Howard-Yana Shapiro, vice president of Seeds of Change, a Santa Fe, N.M. company.
``For many of us, this is a continuation of a lifetime of work.
First it was civil rights.
Then it was anti-war.
Now it's food security.''
SANTA CRUZ, Calif.
(AP) --Consumers will pay more for food they believe to be free of pesticides and grown in an a way that protects the environment.
But can they trust it?
The growth of organic food from a fringe movement to a $5 billion nationwide industry is based mostly on trust.
When a label says ``grown and processed in accordance with the California Organic Foods Act of 1990,'' it does not necessarily mean the food is truly organic, according to the organic foods industry, farmers, inspectors and others.
Unless the food also has been independently certified, they say, it's likely no one has checked to ensure the food meets minimum state standards.
``The savvy customer knows that if it isn't certified, it isn't organic,'' said Route 1 Farms owner Jonathan Steinberg, who grows $1 million of mixed vegetables a year on 120 rented acres in Santa Cruz County and has been certified since 1982.
To sell something as organic, growers have to register with the state and pay an annual fee --from $25 for under $10,000 in sales to $2,000 for $5 million or more.
Sellers of processed foods pay just $100 for an entire line of products.
They also have to keep extensive paperwork showing the food is free from pesticides and synthetic chemicals.
But until recently, the California Department of Food and Agriculture hasn't done much more than look into complaints, which have been rare.
And the Department of Health Services, which inspects processed food, has yet to set up an organic compliance program.
``When you register with the state there are basically no on-site inspections.
They come out and say 'yup, you're organic,' end of story,'' said vegetable grower Dick Peixoto of Watsonville.
``Most customers want that assurance that you're actually being monitored''.
A federal organic law --more than a decade in the planning -- will require certification as early as this fall.
Meanwhile, most major supermarkets have acted on their own.
About 85 percent of the fruits and vegetables sold by California's 2500 registered organic growers, packers and shippers is now certified.
But most national retailers --including such natural food chains as Whole Foods Market -- still don't require certification for processed food.
With the industry growing by 20 percent a year, the state agriculture department's budget has grown to $350,000 --enough for 500 inspections this year, and for the first time, random, unannounced soil and tissue samplings, program director Ray Green said.
For now, the industry remains small enough for organic violators to be easily discovered, and by all accounts, fraud rarely occurs.
When it does, Green avoids fines or criminal charges, unless the fraud seems intentional.
One such incident involved San Diego-based Petrou Foods Inc.
, which was caught selling olive oil as organic when some of the olives were actually harvested from a golf course.
That investigation resulted in a felony conviction and $10,000 in fines.
``If someone's doing something that's not right, the whole industry learns about it.
And believe me, that can be more detrimental than anything else,'' said Margaret Wittenberg, an executive at Whole Foods.
Back then, it was a political statement; today, it's a health statement.
Middle age and affluence are hitting baby boomers at the same time, benefiting the all-natural-food industry.
Organics and natural foods are flowing into mainstream supermarkets.
Boomers remember granola and yogurt and herbal teas from their college hippie days.
And although whole foods have long had a place with the Birkenstocks and mantra crowd, today's consumer is more likely to drive a Suburban than a VW bus.
Organics and natural foods are flowing into mainstream supermarkets.
And the meaning of ``natural'' has morphed to include exotics: cheeses, butters and fish and varieties of vegetables we only read about 30 years ago.
Older, more sophisticated shoppers want to buy Saint Johnswort, but they also want to buy triple cream St.
Andre cheese.
Younger shoppers who can afford it also want it both ways: hip and healthful.
U.S. sales of organic and all-natural foods have grown by 15 percent to 25 percent annually for the past seven years.
Today, more than 10,000 U.S. farms produce organic/natural crops and livestock, according to the Organic Farming Research Foundation.
And these products are being snapped up by consumers who, in the main, make more than $50,000 a year and are 45 and older, according to SPINS, an independent natural-products information source.
When Cheerios maker General Mills rolls out an organic option to all those sugar-pumped floaters, you know organic groceries are going mainstream.
Sunrise Cereal slipped into the General Mills tide this summer, and it won't be the last of its kind, at least in marketing trials.
The steady growth of the organic market isn't the near panic-driven demand generated in the 1980s by a string of food-safety scares that included actress Meryl Streep on ``60 Minutes'' challenging the use of alar, a ripening agent.
That event led to near disaster for the apple industry.
And although the growth of the market is consistent, organics still represent a small fraction of grocery sales in the country, at least in part because of their higher prices: Whereas an increasing organic supply has narrowed the price gap between organic and conventional fare, the difference in price remains large enough to favor higher-income shoppers.
Nevertheless, grocers see a gradual greening in the diet of the American consumer.
``In the last two to three years, momentum has begun to build in the organic food area,'' Tom Thumb spokeswoman Connie Yates said in a prepared statement.
``Sales of organic foods in all categories are definitely on the increase.
By the year 2001, organic products are projected to command 5 percent of total food sales in the United States''.
``The awareness is what's rising,'' said Doug White, produce director for Minyard Food Stores' three chains: Minyard, Carnival and Sack'N Save.
None of the mainstream supermarkets has matched the certified-organic and all-natural inventory found at specialty stores such as Austin-based Whole Foods Markets, the nation's No.
1 natural-foods chain, or Boulder, Colo.-based Wild Oats Markets, or H.E.
Butt Grocery Co.'s three Central Market stores in Austin and San Antonio.
Among mainstream grocers, Tom Thumb based in Dallas was once the Metroplex leader for certified organic produce and all-natural alternatives, and Yates said its storewide organics variety has continued to expand.
Albertson's, already the Metroplex leader in overall grocery market share, has more recently taken the mainstream lead for adding varieties and carrying consistent supplies.
The Boise, Idaho-based chain's certified-organic and all-natural lineups include fresh produce, dried spices, canned and frozen foods, dairy items, snacks and other packaged items, and meats and poultry.
And Kroger's Southwest division has been revving up its own reformation _ adding 16- to 24-foot sections devoted to certified organic produce in 44 of its 62 Metroplex supermarkets since spring 1998, said Gary Huddleston, division consumer affairs manager.
Like an increasing number of competitors, Kroger is also carrying ``additive-free'' or ``all-natural'' lines of beef, chicken and pork.
``Our organic baby foods is one category doing extremely well,'' Huddleston said, citing both nonrefrigerated versions and a new frozen line of certified organic baby foods.
The New Organics Co.
based in Massachusetts has also been gradually capturing space on the canned and packaged grocery aisles of many area supermarkets.
Winn-Dixie Texas based in Fort Worth, for example, is stocking New Organics mustards, preserves and other canned and packaged foods in 45 of its 73 Texas and Oklahoma stores, said Pat West, Winn-Dixie's regional marketing director.
MORE nn The surge of organic foods into mainstream markets in North Texas can be explained in large part because of increasing numbers of suppliers: more demand, more supply.
Overall, more and more categories of organic and natural foods are becoming widely available, said Jeff Lang, Albertson's North Texas Division grocery sales manager.
Less than three years ago, Albertson's ``organic'' merchandising amounted to a few selected stores featuring maybe three to eight certified organic items in 4-foot spaces dwarfed by the produce departments.
Today, each Albertson's store _ including 113 in its North Texas Division _ carries a minimum of 25 certified organic produce items, and many locations offer 38 to 45, said Gary Barnett, the division's produce sales manager.
Those items are dispersed throughout the produce department rather than being relegated to a solitary corner.
In fact, all of Albertson's organic items are scattered throughout the store rather than being segregated into an organics section, flagged by signs identifying them as organic.
Minyard's White notes that his stores are just beginning to show a similar burgeoning variety of whole foods.
Although supply and demand vary widely from store to store, some locations in the Minyard chain carry as many as 30 to 40 certified organic produce items, as well as increasing organic options in canned, frozen and dairy foods.
The grocer, based in Coppell, Texas, is even stocking some organic produce that has yet to turn a profit.
``We're looking toward the future,'' White said of the chain's commitment to organic growth.
Which seems fairly natural.

LOS ANGELES --O.J.
Simpson's Heisman Memorial Trophy fetched $230,000 at an auction Tuesday intended to raise money for the families of his ex-wife and her friend, Ron Goldman.
The total amount raised by the sale of 74 items was $430,000, but the families of the two slaying victims will receive only about $382,000 once auction house fees and other costs are subtracted.
``The amount collected today won't even put a scratch in the $33.5 million judgment,'' said attorney Michael D.
Myers, the state court receiver appointed to oversee the liquidation of Simpson's property.
The auction was intended to partially satisfy the civil judgment owed by Simpson to the families of Goldman and his ex-wife.
A civil jury held Simpson liable for their stabbing deaths in February 1997, two years after Simpson was acquitted by a criminal jury on murder charges.
The buyer of the Heisman Trophy, an East Coast collector, did not want to be identified, said officials with the Butterfield and Butterfield auction house in Hollywood.
Bidding for the Heisman started at $75,000 and quickly rose above $200,000.
Marty Cohen of Cleveland came close to getting the trophy with a bid of $220,000, but decided to hold off when he realized that the East Coast collector would top his bid.
``I just wanted to put it in my house and let it collect dust and say, ``God!
I'm a Heisman Trophy winner,'' said Cohen, a real estate developer who last played football in the ninth grade.
Another private collector, Randy Burkett, said he also wanted a Heisman, but did not want to spend more than $100,000.
``The bidding went by us in a shot,'' he said.
Burkett did spend about $10,000 on several trophies and artwork.
``It's a part of history.
We just wanted a piece of it,'' said Burkett who came from Amarillo, Texas, for the auction of items that were seized from Simpson's Brentwood estate in March 1997 by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
The most coveted item and the last to be auctioned was the Heisman Memorial Trophy awarded to Simpson in 1968 when he was a senior at the University of Southern California.
The bronze statute, the most prestigious award in college football, is the only one ever auctioned.
``I was very pleased with the overall result (of the auction),'' said Ira M.
Friedman, who represented the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson.
``Anything is better than nothing''.
Nicole Brown Simpson's estate is expected to receive one third of the auction proceeds, while Goldman's family should receive two-thirds, Myers said.
About 500 people including a crush of media attended the auction.
Officials said they did not know if O.J.
Simpson had a representative there.
The professional football Hall of Fame Award that had been presented to Simpson went at auction for $10,000 to representatives of a computer Web site who said they plan to destroy the certificate and some Simpson football jerseys on Wednesday to protest failings in the criminal justice system.
``We're going to destroy this O.J.
Simpson property on the steps of the L.A.
(Criminal) Courthouse (Wednesday) at noon,'' said Bob Enyart, a representative of the Web site, shadowgov.com of Denver.
Enyart said the group, which spent $4,750 for two football jerseys, had planned for two weeks to buy and destroy these items.
Jeff Mohr, 43, of North Hollywood said it appeared many people were drawn to the auction by morbid curiosity.
``You have a lot of people who bid from the heart and not the mind,'' said Mohr, a U.S.
Postal Service worker and collector.
``You can't get a hold of O.J., but you can stand next to O.J.'s Heisman,'' Mohr said.
Indeed some of the items went for far more than their estimated value, especially the football jerseys and golf bags.
The Simpson golf bags with clubs went on average for about $2,200.
A simple white football jersey with red stripes and the number 32 estimated to be worth at least $400 went for $4,500.
A Hall of Fame commemorative football valued at $200 to $300 went for $2,250.
Most of the artwork also brought high bids.
A Tiffany-style leaded glass lamp shade valued at $600 to $900 went for $7,000.

LOS ANGELES (AP) --O.J.
Simpson has lost a bid to block broadcast of a TV miniseries he claims would reveal his defense team secrets to an audience of millions.
After reading the script, Superior Court Judge David Yaffe refused to issue a preliminary injunction Wednesday.
The judge said he was unconvinced the broadcast of ''American Tragedy'' would harm Simpson because most of the material already appeared in the 1996 best-selling book on which it is based.
''There's just no necessity'' for an injunction, the judge said, noting that Simpson can collect damages later if he wins his lawsuit claiming Lawrence Schiller, who co-wrote the book and directed the miniseries, and Robert Kardashian, Simpson's former defense lawyer, violated privacy contracts and published confidential material.
''We're very pleased, of course,'' said Gary Bostwick, a lawyer representing Project 95, the movie's producer, and Schiller.
Simpson lawyer Terry Gross of San Francisco said an appeal was being considered.
However, both sides admit they are unlikely to get an appeal judgment before the miniseries' Nov.
12 air date.
No trial date has been set for the lawsuit.
Like the book, the miniseries focuses on the tensions and strategies of the legal ''dream team'' that won Simpson's acquittal in the 1994 slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.
Simpson was found liable for the killings in a later civil trial and ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.
LOS ANGELES (AP) --O.J.
Simpson will go on the Internet next week to field questions from the public and try once again to convince America that he didn't kill his ex-wife and her friend.
''I'm not opposed to talking to the public about my case,'' he said Tuesday.
''Most of them don't know the facts of my case.
When I talk to them there's usually a 180-degree change in attitude.
''My guilt was established in the public eye, not in the courtroom.
It was established in the media,'' Simpson said in a phone interview from Florida, which will soon be his new home.
He said he plans to lease a house in the Miami area where he will live with his two younger children.
Simpson was acquitted of murder in a criminal trial but was found liable for the deaths in a subsequent civil trial and was ordered to pay the victims' families $33.5 million.
He said his two-hour stint on the Internet on July 27 will take place in Tampa, the headquarters of Entertainment Network Inc.
, the company sponsoring the event.
He said he will receive no payment for his participation except a pledge from the company to contribute money to his three favorite charities.
Those who sign on to his ''chat room'' will pay a fee to talk with him.
Simpson said he didn't know how much it would cost to log on, how much was going to charity or the address for the Web chat.
A spokesman for Entertainment Network Inc.
did not return a call for comment.
He said those with the right computer equipment will be able to see and hear him.
Others will receive answers typed in by a stenographer present in the room with him.
Simpson said the company sponsoring the two-hour chat has become known for its voyeuristic Web sites in which people can look in on places such as college dorms.
He expects that some will sign on just to berate him, but said he's become used to that and is confident he can get people to listen to his side of the story.
Simpson, who insists he is innocent, said he still receives tips about possible leads in the case and hopes the Internet site may attract people with helpful information.
As for his move to Florida, he said he had wanted to move there for the past 10 years, even before his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ronald Goldman were slain in June 1994.
Had it not been for a prolonged custody battle over his children, he said he would have relocated earlier.
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) --A civil jury found former American football star O.J.
Simpson liable for the wrongful death of his ex-wife and her friend, according to television report from Santa Monica, California on Tuesday.
Simpson, 49, was acquitted in October 1995 in the criminal trial for the slashing murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman, but the victims' relatives filed a civil wrongful death suit against him, seeking monetary damages.
The jury ordered him to pay 8.5 million U.S. dollars in compensatory damages and will return Thursday to decide whether to award millions more in punitive damages.
Earlier Tuesday, the jury in the wrongful death suit was read back statements by several witnesses, including testimony pertaining to Simpson's whereabouts on the evening of June 12 1994, when Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman were killed outside her home.
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) --Former football star O.J.
Simpson's house was sold at auction today for 2.63 million U.S. dollars to the bank that had foreclosed on it.
The sale was held outside the courthouse in Los Angeles suburban Norwalk.
Bidding opened at 1,875,000 dollars.
Patrick Dobiesz, representing lender Hawthorne Savings, opened the bidding.
Four times, another bidder added one dollar to the pot.
By buying the property, Hawthorne Savings can sell it privately for a much higher price.
It also eliminates any excess money that would have been used to pay part of a 33.5 million dollars civil judgment against Simpson.
Although Simpson was acquitted of murder during a criminal trial, he was found liable for the killings in a wrongful death trial that ended earlier this year.
The 6,200-square-foot home in Los Angeles' wealthy Brentwood section, which Simpson has lived in for 20 years, has six baths, a tennis court, waterfalls and an Olympic-size swimming pool.
It was unclear how quickly Simpson would have to move out.
He said he will remain in the home with his two youngest children for a while, hoping to find another residence in Brentwood by this fall.
LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The U.S. federal tax agency wants the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson to pay dlrs 6.5 million in taxes, a claim based on a dlrs 12 million civil judgment against O.J.
Simpson that was never paid, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.
Brown said Wednesday he is appealing the Internal Revenue Service demand, which was made in September, because ex-football star O.J.
Simpson has ``not paid one penny'' of the dlrs 12 million wrongful-death judgment against him.
``There's been no money collected, and no basis for that lien.
So we said, `IRS, you're nuts,''' said Louis H.
Brown, Ms.
Simpson's father and administrator of her trust.
The estate, created to support the Simpsons' two children, petitioned the U.S.
Tax Court in Washington last week to intervene after failing to reach an agreement with IRS officials, Brown said.
IRS spokeswoman Laurie Kellerman said the agency is seeking to collect dlrs 6.5 million in estate taxes, but declined to comment further.
Lawyers for Simpson also declined comment.
O.J. Simpson was ordered to pay dlrs 33.5 million to the estates and heirs of Ms.
Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
The two were knifed to death June 12, 1994.
Simpson was acquitted of murder, but a civil jury found him liable for the deaths and awarded the victims' families dlrs 33.5 million in damages.
LOS ANGELES (AP) --Is America ready to welcome O.J.
Simpson back as a commercial spokesman?
A lawyer referral service thinks so, and the company has videotaped him making a pitch for legal representation.
Simpson, the former spokesman for Hertz and other companies, said he made the appearance on behalf of Justice Media as a favor to a friend and because he believes in the rights of all defendants to have adequate legal representation.
He said he was paid only enough to cover his expenses.
Simpson said the proposal interested him because it is aimed at minority defendants.
``The main thing I have learned is you can't walk into a courtroom without competent legal representation,'' Simpson said in a telephone interview Wednesday with The Associated Press.
The football Hall of Famer said he was grateful he had the money to hire the best lawyers in the business to represent him at his 1994 criminal trial.
He was acquitted on charges of murdering ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman after a trial with a defense focused on racism and alleged misconduct by the Los Angeles Police Department.
Simpson was found liable for the deaths of Ms.
Simpson and Goldman in a separate civil trial and was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.
Any income he receives can be seized by the estate of Ms.
Simpson and the Goldman family to satisfy the judgment.
Some wonder if a referral from Simpson would help a lawyer's business.
``The message is not bad, but people may have problems with the messenger,'' said Laurie Levenson, associate dean of Loyola University Law School.
``Assuming they are targeting an African-American audience, it's still iffy,'' she said.
``And it's kind of sad.
Isn't there anybody else in the African-American community who can speak out for justice''?
Simpson said he has been following a number of recent cases in which defendants convicted long ago were released from prison.
``These people lost years of their lives,'' Simpson said.
``If any of them had the money to properly defend themselves, maybe they wouldn't have had to spend any time in jail''.
``I was innocent,'' he said, ``but what if I had had to wait 16 years to be vindicated''?
He acknowledged a lot of people are convinced he is guilty but said that reflects a public unwillingness to believe that police do bad things.
Asked if he has any new evidence that might help convince the public of his innocence, he said, ``I'm working on it.''
LOS ANGELES (AP) --Six years ago this summer, O.J.
Simpson was a defendant in the most-watched murder case in American history.
Viewers sat glued to their TV sets as the saga unfolded in what would be dubbed the Trial of the Century.
Now, a TV miniseries is reproducing the experience and exposing audiences to what they didn't see during the yearlong trial: behind-the-scenes battles and strategy sessions by the defense ''dream team'' which won Simpson's acquittal.
It will air on CBS in November unless O.J.
Simpson is able to stop it.
Simpson sent his lawyers to court this month seeking a preliminary injunction to halt production on ''American Tragedy''.
So far, his 11th-hour legal bid has been futile.
A judge refused to issue an injunction, saying he'd look at the script and revisit the matter.
With luck, production will be completed by the time Simpson's suit gets back to court on Sept.
6. What is this movie and why does Simpson want to shut it down?
A visit to the soundstage in North Hollywood is an adventure in deja vu.
Actors bear an eerie resemblance to Marcia Clark, Robert Shapiro and Superior Court Judge Lance Ito, among others.
The courtroom where the case was tried has been duplicated in every detail including floral arrangements that often decorated the judge's bench.
The guiding hand behind the production is Lawrence Schiller, who wrote the book ''American Tragedy'' with James Willwerth based on information from his ''mole'' on the defense team, lawyer Robert Kardashian.
Schiller is directing from a script written by Pulitzer Prize-winner Norman Mailer, and he has assembled a top notch cast headed by Ving Rhames as Johnnie Cochran Jr.
, Christopher Plummer as F.
Lee Bailey and Ron Silver as Robert Shapiro.
Schiller, who collaborated with Simpson on a jailhouse book, ''I Want to Tell You,'' recently directed another miniseries from his book ''Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,'' a recounting of the Jon Benet Ramsey murder case.
''American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story of the Simpson Defense,'' published in 1996, was controversial from the start: Lawyers felt it invaded Simpson's attorney-client privilege of confidentiality.
Eight members of the defense filed affidavits last week saying they had been misled into giving interviews to Schiller.
But the author's lawyers pointed out that no one took legal action until the miniseries was nearly completed.
Schiller says neither Simpson nor anyone else was promised prior approval on the book or script.
Cochran and Shapiro have met with the actors portraying them, he said.
''This story isn't about O.J.
Simpson. It's about the lawyers,'' Schiller said in an interview.
''The public doesn't know what took place behind closed doors, how the defense dealt with the evidence, how they pushed the envelope in the court system.
To me, that is more interesting than anything else''.
Although a Simpson ''body double'' sits at the counsel table during filming of court sessions, his is not a speaking role.
A Simpson voice is occasionally heard on an intercom talking to his lawyers during their meetings.
Segments of actual trial footage will be seen in the miniseries.
The actors have spent many hours immersing themselves in trial history, reading books and watching hours of trial videotape.
Most of them were avid fans of the televised trial.
''Of course I watched the trial.
It was the hottest show in town,'' said Plummer.
''One is not particularly proud of having watched it.
It was sort of the fascination of watching a snake''.
But the actor, who recently played Mike Wallace in the movie, ''the Insider,'' said the chance to play the legendary F.
Lee Bailey was irresistible, and he found the miniseries much more than ''a ghastly replay of the trial''.
''It's about the defense team and the quite amazing ego challenges involved,'' he said.
The challenges of playing Bailey included a physical transformation for Plummer, whose body was padded and his face altered by a rubber mask.
''He's a wonderful character,'' said Plummer.
''He represents the high-flown old school of lawyering, the old man, the curmudgeon.
I'm sure he loves his drink and I do too, so I sympathize''.
Ron Silver, who bears a striking resemblance to Shapiro, added thick eyebrows and shaved a bald spot on the back of his head.
Silver has met with Shapiro more than once but said the lawyer claims never to have read Schiller's book.
''I've read Bob's book and I've talked to other people about him,'' said Silver, who concluded that Shapiro laid the groundwork for a brilliant defense but was forced to the sidelines by others.
''Once the trial started, he became quite marginalized,'' said Silver.
''Everyone had their agendas.
But his obligation to his client kept him there''.
If the movie hews to the book, it will not take a position on whether Simpson was truly innocent of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman.
Simpson was acquitted in criminal court and later found liable in civil court.
''I don't know what the truth is,'' both Plummer and Silver said separately.
But one cast member said he became convinced that truth was never the aim.
''This thing about the search for the truth is laughable,'' said Bruno Kirby, who plays attorney Barry Scheck.
''In a courtroom, it's about winning.
Both sides are there to win...
I hope this (movie) makes people look at the system and see that it needs work''.

AN ACTOR'S TALE: ''Becoming Dick,'' E!
Entertainment Television's second original TV movie, takes a comic look at a struggling actor who discovers a formula for success --being a heel -- and then learns success isn't all it's cracked up to be.
The movie, debuting 9 p.m.

LOS ANGELES (AP) --Is there an agreement for O.J.
Simpson to keep custody of his two youngest children?
Simpson's lawyer says yes.
Their grandfather says no.
The children's lawyer thinks so, and Simpson isn't commenting.
Sydney, 13, and 10-year-old Justin Simpson, the children of Simpson and his slain ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, have been at the center of a custody battle between their father and their mother's parents.
Ms. Simpson's father, Lou Brown, insisted Tuesday that no custody agreement had been reached and was angry at Simpson's lawyer for talking about the negotiations to The Associated Press.
``I don't know why the attorney was discussing it,'' he said.
``It's supposed to be confidential''.
Simpson's lawyer, Bernard Leckie, said Monday that an agreement giving custody to Simpson was ready to be signed.
Simpson refused to comment and seemed distressed that his lawyer was discussing the matter publicly.
Asked what was holding up resolution of the children's custody, Brown said, ``It depends on him,'' referring to Simpson and adding: ``He's out of town''.
Marjorie Fuller, the attorney representing the children, said Tuesday she has not been involved in the negotiations but believes an agreement is close.
``My job is to hang back and let Mr.
Simpson and the Browns work it out,'' she said.
``But as far as I know, everybody's been working real hard on an agreement and it was waiting to be signed''.
The Brown family lawyer, Kimberly Knill, did not return a phone call.
The children, who live with Simpson, often visit Brown and his wife, Juditha.
The Browns lost their first custody suit, but the California Supreme Court ruled in February the case could be retried.
Leckie said Monday that everyone agreed ``it's in the best interest of the children that this not be dragged out through the courts any further''.
Simpson was acquitted of the 1994 murders of Ms.
Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
But he was held liable in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the Brown and Goldman families, who were awarded $33.5 million.
NEW YORK (AP) --Loud cheers from a studio audience greeted Barbara Walters' announcement Monday that she has canceled a scheduled appearance by O.J.
Simpson this week on her syndicated talk show, ''The View''.
Several viewers, members of the show's production staff and all four of her co-hosts had told her they were uncomfortable having Simpson as a guest, she said.
''Mr. Simpson will not appear on our program,'' Walters said.
Simpson's appearance, scheduled for Wednesday, was to promote his participation in a two-hour Internet ''chat'' session on Thursday where members of the public can pay a fee to ask him questions.
Simpson was acquitted of murder in a criminal trial but was found liable in a subsequent civil trial for the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.
He was ordered to pay the victims' families $33.5 million.
Walters said she and her co-executive producer, Bill Geddie, made the decision to cancel the booking.
''Although on 'The View' Bill Geddie and I encourage differences of opinion among us --we can't stop it and indeed we love it -- there was more serious concern about having Mr.
Simpson on the program from all of you at this table,'' she said.
She was surrounded by her co-hosts, Meredith Vieira, Joy Behar, Star Jones and Lisa Ling.
Vieira joined in the audience's cheers by pounding the table after Walters' announcement.
Behar chose to make a joke: ''As Johnnie Cochran says, if the guy's a schnook, you must unbook''.
Simpson is making other television appearances ahead of his Internet ''chat'' session, including interviews Tuesday on NBC's ''Today'' and with Paula Zahn on Fox News Channel.
A Fox News Channel spokesman said Simpson's representatives asked to see questions they would be asked on the show in advance but were refused.
Goldman's father, Fred, went on Fox News Channel last week to encourage television networks not to have Simpson as a guest.
LOS ANGELES (AP) --O.J.
Simpson memorabilia went up in flames to a chorus of cheers and boos Wednesday, a day after it was sold at auction to help pay off the $33.5 million judgment he owes in the deaths of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend.
Two No.
32 football jerseys and a Professional Football Hall of Fame induction certificate were burned and two trophies were smashed outside the Criminal Courts Building in a protest organized by a Christian radio talk show host who purchased $16,000 worth of items.
The auction Tuesday raised $430,000, including $255,500 for Simpson's Heisman Trophy.
``We are destroying O.J.
Simpson's property in front of the L.A. courthouse because the criminal justice system is destroying justice before our very eyes,'' protest organizer Bob Enyart of Denver said.
The destruction was criticized by some spectators at the downtown courthouse and by Simpson, who said it was a waste.
``I wonder about the mentality involved in this,'' Simpson said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
``The guy's burning up $16,000 he could use to fight AIDS or help kids with cancer or even donate to battered (women's) homes''.
Several hundred spectators booed and cheered at the destruction of the items, which included jerseys from the University of Southern California and the National Football League's Buffalo Bills and two 1973 ``Lifesaver'' trophies apparently given for charity contributions.
The Heisman was the auction's big item and was not part of Wednesday's demonstration.
The winning bid of $255,500 came from an anonymous East Coast collector.
Money raised by the court-ordered auction goes to the estate of Ms.
Simpson and Ronald Goldman's family.
A jury made the award in a wrongful death lawsuit that followed Simpson's acquittal on criminal charges in the 1994 killings.
Simpson is appealing the judgment.
Also auctioned off were football awards, artwork, Tiffany-style lamps and a fox fur coat that belonged to Simpson's first wife, Marguerite.
The prices surprised some collectors because Simpson sports memorabilia hasn't been selling well.
``Most people don't want to have anything to do with O.J.
Simpson. There's a real sour taste in their mouths,'' said Scott Welkowsky, owner of Out of This World Memorabilia in Orange County.
WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif.
(AP) --Potential bidders expressed qualms about buying O.J.
Simpson's seized possessions as they viewed the collection in advance of Tuesday night's auction.
``I find the whole thing a little bit sad, to take away the Heisman Trophy,'' said Gary Nickerson of Los Angeles, who came to view another auction lot but stopped by the Simpson display on Friday.
``If I were a friend of his I'd buy it back for him''.
Simpson's 1968 trophy, the most prestigious award in college football, is the most valuable item to be auctioned.
The catalog noted, as did viewers, that the word ``athletic'' is misspelled as ``atletic'' on the trophy's plaque.
Auction officials, who will be taking bids on site and via the Internet, were unwilling to predict a price on the trophy.
``It's the only Heisman ever to be offered at auction,'' said Michael Schwartz, director of entertainment memorabilia for the Butterfield and Butterfield auction house.
The trophy and other possessions were seized from Simpson's home at the behest of lawyers representing the families of his slain ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.
They won a civil wrongful death suit after Simpson was acquitted of the murders in criminal court.
Among viewers who showed up for the preview was Alfred Beardsley, a longtime collector of Simpson memorabilia, who said he would be bidding even though, ``I feel like I'm paying a ransom''.
He said he objects to the auction of Simpson's possessions to help satisfy the $33.5 million civil court judgment against him.
``It bothers me that I'm putting money in the Goldman and Brown pockets,'' Beardsley said.
``I believe he's not responsible for this crime, and I think there are a lot of people who believe that''.
Among items displayed in a small corner of the auction gallery were numerous engraved plaques, cups and bowls awarded to Simpson during his athletic career; golf clubs and bags; three of his No.
32 football jerseys; oriental carpets; paintings and Tiffany-style lamps.
The only personal item of clothing was a fox fur coat once owned by Simpson's first wife, Marguerite.
LOS ANGELES (AP) --O.J.
Simpson will take a lie detector test if someone puts up a $3 million reward to catch his ex-wife's killer, defense attorney F.
Lee Bailey announced on CNN's ''Larry King Live'' Wednesday night.
If Simpson passes the test, the reward money would be put in a trust fund and paid out for information about the crime.
If he fails, the letter of credit pledging the money will be dissolved, Bailey said.
The results will be made public either way.
''It'll be publicly seen, win, lose or draw,'' said the famed defense attorney, who represented Simpson at his trial.
''O.J.'s not trying to make O.J. rich.
He's trying to get enough money out there to smoke someone out,'' Bailey told King from West Palm Beach, Fla.
On Monday, the former football player told The Associated Press that he never has taken a lie-detector test but was hooked up briefly to a polygraph machine to see how it worked.
Bailey on Friday had said during a Florida hearing where his license to practice law is being challenged that he suggested Simpson be stopped from completing a lie-detector test after the slayings.
Simpson was acquitted of criminal charges in the 1994 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman.
However, he was found liable for their wrongful deaths in a subsequent civil trial and was ordered to pay the victims' families $33.5 million.
King also had Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, on the program.
Goldman said he hopes ''no one is stupid enough to give money...
so he (Simpson) can smile at the world and claim he's innocent again.''
SAN FRANCISCO _ O.J.
Simpson wants to stop an upcoming television miniseries about the defense in his murder case, saying its purported revelations are the product of a lawyer's breach of legal confidentiality and an author's breach of promise.
Simpson filed suit Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court against his former friend and lawyer, Robert Kardashian, and author Lawrence Schiller, whose 1996 book ``American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story of the Simpson Defense'' is the basis of the series now being filmed for CBS Television for airing in November.
Both men denied the wrongdoing alleged by Simpson.
Judge David Yaffe declined to issue a restraining order that would have immediately barred Schiller from working on the miniseries, but scheduled a hearing Sept.
6 on a request for a preliminary injunction that would accomplish the same purpose.
The suit also seeks return of any profits Schiller and Kardashian made by violating Simpson's rights.
``This action is about the avaricious disregard of the attorney-client relationship, and of promises of confidentiality, by an attorney and a writer who value the fame and fortune to be derived from publishing information about a sensational trial more than adhering to their ethical obligations and contractual agreements,'' Terry Gross, a lawyer representing Simpson, said in court papers.
Gross alleged that Schiller had gained the cooperation of Simpson and eight of his lawyers for the book project by promising, falsely, that Simpson would be allowed to review the manuscript before publication and remove any confidential material.
The lawsuit also accused Kardashian, a member of Simpson's defense team, of divulging conversations and defense secrets to Schiller in violation of a lawyer's legal duty to keep confidential all information learned during the attorney-client relationship.
Schiller, who wrote the book with journalist James Willwerth, initially described Kardashian as co-author and wound up paying him a fee, the lawsuit said.
The State Bar last month said it had privately reprimanded Kardashian for professional misconduct and ordered him, with his agreement, not to practice law for two years.
The disciplinary action was in response to Simpson's allegations, his lawyers said.
In reply to the lawsuit, Schiller and Kardashian denied making any promises to Simpson about the book or miniseries and also said Simpson should have sued before the book was published in 1996.
Gross said Simpson had not sued then because he was tied up in a civil damage suit.
Gross also said the miniseries had large amounts of confidential information that was not in the book.
Schiller, who is directing the TV production, said the content was virtually the same.
A Los Angeles jury acquitted Simpson in 1995 of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman.
A civil jury in Orange County, however, later found the former football star responsible for their deaths in a suit by the victims' families.
One of the last scenes of Schiller's book portrays Kardashian, Simpson's longtime friend, as doubting his innocence, despite the acquittal.
LOS ANGELES (AP) --Nicole Brown Simpson's sister and her lawyer said Monday they are asking the state attorney general to investigate the possibility of filing perjury charges against O.J.
Simpson before a statute of limitations runs out in three months.
Denise Brown and attorney Gloria Allred said Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti has taken no action on similar requests made to him.
Allred and Brown said that Simpson lied during his civil trial when he testified that he never hit, struck slapped or kicked his late wife.
District Attorney's spokeswoman Victoria Pipkin would say only that ``the matter is still under investigation''.
In the civil trial, Simpson was held liable for the 1994 deaths of Ms.
Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman and was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.
In an earlier criminal trial he was acquitted of murder.
Simpson could not be reached by telephone for comment.
LOS ANGELES (AP) --There is no agreement yet on the custody of O.J.
Simpson's younger children, their grandfather said Tuesday, contradicting statements from Simpson's lawyer that he would retain custody.
Lou Brown, the father of Simpson's slain ex-wife, said, ``Nothing has been agreed upon.
... There is no agreement.
I can't say anything else''.
Simpson's lawyer, Bernard Leckie, told The Associated Press on Monday that an agreement giving custody to Simpson was ready to be signed.
``I don't know why the attorney was discussing it,'' Brown said.
``It's supposed to be confidential''.
Brown's lawyer did not return a phone call seeking comment.
Simpson was out of town and couldn't be reached.
The children, Justin, 10, and Sydney, 13, live with Simpson.
Brown and his wife, Juditha, sued for custody and lost until an appeals court interceded.
The California Supreme Court ruled in February the custody case could go back to court for another trial.
But Leckie said Monday that Simpson would keep custody of the children in a settlement with the Browns.
LOS ANGELES (AP) --The man who paid $255,500 for O.J.
Simpson's Heisman Trophy was identified Thursday as a Philadelphia sheet metal dealer who said he wanted to impress his girlfriend.
Tom ``Juice'' Kriessman, 47, showed up at an auction house to collect the trophy, which was awarded to Simpson in 1968 when he was a star at the University of Southern California.
Kriessman bought the prize anonymously at a court-ordered auction of Simpson memorabilia Tuesday.
``One of the first reasons was I wanted to impress my girlfriend,'' Kriessman said.
``It represents the story of a man who rose to be a superstar and lost it all overnight.
I bought it for everything it represents: The trial of the century, O.J.'s whole career, what happened --you know, the tragedy that was his life.
I just think in the future it's going to be worth a lot of money''.
Kriessman was given the same nickname as Simpson when he played rough touch football in his 20s in Philadelphia.
His girlfriend, whom Kriessman didn't identify, apparently wasn't the only one impressed by the trophy.
``Everybody's been calling,'' he said.
``Seems everybody wants to touch it, everybody wants to be photographed with it''.
Kriessman is the co-owner of Triad Steel Inc, a 10-year-old company that buys and sells sheet metal.
Partner Edward O'Brien said Triad has annual sales of about $20 million.
The auction raised $430,000 to help pay off the $33.5 million a jury ordered Simpson to pay when it held him liable for the slayings of his ex-wife and her friend Ron Goldman.
Kriessman also bought a couple of jerseys and a glass trophy, but the Heisman was the top-ticket item.
Kriessman, a Philadelphia Eagles fan, said he has never met Simpson.
Asked if he would like to hear from the former Buffalo Bills star and perhaps pose with him and the Heisman, he said: ``I'd have to think about it.''
UNDATED --Say two little letters, get a big response -- everything from anger that O.J.
Simpson remains in the public eye, to pride that the justice system finally worked for a black man.
Why is it that six years after the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, nearly five years after O.J.
Simpson's acquittal, more than three years after a jury found him responsible for the deaths in a civil trial, the case still evokes visceral emotions?
Is it Simpson himself?
Just this week he's sparked controversy by appearing on the ``Today'' show to promote his latest venture (www.askoj.com) --and by not being a guest on ``The View,'' after fans of that talk show protested his scheduled appearance.
Or is it the classic chicken-and-egg conundrum?
Do the news and entertainment media cover O.J. because the public remains fascinated, or is the public fascinated because the news and entertainment media cover him?
Even experts differ.
``I'm bored with the subject, and my students are.
They yawn when I bring it up,'' said Frankie Bailey, a University of Albany specialist in media and criminal justice in popular culture.
``I know the media are still interested.
People may just be dragged along behind the media''.
Darnell M.
Hunt disagrees.
``I don't think the case will ever be NOT interesting,'' said Hunt, director of African-American studies and an associate sociology professor at University of Southern California.
``People will always be somewhat titillated by it''.
To Joshua Meyrowitz, professor of communication at the University of New Hampshire, it's ``shortcut journalism.
That's the reason why O.J. and others like JonBenet Ramsey and Elian Gonzalez keep popping up''.
He added, ``It's not so much (that) the public is interested, it's that journalists and journalistic institutions have figured out how simple it is to report these cases.
It doesn't require research, or understanding of complex issues''.
Meanwhile, on the World Wide Web, the 645 members of one O.J. newsgroup (alt.fan.oj-simpson) still debate, every day, the minutiae of his guilt or innocence.
They even have labels for their split, the ``No-J's'' and the ``Pro-J's''.
The 1,272 topics include everything from the gruesome (``Nicole, whose trachea was severed, did not even aspirate a single drop of blood'')... to the mundane (``Kato saw the golf bag about 10:55 p.m. outside the front door, when Simpson was still in the house'')...
One member is Betty Parker, 60, a General Motors retiree in Trenton, N.J.
She's pondered, or researched, or written on, or read about the case ``from Day One,'' she said, and continues to do so.
At the outset, ``I didn't even like O.J.,'' Parker said.
``But I started watching, and I found myself thinking, `That's strange,''' about so many details.
The bloody glove, for instance.
``Why would a killer leave that behind at the scene''?
Or Simpson's injured finger.
``If he was in a life-and-death struggle he would have practically sliced it off, but it was just a tiny cut''.
For Parker, such nagging questions never have been answered, and in their wake is a different America.
``As an African American, I feel my people are being punished for taking this (innocent) position,'' she said.
``There are people in board rooms making decisions, who are still embittered over the O.J.
Simpson verdict.
And those decisions are their retribution''.
USC's Hunt, author of ``O.J.
Simpson Facts and Fictions: News Rituals in the Construction of Reality,'' agreed that race is a prime reason why Simpson remains a flash point.
``I think the case might be seen as a giant Rorschach test,'' he said.
The trials forced America to consider three hot-button topics simultaneously, Hunt said: --Race, as Simpson is black and Nicole was white.
--Gender, with the allegations of domestic abuse.
--And class, with his wealth enabling Simpson to hire a ``dream team'' of attorneys.
``And those are issues we continue to wrestle with,'' Hunt added.
Once again, however, there's disagreement.
``The people I encounter, the subject of O.J. just never comes up,'' said Bailey from the University of Albany.
``I think by this time, most people have reached their own conclusions about the case''.
One thing isn't in dispute: that O.J.
Simpson is a permanent fixture in American society.
``He's outspoken, he continues to talk about it,'' Bailey said.
``As an academic, I'll be interested to see how many hits he gets on his new Web site''.
Will Simpson ever be able to stroll down a street and not evoke a response?
``Oh, absolutely not,'' Hunt said.
``I just can't see it.
Until he dies, he'll be a symbol of where we are as a society.''
LOS ANGELES _ O.J.
Simpson's appeal of the $33.5 million judgment against him provoked bitter, angry reactions from the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.
Denise Brown, Nicole's sister, said Friday the family responded to news of the appeal by stripping the name ``Simpson'' from the Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation, which helps victims of domestic violence.
``This foundation is not about Mr.
Simpson,'' she said.
Fred Goldman, the father of Ronald Goldman, called the appeal ``further proof positive that this monster doesn't want to be held responsible for his actions''.
Golfing in Louisiana, Simpson said the appeal was his fundamental right.
``I think in America, justice is supposed to be fair and it's supposed to be blind,'' Simpson told reporters, ``and public opinion or certain prejudices are not supposed to count.
You're supposed to go by the law and I don't think any person involved in the law who looked at that trial and looked at some of the rulings would say it was legal''.
Goldman contends that Simpson has become adept at shielding his income from the Goldman family as they try to collect on the huge judgment.
For instance, Goldman said Simpson recently granted a paid interview to a German television station and asked the station to pay the money to a third party.
``We'll continue to chase him and file suit against those he fraudulently conveys money to,'' Goldman said.
In February 1997, a civil jury found Simpson liable for the stabbing deaths of Ronald Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson.
The appeal, filed 17 months after that verdict, could take months or even years to resolve.
In 1995, a criminal jury acquitted Simpson of murder charges.
Simpson's attorneys filed the 96-page appeal last week with the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, labeling the civil trial ``fundamentally tainted by several erroneous evidentiary rulings''.
The former football star's attorneys said the judge should have excluded evidence that Simpson had a history of violence against his former wife.
They also said the judge's rulings thwarted their efforts to prove then-Officer Mark Fuhrman of the Los Angeles Police Department planted a bloody glove at Simpson's estate.
The brief criticizes the inclusion of several civil trial witnesses, including a veterinary clinic worker who claims she saw the couple fight over a fur coat, and a former security guard who testified Simpson smashed a windshield and dented a Mercedes-Benz coupe with a baseball bat in a jealous rage.
Peter Gelblum, one of the Goldmans' attorneys, predicted the appeal wouldn't have much success.
``It's the same issues we litigated twice already in the trial court,'' he said.
``Once a batterer, always a batterer,'' he said.
``He was liable for murdering Nicole and Ron''.
The Goldmans' attorneys said they will continue to pursue Simpson's assets.
Later this year they plan to auction off his Heisman Trophy, Gelblum said.
Los Angeles attorney Nathanial Friedman, who successfully sued Charles Manson on behalf of the family of one of Manson's victims, called Simpson's appeal ``an absolutely outrageous abuse of the taxpayer-supported court system of California''.
``His guilt is so self-evident that any reasonable person says he would have emigrated to Brazil or Mozambique or some other place if he had the slightest shred of decency,'' Friedman said.
CORAL GABLES, Fla.
(AP) --O.J.
Simpson's children have enrolled in an exclusive South Florida private school and he asked the media to leave them alone.
Standing on the driveway of Gulliver Academy, Simpson said Thursday he's proud that his 14-year-old daughter, Sydney, and 12-year-old son, Justin, passed the school's rigorous entrance exams and are beginning classes.
They were not present at his news conference.
The academy charges $13,000 annually, has an average class size of 14 students and sends almost all of its graduates to college.
The children of Gov.
Jeb Bush and singers Julio Iglesias and Gloria Estefan have attended the school.
''My major concern was the education of my kids,'' Simpson said.
''The two key things to raising kids is to make sure that they know they are loved and make sure that they got a first-class education''.
Simpson, 53, has had custody of his children for four years, since shortly after he was acquitted of murdering their mother --his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson -- and her friend Ronald Goldman.
A civil jury later found him responsible for their 1994 deaths, awarding their families $33.5 million.
Simpson said he's in the middle of moving from Los Angeles to South Florida, renting a house for now in an undisclosed location.
He said he is seeking a home near the school.
NAPLES, Fla.
(AP) --Days after O.J.
Simpson's ex-wife and a man were stabbed to death, the football star underwent a polygraph test that F.
Lee Bailey says he stopped because it was not going well.
Bailey said Friday, during testimony in a Florida courtroom where his license to practice law is being challenged, that shortly after the June 1994 slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman he received a telephone call from Los Angeles defense attorney Robert Shapiro.
Bailey, who has said he is an expert on polygraph examinations, said Shapiro wanted his advice about a polygraph test of Simpson in progress that was not going well.
Bailey said he told Shapiro that was because it was too emotional a time for Simpson.
''I said shut the test down, you have to let him settle down,'' said Bailey, who was eventually part of Simpson's legal team.
Bailey said he advised Shapiro that if Simpson was to take a polygraph examination it should only include questions about Goldman's death.
Bailey said Shapiro took the test results and no one has seen them since.
He said Shapiro has said he doesn't have the test results.
Bailey did not elaborate further on the polygraph episode.
Messages left for Shapiro Sunday afternoon were not immediately returned.
Simpson has said he never took a polygraph test, but was hooked up to the machine to see how it worked.
In the civil case against Simpson, lawyers for the Goldman family alleged that Simpson failed a polygraph test shortly after the slayings.
Simpson was acquitted of criminal charges in the deaths but the civil jury found him liable for the crimes.
He was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.
The accounting of the polygraph incident in the Simpson case came in Bailey's lengthy accounting of how his time was spent defending another client, international drug trafficker Claude Duboc.
Bailey is accused of misappropriating millions of dollars of stock Duboc held in a pharmaceutical company to pay Bailey's legal expenses.
LOS ANGELES (AP) --O.J.
Simpson will keep custody of his two young children in a settlement with the parents of his slain ex-wife, his lawyer said Monday.
The agreement, which still requires the signatures of Lou and Juditha Brown, heads off a second trial over the custody of 13-year-old Sydney and Justin, 10.
``It's in the best interest of the children that this not be dragged out through the courts any further,'' said Simpson attorney Bernard Leckie.
The Browns have long fought Simpson over custody of the children, but Leckie said Simpson is now on good terms with his children's grandparents and they're closely involved in their upbringing.
``The Browns and Simpson are getting along better now,'' Leckie said.
``They sit together at the children's athletic events''.
Reached at home Monday, Simpson refused to comment.
Calls to the Browns were unreturned and their lawyer could not be located.
The lawyer representing the children also did not return calls.
The California Supreme Court ruled in February that the custody case could go back to court for a second trial because a judge had failed to hear evidence about the slayings of Simpson's former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.
Simpson was acquitted in criminal court but held liable for the deaths in a civil trial and ordered to pay the Browns and Goldman's family $33.5 million.
The custody agreement comes nearly five years after Ms.
Simpson and Goldman were found stabbed to death outside her Brentwood home.
Simpson spent a year in jail before he was acquitted.
During that year, the Browns had custody of the two children.
When Simpson was freed the children moved in with him but the Browns decided to sue for permanent custody.
A judge awarded custody to Simpson in 1996, but the Browns appealed the decision.
O.J. Simpson will appear on a series of television programs next week, including ``Today'' on NBC and ``The View'' on ABC, to publicize a Web site on which he will take questions from the public.
The interviews will be rare television appearances for Simpson, who, in the years since his acquittal on murder charges in 1994, has been extensively interviewed only on Black Entertainment Television in 1996 and on ESPN in 1998.
On Tuesday Simpson will be interviewed on ``Today'' by the anchor Matt Lauer.
On Wednesday he will appear on the ABC daytime program ``The View,'' talking mainly with Barbara Walters and Star Jones.
Later on Wednesday he will be seen in an afternoon segment on the Fox News Channel, and that night he will appear on the same channel on the program ``The Edge'' with Paula Zahn.
In all the appearances, Simpson will discuss the start-up of the Web site AskOJ.com, established by the Entertainment Network, a company that operates adult-oriented Web sites.
Internet users, who will be able to direct questions to him, will be charged a $9.95 fee to register for the site, said Brian Barry, a spokesman for the company and Simpson.
They will also be able to purchase what Barry called ``O.J.
memorabilia''. ``O.J.
will be donating all his potential earnings from the Web site to charity,'' Barry said, but he did not provide details of the financial arrangement.
Jeff Zucker, the executive producer of ``Today,'' said Simpson was doing the interviews to ``publicize the start of this Web site''.
But both Zucker and Bill Geddie, the executive producer of ``The View,'' said no conditions had been placed on the interviews.
Zucker said Lauer would ``ask the questions you'd expect him to be asked''.
Zucker gave some examples: ``How is he supporting himself?
How are people treating him?
How is he dealing with the financial judgment against him''?
Simpson lost a civil lawsuit over the deaths of his wife, Nicole, and her friend Ron Goldman in 1997.
He was ordered to pay Simpson's and Goldman's families financial judgments totaling $33.5 million.
Geddie emphasized that ``The View'' is ``an opinion program'' and said, ``The image of O.J. sitting in the center of our panel of women was too powerful to resist''.
He added, ``I think he knows he's going to be sitting with people who believe he's a murderer''.
Zucker said he expected some viewers to be unhappy that ``Today'' was giving Simpson a forum to discuss his Web site, but said, ``It's certainly a newsworthy interview''.
Geddie said Simpson had originally contacted Walters about doing an interview for her ABC News program, ``20/20,'' but said, ``Barbara did not want to interview him on that show''.
Geddie added that the scheduled NBC appearance influenced his decision to book the interview.
``Having him on the `Today' show helped me,'' he said.
``I don't know if we would have gone out on a limb to be the first to put him on.
Being on `Today' gives it some legitimacy''.
Barry said the Entertainment Network was based in Tampa, Fla.
He described it as a ``company that creates voyeuristic Web sites.''
