0_1	0.2692307692307692	The research, based on detailed photographs from the Galileo spacecraft, shows how the extreme ebb and flow of tides in a subsurface ocean may have flexed the ice surface and created the elaborate patterns of curving cracks and ridges on Europa that are unlike anything else seen in the solar system.

9_8	0.0625	When the spectrometer focused on the areas of Europa that appeared in photographs to consist of pure ice, it indeed measured the characteristic spectrum of water ice _ no surprise there.
9_9	0.06666666666666667	But when the instrument examined features like the many dark lines that crisscross the moon's surface, it obtained several distorted spectra that each looked similar to ice.
9_10	0.0	Thomas McCord, a geophysicist at the University of Hawaii who is studying the Galileo data, recognized that the spectra were produced by light reflecting off water-impregnated salty minerals, including natron and Epsom salts.
9_11	0.0	Such salts, McCord says, form only in the presence of liquid water.
9_12	0.375	``This is the first evidence that Europa's ocean is briny,'' McCord says.
9_13	0.0	The circulating currents of a salty sea would explain the unusual magnetic readings that other Galileo instruments have recorded.
9_14	0.3333333333333333	Those currents may create a magnetic field for the moon.
9_15	0.0	Galileo found that the salts have the same composition at different sites scattered about the moon, evidence that the sea is extensive and well mixed.
9_16	0.2727272727272727	The composition of the salts, McCord says, gives some hints about the chemistry of Europa's ocean.
9_17	0.0	The presence of sodium carbonates means that carbon dioxide is probably dissolved in the water.
9_18	0.14285714285714285	On Earth, volcanoes and submarine hydrothermal vents release carbon dioxide, ``so it is reasonable to think that carbon dioxide gas would be coming out of Europa's mantle and into the ocean,'' McCord says.
9_19	0.0	``The ice cap would seal the ocean most of the time, so the carbon dioxide would build up and become like seltzer water''.
9_20	0.0	Raise the pressure of that carbon dioxide high enough and it could erupt through the ice to the surface.
9_21	0.0	(This could explain the origin of volcano-like features on Europa).
9_22	0.07142857142857142	Once exposed to the near vacuum that exists at the moon's surface, the briny water would quickly evaporate, leaving the salts behind.
9_23	0.0	As yet, there is no evidence that Europa has hydrothermal vents on its ocean floor.
9_24	0.0	``But if there is an ocean, there has to be heat coming out of the mantle,'' McCord says, ``so there almost have to be hydrothermal vents''.
9_25	0.0	There is certainly no reason that hydrothermal vents couldn't exist in oceans on worlds other than our own.
9_26	0.0	In fact, the Mars Global Surveyor mission recently found signs of a large deposit of hematite _ a mineral often formed by hydrothermal activity _ near Mars' equator.
9_27	0.0	If the hematite deposit does indeed mark the site of a large ancient body of hot water, it would be an ideal place to search for past life on Mars.
9_28	0.0	A briny Europan sea might also contain evidence of past life.
9_29	0.0	But unlike Mars, Europa may still harbor some kind of life.
9_30	0.0	``It is felt that carbon dioxide in the ocean created a fertile environment for the formation of life on Earth,'' McCord says.

15_5	0.35714285714285715	The spacecraft might carry a small landing vehicle, said Carl Pilcher, NASA scientific director for Solar System exploration.
15_6	0.3333333333333333	The central reason for the agency's interest in Europa, he said, is the feeling that this, above all other extraterrestrial places in the solar system, could be the home of some kind of living organism.
15_7	0.21428571428571427	He emphasized that there are no plans ``for decades to come'' to attempt to retrieve material from Europa's icy surface and return it to Earth.
15_8	0.0	A report issued by a National Academy of Sciences committee this month said that if such a mission ever is launched, NASA must to take care that stuff brought back to Earth does not contaminate the planet with extraterrestrial life.

15_10	0.38461538461538464	It added that the biological potential on Europa _ which it called ``one of the most interesting objects in the solar system'' _ appears to be greater than on Ganymede.
15_11	0.16	In the last few months, scientists at NASA have been intrigued by new evidence suggesting that a vast body of salty, liquid water lies beneath Europa's frozen crust, a sort of ``buried'' ocean that may be as much as 60 miles deep.
15_12	0.0	The evidence comes from Galileo, a satellite launched in 1989 to peer down on Jupiter and its larger moons.
15_13	0.5	Galileo's mission is technically over, but the space agency has rerigged its orbit around Jupiter so that it repeatedly flies by Europa.
15_14	0.0	Based on studies of its gravitational field, scientists are pretty much convinced that Europa is composed of a metallic center, possibly iron, which is surrounded by a shell of rock.
15_15	0.0	The rock shell is surround in turn by a layer of water.
15_16	0.07692307692307693	The question they need answered is whether the water is all frozen or consists of a liquid ocean on which floats a layer of ice that may be several miles thick.
15_17	0.21739130434782608	From Europa's surface, Jupiter would appear as a huge, dark body in a mostly black sky, said Gerald Schubert a planetary physicist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an interdisciplinary scientist on the Galileo mission.
15_18	2.2142857142857144	Slightly smaller than the Earth's moon, Europa is wrenched by the tidal forces of Jupiter's overpowering gravity, Schubert said.
15_19	0.125	``As it orbits Jupiter, it contracts, expands, twists and contorts,'' Schubert said.
15_20	0.0	``There should be a hell of a lot of heat in the interior as a result of this tidal effect,'' he said in an interview.
15_21	0.0	``There could be a tremendous amount of volcanic activity because of this internal heat.
15_22	0.0	Whether there actually is or not, we don't know''.
15_23	0.0	That kind of heat could explain why the surface of Europa is covered by fractures and ridges.
15_24	0.0	The criss-crossed lines look much like the broken ice that covers the Arctic Ocean and coastal areas of Antarctica.
15_25	0.42857142857142855	The cracks also could be caused by Europa's flexing tides.
15_26	0.0	However, some of the cracks show signs that something from underneath has oozed out and has been deposited on the surface, Schubert said.
15_27	0.2	In addition to the gravitational studies, Galileo has measured magnetic fields surrounding Jupiter and its moons.
15_28	0.0	This has produced still more intriguing information about Europa.
15_29	0.25	The magnetic field of Jupiter varies as Europa orbits through it, he explained.
15_30	0.0	The effect is not unlike conditions inside an electric motor.
15_31	0.15384615384615385	When a material that can conduct electricity passes through a varying magnetic field, an electric current is generated in the moving material.
15_32	0.4	That current then generates its own magnetic field.
15_33	0.0	Surrounding Europa are magnetic patterns that are typical of fields generated by electric currents, Schubert said.
15_34	2.3333333333333335	The currents could be generated as Europa moves though Jupiter's magnetic field.
15_35	0.0	But the key question is what could be conducting those currents.
15_36	0.36363636363636365	The metallic core of the body is too far from Galileo to produce magnetic fields the satellite could detect, Schubert said.
15_37	0.0	And the rocky shell would not conduct electricity well enough to carry the current.
15_38	0.23076923076923078	``It appears these magnetic fields could only be explained by electric currents in a salty liquid ocean near the surface,'' Schubert said.
15_39	0.0	Pilcher said the space mission planned for 2003 would carry a laser altimeter, capable of very precise measurements of the satellite's distance from the surface of Europa.
15_40	0.0	If the Jupiter moon is covered with solid ice, then tidal variations on the surface might be no more than a few meters, but if there is a large body liquid water sloshing around beneath that ice, then the tides would be much greater.
15_41	0.0	The orbiter also would carry infrared imaging equipment to examine surface features and a sounding radar capable of examining the subsurface several kilometers deep, he said.
15_42	0.0	Although there are no specific plans for a lander, such a device might be added as a technology-testing prototype.
15_43	0.0	If that is done, instruments to test the surface for the presence of organic chemicals might be added, he said.
15_44	0.0	But sending a lander to the surface of Europa and retrieving a sample of the ice or perhaps of the ancient ooze laying along the sides of the moon's criss-crossed fractures is something that hasn't even been seriously considered, Pilcher said.
15_45	0.0	One reason: the same gravitational stresses that knead Europa like a big ice-covered doughball would create almost unthinkable obstacles to launching the vehicle when it has finished collecting its samples.

23_0	0.14285714285714285	WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) --Initial analysis of early data from Galileo probe has encouraged scientists to review their theories of planetary evolution, according to scientists at a NASA press conference Monday.
23_1	1.8636363636363635	The cone-shaped probe, released from Galileo on July 13 and entered into Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7, was the first man-made craft ever to dip into the atmosphere of a planet and sent back data on its way to demise.
23_2	0.3333333333333333	"The quality of the Galileo probe data exceeds all of our most optimistic predictions," said Dr.
23_3	0.0	Wesler Huntress, Associate Administrator for Space Science with the U.S.
23_4	0.0	National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
23_5	1.2	"It will allow the scientific community to develop valuable new insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system and the origins of life within it," he added.
23_6	3.5714285714285716	The composition of Jupiter's atmosphere offered some surprise.
23_7	0.42857142857142855	It contains lower than expected levels of helium, neon, and some heavy elements, such as carbon, oxygen and sulfur, said projects scientists.
23_8	1.4615384615384615	The probe detected extremely strong winds and very intense turbulence during its descent through Jupiter's thick atmosphere.
23_9	1.4	It provides evidence that the energy source driving Jupiter's circulation is "probably heat escaping from the deep interior of the planet," said Dr.
23_10	0.14285714285714285	Richard Young of NASA's Ames Research Center.
23_11	1.6428571428571428	"The probe also discovered an intense new radiation belt above Jupiter's cloud tops, and a veritable absence of lighting".
23_12	0.0	The probe found that lighting occurs on Jupiter only about one-tenth as often as on Earth, which is consistent with the absence of water clouds but reduces the possibility of finding organic molecules in the Jovian atmosphere.
23_13	0.1	Asked about the meaning of these findings, the project scientists said that the probe's measurements may necessitate a reappraisal of existing views of how Jupiter evolved from the solar nebula, because most scientists believe now that Jupiter has a composition similar to that of the gas and dust cloud of the primitive solar nebula from which the planets and the Sun were formed.
23_14	3.1818181818181817	The Galileo probe made the most difficult voyage entering Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7 last year.
23_15	0.04	It sent back more than 30 minutes of data before its life came to an end under extreme conditions including entry speed of about 170,000 kilometers per hour, temperatures twice those on the surface of the Sun and 230 times the strength of gravity on the Earth.
23_16	0.5	Galileo, which has been put into orbit by space shuttle Atlantis since late 1989, is now undertaking a two-year mission to study Jupiter and its moons.
24_0	0.5625	LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) --The planet Jupiter is much hotter and windier than previously believed, the latest information from the space probe Galileo has shown.
24_1	0.11764705882352941	The chemical composition of the planet, which hasn't changed for 5,000 million years, is almost exactly like the sun's, a report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper said.
24_2	0.23529411764705882	Information sent back by Galileo shows that the central regions of Jupiter are much hotter than previously believed and winds around Jupiter exceeded 400mph, almost 100mph faster than hitherto thought.
24_3	0.5	These winds are driven by heat escaping from the planet's core.
