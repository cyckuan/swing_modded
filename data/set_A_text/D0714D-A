0_0	0.42038105	SAN FRANCISCO _ Handing the recording industry a resounding victory, a San Francisco judge slapped Napster Inc.
0_1	0.18216551	with a preliminary injunction Wednesday and ordered the Internet service to halt all illegal song swapping by midnight Friday.
0_2	0.2404299	U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Hall Patel rejected all of Napster's legal arguments and ruled that the program is primarily a conduit for ``wholesale infringing'' of copyright laws.
0_3	0.2887109	The ruling is likely to disappoint millions of Napster fans who use the Internet program to trade free music with each other.
0_4	0.15802806	And officials with the San Mateo startup claim the ruling could be a death blow to its fledgling business because, it said, its program cannot distinguish legal from illegal songs.
0_5	0.14703483	Napster executives said they will appeal as early as Thursday to keep Napster online.
0_6	0.1793126	The company's high-powered defense attorney David Boies said Napster will have to shut down the service if a higher court does not grant a stay of the injunction.
0_7	0.11356814	``We are surprised and disappointed,'' Napster's interim CEO Hank Barry said moments after the verdict.
0_8	0.05837154	``We understand the ruling and the basis for it, but we disagree with it.
0_9	0.1529458	We do not believe Napster users are acting illegally''.
0_10	0.098449906	Patel issued her much-anticipated ruling at the end of a 21/2 hour hearing.
0_11	0.11199826	The judge's small courtroom was packed, and more than 150 lawyers, journalists, online music company executives and Napster fans had to watch the proceedings on closed circuit television in an adjoining courtroom.
0_12	0.11995799	Patel's ruling is historic because it sets the tone for how the established entertainment industries deal with the increasing problem of Internet users using file-sharing programs like Napster.
0_13	0.092676317	Already, other programs like Gnutella, Freenet and Scour have extended the Napster ``peer-to-peer'' file-sharing concept to digital pictures and first-run movies.
0_14	0.069035765	The same idea could be used to swap electronic books and computer software.
0_15	0.33864196	``This decision will pave the way for the future of online music,'' said Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording Industry Association of America, the trade group representing the top five record labels that sued Napster for copyright infringement in December.
0_16	0.18396428	The quick rise of the Napster program, originally written by a 19-year-old college student, Shawn Fanning, alarmed the $40 billion U.S. recording industry.
0_17	0.16495435	Napster estimates there are 20 million users of the program, first released in August 1999.
0_18	0.10270668	Once considered a fad among teens and college students, Napster has now also become popular with people of all ages.
0_19	0.15276515	Napster user Hidehiro Beppu, 21, studying math at the University of California at Berkeley, was also disappointed.
0_20	0.0021943501	``This is bogus.
0_21	0.084807753	Napster doesn't do anything.
0_22	0.085702309	It's like people copying music on tapes and giving it to friends''.
0_23	0.39488131	The Napster software links users to various servers run by Napster Inc.
0_24	0.27609771	People can easily search for any MP3-formated song stored on the computer hard drives of other Napster users.
0_25	0.096657904	When selected, the songs are copied from one computer to another.
0_26	0.11120004	This vast ``peer-to-peer'' file sharing network has the ability to find almost any recorded song in the world, from the latest Britney Spears top-10 pop hit to an obscure 19th century folk song.
0_27	0.20632662	The recording industry complained that the ability to download free songs threatens to undermine the very core of the sales and distribution mechanism that sustains the creative juices of the musical world.
0_28	0.45746486	The Recording Industry Association of America estimates that Napster has already cost more than $300 million in lost sales.
0_29	0.097993435	A new study released Wednesday by online research firm Jupiter Communications Inc.
0_30	0.28583345	called Napster ``the definitive killer application for the online music industry''.
0_31	0.20994718	Los Angeles attorney Russell Frackman, representing the recording companies, said Napster would grow to 75 million users downloading billions of songs by the end of the year if left unchecked.
0_32	0.16732497	``This is the most egregious case of mass copyright infringement that has ever existed,'' Frackman said.
0_33	0.088962792	``The longer this goes on, the more impossible it will be for us and, we believe, for the court, to do anything realistic''.
0_34	0.093675014	Napster's defense team headed by Boies, who led the U.S. government's recent successful antitrust prosecution of Microsoft, relied on legal precedents set by previous court decisions that allowed VCR owners to copy movies.
0_35	0.23640256	Napster also said it is protected by provisions of the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.
0_36	0.11634745	Patel, however, flatly rejected those arguments, saying e-mail messages by Napster's own founders admit the program was designed to share ``pirated'' versions of copyright-protected songs.
0_37	0.10260623	She also shot down Napster's contention that the program, even if used for illegal purposes, could be spared because there were some legal ``fair use'' applications such as a promotional vehicle for unknown new artists.
0_38	0.070947553	That argument appeared ``late, after the beginning of this litigation,'' Patel said.
0_39	0.24037265	Patel's injunction, intended to prevent any more damage to the recording industry until after the suit goes to trial, orders Napster to prevent members from swapping songs controlled by the record companies that filed the suit.
0_40	0.14147785	Boies argued that the injunction is unfair to Napster because technicians have not devised a way to separate which songs are legal.
0_41	0.070638062	Patel said the injunction will force them to come up with a method.
0_42	0.084526871	``They created the monster; I guess that's the consequences they face,'' Patel said.
0_43	0.26399968	Lars Ulrich, drummer for the rock band Metallica, was especially pleased by the ruling.
0_44	0.23469267	Metallica drew the ire of its fans by filing its own suit against Napster for allowing the band's songs to be freely swapped.
0_45	0.12465674	With Napster, ``the right of what happens to my music was taken away from me,'' Ulrich said in a telephone interview from New York.
0_46	0.16250892	Now, he said, the challenge ``is to make people in this country understand that because technology make it available and because the Internet gives you access to it, that doesn't mean you have a right to it'' Legal experts said the ruling gives the recording industry a clear copyright enforcement victory.
0_47	0.12129879	But other file sharing programs like Gnutella that are not controlled by any one company are going to be harder to control.
0_48	0.097339917	``The liability issue against Napster was very clear,'' said Brian Mudge, partner at Kenyon &AMP; Kenyon in Wash.
0_49	0.092742066	DC, specializing in intellectual property cases.
0_50	0.067363033	``That's going to be a whole different ballgame to enforce and police.

0_52	0.12370812	With the possibility of a court-ordered Napster shutdown looming, Napster fans had already started moving to other file-sharing programs such as Gnutella, iMesh and Scour, which is also the subject of another copyright infringement suit by the motion picture industry.
0_53	0.093627645	Web sites like &UR; www.angrycoffee.com &LR; offer more alternatives, while &UR; http://opennap.sourceforge.net &LR; offers links through outside servers in case Napster is forced to shut down its own servers.

4_0	0.20728481	NEW YORK (AP) --The music industry has some fresh ammunition in its effort to prove that Internet swapping of free music files has cut into music sales.

4_7	0.054860201	The study was commissioned by Reciprocal Inc.

7_0	0.25796521	WASHINGTON _ The Senate indicated Tuesday that it wants no part of the hottest controversy in the music business, ensuring that the youth-driven trend to download music from the Internet will continue to reshape the industry, at least for now.
7_1	0.13809588	After listening to Metallica rocker Lars Ulrich square off with the Byrds folksinger Roger McGuinn over the evils and joys of Internet music downloads, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said, ``I think the courts can handle it''.
7_2	0.23949283	Hatch said the Senate will keep ``a close eye'' on the raging copyright fight between the recording industry and Internet music distributors, such as San Mateo-based Napster, but will take no action now.
7_3	0.08149628	The committee's ranking Democrat, Patrick Leahy of Vermont agreed, adding that movie studios were once ``terrified'' of videotapes, which later turned into a major revenue stream for Hollywood.
7_4	0.11106109	``In the end, things get sorted out and new (technologies) offer new opportunities for artists and more choices for consumers,'' Leahy said.
7_5	0.041422283	``Let's not strangle the baby in the cradle''.
7_6	0.14796771	The copyright dispute has drawn intense lobbying in Washington from the software industry, recording companies, Hollywood studios and even book publishers as Internet distribution undermines ownership of ``intellectual property'' across the spectrum of copyrighted material.
7_7	0.100153	Industry leaders liken unauthorized free Internet distribution of copyrighted work to theft, saying it robs artists of their livelihoods, strangles artistic creation and, ultimately, will harm consumers as the sources of creativity dry up.
7_8	0.095411696	Internet distributors contend that established industries are trying to stifle a hugely &LR; popular technology that will bring untold convenience and flexibility to consumers.
7_9	0.14661398	They say they want to preserve copyright protections but that recording studios have been reluctant to work with Web sites the studios view as competitors.
7_10	0.19695675	The distributors say the recording industry has hit them with huge lawsuits on the scale of those filed against tobacco companies, and that the suits could put them out of business.
7_11	0.16905507	In any event, some argued Tuesday that technologies such as Napster and a more sophisticated program called ``Gnutella'' _ a free software that allows users to download music from each other's computers rather than a central server _ are inherently uncontrollable.
7_12	0.079015276	Hatch even quoted Intel Chairman Andy Grove's prediction that ``the whole Internet could be rearchitected by Napster-like technology''.
7_13	0.089645676	Hatch, whose high-profile hearings on technology issues often indicate where Washington is headed, did not disappoint Tuesday, lining up the chief combatants of the music wars and packing Capitol Hill's most cavernous hearing room.
7_14	0.13816326	Metallica's Ulrich opened by accusing Napster of hijacking, piracy and theft of artistic property.
7_15	0.094410484	Describing Metallica's rise from rags to riches as ``the classic American dream come true,'' Ulrich compared a musician's right to own his music to a carpenter's right to own a table he crafts.
7_16	0.10745845	Ulrich recounted how his band was working earlier this year on a song for the movie ``Mission Impossible-2'' when members heard that radio stations were already playing versions of the work in progress.
7_17	0.31932511	The band traced the ``leaks'' to Napster and filed a lawsuit.
7_18	0.2213799	``My band authored the music which is Napster's lifeblood,'' Ulrich said.
7_19	0.12026942	``We should decide what happens to it, not Napster _ a company with no rights in our recordings, which never invested a penny in Metallica's music or had anything to do with its creation''.
7_20	0.3702284	Napster chief executive Hank Barry countered that the Web site's 20 million users have a right to ``share'' music under copyright law.
7_21	0.14045627	Barry argued that Internet distribution ``is helping, not hurting'' the music industry by allowing people to sample music before buying it, leading to more store sales.
7_22	0.13020158	And he said Internet distribution gives music lovers and artists unprecedented access to each other.
7_23	0.098431693	The Byrds co-ounder McGuinn agreed, charging that recording studios actually undercut artists rather than protect them.
7_24	0.092682111	Despite recording more than 25 records and such 1960s megahits as ``Mr.
7_25	0.094018109	Tambourine Man'' and ``Turn, Turn, Turn,'' McGuinn said he ``never saw any royalties'' from most of his work other than meager advances.
7_26	0.25550762	``The recording companies have ways of not paying,'' he said.
7_27	0.10453667	In 1994, McGuinn said he began recording traditional folk songs to preserve the genre and was led eventually to Internet distributor MP3.com, which paid him ``an unheard of'' 50 percent non-exclusive royalty and helped fuel a resurgence in folk music that he said the big recording companies had abandoned.
7_28	0.088496897	But such arguments had little sway with California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who took a much harder line than her colleagues on copyright infringement.
7_29	0.12879494	``To my way of thinking, Napster has found a method which entirely defeats copyright protection,'' Feinstein said.
7_30	0.078691793	Barry sharply countered, ``Sales are up, Senator,'' but Feinstein was undeterred.
7_31	0.069623133	``You could do the same thing with a book,'' she said.
7_32	0.07227555	``You could do the same thing with a movie.
7_33	0.093809308	You are essentially defeating any intellectual property copyright with your technology, all driven under the cloak of anonymity at the other end of a server''.
7_34	0.087064611	Barry replied that such charges have been levelled against every technological advance, ``from the piano roll to radio to cassettes to VCRs.
7_35	0.070673522	These horrible prophecies have not come true.
7_36	0.076806174	In every case it's been a financial boon'' to copyright holders and content producers.
7_37	0.15498011	Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of America, drew a sharp distinction between Napster and Gnutella, which pay no royalties, and such companies as MP3.com and Emusic.com of Redwood City, which do.
7_38	0.11102555	But Gene Kan, a University of California at Berkeley graduate in electrical engineering who helped develop Gnutella, said the ``toothpaste is already out of the tube'' and that Napster's 20 million users of today ``will be 100 million tomorrow''.
7_39	0.089186355	Attempts to ``lock up'' copyrighted material will be defeated eventually, Kan predicted.
7_40	0.12144163	Gene Hoffman, founder and CEO of Emusic.com of Redwood City, agreed that the convenience, flexibility and infinite availability of music on the Internet will upend the music industry's reliance on physical distribution.
7_41	0.090626995	But Hoffman said that while Emusic offers lower costs _ 99 cents for a single track and $8.99 for an album _ it still pays artists and cannot compete with free music.
7_42	0.10289917	``The reason my stock declined 70 percent is because Napster will invalidate the concept of paying for music,'' Hoffman said.
7_43	0.09834927	Although Hatch said Congress will take no action now, he warned that Washington will ``be watching very closely'' to see that ``fair and reasonable licensing'' takes place between recording studios and Internet distributors to make sure that artists are compensated _ and that Web sites get access to recordings.
8_0	0.039503749	The battle lines are drawn.
8_1	0.35048688	The target is Napster, the software company that allows computer users to swap music files with other users for free, whether the music is by unknown bands or superstars.
8_2	0.12959185	Either way, the artists don't get royalties _ and this issue has ignited a firestorm of debate among musicians, record labels, and increasingly, the courts, which have been asked to rule on copyright questions regarding online piracy.
8_3	0.19971954	In one corner stands Metallica and Dr.
8_4	0.34761484	Dre _ the heavy metal and rap titans, respectively, who recently filed separate suits against Napster for copyright infringement.
8_5	0.085911748	Other artists from Don Henley to Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails are defending their position, with Henley saying that Napster is engaged in outright ``stealing'' from songwriters.
8_6	0.11544089	In the other corner is Limp Bizkit, the rap-rock act that has become Napster's lobbying arm and is taking $1.7 million in Napster sponsorship to tour this summer.
8_7	0.11680362	The Offspring and Chuck D of Public Enemy are among the acts standing beside Bizkit in support of Napster, saying that Napster helps expose new music and anyone who thinks otherwise is old school.
8_8	0.17362158	All of which comes just a week after the Recording Industry Association of America (on behalf of major labels such as Sony and Arista) won a lawsuit against MP3.com _ a music database service.

8_11	0.089571099	The subplots to the digital battle are many, and are being played out in light of increased sales of compact discs.
8_12	0.16930625	For one, Metallica has been pitted against some of its fans, one of whom went on Napster's Web site this week to write that Metallica was a bunch of ``sellouts''.
8_13	0.11151633	He added: ``The (Metallica) song `Master of Puppets' is fitting, only this time, Metallica is on the wrong end of the strings''.
8_14	0.13517585	Metallica's response was to hire a British firm, NetPD, to monitor three days of Napster activity earlier this week, which turned up 333,082 screen names of users who traded 1.4 million Metallica songs _ an average of nearly five songs per person _ during that time, said Gayle Fine of the band's management company, Q Prime.
8_15	0.20429524	Metallica has asked that Napster drop those names from its files.
8_16	0.07630216	As of Thursday, Napster had not removed the names.
8_17	0.18527884	One fan posted an angry parody site, www.paylars.com, which asks fans to send money to the band to pay for songs they downloaded on Napster.
8_18	0.093455821	Another subplot features Limp Bizkit's singer-rapper, Fred Durst, who also is a senior vice president of Interscope Records, whose parent label, Universal Music, joined the RIAA in a separate lawsuit against Napster.
8_19	0.057487559	Interscope has not commented on what it thinks of Durst's actions.
8_20	0.066828072	But the larger issue has nothing to do with opposing rock personalities.
8_21	0.11408898	It has to do with whether 200 years of copyright law will be thrown out the window by the digital revolution.
8_22	0.26984785	``The recording industry is not anti-Napster,'' says Jayson Maloni, a spokesman for the RIAA.
8_23	0.076306786	``Nobody is trying to keep an unsigned band from getting its music heard.

8_25	0.02627939	``It's not just the artist.

8_34	0.080137653	Just because a technology exists where you can duplicate something, that doesn't give you the right to steal.
8_35	0.0962156	There's nothing wrong with giving some tracks away, or bits of stuff, that's fine.

15_8	0.20619429	David Boies, the lead lawyer for Napster, said the company would immediately appeal.
15_9	0.20060209	He said that Napster did not have the ability to sift out which of the millions of songs on Napster represented copyrighted works owned by the plaintiffs and which did not.
15_10	0.068108654	This injunction ``does not give us any fair ability to comply and still operate,'' Boies said.

15_27	0.45311897	From a technical legal standpoint, the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents major record labels, asserts Napster is guilty of contributory copyright infringement.
15_28	0.23277178	The industry contends that Napster has built a business by encouraging individual users to share files of music they do not own.
15_29	0.13719006	But Napster says its users are doing nothing wrong, and therefore it is doing nothing wrong.
15_30	0.17227368	Rather, the company says, they are engaging en masse in a practice that has been permitted all along _ the copying of music and other media for personal use.
15_31	0.20418251	Patel concluded that Napster users were engaged in ``wholesale infringing,'' and that the users were not engaged in ``typical personal use of music copies, as Napster lawyers asserted''.
15_32	0.20367306	Moreover, she said the users reaped economic advantage from making copies on the Napster service by getting music free they might ordinarily pay for.
15_33	0.22031737	In seeking the preliminary injunction, lawyers for the recording industry said Napster was on pace to have 70 million users within six months.
15_34	0.21871197	The lawyers said Napster users already downloaded 14,000 songs a minute.
15_35	0.18955345	``This is the most egregious case of massive copyright infringement that has ever existed,'' Russell Frackman, a record label lawyer, told the judge.
15_36	0.10511039	Boies, who represented the government in its antitrust case against Microsoft, said that an injunction should not be granted because it would have the side effect of impinging on Napster's uses that do not infringe on copyrights, like sharing works that do not have copyrights.
15_37	0.043715846	Boies cited the U.S.
15_38	0.091026014	Supreme Court's 1984 decision that Sony was not guilty of contributory copyright violation with its Betamax videocassette recorder, in part because the device was ``capable of substantial noninfringing uses''.
15_39	0.061867169	But Patel did not accept the argument.
15_40	0.11176924	``While Napster may be capable of some other things, they seem to pale in comparison to what Napster was created for,'' she said.
15_41	0.11141979	The two sides wielded competing studies to show Napster's impact, or lack thereof, on music sales.
15_42	0.10556062	One study, commissioned by Napster and prepared by Peter S.
15_43	0.12756663	Fader, associate professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, found that ``over 91 percent of Napster users buy as much or more music than before they used Napster, with 28 percent purchasing more''.

15_45	0.17835623	, a San Francisco-based research firm, 22 percent of Napster users said that because of Napster, they did not buy CDs any more or they bought fewer CDs.

16_0	0.26960058	WASHINGTON _ Celebrity and politics collided Tuesday on Capitol Hill, as a rock musician joined online music executives and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss the effects on the recording industry of downloading music from the Internet.

16_5	0.14554798	Hundreds lined up to get a view of Ulrich, or perhaps to gain some insight into the clash between the recording industry and online music outlets.
16_6	0.37347591	The Recording Industry Association of America, which represents major record labels, and several music groups have argued that software created by the online music start-up Napster permits individuals to steal copyrighted material.
16_7	0.15025591	Officials for the service, and their fans, contend that it simply allows for easy sharing and sampling of music.
16_8	0.30901675	To use the Napster service, which is free, users download software over the Internet that allows them to store and catalog their music on their own computers.
16_9	0.26230646	Napster posts those catalogs, and then enables users of the service to visit one another's computers over the Internet and share and download one another's music.
16_10	0.24442921	Ulrich said that ``if music is free for downloading, the music industry is not viable''.
16_11	0.20011453	Napster, he said, had ``hijacked'' his music.

16_21	0.056360624	``In the end, things get sorted out''.
16_22	0.088138258	But Leahy said that it is important both to ``protect the legitimate right'' of artists and to reward them for their work.

16_25	0.47275304	And he said that Napster was helping, not hurting the recording industry.
16_26	0.16968418	People are buying more records, he said, because they are able to sample and preview music before buying.
16_27	0.094820166	``Companies that hold copyrights on behalf of creators, and which control distribution of creative works, have a strong inclination to change copyright law from a balanced vehicle for public enrichment to an unbalanced engine of control,'' he said.
16_28	0.083730436	Barry said copyright holders were often reluctant to allow new technologies to emerge.
16_29	0.10351653	But, he said, innovations like radio, television, the cassette player and the videocassette recorder have ``proved to be a financial boon to these same concerned copyright holders''.
16_30	0.077411289	Rather than legislation from Congress, Barry called for a ``market-based solution that will benefit consumers''.
16_31	0.077668562	Others who testified Tuesday agreed.

17_0	0.35274793	The surge in sharing and trading music over the Internet has brought online music sites into conflict with record labels, which say copyrighted songs are being pirated.
17_1	0.089396337	Wednesday the dispute is expected to take a significant turn that will pit musicians directly against their fans.
17_2	0.35276378	The heavy-metal band Metallica will seek to prevent 335,000 fans from using Napster, a service for sharing music collections over the Internet.
17_3	0.32279043	A lawyer for the band said the users, identified by their online handles, were making Metallica recordings available for others to copy.
17_4	0.13565388	Napster officials said Tuesday that under the law they would be obliged to bar anyone shown to have infringed copyright from using the service, though it was not clear what might prevent such users from reregistering.
17_5	0.12664548	In any case, the move is a potential blow to the explosively popular but embattled Napster, which was created last year and already faces several lawsuits.
17_6	0.11739627	The Metallica lawyer said that if the tactic succeeded, he would encourage similar moves by other musicians, thus potentially depriving Napster of thousands of users.
17_7	0.12279882	And with the musicians moving directly into the fray, the dispute is no longer between faceless record labels and Internet companies.
17_8	0.14302389	Already, tempers are flaring, with fans of Metallica, one of the most popular heavy metal bands of the last two decades, asserting the move may cause them to abandon a band they have followed with dogged loyalty.
17_9	0.12481935	``There are going to be Metallica CD burnings if they try this,'' said Rob Jones, founder of KNAC.com, a Web site catering to heavy-metal fans.
17_10	0.09470188	But Metallica sees the issue very differently, said its lawyer, Howard King.
17_11	0.15834993	He said Metallica spent millions of dollars to create and market an album and did not want to have the music traded freely online, depriving the band of the fruits of its investment.
17_12	0.072662397	``The band would like to sell some albums,'' King said.
17_13	0.11201358	He added that ``it is a lousy position to be in'' for Metallica to be at odds with its fans.
17_14	0.2679546	But he said that Napster has put Metallica in the position and forced the band to ``take a stand''.
17_15	0.25806542	That stand entailed hiring a company to visit Napster to compile a log of the online handles of Napster users who say they have Metallica music to offer.
17_16	0.29381847	King said he planned to hand over the list of names to Napster, which is based in San Mateo, Calif.
17_17	0.074818625	, in a collection of documents filling 30 cardboard boxes.
17_18	0.077181244	His plans were reported Tuesday by Cnet.com, an Internet news site.
17_19	0.47636006	Computer users who download the Napster software can then use the Napster site to list the music stored on their computers.
17_20	0.26896551	By so doing, they offer that music to the other Napster users, who in effect visit one another's computers over the Internet and listen to or download music.
17_21	0.3762965	Napster officials assert they are not involved in music piracy because the music is not kept on the company's computers.
17_22	0.17933706	Further, they say their users must comply with copyright law.
17_23	0.22924982	Elizabeth Brooks, vice president for marketing at Napster, said the company would expel users found to be ``legitimate infringers'' of copyright.
17_24	0.18829329	She said the company was obliged to take the step under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which stipulates that an online service is liable for copyright infringement if it is warned that a user is infringing a copyright and fails to act.
17_25	0.17933209	Brooks said the 335,000 fans represented less than 10 percent of Napster's ``several million'' users.
17_26	0.1050904	She declined to say how much music is available for trading through the service.
17_27	0.13295487	Until last week, when Metallica and the rapper Dr.

17_29	0.16602735	On another front in the digital music struggle, the industry won at least an initial victory last week when a federal judge ruled that another online music database, MP3.com, had violated copyright law.
17_30	0.20222311	Cliff Burnstein, one of Metallica's managers, said the band decided it needed to join the fight to make it clear that the dispute is not just about the interests of the record companies, but about the bands themselves.
17_31	0.10228118	``Even though the RIAA sued, they did it in a legalistic manner that didn't bring a lot of coverage,'' he said.
17_32	0.072532097	``We though this would bring the issue out more if we did it''.
17_33	0.12189314	Any rift between Metallica and its fans over Napster would be particularly striking, since the band's initial popularity in the early 1980s grew in part from a cassette demo tape, ``No Life Til Leather,'' that the band sent out free and encouraged fans to bootleg.
17_34	0.067987394	It is said to be among the most-traded cassette demo tapes in rock.
17_35	0.12446682	Burnstein said the band had a right to distribute music free then, but also had the right to ask for payment from fans for its current CDs.
17_36	0.088871032	It now records for Elektra Records, a division of Time Warner.
17_37	0.14768609	Jones of KNAC.com said music fans did not feel they were costing the bands money by sharing music online.
17_38	0.095030745	Rather, he said, those who have routinely copied music for each other on cassette tapes, or made illegal bootleg recordings at concerts, are merely taking the practice to a new medium.

20_0	0.23924726	WASHINGTON _ The law meant to protect intellectual property on the Internet needs to be updated, a Democratic research center says in a report to be released on Monday.
20_1	0.30029437	The report proposes outlawing technologies like the controversial Napster software that enables Internet users to trade music files with little regard to copyrights.
20_2	0.14503305	The Progressive Policy Institute, which is affiliated with the Democratic Leadership Council, is releasing its policy brief, ``Napster and Online Piracy: The Need to Revisit the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,'' ahead of a House Small Business Committee hearing scheduled for Wednesday to examine Internet music technologies.
20_3	0.24640936	The hearing is expected to focus on how small recording labels and lesser-known musical acts are using the Internet and downloadable music to gain market share.
20_4	0.1329568	Scheduled witnesses include Chuck D, founder of Rapstation.com, who has become a vocal proponent of Napster, which uses a file format called MP3.
20_5	0.16629849	At Rapstation.com, music fans can download MP3 files of lesser-known artists and those who have not yet signed recording contracts.
20_6	0.11981619	But the Progressive Policy Institute hopes the hearing, and its report, will also focus attention on what it says are needed updates to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
20_7	0.092050086	That law, passed in 1998 to extend traditional copyright protections to digital works, specifically exempted providers of Internet access services and search services from liability when their users transmit pirated works.

20_11	0.064913727	The groups are seeking damages that could add up to billions of dollars.
20_12	0.10335065	Napster's software works like a co-op.
20_13	0.1739029	It enables users to swap songs by trading files in the MP3 format _ a data-compression formula that turns a CD's music tracks into computer files.
20_14	0.20659003	Record companies call it a haven for piracy because it enables distribution of music without any copyright protection.
20_15	0.11072957	``To say that Napster should qualify as an ISP is not what the law intended, although it is possible the law could be interpreted that way,'' said Robert D.

20_18	0.084080118	``ISP'' is industry shorthand for ``Internet service provider''.
20_19	0.15247921	The report recommends that the digital copyright law be amended ``to hold Napster, its users, and similar services accountable for copyright violations while maintaining protections from liability for service providers that are innocent bystanders to digital piracy''.
20_20	0.10452719	The report proposes that services like Napster be required to collect identifiable and verifiable information from its users, such as addresses and credit-card information.
20_21	0.10722287	And it recommends that the services be required to remove infringing users within a specific period, perhaps a week, once they are identified.
20_22	0.28463027	Napster has argued that it should not be held accountable if its users illegally trade copyrighted music over the Internet, because it does not itself store the music on its computers or engage in trading copyrighted music.
20_23	0.3072001	Recently, however, Napster did bar 300,000 fans of the rock group Metallica, after the band said the fans had infringed its copyrights using the service.
20_24	0.079517953	Atkinson said no legislation had yet been drafted to address the recommendations in his report.
20_25	0.14192186	But he said he hoped that Wednesday's hearing would raise awareness in Washington for the need to update the digital copyright law to address new technologies.
20_26	0.084949364	(STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Any such proposals would likely be met with resistance from the civil libertarian community, which opposed the original law as potentially limiting access to works that belong in the public domain.

22_0	0.31091615	SAN FRANCISCO _ The crackdown on Napster has reached the corporate workplace.
22_1	0.23395868	Public relations firm Golon/Harris International has blocked employees from using the popular but controversial music swapping program because Napster was starting to sap the company's computer resources.
22_2	0.19872231	Numerous universities have already blocked or restricted use of Napster for various reasons, including copyright and bandwidth problems.
22_3	0.15712079	But Napster officials said there have been only a few scattered reports by Napster members or ``through the grapevine'' of the program causing similar problems in the workplace.
22_4	0.12632633	The latest came when Golon/Harris, which is based in Chicago and has offices in the United States, Britain and Japan, sent notice Tuesday to the more than 500 computer users in 13 company offices, including one in San Francisco.
22_5	0.090196709	The message: Napster is officially off-limits at work.
22_6	0.10706712	Barrett Buss, Golon/Harris vice president for information systems, said his first inkling that there might be a problem came when he noticed that 80 percent of the Internet traffic from one office was going to just one location _ Napster Inc.
22_7	0.78498666	in San Mateo, Calif.
22_8	0.14327675	``At that point, I got concerned that if 80 percent was going to Napster, how much of the bandwidth was left for e-mail'' and other business uses of the Internet, Buss said.
22_9	0.10047317	At the same time, Buss said the company was having problems backing up e-mail files in another office because a server no longer had the 4 gigabytes of hard-disk space needed to perform the operation.
22_10	0.085994893	Buss investigated and found employees had downloaded about 4.5 gigabytes worth of MP3 files.
22_11	0.079864024	``It's like potato chips, you can't download just one,'' Buss said.

22_20	0.14169474	``It would make sense that people are using Napster at work,'' said David Gould, who operates an independent Web site called NapsterMP3.com, which offers Napster fans forums and news, but not MP3s.

24_6	0.18746556	At the behest of the recording industry, US District Judge Marilyn Patel last month issued a sweeping injunction against Napster, where millions of music lovers swap digital copies of their favorite tunes without paying for them.
24_7	0.13043738	Essentially, Patel agreed with music industry executives _ and me _ that Napster's primary business is the facilitation of thievery.
24_8	0.27757197	She ordered Napster to stop its users from trafficking in copyrighted music.
24_9	0.094554387	An Appeals Court stayed Patel's order, giving Napster's stunned legal team an opportunity to recoup.

24_11	0.075274124	The Association of American Physicians &AMP; Surgeons has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, along with Eagle Forum, a conservative group best known for its successful campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment.
24_12	0.21092867	Both groups say the Napster injunction menaces the free exchange of ideas over the Internet.

24_19	0.084285589	A rather more serious objection to Patel's ruling comes from a powerful coalition of technology firms _ the Consumer Electronics Association, the Digital Future Coalition, and the Computer &AMP; Communications Industry Association.

24_34	0.07130548	It would therefore be foolish to ban the technology altogether, merely to prevent its abuse.
24_35	0.11977028	It's a telling argument that suffers from a single flaw _ Patel didn't try to ban Napster.
24_36	0.14993893	Her ruling leaves the company free to offer its service to those who trade in legal copies of digital music.
24_37	0.08511509	The fact that this restriction threatens the company's doom tells you all you need to know.
24_38	0.1372031	It's a tacit admission of the obvious _ the Napster business model is all about trading in stolen goods.
24_39	0.13346626	Yes, I know that Napster alternatives like Gnutella and Freenet ensure that the music thefts will continue.
24_40	0.090583838	But that doesn't change the fact that Napster has been well and truly busted, for forgetting something I learned at my father's knee _ dealers in hot merchandise generally get burned.
