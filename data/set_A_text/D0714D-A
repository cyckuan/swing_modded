0_3	0.079370327	If he'd been busted, I somehow doubt that any major corporations would have come to his defense.
0_4	0.07867551	But some purveyors of stolen goods have friends in high places.
0_5	0.19213866	Just look at who's going to bat for Napster, the Internet music-swapping company.
0_6	0.2137205	At the behest of the recording industry, US District Judge Marilyn Patel last month issued a sweeping injunction against Napster, where millions of music lovers swap digital copies of their favorite tunes without paying for them.
0_7	0.14586273	Essentially, Patel agreed with music industry executives _ and me _ that Napster's primary business is the facilitation of thievery.
0_8	0.28960935	She ordered Napster to stop its users from trafficking in copyrighted music.
0_9	0.098668268	An Appeals Court stayed Patel's order, giving Napster's stunned legal team an opportunity to recoup.
0_10	0.20626966	Meanwhile, an extraordinary group of Napster sympathizers has begun to rally around the company.
0_11	0.084381307	The Association of American Physicians &AMP; Surgeons has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, along with Eagle Forum, a conservative group best known for its successful campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment.
0_12	0.22647438	Both groups say the Napster injunction menaces the free exchange of ideas over the Internet.
0_13	0.13080886	They warn that corporations may use the Napster ruling to limit online criticism of their products.
0_14	0.077705602	``What if the owner of (the drug) Ritalin asserted its intellectual property rights, and demanded that Yahoo only provide authorized links on Ritalin''? this brief thunders.
0_15	0.082352142	``The outcome would be that criticism of the use of Ritalin would be effectively silenced''.
0_16	0.25545158	But the record companies aren't complaining about people who post scathing reviews of the new Metallica album.
0_17	0.097673316	They're upset about people stealing it, with the help of a company founded to facilitate such theft.
0_18	0.10119504	Consider the following quote from a Napster official: ``We are not just making pirated music available, but pushing demand''.
0_19	0.09846947	A rather more serious objection to Patel's ruling comes from a powerful coalition of technology firms _ the Consumer Electronics Association, the Digital Future Coalition, and the Computer &AMP; Communications Industry Association.
0_20	0.099737027	Among them, these three groups represent most of the world's biggest providers of computer hardware and software, home electronics gear, and Internet services.
0_21	0.083525979	Peter Jaszi, a law professor at American University, helped write this amicus brief.
0_22	0.13642893	It doesn't exactly amount to a ringing defense of Napster _ ``The brief certainly doesn't say that Napster should win or Napster should lose,'' Jaszi insists.
0_23	0.086409469	Still, their argument takes aim at the heart of Patel's ruling, by making a point with a good deal of merit.
0_24	0.091661067	``When there are technologies that have multiple uses, some obviously good and some perhaps bad, copyright law ought not to be a means for stamping out those technologies,'' Jaszi argues.
0_25	0.090000724	Imagine what would have happened in the early 1980s if the movie studios had succeeded in halting the sale of video cassette recorders?

0_30	0.076888878	There was only one solution _ ban Betamax.
0_31	0.076921642	Believe it or not, a federal Appeals Court agreed.
0_32	0.076409492	Fortunately, the US Supreme Court stepped in.
0_33	0.088169867	In 1984, the court ruled that even if VCRs could be used to steal the studios' intellectual property, the devices also had many legitimate uses.
0_34	0.086994207	It would therefore be foolish to ban the technology altogether, merely to prevent its abuse.
0_35	0.10314461	It's a telling argument that suffers from a single flaw _ Patel didn't try to ban Napster.
0_36	0.14768503	Her ruling leaves the company free to offer its service to those who trade in legal copies of digital music.
0_37	0.097269555	The fact that this restriction threatens the company's doom tells you all you need to know.
0_38	0.1258204	It's a tacit admission of the obvious _ the Napster business model is all about trading in stolen goods.
0_39	0.12605909	Yes, I know that Napster alternatives like Gnutella and Freenet ensure that the music thefts will continue.
0_40	0.088947501	But that doesn't change the fact that Napster has been well and truly busted, for forgetting something I learned at my father's knee _ dealers in hot merchandise generally get burned.

1_0	0.25788518	SAN FRANCISCO _ The battle over music in cyberspace spilled onto the streets of San Mateo, Calif.
1_1	0.33305215	, Wednesday as Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich jawed with fans of Napster, the popular and controversial music-sharing software.
1_2	0.27147845	The leader of the well-known heavy metal band showed up at the Fourth Street headquarters of Napster Inc.
1_3	0.25476325	to deliver the names of 335,435 Napster users who made 1.45 million Metallica songs available for free downloads last weekend.
1_4	0.14434518	But while Ulrich spoke to the assembled throng of reporters and photographers about Metallica's request to have Napster cut off those users, he was constantly heckled by irked Metallica fans who shouted ``Long live Napster'' and ``We just want to hear the music''.
1_5	0.14118502	At one point during the media event orchestrated by Metallica, Ulrich debated with a Napster fan.
1_6	0.1106404	And after Ulrich left, a longtime Metallica fan named Tony smashed his collection of Metallica CDs and tossed the plastic slivers on the ground in protest.
1_7	0.13406565	``Why can't we listen to their music on the Internet''? asked the 36-year-old San Francisco resident, who didn't want his last name used for fear of being hounded by Metallica's lawyers.
1_8	0.46418546	Metallica, which is suing Napster for copyright infringement, is seeking $10 million in damages.
1_9	0.11596833	On one side of the controversy are artists like Metallica, who believe that upstarts like Napster are robbing them of royalties and their livelihoods.
1_10	0.18354512	On the other side are fans, who say the greedy artists and record companies are trying to rob them of their ability to enjoy a new way of listening to music.
1_11	0.10851176	Meanwhile, Napster, which portrays itself as being in the middle, issued a statement after the event, saying the company will review the 13 boxes of paper printouts delivered on handcarts by Ulrich and attorney Howard E.
1_12	0.16489624	King. ``If the claims are submitted properly, the company will take the appropriate actions to disable the users Metallica has identified,'' Napster attorney Laurence Pulgram said in a statement.
1_13	0.078306451	``Of course, if the band would provide the names in computerized form rather than in tens of thousands of pages of paper intended to create a photo opp, that would expedite the process,'' Pulgram said.
1_14	0.15043718	Pulgram also noted that Napster has no way to block specific artists or titles from being traded, so ``the upshot of Metallica's notice may be to prevent its fans from using Napster at all'' for any music.
1_15	0.21235906	Napster's only product is a free computer program that allows fans to freely swap via the Internet copies of songs converted into the MP3 compression format.
1_16	0.28133685	Metallica and rap artist Dr.
1_17	0.25998103	Dre have filed separate civil suits claiming the software violates copyright laws, but Napster says it is legally protected under a provision of the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act because it has no control over its users' actions.
1_18	0.16481515	A British online consulting company hired by Metallica monitored Napster use from April 28 to April 30 and identified the 335,435 Napster users, along with the group's songs available for free download.
1_19	0.10150187	The song ``Nothing Else Matters'' topped the Metallica hit list with 116,574 copies posted by 73,772 users.
1_20	0.18549916	The Napster members were identified by their user names, which they gave Napster when they registered to download the program, along with the location of the song on their hard drives and their numerical Internet Protocol address.
1_21	0.18408069	Napster users noted that even if they were denied access by Napster, they could easily reregister under a new user name.
1_22	0.22313412	Metallica lawyers said it would be up to Napster to stop offenders from reregistering.
1_23	0.15205421	But Ulrich stressed that the band had no intention of hunting down and prosecuting any individual Napster users.
1_24	0.26680873	``This is not between Metallica and its fans,'' Ulrich said.
1_25	0.13506557	``This is between Metallica and Napster, let there be no question about that''.
1_26	0.088945976	And, he said, ``If we lose a bunch of fans over this, and we will, that doesn't discourage us from doing what we feel is right''.
1_27	0.14679897	Still, Ulrich, who has never visited Napster's Web site and admitted he ``can barely get on AOL,'' criticized the actions of Napster users as immoral.
1_28	0.098029995	``If they want to steal Metallica's music, instead of hiding behind their computers in their bedrooms and dorm rooms, then just go down to Tower Records and grab them off the shelves,'' Ulrich said.
1_29	0.1362995	Ulrich said he isn't opposed to online music, but said, ``We want online music to be on our conditions''.
1_30	0.10093253	That didn't sit well with Roman Dzindzichashvili, a 54-year-old Napster user who drove from his Sausalito, Calif.
1_31	0.08753087	, home to give Ulrich a piece of his mind.
1_32	0.11492709	``This is ridiculous, this is very obnoxious and this is very selfish,'' said Dzindzichashvili, who said Napster has not stopped him from buying CDs.
1_33	0.087025644	Metallica's suit has ired other fans around the country.
1_34	0.10408409	Randy Grant, a Napster user from UCLA, said he doesn't understand why Metallica seems bent on angering his fellow ``Napsterians''.
1_35	0.086560545	``This whole issue reeks of greed and fear to me, but I am not so sure who are the greedy and scared ones _ Metallica, or the huge and powerful industry which they are a part of,'' Grant wrote in an e-mail.
1_36	0.19308707	Local copyright law expert Eric Doney believes Napster will ultimately lose in court because the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was not designed to allow the type of music sharing promoted by Napster.
1_37	0.085719022	``I don't think they have a prayer,'' said Doney, an attorney with Donahue, Gallagher, Woods &AMP; Wood in Oakland, Calif.
1_38	0.10516969	He also said the fact that Metallica was able to compile a list of alleged offenders means individual Napster users could have something to worry about.
1_39	0.086883072	``If Metallica or anyone else who is being infringed wanted to start picking people off to make an example of them, they could,'' Doney said.

2_1	0.19088599	for allegedly swapping the heavy metal band's music want their access reinstated.
2_2	0.2026441	Napster said Tuesday it received notice from more than 30,000 MusicShare software users claiming they were misidentified as persons illegally trading Metallica's copyrighted songs in the popular MP3 digital format.
2_3	0.17183349	If Metallica does not take legal action against individual users within 10 days of Tuesday's notice, Napster will restore those blocked accounts, citing federal copyright law.
2_4	0.12981924	Napster has begun forwarding those petitions to Metallica's attorney, who disputed their claims.
2_5	0.088428536	''They're (the users) absolutely lying.

2_7	0.094698534	''Each and every one of them was offering Metallica MP3s for uploads''.

2_9	0.21582866	Metallica compiled 317,377 Napster usernames they allege were trading the band's tunes.
2_10	0.26445681	The band's drummer, Lars Ulrich, hand-delivered the list of usernames to Napster headquarters in San Mateo two weeks ago.
2_11	0.12530067	Napster responded by blocking access to those listed, but it also posted information on its Web site telling users how to file a counter notification if they felt they had been misidentified.
2_12	0.12330927	''The fact that so many people have come forward and disputed Metallica's accusation that they did not break the law demonstrates that this is not a black and white issue,'' Napster's 19-year-old founder Shawn Fanning said in a statement.
2_13	0.16315796	Meanwhile, Metallica's attorney said he expects another client, rap artist Dr.
2_14	0.16316653	Dre, to notify Napster on Wednesday of more than 200,000 users who illegally traded his music.

3_0	0.2777308	WASHINGTON _ Celebrity and politics collided Tuesday on Capitol Hill, as a rock musician joined online music executives and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss the effects on the recording industry of downloading music from the Internet.
3_1	0.17653493	Lars Ulrich, the drummer for the heavy-metal band Metallica, found what may have been an unexpected ally in Sen.
3_2	0.083029198	Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and chairman of the committee.
3_3	0.09446765	``Fair and reasonable licensing needs to take place; that is what I'm hearing,'' Hatch said at the conclusion of a three-hour hearing.
3_4	0.084378181	The meeting room was packed with young spectators, spilling into the hallway of the Hart Senate Building.
3_5	0.13473271	Hundreds lined up to get a view of Ulrich, or perhaps to gain some insight into the clash between the recording industry and online music outlets.
3_6	0.41002999	The Recording Industry Association of America, which represents major record labels, and several music groups have argued that software created by the online music start-up Napster permits individuals to steal copyrighted material.
3_7	0.16117592	Officials for the service, and their fans, contend that it simply allows for easy sharing and sampling of music.
3_8	0.29287436	To use the Napster service, which is free, users download software over the Internet that allows them to store and catalog their music on their own computers.
3_9	0.26512181	Napster posts those catalogs, and then enables users of the service to visit one another's computers over the Internet and share and download one another's music.
3_10	0.27718194	Ulrich said that ``if music is free for downloading, the music industry is not viable''.
3_11	0.13268105	Napster, he said, had ``hijacked'' his music.
3_12	0.076364942	``Like a carpenter who crafts a table gets to decide whether to keep it, sell it or give it away, shouldn't we have the same options''? he asked.
3_13	0.144584	In April, Metallica and the rapper Dr.
3_14	0.61108066	Dre sued Napster for copyright infringement.
3_15	0.17404416	A federal judge in Manhattan ruled this spring that another online music database, MP3.com, had violated copyright laws; the company has since settled with two labels.
3_16	0.091476205	But Congress has been reluctant to interfere in the private marketplace.
3_17	0.089928001	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
3_18	0.1325624	, the ranking minority member of the committee, said the intellectual property generated in the United States was ``the envy of the world''.
3_19	0.085364547	Leahy, who kept an open laptop computer in front of him throughout the hearing, noted that millions of young voters are paying close attention to the debate on intellectual property and the need for certain safeguards.
3_20	0.088792246	``History has shown that when new technologies emerge, they may initially seem to threaten to trump intellectual property protection,'' Leahy said.
3_21	0.078097469	``In the end, things get sorted out''.
3_22	0.091867162	But Leahy said that it is important both to ``protect the legitimate right'' of artists and to reward them for their work.
3_23	0.42390995	Hank Barry, the chief executive of Napster, based in San Mateo, Calif.
3_24	0.39750151	, said the company's Web site had attracted nearly 20 million users.
3_25	0.50729097	And he said that Napster was helping, not hurting the recording industry.
3_26	0.16981568	People are buying more records, he said, because they are able to sample and preview music before buying.
3_27	0.097117716	``Companies that hold copyrights on behalf of creators, and which control distribution of creative works, have a strong inclination to change copyright law from a balanced vehicle for public enrichment to an unbalanced engine of control,'' he said.
3_28	0.10176627	Barry said copyright holders were often reluctant to allow new technologies to emerge.
3_29	0.10273126	But, he said, innovations like radio, television, the cassette player and the videocassette recorder have ``proved to be a financial boon to these same concerned copyright holders''.
3_30	0.089594731	Rather than legislation from Congress, Barry called for a ``market-based solution that will benefit consumers''.
3_31	0.084173923	Others who testified Tuesday agreed.
3_32	0.090280107	Fred Ehrlich, president of new technology for Sony Music Entertainment, a unit of Sony Corp.

3_35	0.14917611	, president of Emusic.com, which charges and pays royalties to artists for recordings on the Internet, said that the government should strive to be more effective in enforcing current copyright laws.
3_36	0.10321968	And Roger McGuinn, of the folk-rock group the Byrds, said the issue was ``a lot of worrying about nothing''.
3_37	0.07981486	Ulrich, however, remained steadfast on legislative intervention.
3_38	0.084831328	``I think we're dreaming if you think we can work this out ourselves,'' he said.
3_39	0.079335605	``The differences are too deep on too many levels''.
3_40	0.083819899	As the debate entered the Senate, a group called Artists Against Piracy ran full-page advertisements Tuesday in several major newspapers.

3_42	0.2402009	Corporate donors to the group include the National Association of Recording Merchandisers, the Recording Industry Association of America and Walt Disney Co.
4_0	0.14327774	In February, when Texas Christian University administrators decided to block their Web-surfing students from entering a site called Napster, they did so because the site was causing the campus' computers to slow down.
4_1	0.29068568	So many students were logging onto Napster to download MP3 files _ electronic versions of songs _ that the computer's server kept crashing.
4_2	0.13978302	Upgraded hardware was eventually installed, lessening the problem, but the Napster music-community site remains off-limits to students.

4_29	0.21265655	Napster officials say the company isn't breaking the law because it does not directly provide the copyrighted music, just a way to get it.
4_30	0.13800316	``I'm a huge Metallica fan and therefore really sorry that they're going in this direction,'' Napster's founder, 19-year-old Shawn Fanning, said in a statement.

9_58	0.08935808	Despite the expectations others have of him, and that he has for himself, Fanning still tastes the sting of where he came from more than the sweetness of where he might be headed.

9_63	0.093982377	But what drove him to dream up Napster in the fall of 1998 _ with the help of his uncle's advice and later his seed money _ was more immediate.
9_64	0.12177841	His roommate was into downloading digital music and was constantly complaining about the inconsistent quality and the inadequacy of the search engines available.
9_65	0.089055722	Fanning decided he was the teenager to do something about it.

11_5	0.073391189	King said Tuesday.
11_6	0.4430885	Napster created software that allows people to share and swap MP3-formatted songs over the Internet without paying for the music.
11_7	0.13460084	The suit, filed by the band and its own production companies E/M Ventures and Creeping Death Music, seeks at least $10 million in damages.
11_8	0.36096509	The suit claims Napster violated federal copyright and racketeering laws by allowing its users to share and swap Metallica songs on the Internet without charge.
11_9	0.54143868	Napster is also fighting copyright infringement suits filed by rap artists Dr.
11_10	0.9692641	Dre and the Recording Industry Association of America trade group.

11_12	0.12260384	But each institution was dropped from the suit after blocking Napster permanently.
11_13	0.10280894	Napster lawyers have denied the claims and vowed to fight the suit.
11_14	0.25812912	However, King said Napster officials said they would block any users who violated copyright laws if Metallica could identify them.
11_15	0.10136611	So Metallica hired British online consulting firm NetPD to monitor Napster from Friday, April 28, to Sunday, April 30.
11_16	0.19154154	The firm found 335,435 distinct Napster users who offered an average of five Metallica songs for other Napster members.
11_17	0.16578372	The list includes the screen names used by the Napster members and enough information to identify the users' computers.
11_18	0.20863385	It's not clear how many Metallica songs were actually downloaded during that period, but King said the band contends any song offered by Napster users is illegal.
11_19	0.094565843	In an event staged for the media, Ulrich plans to show up at noon today at Napster headquarters on Fourth Avenue with the 60,000-page list contained in 30 cardboard boxes.

12_1	0.10101931	Wednesday the dispute is expected to take a significant turn that will pit musicians directly against their fans.
12_2	0.34159811	The heavy-metal band Metallica will seek to prevent 335,000 fans from using Napster, a service for sharing music collections over the Internet.
12_3	0.29690643	A lawyer for the band said the users, identified by their online handles, were making Metallica recordings available for others to copy.
12_4	0.1306942	Napster officials said Tuesday that under the law they would be obliged to bar anyone shown to have infringed copyright from using the service, though it was not clear what might prevent such users from reregistering.
12_5	0.11597412	In any case, the move is a potential blow to the explosively popular but embattled Napster, which was created last year and already faces several lawsuits.
12_6	0.10120287	The Metallica lawyer said that if the tactic succeeded, he would encourage similar moves by other musicians, thus potentially depriving Napster of thousands of users.
12_7	0.12293361	And with the musicians moving directly into the fray, the dispute is no longer between faceless record labels and Internet companies.
12_8	0.14427804	Already, tempers are flaring, with fans of Metallica, one of the most popular heavy metal bands of the last two decades, asserting the move may cause them to abandon a band they have followed with dogged loyalty.
12_9	0.13533427	``There are going to be Metallica CD burnings if they try this,'' said Rob Jones, founder of KNAC.com, a Web site catering to heavy-metal fans.
12_10	0.11368554	But Metallica sees the issue very differently, said its lawyer, Howard King.
12_11	0.15641859	He said Metallica spent millions of dollars to create and market an album and did not want to have the music traded freely online, depriving the band of the fruits of its investment.
12_12	0.10093129	``The band would like to sell some albums,'' King said.
12_13	0.11445383	He added that ``it is a lousy position to be in'' for Metallica to be at odds with its fans.
12_14	0.27605667	But he said that Napster has put Metallica in the position and forced the band to ``take a stand''.
12_15	0.25667345	That stand entailed hiring a company to visit Napster to compile a log of the online handles of Napster users who say they have Metallica music to offer.
12_16	0.29088465	King said he planned to hand over the list of names to Napster, which is based in San Mateo, Calif.
12_17	0.084222584	, in a collection of documents filling 30 cardboard boxes.
12_18	0.088335744	His plans were reported Tuesday by Cnet.com, an Internet news site.
12_19	0.45675877	Computer users who download the Napster software can then use the Napster site to list the music stored on their computers.
12_20	0.24892275	By so doing, they offer that music to the other Napster users, who in effect visit one another's computers over the Internet and listen to or download music.
12_21	0.37196157	Napster officials assert they are not involved in music piracy because the music is not kept on the company's computers.
12_22	0.23287872	Further, they say their users must comply with copyright law.
12_23	0.21869867	Elizabeth Brooks, vice president for marketing at Napster, said the company would expel users found to be ``legitimate infringers'' of copyright.
12_24	0.18800013	She said the company was obliged to take the step under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which stipulates that an online service is liable for copyright infringement if it is warned that a user is infringing a copyright and fails to act.
12_25	0.19853987	Brooks said the 335,000 fans represented less than 10 percent of Napster's ``several million'' users.
12_26	0.12461459	She declined to say how much music is available for trading through the service.
12_27	0.10238442	Until last week, when Metallica and the rapper Dr.

12_29	0.16846827	On another front in the digital music struggle, the industry won at least an initial victory last week when a federal judge ruled that another online music database, MP3.com, had violated copyright law.
12_30	0.19203412	Cliff Burnstein, one of Metallica's managers, said the band decided it needed to join the fight to make it clear that the dispute is not just about the interests of the record companies, but about the bands themselves.
12_31	0.094144024	``Even though the RIAA sued, they did it in a legalistic manner that didn't bring a lot of coverage,'' he said.
12_32	0.088994455	``We though this would bring the issue out more if we did it''.
12_33	0.12064531	Any rift between Metallica and its fans over Napster would be particularly striking, since the band's initial popularity in the early 1980s grew in part from a cassette demo tape, ``No Life Til Leather,'' that the band sent out free and encouraged fans to bootleg.
12_34	0.08762808	It is said to be among the most-traded cassette demo tapes in rock.
12_35	0.11400734	Burnstein said the band had a right to distribute music free then, but also had the right to ask for payment from fans for its current CDs.

12_37	0.14079362	Jones of KNAC.com said music fans did not feel they were costing the bands money by sharing music online.

13_1	0.22439747	Public relations firm Golon/Harris International has blocked employees from using the popular but controversial music swapping program because Napster was starting to sap the company's computer resources.
13_2	0.18677264	Numerous universities have already blocked or restricted use of Napster for various reasons, including copyright and bandwidth problems.
13_3	0.13918406	But Napster officials said there have been only a few scattered reports by Napster members or ``through the grapevine'' of the program causing similar problems in the workplace.
13_4	0.11842962	The latest came when Golon/Harris, which is based in Chicago and has offices in the United States, Britain and Japan, sent notice Tuesday to the more than 500 computer users in 13 company offices, including one in San Francisco.
13_5	0.080290125	The message: Napster is officially off-limits at work.
13_6	0.097519206	Barrett Buss, Golon/Harris vice president for information systems, said his first inkling that there might be a problem came when he noticed that 80 percent of the Internet traffic from one office was going to just one location _ Napster Inc.
13_7	0.39335943	in San Mateo, Calif.
13_8	0.13062033	``At that point, I got concerned that if 80 percent was going to Napster, how much of the bandwidth was left for e-mail'' and other business uses of the Internet, Buss said.
13_9	0.092157037	At the same time, Buss said the company was having problems backing up e-mail files in another office because a server no longer had the 4 gigabytes of hard-disk space needed to perform the operation.
13_10	0.083545103	Buss investigated and found employees had downloaded about 4.5 gigabytes worth of MP3 files.

20_2	0.22437727	Hatch said the Senate will keep ``a close eye'' on the raging copyright fight between the recording industry and Internet music distributors, such as San Mateo-based Napster, but will take no action now.
20_3	0.077671734	The committee's ranking Democrat, Patrick Leahy of Vermont agreed, adding that movie studios were once ``terrified'' of videotapes, which later turned into a major revenue stream for Hollywood.
20_4	0.099521479	``In the end, things get sorted out and new (technologies) offer new opportunities for artists and more choices for consumers,'' Leahy said.
20_5	0.074508363	``Let's not strangle the baby in the cradle''.
20_6	0.14305895	The copyright dispute has drawn intense lobbying in Washington from the software industry, recording companies, Hollywood studios and even book publishers as Internet distribution undermines ownership of ``intellectual property'' across the spectrum of copyrighted material.
20_7	0.093573291	Industry leaders liken unauthorized free Internet distribution of copyrighted work to theft, saying it robs artists of their livelihoods, strangles artistic creation and, ultimately, will harm consumers as the sources of creativity dry up.
20_8	0.08563308	Internet distributors contend that established industries are trying to stifle a hugely &LR; popular technology that will bring untold convenience and flexibility to consumers.
20_9	0.14302454	They say they want to preserve copyright protections but that recording studios have been reluctant to work with Web sites the studios view as competitors.
20_10	0.17985791	The distributors say the recording industry has hit them with huge lawsuits on the scale of those filed against tobacco companies, and that the suits could put them out of business.
20_11	0.16054006	In any event, some argued Tuesday that technologies such as Napster and a more sophisticated program called ``Gnutella'' _ a free software that allows users to download music from each other's computers rather than a central server _ are inherently uncontrollable.
20_12	0.075355674	Hatch even quoted Intel Chairman Andy Grove's prediction that ``the whole Internet could be rearchitected by Napster-like technology''.
20_13	0.081769746	Hatch, whose high-profile hearings on technology issues often indicate where Washington is headed, did not disappoint Tuesday, lining up the chief combatants of the music wars and packing Capitol Hill's most cavernous hearing room.
20_14	0.12131208	Metallica's Ulrich opened by accusing Napster of hijacking, piracy and theft of artistic property.
20_15	0.083504845	Describing Metallica's rise from rags to riches as ``the classic American dream come true,'' Ulrich compared a musician's right to own his music to a carpenter's right to own a table he crafts.
20_16	0.10070894	Ulrich recounted how his band was working earlier this year on a song for the movie ``Mission Impossible-2'' when members heard that radio stations were already playing versions of the work in progress.
20_17	0.36287808	The band traced the ``leaks'' to Napster and filed a lawsuit.
20_18	0.21209191	``My band authored the music which is Napster's lifeblood,'' Ulrich said.
20_19	0.10461868	``We should decide what happens to it, not Napster _ a company with no rights in our recordings, which never invested a penny in Metallica's music or had anything to do with its creation''.
20_20	0.37765264	Napster chief executive Hank Barry countered that the Web site's 20 million users have a right to ``share'' music under copyright law.
20_21	0.13465314	Barry argued that Internet distribution ``is helping, not hurting'' the music industry by allowing people to sample music before buying it, leading to more store sales.
20_22	0.14412075	And he said Internet distribution gives music lovers and artists unprecedented access to each other.
20_23	0.089311728	The Byrds co-ounder McGuinn agreed, charging that recording studios actually undercut artists rather than protect them.
20_24	0.10512625	Despite recording more than 25 records and such 1960s megahits as ``Mr.
20_25	0.08821494	Tambourine Man'' and ``Turn, Turn, Turn,'' McGuinn said he ``never saw any royalties'' from most of his work other than meager advances.
20_26	0.3057992	``The recording companies have ways of not paying,'' he said.
20_27	0.098109842	In 1994, McGuinn said he began recording traditional folk songs to preserve the genre and was led eventually to Internet distributor MP3.com, which paid him ``an unheard of'' 50 percent non-exclusive royalty and helped fuel a resurgence in folk music that he said the big recording companies had abandoned.
20_28	0.090333124	But such arguments had little sway with California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who took a much harder line than her colleagues on copyright infringement.
20_29	0.11963301	``To my way of thinking, Napster has found a method which entirely defeats copyright protection,'' Feinstein said.
20_30	0.088404687	Barry sharply countered, ``Sales are up, Senator,'' but Feinstein was undeterred.
20_31	0.090318882	``You could do the same thing with a book,'' she said.
20_32	0.081211355	``You could do the same thing with a movie.
20_33	0.093994122	You are essentially defeating any intellectual property copyright with your technology, all driven under the cloak of anonymity at the other end of a server''.
20_34	0.091333493	Barry replied that such charges have been levelled against every technological advance, ``from the piano roll to radio to cassettes to VCRs.
20_35	0.083809318	These horrible prophecies have not come true.
20_36	0.087459531	In every case it's been a financial boon'' to copyright holders and content producers.
20_37	0.14325368	Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of America, drew a sharp distinction between Napster and Gnutella, which pay no royalties, and such companies as MP3.com and Emusic.com of Redwood City, which do.
20_38	0.10350465	But Gene Kan, a University of California at Berkeley graduate in electrical engineering who helped develop Gnutella, said the ``toothpaste is already out of the tube'' and that Napster's 20 million users of today ``will be 100 million tomorrow''.
20_39	0.087238025	Attempts to ``lock up'' copyrighted material will be defeated eventually, Kan predicted.
20_40	0.11300357	Gene Hoffman, founder and CEO of Emusic.com of Redwood City, agreed that the convenience, flexibility and infinite availability of music on the Internet will upend the music industry's reliance on physical distribution.
20_41	0.086338415	But Hoffman said that while Emusic offers lower costs _ 99 cents for a single track and $8.99 for an album _ it still pays artists and cannot compete with free music.
20_42	0.09504768	``The reason my stock declined 70 percent is because Napster will invalidate the concept of paying for music,'' Hoffman said.
20_43	0.094253094	Although Hatch said Congress will take no action now, he warned that Washington will ``be watching very closely'' to see that ``fair and reasonable licensing'' takes place between recording studios and Internet distributors to make sure that artists are compensated _ and that Web sites get access to recordings.
21_0	0.59913103	Representatives of the heavy-metal band Metallica went Wednesday to the headquarters of Napster Inc.
21_1	0.22996843	with 13 boxes of papers said to list more than 300,000 computer users who, without the band's permission, had recently downloaded Metallica music from other users listed on Napster's Internet site.
21_2	0.30843054	Repeating statements made by band members Tuesday during an interview broadcast over the Internet, Howard King, the band's lawyer, said the band did not intend to bring any of the computer users into its previously filed lawsuit against Napster for copyright infringement.
21_3	0.21822225	He said that the names had been gathered and submitted to Napster after the company said it could not do anything to stop the free trade in Metallica songs without specific information about which Napster Web site users were involved.
21_4	0.10664438	Napster, through a lawyer, said Tuesday that it would review the papers and take steps to disable those users Metallica identified if the claims had been properly submitted.
21_5	0.10456147	The statement, issued by Laurence Pulgram, a San Francisco lawyer, went on to say that the result might be to force it to knock the users off its site.

22_0	0.4689371	SAN FRANCISCO _ In a major victory for the recording industry, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Napster online music service to stop permitting the exchange of copyrighted music owned by the major music labels.
22_1	0.26034765	Napster's lawyer said the decision could effectively shut down the service.
22_2	0.10207791	In granting the industry's request for a preliminary injunction, Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of U.S.
22_3	0.25401518	District Court in San Francisco ruled that the explosively popular Napster service was used primarily to trade copyrighted material, a behavior that Patel said Napster knew about.
22_4	0.39010685	``A majority of Napster users use the service to download and upload copyrighted music,'' the judge said.
22_5	0.077819499	The injunction is scheduled to take effect at midnight Friday and will continue pending trial.
22_6	0.14365569	The case has become the rallying point for competing interests in the unresolved copyright issues on the Internet, with lawyers, consumers, policy-makers and entrepreneurs watching closely.
22_7	0.14284813	And legal experts have said the implications for the case extend beyond music, to the sharing of other media like movies, and may set a tone for how intellectual property law is defined on the Internet.
22_8	0.24087148	David Boies, the lead lawyer for Napster, said the company would immediately appeal.
22_9	0.18148297	He said that Napster did not have the ability to sift out which of the millions of songs on Napster represented copyrighted works owned by the plaintiffs and which did not.
22_10	0.077546889	This injunction ``does not give us any fair ability to comply and still operate,'' Boies said.
22_11	0.24096115	Hank Barry, interim chief executive of Napster, held an Internet Webcast to address the ruling to Napster's users; the company says 20 million people have downloaded its software.
22_12	0.18604988	The recording industry declared the decision a major and complete victory.
22_13	0.2035414	``This sends the message to others who are building businesses based on other people's copyrighted works without permission,'' said Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording Industry Association of America.
22_14	0.19238872	``From the judge's language, this was not a close call,'' said Howard King, who represents the rock group Metallica and the artist Dr.
22_15	0.1545843	Dre in separate lawsuits against Napster.
22_16	0.073857588	King called the decision a ``huge win''.
22_17	0.10411406	The recording association said it would post a $5 million bond requested by the judge against any financial losses Napster could suffer from being shut down pending the trial.
22_18	0.11972775	Napster had asked for a bond of at least $800 million.

22_21	0.23691638	Other Napster users then can listen to or download music kept on others' computers.
22_22	0.10442797	It is not alone; other services that permit file sharing, like Gnutella, have grown, too.
22_23	0.24186635	Last week, the recording industry and the movie industry filed a lawsuit seeking to shut down Scour Exchange, a Los Angeles-based Internet service that lets users download music and video files.
22_24	0.10352663	The legal battle over Napster began in December when Time Warner Inc.
22_25	0.079312499	, the Sony Corp.
22_26	0.56360067	, Bertelsmann and other record companies, represented by the recording association, sued the service for copyright infringement.
22_27	0.44766231	From a technical legal standpoint, the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents major record labels, asserts Napster is guilty of contributory copyright infringement.
22_28	0.2205039	The industry contends that Napster has built a business by encouraging individual users to share files of music they do not own.
22_29	0.14846124	But Napster says its users are doing nothing wrong, and therefore it is doing nothing wrong.
22_30	0.15477565	Rather, the company says, they are engaging en masse in a practice that has been permitted all along _ the copying of music and other media for personal use.
22_31	0.19156508	Patel concluded that Napster users were engaged in ``wholesale infringing,'' and that the users were not engaged in ``typical personal use of music copies, as Napster lawyers asserted''.
22_32	0.17550804	Moreover, she said the users reaped economic advantage from making copies on the Napster service by getting music free they might ordinarily pay for.
22_33	0.21509343	In seeking the preliminary injunction, lawyers for the recording industry said Napster was on pace to have 70 million users within six months.
22_34	0.21462957	The lawyers said Napster users already downloaded 14,000 songs a minute.
22_35	0.17312817	``This is the most egregious case of massive copyright infringement that has ever existed,'' Russell Frackman, a record label lawyer, told the judge.
22_36	0.10071504	Boies, who represented the government in its antitrust case against Microsoft, said that an injunction should not be granted because it would have the side effect of impinging on Napster's uses that do not infringe on copyrights, like sharing works that do not have copyrights.
22_37	0.076203949	Boies cited the U.S.
22_38	0.093827327	Supreme Court's 1984 decision that Sony was not guilty of contributory copyright violation with its Betamax videocassette recorder, in part because the device was ``capable of substantial noninfringing uses''.
22_39	0.080267532	But Patel did not accept the argument.
22_40	0.10469214	``While Napster may be capable of some other things, they seem to pale in comparison to what Napster was created for,'' she said.
22_41	0.0951826	The two sides wielded competing studies to show Napster's impact, or lack thereof, on music sales.
22_42	0.10649687	One study, commissioned by Napster and prepared by Peter S.
22_43	0.12287868	Fader, associate professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, found that ``over 91 percent of Napster users buy as much or more music than before they used Napster, with 28 percent purchasing more''.
22_44	0.10903194	Meanwhile, according to a survey the recording association commissioned from the Field Research Corp.
22_45	0.17649459	, a San Francisco-based research firm, 22 percent of Napster users said that because of Napster, they did not buy CDs any more or they bought fewer CDs.
22_46	0.12440589	Patel suggested that by the time of the trial, more work on the effect of Napster would have to be done, noting that none of the studies presented were ``without flaws.''
23_0	0.16794638	Embattled software startup Napster Inc.
23_1	0.32663764	said Wednesday that it has blocked access to more than 300,000 Napster users who the rock group Metallica said were swapping illegal copies of their songs.
23_2	0.17827458	But in an attempt to shift blame to the heavy-metal band, the San Mateo company said it would reinstate anyone who lodged a formal protest that they were mistakenly named by Metallica.
23_3	0.11336088	Reactivation of the account would take 10 to 14 business days as long as the band doesn't sue the individual first.

23_8	0.10633913	Metallica attorney Howard K.
23_9	0.20063947	King said the band still had no intention of suing individual fans and that it was ``outrageous'' Napster was trying to shift blame to Metallica.
