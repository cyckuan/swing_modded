0_3	0.091967706	If he'd been busted, I somehow doubt that any major corporations would have come to his defense.
0_4	0.097203309	But some purveyors of stolen goods have friends in high places.
0_5	0.11975135	Just look at who's going to bat for Napster, the Internet music-swapping company.
0_6	0.23420608	At the behest of the recording industry, US District Judge Marilyn Patel last month issued a sweeping injunction against Napster, where millions of music lovers swap digital copies of their favorite tunes without paying for them.
0_7	0.12685485	Essentially, Patel agreed with music industry executives _ and me _ that Napster's primary business is the facilitation of thievery.
0_8	0.16171422	She ordered Napster to stop its users from trafficking in copyrighted music.
0_9	0.093744038	An Appeals Court stayed Patel's order, giving Napster's stunned legal team an opportunity to recoup.
0_10	0.13452955	Meanwhile, an extraordinary group of Napster sympathizers has begun to rally around the company.
0_11	0.075980462	The Association of American Physicians &AMP; Surgeons has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, along with Eagle Forum, a conservative group best known for its successful campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment.
0_12	0.13480877	Both groups say the Napster injunction menaces the free exchange of ideas over the Internet.
0_13	0.10369977	They warn that corporations may use the Napster ruling to limit online criticism of their products.
0_14	0.037878918	``What if the owner of (the drug) Ritalin asserted its intellectual property rights, and demanded that Yahoo only provide authorized links on Ritalin''? this brief thunders.
0_15	0.089416354	``The outcome would be that criticism of the use of Ritalin would be effectively silenced''.
0_16	0.17572939	But the record companies aren't complaining about people who post scathing reviews of the new Metallica album.
0_17	0.094658604	They're upset about people stealing it, with the help of a company founded to facilitate such theft.
0_18	0.098007868	Consider the following quote from a Napster official: ``We are not just making pirated music available, but pushing demand''.
0_19	0.098847927	A rather more serious objection to Patel's ruling comes from a powerful coalition of technology firms _ the Consumer Electronics Association, the Digital Future Coalition, and the Computer &AMP; Communications Industry Association.
0_20	0.090859684	Among them, these three groups represent most of the world's biggest providers of computer hardware and software, home electronics gear, and Internet services.
0_21	0.054786722	Peter Jaszi, a law professor at American University, helped write this amicus brief.
0_22	0.12597335	It doesn't exactly amount to a ringing defense of Napster _ ``The brief certainly doesn't say that Napster should win or Napster should lose,'' Jaszi insists.
0_23	0.082176536	Still, their argument takes aim at the heart of Patel's ruling, by making a point with a good deal of merit.
0_24	0.089829181	``When there are technologies that have multiple uses, some obviously good and some perhaps bad, copyright law ought not to be a means for stamping out those technologies,'' Jaszi argues.
0_25	0.082016118	Imagine what would have happened in the early 1980s if the movie studios had succeeded in halting the sale of video cassette recorders?

0_29	0.0835127	People would launch a trade in illegally copied movie and TV programs that would cost the studios billions.
0_30	0.090047061	There was only one solution _ ban Betamax.
0_31	0.092267184	Believe it or not, a federal Appeals Court agreed.
0_32	0.085494096	Fortunately, the US Supreme Court stepped in.
0_33	0.088841501	In 1984, the court ruled that even if VCRs could be used to steal the studios' intellectual property, the devices also had many legitimate uses.
0_34	0.088546924	It would therefore be foolish to ban the technology altogether, merely to prevent its abuse.
0_35	0.0938214	It's a telling argument that suffers from a single flaw _ Patel didn't try to ban Napster.
0_36	0.11616115	Her ruling leaves the company free to offer its service to those who trade in legal copies of digital music.
0_37	0.090790848	The fact that this restriction threatens the company's doom tells you all you need to know.
0_38	0.11743506	It's a tacit admission of the obvious _ the Napster business model is all about trading in stolen goods.
0_39	0.11046939	Yes, I know that Napster alternatives like Gnutella and Freenet ensure that the music thefts will continue.
0_40	0.083429343	But that doesn't change the fact that Napster has been well and truly busted, for forgetting something I learned at my father's knee _ dealers in hot merchandise generally get burned.

1_0	0.26714196	SAN FRANCISCO _ The battle over music in cyberspace spilled onto the streets of San Mateo, Calif.
1_1	0.35459679	, Wednesday as Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich jawed with fans of Napster, the popular and controversial music-sharing software.
1_2	0.22211036	The leader of the well-known heavy metal band showed up at the Fourth Street headquarters of Napster Inc.
1_3	0.30861519	to deliver the names of 335,435 Napster users who made 1.45 million Metallica songs available for free downloads last weekend.
1_4	0.20039199	But while Ulrich spoke to the assembled throng of reporters and photographers about Metallica's request to have Napster cut off those users, he was constantly heckled by irked Metallica fans who shouted ``Long live Napster'' and ``We just want to hear the music''.
1_5	0.12333459	At one point during the media event orchestrated by Metallica, Ulrich debated with a Napster fan.
1_6	0.13877732	And after Ulrich left, a longtime Metallica fan named Tony smashed his collection of Metallica CDs and tossed the plastic slivers on the ground in protest.
1_7	0.1607349	``Why can't we listen to their music on the Internet''? asked the 36-year-old San Francisco resident, who didn't want his last name used for fear of being hounded by Metallica's lawyers.
1_8	0.38123452	Metallica, which is suing Napster for copyright infringement, is seeking $10 million in damages.
1_9	0.10655471	On one side of the controversy are artists like Metallica, who believe that upstarts like Napster are robbing them of royalties and their livelihoods.
1_10	0.13340338	On the other side are fans, who say the greedy artists and record companies are trying to rob them of their ability to enjoy a new way of listening to music.
1_11	0.14461788	Meanwhile, Napster, which portrays itself as being in the middle, issued a statement after the event, saying the company will review the 13 boxes of paper printouts delivered on handcarts by Ulrich and attorney Howard E.
1_12	0.21852276	King. ``If the claims are submitted properly, the company will take the appropriate actions to disable the users Metallica has identified,'' Napster attorney Laurence Pulgram said in a statement.
1_13	0.063987488	``Of course, if the band would provide the names in computerized form rather than in tens of thousands of pages of paper intended to create a photo opp, that would expedite the process,'' Pulgram said.
1_14	0.19750324	Pulgram also noted that Napster has no way to block specific artists or titles from being traded, so ``the upshot of Metallica's notice may be to prevent its fans from using Napster at all'' for any music.
1_15	0.26540123	Napster's only product is a free computer program that allows fans to freely swap via the Internet copies of songs converted into the MP3 compression format.
1_16	0.57831012	Metallica and rap artist Dr.
1_17	0.32792653	Dre have filed separate civil suits claiming the software violates copyright laws, but Napster says it is legally protected under a provision of the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act because it has no control over its users' actions.
1_18	0.21430227	A British online consulting company hired by Metallica monitored Napster use from April 28 to April 30 and identified the 335,435 Napster users, along with the group's songs available for free download.
1_19	0.11692828	The song ``Nothing Else Matters'' topped the Metallica hit list with 116,574 copies posted by 73,772 users.
1_20	0.24027762	The Napster members were identified by their user names, which they gave Napster when they registered to download the program, along with the location of the song on their hard drives and their numerical Internet Protocol address.
1_21	0.14066421	Napster users noted that even if they were denied access by Napster, they could easily reregister under a new user name.
1_22	0.1261399	Metallica lawyers said it would be up to Napster to stop offenders from reregistering.
1_23	0.116748	But Ulrich stressed that the band had no intention of hunting down and prosecuting any individual Napster users.
1_24	0.12928533	``This is not between Metallica and its fans,'' Ulrich said.
1_25	0.097554879	``This is between Metallica and Napster, let there be no question about that''.
1_26	0.087355007	And, he said, ``If we lose a bunch of fans over this, and we will, that doesn't discourage us from doing what we feel is right''.
1_27	0.18702009	Still, Ulrich, who has never visited Napster's Web site and admitted he ``can barely get on AOL,'' criticized the actions of Napster users as immoral.
1_28	0.11214381	``If they want to steal Metallica's music, instead of hiding behind their computers in their bedrooms and dorm rooms, then just go down to Tower Records and grab them off the shelves,'' Ulrich said.
1_29	0.12275928	Ulrich said he isn't opposed to online music, but said, ``We want online music to be on our conditions''.
1_30	0.10537832	That didn't sit well with Roman Dzindzichashvili, a 54-year-old Napster user who drove from his Sausalito, Calif.
1_31	0.092823702	, home to give Ulrich a piece of his mind.
1_32	0.10509912	``This is ridiculous, this is very obnoxious and this is very selfish,'' said Dzindzichashvili, who said Napster has not stopped him from buying CDs.
1_33	0.10461974	Metallica's suit has ired other fans around the country.
1_34	0.10942814	Randy Grant, a Napster user from UCLA, said he doesn't understand why Metallica seems bent on angering his fellow ``Napsterians''.
1_35	0.082434792	``This whole issue reeks of greed and fear to me, but I am not so sure who are the greedy and scared ones _ Metallica, or the huge and powerful industry which they are a part of,'' Grant wrote in an e-mail.
1_36	0.22479366	Local copyright law expert Eric Doney believes Napster will ultimately lose in court because the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was not designed to allow the type of music sharing promoted by Napster.
1_37	0.048213683	``I don't think they have a prayer,'' said Doney, an attorney with Donahue, Gallagher, Woods &AMP; Wood in Oakland, Calif.
1_38	0.10176308	He also said the fact that Metallica was able to compile a list of alleged offenders means individual Napster users could have something to worry about.
1_39	0.081619892	``If Metallica or anyone else who is being infringed wanted to start picking people off to make an example of them, they could,'' Doney said.

2_1	0.111255	for allegedly swapping the heavy metal band's music want their access reinstated.
2_2	0.26867309	Napster said Tuesday it received notice from more than 30,000 MusicShare software users claiming they were misidentified as persons illegally trading Metallica's copyrighted songs in the popular MP3 digital format.
2_3	0.21797609	If Metallica does not take legal action against individual users within 10 days of Tuesday's notice, Napster will restore those blocked accounts, citing federal copyright law.
2_4	0.11157186	Napster has begun forwarding those petitions to Metallica's attorney, who disputed their claims.
2_5	0.059654254	''They're (the users) absolutely lying.

2_7	0.09848072	''Each and every one of them was offering Metallica MP3s for uploads''.
2_8	0.49022155	Metallica sued the company last month for copyright infringement and racketeering, alleging that Napster's software encouraged users to freely trade the band's songs without permission.
2_9	0.22643523	Metallica compiled 317,377 Napster usernames they allege were trading the band's tunes.
2_10	0.30322835	The band's drummer, Lars Ulrich, hand-delivered the list of usernames to Napster headquarters in San Mateo two weeks ago.
2_11	0.15226215	Napster responded by blocking access to those listed, but it also posted information on its Web site telling users how to file a counter notification if they felt they had been misidentified.
2_12	0.14602933	''The fact that so many people have come forward and disputed Metallica's accusation that they did not break the law demonstrates that this is not a black and white issue,'' Napster's 19-year-old founder Shawn Fanning said in a statement.
2_13	0.19064832	Meanwhile, Metallica's attorney said he expects another client, rap artist Dr.

3_0	0.32445554	WASHINGTON _ Celebrity and politics collided Tuesday on Capitol Hill, as a rock musician joined online music executives and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss the effects on the recording industry of downloading music from the Internet.
3_1	0.13018246	Lars Ulrich, the drummer for the heavy-metal band Metallica, found what may have been an unexpected ally in Sen.
3_2	0.10257451	Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and chairman of the committee.
3_3	0.091953816	``Fair and reasonable licensing needs to take place; that is what I'm hearing,'' Hatch said at the conclusion of a three-hour hearing.
3_4	0.089301046	The meeting room was packed with young spectators, spilling into the hallway of the Hart Senate Building.
3_5	0.10832467	Hundreds lined up to get a view of Ulrich, or perhaps to gain some insight into the clash between the recording industry and online music outlets.
3_6	0.43042604	The Recording Industry Association of America, which represents major record labels, and several music groups have argued that software created by the online music start-up Napster permits individuals to steal copyrighted material.
3_7	0.1093328	Officials for the service, and their fans, contend that it simply allows for easy sharing and sampling of music.
3_8	0.24952963	To use the Napster service, which is free, users download software over the Internet that allows them to store and catalog their music on their own computers.
3_9	0.26591389	Napster posts those catalogs, and then enables users of the service to visit one another's computers over the Internet and share and download one another's music.
3_10	0.13600115	Ulrich said that ``if music is free for downloading, the music industry is not viable''.
3_11	0.13895328	Napster, he said, had ``hijacked'' his music.
3_12	0.061169789	``Like a carpenter who crafts a table gets to decide whether to keep it, sell it or give it away, shouldn't we have the same options''? he asked.
3_13	0.15518865	In April, Metallica and the rapper Dr.
3_14	0.81650523	Dre sued Napster for copyright infringement.
3_15	0.18764178	A federal judge in Manhattan ruled this spring that another online music database, MP3.com, had violated copyright laws; the company has since settled with two labels.
3_16	0.089626999	But Congress has been reluctant to interfere in the private marketplace.
3_17	0.026636365	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
3_18	0.13896992	, the ranking minority member of the committee, said the intellectual property generated in the United States was ``the envy of the world''.
3_19	0.076438528	Leahy, who kept an open laptop computer in front of him throughout the hearing, noted that millions of young voters are paying close attention to the debate on intellectual property and the need for certain safeguards.
3_20	0.098668787	``History has shown that when new technologies emerge, they may initially seem to threaten to trump intellectual property protection,'' Leahy said.
3_21	0.095609755	``In the end, things get sorted out''.
3_22	0.094542462	But Leahy said that it is important both to ``protect the legitimate right'' of artists and to reward them for their work.
3_23	0.37679724	Hank Barry, the chief executive of Napster, based in San Mateo, Calif.
3_24	0.35147022	, said the company's Web site had attracted nearly 20 million users.
3_25	0.19580942	And he said that Napster was helping, not hurting the recording industry.
3_26	0.12570276	People are buying more records, he said, because they are able to sample and preview music before buying.
3_27	0.096071699	``Companies that hold copyrights on behalf of creators, and which control distribution of creative works, have a strong inclination to change copyright law from a balanced vehicle for public enrichment to an unbalanced engine of control,'' he said.
3_28	0.092973967	Barry said copyright holders were often reluctant to allow new technologies to emerge.
3_29	0.11188824	But, he said, innovations like radio, television, the cassette player and the videocassette recorder have ``proved to be a financial boon to these same concerned copyright holders''.
3_30	0.093868604	Rather than legislation from Congress, Barry called for a ``market-based solution that will benefit consumers''.
3_31	0.087941787	Others who testified Tuesday agreed.
3_32	0.066935078	Fred Ehrlich, president of new technology for Sony Music Entertainment, a unit of Sony Corp.

3_35	0.14905187	, president of Emusic.com, which charges and pays royalties to artists for recordings on the Internet, said that the government should strive to be more effective in enforcing current copyright laws.
3_36	0.10048505	And Roger McGuinn, of the folk-rock group the Byrds, said the issue was ``a lot of worrying about nothing''.
3_37	0.094298985	Ulrich, however, remained steadfast on legislative intervention.
3_38	0.090094996	``I think we're dreaming if you think we can work this out ourselves,'' he said.
3_39	0.090368565	``The differences are too deep on too many levels''.
3_40	0.071078574	As the debate entered the Senate, a group called Artists Against Piracy ran full-page advertisements Tuesday in several major newspapers.

3_42	0.20053169	Corporate donors to the group include the National Association of Recording Merchandisers, the Recording Industry Association of America and Walt Disney Co.
4_0	0.15325951	In February, when Texas Christian University administrators decided to block their Web-surfing students from entering a site called Napster, they did so because the site was causing the campus' computers to slow down.
4_1	0.24419147	So many students were logging onto Napster to download MP3 files _ electronic versions of songs _ that the computer's server kept crashing.

4_28	0.093056536	But we want to control how that's done, just like we've always controlled what we make''.
4_29	0.14674871	Napster officials say the company isn't breaking the law because it does not directly provide the copyrighted music, just a way to get it.
4_30	0.13121091	``I'm a huge Metallica fan and therefore really sorry that they're going in this direction,'' Napster's founder, 19-year-old Shawn Fanning, said in a statement.

11_5	0.092204249	King said Tuesday.
11_6	0.27543179	Napster created software that allows people to share and swap MP3-formatted songs over the Internet without paying for the music.
11_7	0.14777639	The suit, filed by the band and its own production companies E/M Ventures and Creeping Death Music, seeks at least $10 million in damages.
11_8	0.36729985	The suit claims Napster violated federal copyright and racketeering laws by allowing its users to share and swap Metallica songs on the Internet without charge.
11_9	0.3502802	Napster is also fighting copyright infringement suits filed by rap artists Dr.
11_10	0.5564473	Dre and the Recording Industry Association of America trade group.
11_11	0.29024373	The Metallica suit originally named three colleges, the University of Southern California, Yale University and Indiana University, that the band said were allowing use of Napster by their students.
11_12	0.10310021	But each institution was dropped from the suit after blocking Napster permanently.
11_13	0.097020574	Napster lawyers have denied the claims and vowed to fight the suit.
11_14	0.2316799	However, King said Napster officials said they would block any users who violated copyright laws if Metallica could identify them.
11_15	0.09797758	So Metallica hired British online consulting firm NetPD to monitor Napster from Friday, April 28, to Sunday, April 30.
11_16	0.19877876	The firm found 335,435 distinct Napster users who offered an average of five Metallica songs for other Napster members.
11_17	0.12845886	The list includes the screen names used by the Napster members and enough information to identify the users' computers.
11_18	0.21053902	It's not clear how many Metallica songs were actually downloaded during that period, but King said the band contends any song offered by Napster users is illegal.
11_19	0.090496559	In an event staged for the media, Ulrich plans to show up at noon today at Napster headquarters on Fourth Avenue with the 60,000-page list contained in 30 cardboard boxes.

12_1	0.092168673	Wednesday the dispute is expected to take a significant turn that will pit musicians directly against their fans.
12_2	0.27121724	The heavy-metal band Metallica will seek to prevent 335,000 fans from using Napster, a service for sharing music collections over the Internet.
12_3	0.20412481	A lawyer for the band said the users, identified by their online handles, were making Metallica recordings available for others to copy.
12_4	0.13171127	Napster officials said Tuesday that under the law they would be obliged to bar anyone shown to have infringed copyright from using the service, though it was not clear what might prevent such users from reregistering.
12_5	0.10142936	In any case, the move is a potential blow to the explosively popular but embattled Napster, which was created last year and already faces several lawsuits.
12_6	0.097263935	The Metallica lawyer said that if the tactic succeeded, he would encourage similar moves by other musicians, thus potentially depriving Napster of thousands of users.
12_7	0.10143702	And with the musicians moving directly into the fray, the dispute is no longer between faceless record labels and Internet companies.
12_8	0.15928006	Already, tempers are flaring, with fans of Metallica, one of the most popular heavy metal bands of the last two decades, asserting the move may cause them to abandon a band they have followed with dogged loyalty.
12_9	0.147506	``There are going to be Metallica CD burnings if they try this,'' said Rob Jones, founder of KNAC.com, a Web site catering to heavy-metal fans.
12_10	0.099393484	But Metallica sees the issue very differently, said its lawyer, Howard King.
12_11	0.16653676	He said Metallica spent millions of dollars to create and market an album and did not want to have the music traded freely online, depriving the band of the fruits of its investment.
12_12	0.095669316	``The band would like to sell some albums,'' King said.
12_13	0.10155921	He added that ``it is a lousy position to be in'' for Metallica to be at odds with its fans.
12_14	0.15169069	But he said that Napster has put Metallica in the position and forced the band to ``take a stand''.
12_15	0.24752375	That stand entailed hiring a company to visit Napster to compile a log of the online handles of Napster users who say they have Metallica music to offer.
12_16	0.1750016	King said he planned to hand over the list of names to Napster, which is based in San Mateo, Calif.
12_17	0.080035411	, in a collection of documents filling 30 cardboard boxes.
12_18	0.086669831	His plans were reported Tuesday by Cnet.com, an Internet news site.
12_19	0.28127666	Computer users who download the Napster software can then use the Napster site to list the music stored on their computers.
12_20	0.22408103	By so doing, they offer that music to the other Napster users, who in effect visit one another's computers over the Internet and listen to or download music.
12_21	0.20571295	Napster officials assert they are not involved in music piracy because the music is not kept on the company's computers.
12_22	0.1206004	Further, they say their users must comply with copyright law.
12_23	0.20815245	Elizabeth Brooks, vice president for marketing at Napster, said the company would expel users found to be ``legitimate infringers'' of copyright.
12_24	0.19445078	She said the company was obliged to take the step under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which stipulates that an online service is liable for copyright infringement if it is warned that a user is infringing a copyright and fails to act.
12_25	0.19380204	Brooks said the 335,000 fans represented less than 10 percent of Napster's ``several million'' users.
12_26	0.094515433	She declined to say how much music is available for trading through the service.
12_27	0.11058411	Until last week, when Metallica and the rapper Dr.

12_29	0.16399889	On another front in the digital music struggle, the industry won at least an initial victory last week when a federal judge ruled that another online music database, MP3.com, had violated copyright law.
12_30	0.18476087	Cliff Burnstein, one of Metallica's managers, said the band decided it needed to join the fight to make it clear that the dispute is not just about the interests of the record companies, but about the bands themselves.

12_32	0.089332532	``We though this would bring the issue out more if we did it''.
12_33	0.12955657	Any rift between Metallica and its fans over Napster would be particularly striking, since the band's initial popularity in the early 1980s grew in part from a cassette demo tape, ``No Life Til Leather,'' that the band sent out free and encouraged fans to bootleg.
12_34	0.087839609	It is said to be among the most-traded cassette demo tapes in rock.
12_35	0.10664617	Burnstein said the band had a right to distribute music free then, but also had the right to ask for payment from fans for its current CDs.

12_37	0.11883843	Jones of KNAC.com said music fans did not feel they were costing the bands money by sharing music online.

13_1	0.28448807	Public relations firm Golon/Harris International has blocked employees from using the popular but controversial music swapping program because Napster was starting to sap the company's computer resources.
13_2	0.15137888	Numerous universities have already blocked or restricted use of Napster for various reasons, including copyright and bandwidth problems.
13_3	0.13072743	But Napster officials said there have been only a few scattered reports by Napster members or ``through the grapevine'' of the program causing similar problems in the workplace.
13_4	0.17769155	The latest came when Golon/Harris, which is based in Chicago and has offices in the United States, Britain and Japan, sent notice Tuesday to the more than 500 computer users in 13 company offices, including one in San Francisco.
13_5	0.10604147	The message: Napster is officially off-limits at work.
13_6	0.13275385	Barrett Buss, Golon/Harris vice president for information systems, said his first inkling that there might be a problem came when he noticed that 80 percent of the Internet traffic from one office was going to just one location _ Napster Inc.
13_7	0.57312956	in San Mateo, Calif.
13_8	0.18826883	``At that point, I got concerned that if 80 percent was going to Napster, how much of the bandwidth was left for e-mail'' and other business uses of the Internet, Buss said.
13_9	0.11166765	At the same time, Buss said the company was having problems backing up e-mail files in another office because a server no longer had the 4 gigabytes of hard-disk space needed to perform the operation.
13_10	0.084101857	Buss investigated and found employees had downloaded about 4.5 gigabytes worth of MP3 files.

20_2	0.26948338	Hatch said the Senate will keep ``a close eye'' on the raging copyright fight between the recording industry and Internet music distributors, such as San Mateo-based Napster, but will take no action now.
20_3	0.029848801	The committee's ranking Democrat, Patrick Leahy of Vermont agreed, adding that movie studios were once ``terrified'' of videotapes, which later turned into a major revenue stream for Hollywood.
20_4	0.08963738	``In the end, things get sorted out and new (technologies) offer new opportunities for artists and more choices for consumers,'' Leahy said.
20_5	0.090471051	``Let's not strangle the baby in the cradle''.
20_6	0.19816166	The copyright dispute has drawn intense lobbying in Washington from the software industry, recording companies, Hollywood studios and even book publishers as Internet distribution undermines ownership of ``intellectual property'' across the spectrum of copyrighted material.
20_7	0.11136575	Industry leaders liken unauthorized free Internet distribution of copyrighted work to theft, saying it robs artists of their livelihoods, strangles artistic creation and, ultimately, will harm consumers as the sources of creativity dry up.
20_8	0.08352267	Internet distributors contend that established industries are trying to stifle a hugely &LR; popular technology that will bring untold convenience and flexibility to consumers.
20_9	0.12196018	They say they want to preserve copyright protections but that recording studios have been reluctant to work with Web sites the studios view as competitors.
20_10	0.18502811	The distributors say the recording industry has hit them with huge lawsuits on the scale of those filed against tobacco companies, and that the suits could put them out of business.
20_11	0.22029198	In any event, some argued Tuesday that technologies such as Napster and a more sophisticated program called ``Gnutella'' _ a free software that allows users to download music from each other's computers rather than a central server _ are inherently uncontrollable.
20_12	0.060162108	Hatch even quoted Intel Chairman Andy Grove's prediction that ``the whole Internet could be rearchitected by Napster-like technology''.
20_13	0.073739679	Hatch, whose high-profile hearings on technology issues often indicate where Washington is headed, did not disappoint Tuesday, lining up the chief combatants of the music wars and packing Capitol Hill's most cavernous hearing room.
20_14	0.12469275	Metallica's Ulrich opened by accusing Napster of hijacking, piracy and theft of artistic property.
20_15	0.06853331	Describing Metallica's rise from rags to riches as ``the classic American dream come true,'' Ulrich compared a musician's right to own his music to a carpenter's right to own a table he crafts.
20_16	0.11854377	Ulrich recounted how his band was working earlier this year on a song for the movie ``Mission Impossible-2'' when members heard that radio stations were already playing versions of the work in progress.
20_17	0.17014753	The band traced the ``leaks'' to Napster and filed a lawsuit.
20_18	0.19351602	``My band authored the music which is Napster's lifeblood,'' Ulrich said.
20_19	0.12416024	``We should decide what happens to it, not Napster _ a company with no rights in our recordings, which never invested a penny in Metallica's music or had anything to do with its creation''.
20_20	0.43938642	Napster chief executive Hank Barry countered that the Web site's 20 million users have a right to ``share'' music under copyright law.
20_21	0.1621951	Barry argued that Internet distribution ``is helping, not hurting'' the music industry by allowing people to sample music before buying it, leading to more store sales.
20_22	0.11590674	And he said Internet distribution gives music lovers and artists unprecedented access to each other.
20_23	0.090891686	The Byrds co-ounder McGuinn agreed, charging that recording studios actually undercut artists rather than protect them.
20_24	0.10461864	Despite recording more than 25 records and such 1960s megahits as ``Mr.
20_25	0.061590408	Tambourine Man'' and ``Turn, Turn, Turn,'' McGuinn said he ``never saw any royalties'' from most of his work other than meager advances.
20_26	0.16256414	``The recording companies have ways of not paying,'' he said.
20_27	0.1080158	In 1994, McGuinn said he began recording traditional folk songs to preserve the genre and was led eventually to Internet distributor MP3.com, which paid him ``an unheard of'' 50 percent non-exclusive royalty and helped fuel a resurgence in folk music that he said the big recording companies had abandoned.
20_28	0.092826632	But such arguments had little sway with California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who took a much harder line than her colleagues on copyright infringement.
20_29	0.12092489	``To my way of thinking, Napster has found a method which entirely defeats copyright protection,'' Feinstein said.
20_30	0.086602634	Barry sharply countered, ``Sales are up, Senator,'' but Feinstein was undeterred.
20_31	0.08947766	``You could do the same thing with a book,'' she said.
20_32	0.09097409	``You could do the same thing with a movie.
20_33	0.098739819	You are essentially defeating any intellectual property copyright with your technology, all driven under the cloak of anonymity at the other end of a server''.
20_34	0.076778936	Barry replied that such charges have been levelled against every technological advance, ``from the piano roll to radio to cassettes to VCRs.
20_35	0.092511679	These horrible prophecies have not come true.
20_36	0.094633754	In every case it's been a financial boon'' to copyright holders and content producers.
20_37	0.18137896	Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of America, drew a sharp distinction between Napster and Gnutella, which pay no royalties, and such companies as MP3.com and Emusic.com of Redwood City, which do.
20_38	0.12691046	But Gene Kan, a University of California at Berkeley graduate in electrical engineering who helped develop Gnutella, said the ``toothpaste is already out of the tube'' and that Napster's 20 million users of today ``will be 100 million tomorrow''.
20_39	0.089890528	Attempts to ``lock up'' copyrighted material will be defeated eventually, Kan predicted.
20_40	0.1389502	Gene Hoffman, founder and CEO of Emusic.com of Redwood City, agreed that the convenience, flexibility and infinite availability of music on the Internet will upend the music industry's reliance on physical distribution.
20_41	0.077110934	But Hoffman said that while Emusic offers lower costs _ 99 cents for a single track and $8.99 for an album _ it still pays artists and cannot compete with free music.
20_42	0.090437434	``The reason my stock declined 70 percent is because Napster will invalidate the concept of paying for music,'' Hoffman said.
20_43	0.10736955	Although Hatch said Congress will take no action now, he warned that Washington will ``be watching very closely'' to see that ``fair and reasonable licensing'' takes place between recording studios and Internet distributors to make sure that artists are compensated _ and that Web sites get access to recordings.
21_0	0.33200323	Representatives of the heavy-metal band Metallica went Wednesday to the headquarters of Napster Inc.
21_1	0.30085938	with 13 boxes of papers said to list more than 300,000 computer users who, without the band's permission, had recently downloaded Metallica music from other users listed on Napster's Internet site.
21_2	0.39239065	Repeating statements made by band members Tuesday during an interview broadcast over the Internet, Howard King, the band's lawyer, said the band did not intend to bring any of the computer users into its previously filed lawsuit against Napster for copyright infringement.
21_3	0.2800288	He said that the names had been gathered and submitted to Napster after the company said it could not do anything to stop the free trade in Metallica songs without specific information about which Napster Web site users were involved.
21_4	0.10763071	Napster, through a lawyer, said Tuesday that it would review the papers and take steps to disable those users Metallica identified if the claims had been properly submitted.
21_5	0.12918705	The statement, issued by Laurence Pulgram, a San Francisco lawyer, went on to say that the result might be to force it to knock the users off its site.

22_0	0.5040373	SAN FRANCISCO _ In a major victory for the recording industry, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Napster online music service to stop permitting the exchange of copyrighted music owned by the major music labels.
22_1	0.11805241	Napster's lawyer said the decision could effectively shut down the service.
22_2	0.09353749	In granting the industry's request for a preliminary injunction, Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of U.S.
22_3	0.29309275	District Court in San Francisco ruled that the explosively popular Napster service was used primarily to trade copyrighted material, a behavior that Patel said Napster knew about.
22_4	0.23560832	``A majority of Napster users use the service to download and upload copyrighted music,'' the judge said.
22_5	0.092089763	The injunction is scheduled to take effect at midnight Friday and will continue pending trial.
22_6	0.15308176	The case has become the rallying point for competing interests in the unresolved copyright issues on the Internet, with lawyers, consumers, policy-makers and entrepreneurs watching closely.
22_7	0.15427977	And legal experts have said the implications for the case extend beyond music, to the sharing of other media like movies, and may set a tone for how intellectual property law is defined on the Internet.
22_8	0.12824837	David Boies, the lead lawyer for Napster, said the company would immediately appeal.
22_9	0.18093068	He said that Napster did not have the ability to sift out which of the millions of songs on Napster represented copyrighted works owned by the plaintiffs and which did not.
22_10	0.092490298	This injunction ``does not give us any fair ability to comply and still operate,'' Boies said.
22_11	0.29268823	Hank Barry, interim chief executive of Napster, held an Internet Webcast to address the ruling to Napster's users; the company says 20 million people have downloaded its software.
22_12	0.11545992	The recording industry declared the decision a major and complete victory.
22_13	0.24120602	``This sends the message to others who are building businesses based on other people's copyrighted works without permission,'' said Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording Industry Association of America.
22_14	0.20702651	``From the judge's language, this was not a close call,'' said Howard King, who represents the rock group Metallica and the artist Dr.
22_15	0.16210722	Dre in separate lawsuits against Napster.
22_16	0.092798159	King called the decision a ``huge win''.
22_17	0.11101689	The recording association said it would post a $5 million bond requested by the judge against any financial losses Napster could suffer from being shut down pending the trial.
22_18	0.10043219	Napster had asked for a bond of at least $800 million.
22_19	0.40424718	Napster, a year-old company based in San Mateo, Calif.

22_21	0.13892498	Other Napster users then can listen to or download music kept on others' computers.
22_22	0.098267436	It is not alone; other services that permit file sharing, like Gnutella, have grown, too.
22_23	0.26512367	Last week, the recording industry and the movie industry filed a lawsuit seeking to shut down Scour Exchange, a Los Angeles-based Internet service that lets users download music and video files.
22_24	0.090996322	The legal battle over Napster began in December when Time Warner Inc.
22_25	0.094364836	, the Sony Corp.
22_26	0.46499935	, Bertelsmann and other record companies, represented by the recording association, sued the service for copyright infringement.
22_27	0.42693215	From a technical legal standpoint, the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents major record labels, asserts Napster is guilty of contributory copyright infringement.
22_28	0.15807335	The industry contends that Napster has built a business by encouraging individual users to share files of music they do not own.
22_29	0.099997694	But Napster says its users are doing nothing wrong, and therefore it is doing nothing wrong.
22_30	0.16587107	Rather, the company says, they are engaging en masse in a practice that has been permitted all along _ the copying of music and other media for personal use.
22_31	0.20699759	Patel concluded that Napster users were engaged in ``wholesale infringing,'' and that the users were not engaged in ``typical personal use of music copies, as Napster lawyers asserted''.
22_32	0.17734525	Moreover, she said the users reaped economic advantage from making copies on the Napster service by getting music free they might ordinarily pay for.
22_33	0.22523786	In seeking the preliminary injunction, lawyers for the recording industry said Napster was on pace to have 70 million users within six months.
22_34	0.16317343	The lawyers said Napster users already downloaded 14,000 songs a minute.
22_35	0.18681923	``This is the most egregious case of massive copyright infringement that has ever existed,'' Russell Frackman, a record label lawyer, told the judge.
22_36	0.11112105	Boies, who represented the government in its antitrust case against Microsoft, said that an injunction should not be granted because it would have the side effect of impinging on Napster's uses that do not infringe on copyrights, like sharing works that do not have copyrights.
22_37	0.092659934	Boies cited the U.S.
22_38	0.10484487	Supreme Court's 1984 decision that Sony was not guilty of contributory copyright violation with its Betamax videocassette recorder, in part because the device was ``capable of substantial noninfringing uses''.
22_39	0.090596865	But Patel did not accept the argument.
22_40	0.09952109	``While Napster may be capable of some other things, they seem to pale in comparison to what Napster was created for,'' she said.
22_41	0.079022422	The two sides wielded competing studies to show Napster's impact, or lack thereof, on music sales.
22_42	0.098903145	One study, commissioned by Napster and prepared by Peter S.
22_43	0.1379762	Fader, associate professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, found that ``over 91 percent of Napster users buy as much or more music than before they used Napster, with 28 percent purchasing more''.
22_44	0.10174224	Meanwhile, according to a survey the recording association commissioned from the Field Research Corp.
22_45	0.17854127	, a San Francisco-based research firm, 22 percent of Napster users said that because of Napster, they did not buy CDs any more or they bought fewer CDs.
22_46	0.12864793	Patel suggested that by the time of the trial, more work on the effect of Napster would have to be done, noting that none of the studies presented were ``without flaws.''
23_0	0.34512157	Embattled software startup Napster Inc.
23_1	0.29528718	said Wednesday that it has blocked access to more than 300,000 Napster users who the rock group Metallica said were swapping illegal copies of their songs.
23_2	0.19127288	But in an attempt to shift blame to the heavy-metal band, the San Mateo company said it would reinstate anyone who lodged a formal protest that they were mistakenly named by Metallica.
23_3	0.11398003	Reactivation of the account would take 10 to 14 business days as long as the band doesn't sue the individual first.

23_8	0.25353469	Metallica attorney Howard K.
23_9	0.13262619	King said the band still had no intention of suing individual fans and that it was ``outrageous'' Napster was trying to shift blame to Metallica.
