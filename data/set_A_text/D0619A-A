9_2	0.0	William ``Pete'' Knight, R-Palmdale, is broadly supported by state Republicans.
9_3	0.1875	But Connerly, who led the campaign for the anti-affirmative action Proposition 209, said gay rights are a matter of personal freedom and not an area where the government should be involved.

9_5	0.42857142857142855	Thursday's statement by Connerly, GOP Senate candidate Tom Campbell, and state Assemblyman Jim Cunneen, R-San Jose, comes on the heels of several other public battles within the Republican Party.

10_0	0.12903225806451613	AUSTIN, Texas _ Because the Texas House race between Democratic incumbent Glen Maxey and Republican challenger Fred Ebner is the first in Texas history to feature two openly gay candidates, you'd think the two men would find it difficult to feud over the issue of sexual orientation.
10_1	0.4230769230769231	But the campaign for Austin's District 51 has taken a strange turn in its final days: Ebner and other gay Republicans are accusing Maxey _ the only openly gay member of the Texas House and an outspoken gay rights advocate _ of gay-baiting.
10_2	0.42857142857142855	Maxey, meanwhile, says Ebner is misleading voters about his sexual orientation.

10_8	0.9130434782608695	Ebner and the Log Cabin Republicans say the leaflet appears to have been sent only to people who voted in the Republican primary, and was intended to dampen GOP turnout by highlighting Ebner's sexual orientation and some of his socially moderate stands.

10_12	0.1111111111111111	Ebner said he considers his sexuality to be ``a private and personal matter which is irrelevant to holding public office,'' while Maxey has ``made a lifetime career of advocating a left/liberal approach to gay issues''.
10_13	0.0	Maxey said he sent the mailing because Ebner attacks him for being a gay advocate when he speaks to broader audiences, but tells gay groups that he can better represent their interests.
10_14	0.0	He said the leaflet didn't mention that he was gay because it is already well-known.
10_15	0.375	Maxey said he isn't gay-baiting because it was Ebner who injected sexual orientation into the campaign.

10_20	0.7894736842105263	The platform of the Texas Republican Party states that homosexuality ``is contrary to the fundamental, unchanging truths that have been ordained by God'' and opposes gay marriage and the repeal of sodomy laws.

10_22	0.5625	Steve Labinski, who is president of the group's Texas chapter, dismissed the idea that Ebner's campaign is designed to send a message to the Republican Party.

12_0	0.44	WASHINGTON _ In an intriguing campaign dance, John McCain has collected tens of thousands of dollars in contributions from members of a gay Republican group with whom he disagrees on a broad range of issues, from job-discrimination protection to benefits for same-sex couples.

15_0	0.11764705882352941	PHILADELPHIA _ As Republicans wrapped up their convention intended to highlight inclusiveness, gay political organizations squared off Thursday over whether the party has a newfound moderation toward homosexuals.
15_1	0.2777777777777778	Leaders of the nation's largest gay political organization said the GOP national convention demonstrated ``meanness'' toward gays and that the election of presidential nominee George W.
15_2	0.375	Bush and his running mate Dick Cheney would be a setback for gay rights.
15_3	0.0	``The verdict is in,'' Winnie Stachelberg, political director for the Human Rights Campaign, said as Bush prepared to deliver his acceptance speech.
15_4	0.42857142857142855	``A Bush-Cheney administration has the potential to be very harmful for gays and lesbians.
15_5	0.0	... It is clear that the kinder, gentler face we see at the convention is nothing more than a facade''.
15_6	0.1111111111111111	Elizabeth Birch, the group's executive director, said that the four-day affair was disappointing, even though the GOP sought to soften hard-line opposition to homosexual rights by allowing Rep.

15_8	0.0	, to address delegates.
15_9	0.3333333333333333	Kolbe is openly gay.
15_10	0.375	The gay rights officials spoke at a news conference in Washington, D.C.
15_11	0.0	The Human Rights Campaign already has endorsed Vice President Al Gore for president.
15_12	0.4	Birch said she was ```very disturbed'' by the GOP platform, which included language gay Republicans wanted removed.
15_13	0.0	Birch said ``a kind of meanness won out'' when the platform was finalized on Monday.
15_14	0.0	The platform defines marriage ``as the legal union of one man and one woman''.
15_15	0.0	It says that ``federal judges and bureaucrats should not force states to recognize other living arrangements as marriages''.
15_16	0.0	And the platform further says that homosexuals should be exempt from anti-discrimination laws and that homosexuality is incompatible with military service.
15_17	0.38461538461538464	Stachelberg said a low point for gays at the Republican convention was on Tuesday as Kolbe spoke to delegates in a four-minute speech on international trade.
15_18	0.16666666666666666	Several members of Bush's own Texas delegation removed their cowboy hats and bowed their heads in prayer.
15_19	0.0	Birch noted the irony of the Republican position, saying that Cheney's daughter Mary is openly lesbian.
15_20	0.08333333333333333	``The presence of Mary Cheney as an openly lesbian person shines a light on the fact that George W.

15_22	1.0952380952380953	But Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, the country's largest organization for gay Republicans, said despite the Kolbe incident and the platform, the convention was by far the most successful ever for homosexual Republicans.
15_23	1.2	Ivers said that the ``old social conservative paradigm'' in the Republican party this week ``is showing signs that is is crumbling''.
15_24	0.0	''We've seen real advances this week,`` he said, pointing to a platform committee that had initially removed the anti-gay language, only to be overruled by conservatives.
15_25	0.2222222222222222	The fact that Kolbe was asked to speak by Bush was a significant attempt at reaching out to gay Republicans, he said, adding that most of the 2,066 convention delegates applauded Kolbe heartily.
15_26	0.15384615384615385	One other indication that the party is warming to gays: there were more openly gay convention delegates (19) to this GOP convention than at any previous.
15_27	0.0	There were five gay delegates in 1996 and two alternates in 1992, Ivers said.
15_28	0.0	``This week was a success.
15_29	1.4444444444444444	We are at a turning point (in the Republican Party) on gay and lesbian issues,'' Ivers said.

15_33	0.0	Republicans also note that Cheney, while secretary of defense in 1991, supported his spokesman, Pete Williams, when he announced he was gay.

16_25	2.5714285714285716	Unlike Bush, however, McCain met with the Log Cabin Republicans.
16_26	0.0625	Asked during a television interview to explain his refusal to meet with the group, Bush said he didn't believe in ``group thought'' or ``pitting one group of people against another''.
16_27	0.0	Many were puzzled by that explanation, given that Bush frequently meets with other political and interest groups.
16_28	1.2941176470588236	Bush spokesman Scott McClellan shed little light on that response, saying Bush refused to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans because they politicize gay issues.
16_29	0.0	``He does not believe in politicizing the issue, and this is a group that wants to politicize it,'' McClellan said.
16_30	0.0	He added that Bush didn't see the point of meeting with the group because he disagrees with its positions.
16_31	0.14285714285714285	Nor would the Bush campaign say whether the governor agrees with the Texas GOP's platform position on gays and lesbians, which is that ``homosexual behavior is contrary to the fundamental, unchanging truths that have been ordained by God''.
16_32	0.0	Instead, campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said that Bush believes that ``it's not his place to judge other people''.

16_34	0.17647058823529413	Rep. Glen Maxey, the only openly gay member of the Texas Legislature, describes Bush as ``pretty benign'' because whatever his policy positions, he hasn't resorted to anti-gay rhetoric.

16_36	0.15	``But at a time when there's a tremendous rise in hate crimes, and discrimination in the workplace still abounds, the fact that a leader would not see gay and lesbian issues as important or take a position one way or the other is troubling to me''.
16_37	0.15789473684210525	When state lawmakers last year proposed a bill barring gays and lesbians from adopting children in state custody, Bush said he believed that children were better off in homes with traditional couples.
16_38	0.21428571428571427	But the state already favors such arrangements, and Bush wouldn't say whether he supported the bill, which would have removed children from gay and lesbian homes.
16_39	0.0	The legislation never reached his desk.
16_40	0.0	Bush also declined to take a firm position last year on a hate-crimes bill that would have listed homosexuals as a protected group.
16_41	0.0	He argued that all violent crimes are hate crimes and noted that Texas already has a hate-crimes law, albeit one that doesn't specify who is protected.

16_43	0.21428571428571427	Gay rights groups suspected that the bill's protection of gays was behind his failure to support the bill, but Bush denied the charge.

16_45	0.17647058823529413	The Democrats want to guarantee legal and financial benefits to gay and lesbian partnerships, but they maintain that marriage is a religious and cultural institution reserved for a man and a woman.
16_46	0.125	``Bush has had a fair record, and many gays believe he's been a good governor.
16_47	1.3846153846153846	But he does need to move more on some gay political issues,'' said Steve Labinski, who heads the Texas branch of the Log Cabin Republicans.
16_48	1.05	Gay Texas Republicans note that during the party's 1998 convention, Bush urged the GOP to allow the state's Log Cabin Republicans, who had been banned from setting up a booth, to do so.
16_49	0.0	Maxey suspects that some of Bush's positions are the result of political considerations rather than his personal views.
16_50	0.0	He points to a conversation he had with Bush last spring on the floor of the Texas House.
16_51	0.09090909090909091	Maxey said the governor told him his stance on the gay adoption bill had nothing to do with his view of Maxey, whom he ``valued as a person''.
16_52	0.0	Based on that talk, Maxey believes that Bush is a lot more tolerant of gays than his record might indicate.
16_53	0.0	Bush, however, said later that the two discussed children's health insurance, not homosexuality.

16_58	0.07692307692307693	Openly gay people serve on some of Bush's state steering committees, but Farris said he is not bothered by that because the panels are mostly honorary.
16_59	0.0	Furthermore, Farris believes that Bush has genuinely conservative views ``in his heart'' about homosexuality.
16_60	0.4	Gay Republicans hope Farris is wrong and that Bush is simply doing what he must to win the GOP primaries.
16_61	0.16666666666666666	They say he may be more receptive to gays once he's the nominee.
16_62	1.1333333333333333	Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for the national Log Cabin Republicans, said Bush should be well aware of the importance of creating a tolerant image for the GOP in the general election.
16_63	0.15	Ivers argues that Buchanan's anti-gay remarks at the 1992 Republican convention tarnished the party, helping to seal the failure of President George Bush's re-election bid.
