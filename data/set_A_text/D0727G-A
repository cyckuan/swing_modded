22_2	0.1743849	The revelations came from a flurry of court filings and documents released Thursday by attorneys in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., as the Gingriches' divorce case moves toward a threatened trial date.
22_3	0.41401846	In one of the more significant developments of the day, a Washington judge issued an order that puts Marianne Gingrich, 48, a step closer to questioning Callista Bisek, 33, under oath about Bisek's relationship with Newt Gingrich, 56.

23_4	0.12562417	Gingrich, who rose to power by aggressively attacking Democrats in Congress, will now put the same energy toward proving that his wife shares the blame for the marriage's collapse, one of his attorneys said Tuesday.
23_5	0.43637877	In pleadings released in Cobb County Superior Court, Gingrich, 56, is demanding that Marianne Gingrich sit for a videotaped deposition on Oct.

23_18	0.15794566	Bisek, 33, has asked a Washington judge to block the deposition, arguing _ in part _ that since adultery is a crime in the District of Columbia, she shouldn't be asked to incriminate herself.

23_22	0.2169165	In the meantime, Gingrich is accusing his wife of not accounting for some of the public speaking money he has earned since the September financial agreement.
23_23	0.15447933	The fees for his speeches, which can be as high as $50,000, go directly to Marianne Gingrich, who manages all the couple's money, Evans said.

23_25	0.10054457	``I'm not aware of any improprieties on either parties' behalf,'' said Harvey Cohen, the certified public accountant hired by the Gingriches to manage the account under their agreement.
