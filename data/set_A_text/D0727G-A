22_2	0.19393713	The revelations came from a flurry of court filings and documents released Thursday by attorneys in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., as the Gingriches' divorce case moves toward a threatened trial date.
22_3	0.46866927	In one of the more significant developments of the day, a Washington judge issued an order that puts Marianne Gingrich, 48, a step closer to questioning Callista Bisek, 33, under oath about Bisek's relationship with Newt Gingrich, 56.

23_4	0.14324341	Gingrich, who rose to power by aggressively attacking Democrats in Congress, will now put the same energy toward proving that his wife shares the blame for the marriage's collapse, one of his attorneys said Tuesday.
