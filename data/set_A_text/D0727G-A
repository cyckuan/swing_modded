0_0	0.61810855	ATLANTA _ In a surprise move, Newt Gingrich has initiated his own deposition of the Washington congressional aide named in his divorce.
0_1	0.47528387	In a notice filed Tuesday in Cobb County Superior Court, Gingrich announced he will question Callista Bisek under oath Nov.
0_2	0.35056456	9. The deposition would come two days before he and estranged wife Marianne Gingrich are to make their first court appearance together since the former speaker of the U.S.
0_3	0.61858211	House of Representatives filed for divorce in July.
0_4	0.14250058	The move, which an opposing attorney called ``unique,'' comes weeks into an unresolved legal contest between Bisek and Marianne Gingrich over the same deposition.
0_5	0.66230501	Bisek has asked a Washington judge to block Marianne Gingrich's subpoena asking her to answer questions about her relationship with the former speaker.
0_6	0.08323197	The subpoena also asks for documents, such as letters, phone records and gift receipts, that could link the two romantically.
0_7	0.053009847	The judge's ruling is expected any day.
0_8	0.177302	``This whole idea of us hiding the ball, I want to get rid of that real quick,'' Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, said Tuesday.
0_9	0.059041046	``We're not hiding anything''.
0_10	0.28456521	Marianne Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, characterized Gingrich's deposition notice as ``peculiar'' and pointed out that Bisek has not withdrawn her objections to Mayoue's request for a deposition.
0_11	0.29942246	While Bisek could conceivably object to questioning by Gingrich's attorneys, Evans said she has agreed to participate.
0_12	0.11566359	In fact, the deposition will be taken at her attorney's office in Washington, according to Tuesday's filing.
0_13	0.099903464	Bisek's attorney, Pamela Bresnahan, did not return a phone message seeking confirmation.
0_14	0.10503332	Gingrich's notice also instructs Bisek to bring with her records of any money he has spent on her, gifts he's purchased for her, and travel she's taken at his expense since he became speaker.
0_15	0.3082025	They are all documents Bisek already has agreed to turn over in the deposition dispute between her and Marianne Gingrich.
0_16	0.14202965	According to divorce experts, Gingrich wants to make it clear to the public and to the court that Bisek is an independent witness who is not under his control.
0_17	0.15025908	``They are trying to show the court that they are not trying to hide her,'' Atlanta divorce attorney Shiel Edlin said.
0_18	0.11201009	Other than as a public relations tool, Gingrich's move to depose Bisek offers little tactical benefit, Edlin said.
0_19	0.088893219	In a deposition, both sides are allowed to question the witness.
0_20	0.12943803	While Evans has scheduled Bisek's deposition for Nov.
0_21	0.075293485	9, his notice left open the possibility that a new date could be negotiated.
0_22	0.029769779	On Nov.
0_23	0.16596644	11, the Gingriches are due to appear before Judge Dorothy Robinson in Cobb Superior Court as their lawyers argue several discovery motions still in contention.
0_24	0.068376932	Both sides say they intend to follow through with the hearing.
0_25	0.070443526	Said Evans: ``We want to get this case resolved or tried''.

1_0	0.50138249	ATLANTA (AP) --Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has reached an agreement with his wife on how to divide their assets as part of their divorce proceedings, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Tuesday.
1_1	0.33034481	The confidential agreement on who owns what between Gingrich and his wife, Marianne, was reached Monday and ``gives them both support to live off of,'' said Randy Evans, Gingrich's attorney.
1_2	0.32165988	Mrs. Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, told the newspaper that an agreement was reached, but would give no details.
1_3	0.2325233	The agreement was reached prior to a Thursday hearing that was expected to attract national media, especially after the disclosure of Gingrich's relationship with a 33-year-old congressional aide, Callista Bisek of Virginia.
1_4	0.30572464	By avoiding a hearing, the Gingriches not only end their 18-year marriage, but also avoid answering specific charges they've made against each other since Newt Gingrich filed for the divorce in July.

2_0	0.5151628	WASHINGTON (AP) --Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and a congressional aide named in his divorce case are trying to keep lawyers for Gingrich's wife from finding out details of their relationship.
2_1	0.22737127	In the latest twist in the Gingriches' bitter divorce fight, lawyers for Marianne Gingrich charged in court papers Monday that Gingrich ``willfully failed and refused to answer virtually each and every interrogatory concerning his personal and professional relationships as well as the finances of his marriage''.
2_2	0.39002349	And in motions filed last week in Superior Court for the District of Columbia, Callista Bisek, a clerk for the House Agriculture Committee, asked a judge to overturn a Georgia court order requiring her to answer questions about her relationship with Gingrich.
