3_0	0.12458773	WELLINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) --One of the biggest international science ventures undertaken in New Zealand waters will begin later this month with the arrival of an advanced French research ship to carry out a program of deep sea drilling.
3_1	0.079819639	A Wellington-based newspaper Tuesday reported that scientists from 11 countries, including New Zealand, France, Australia and Britain, are due to join the flagship Joides Resolution as it has drilled seven holes along the eastern coast of New Zealand to retrieve sediment and rock for analysis.
3_2	0.095211579	The Dominion quoted New Zealand scientist Lionel Carter, one of the researchers who will be on board, as saying that the project is part of a global initiative to determine how the oceans tick and influence climate.
3_3	0.079293555	The Ocean Drilling Program, set up in 1985 by 22 member countries, has led 78 expeditions and overseen drilling at more than 1,300 sites around the world.
3_4	0.085152589	The New Zealand visit, dubbed "Leg 181" and hoping to uncover the history of the South Pacific Ocean in the past 32 million years, will last two months.
3_5	0.085594442	The bill for the New Zealand leg has been estimated at six million U.S. dollars, funded mainly by the United States' National Science Foundation.
3_6	0.089631426	While conventional drilling ships typically work in water depths of less than 200 meters, the Joides Resolution can work in waters eight kilometers deep and then drill to one kilometer or more below the seabed.
3_7	0.09051464	Dr. Carter said this is truly a remarkable capability considering the ship will be bobbing in the ocean with 4 km of rotating drill pipe snaking through current-swept waters to the seabed and penetrating several hundred meters below to obtain the core material.
3_8	0.10982446	New Zealand's eastern coast has been chosen because of its position across the great current systems of the ocean.
3_9	0.091303549	New Zealand is the visible part of a vast submarine continent, half the size of Australia, that projects deep into the pathways of the currents, Dr.
3_10	0.094923521	Carter said.
4_0	0.096814862	El Nino and La Nina, the warmer and colder phases of a perpetual oscillation in the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean that drastically affects weather around the world, have in recent years become familiar agents of short-term climate change.
4_1	0.098179926	Now some scientists believe they may have identified a comparable kind of oscillation involving deep ocean currents.
4_2	0.096354827	They say this oscillation could warm and cool substantial parts of the globe on longer time scales of centuries to millenniums.
4_3	0.084637557	The deep ocean currents, in effect, create a global conveyor belt that transports great amounts of heat around the world.
4_4	0.079008085	When the currents run strongly, for example, Western Europe and the North Atlantic region are relatively warm; when they are weak, they cool off.
4_5	0.074314043	One instance of this cooling, some experts now suspect, was what is called the little ice age, an intermittent cold spell from the 14th to 19th centuries that at its coldest sent glaciers coursing down mountain slopes and condemned much of Europe to famine by freezing harvests.
4_6	0.074764894	Two years ago, researchers at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University discovered that cold spells lasting several centuries, much like the little ice age, have occurred regularly, about every 1,400 to 1,500 years, since the end of the last full ice age some 10,000 years ago.
4_7	0.073202465	Much bigger temperature swings, they found, occurred at the same intervals during the ice age itself.
4_8	0.093361639	They discovered this by analyzing climate signals contained in ocean sediments in the North Atlantic.
4_9	0.076937185	Now, by putting together different sorts of evidence, other researchers led by Dr.
4_10	0.097376952	Wallace S.
4_11	0.07789603	Broecker, a marine geochemist at Lamont-Doherty, have postulated that the oscillations in deep-ocean currents may be responsible for the 1,500-year cold cycles.
4_12	0.093376098	The study by Broecker and Stewart Sutherland of Lamont-Doherty and Tsung-Hung Peng of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration appears in the current issue of the journal Science.
4_13	0.08348639	While there is a long way to go before Broecker's postulate can be proved or disproved, it appeared to provide a possible new explanation for what Dr.
4_14	0.082519384	Richard Alley, a climate expert at Pennsylvania State University, called ``a fundamental beat to the climate''.
4_15	0.086663499	He said Broecker had ``put together a very possible story''.
4_16	0.10117509	``We need good hypotheses,'' Alley said, ``and he's given us one''.
4_17	0.085321707	Discerning and explaining the climate's fundamental beat is important to a central climate question of the day: whether the atmosphere is warming because of natural changes or human-induced changes in the atmosphere, chiefly emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases, like carbon dioxide.
4_18	0.1218305	Broecker is a primary advocate of the concept of the ocean conveyor belt as a climate regulator.
4_19	0.12193435	The conveyor is believed to be driven by changes in the salt content of the ocean's surface.
4_20	0.10456448	When salt builds up in a particular spot in the North Atlantic, it eventually makes the water dense enough to sink to the ocean depths.
4_21	0.088629668	Other water rushes in to replace it at the surface.
4_22	0.08713057	This combination is what sets the conveyor moving.
4_23	0.11000429	The bigger and stronger the main conveyor current, the more heat it can transport.
4_24	0.090029977	Aside from the North Atlantic, there is one other place where the conveyor gets a boost from sinking water (scientists call this production of deep water): the Weddell Sea near Antarctica.
4_25	0.089193495	By combining the results of a number of recent chemical and physical studies by several scientists, Broecker has concluded that the two sites do not produce roughly the same amount of deep water all the time, as had been thought.
4_26	0.098095108	Rather, he says, the southern and northern sites alternate as strong producers: when one is giving a strong boost to the conveyor, the other is giving a weak one, with widespread consequences for climate.
4_27	0.097559736	A number of studies of past climates have shown that when the North Atlantic region has been cold, as in the end of the last ice age, Antarctica has been relatively warm.
4_28	0.079451635	And a recent study by Dr.
4_29	0.087974549	Gary Clow, a geophysicist at the United States Geological Survey in Denver, based on an analysis of ancient Antarctic ice, suggests that since the end of the last glaciation, Antarctica was warmer whenever Europe was colder, as in the little ice age.
4_30	0.089609639	Finally, chemical evidence shows that the production of deep water off Antarctica has slowed to about a third of its rate a century or so ago, when the little ice age was ending, while production has remained strong in the North Atlantic.
4_31	0.088743484	That means the conveyor belt in that region continues to draw heat from the south to warm the North Atlantic region, especially Western Europe.
4_32	0.088896653	No firm cause-and-effect link has been established between the conveyor's supposed oscillations and the 1,500-year recurrences of cold spells like the little ice age.
4_33	0.086472284	But Broecker says there is a clear relationship between the conveyor's behavior and climate oscillations in the last ice age.
4_34	0.086737655	And he says that if the conveyor has indeed oscillated since then, as now seems the case, it suggests that the link may have persisted.
4_35	0.087302877	It is, he says, ``consistent with the idea that changes in the large-scale circulation in the ocean can have very important effects on the atmosphere,'' and that ``we're playing with a system that we still don't understand.''
5_0	0.08784646	The sea has millions of dark secrets.
5_1	0.085667118	And now, a famous explorer is to illuminate more of them.
5_2	0.083931816	For more than a third of a century, Alvin, the world's first craft to roam the abyss with relative ease, has been ferrying American scientists into the planet's sunless depths and racking up a staggering record of discovery, including dark ecosystems that, with riots of tube worms and other bizarre creatures, rival rain forests in richness.
5_3	0.082248142	But the plucky, white, 25-foot-long craft has its shortcomings.
5_4	0.080262958	Most notably, it can plunge down only so far without the deep's pressures suddenly crushing its crew capsule (and three occupants).
5_5	0.08703164	For dives, the safety limit is 2.8 miles.
5_6	0.078341752	That distance is little more than the sea's average depth and far short of its deepest spot, seven miles down, much lower than Everest is high.
5_7	0.080396878	The upshot is that a large part of the seabed, with its dark recesses and riddles and perhaps even a den or two of undiscovered monsters, is out of Alvin's reach.
5_8	0.080415407	Off limits is an area larger than Asia.
5_9	0.075704257	But now, Alvin is getting a major overhaul that may extend its reach and allow it to match and possibly even surpass newer submersibles abroad, making it the world leader.
5_10	0.096604909	In a remarkable bonanza from the end of the Cold War, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, which runs Alvin, has just received from the Navy a submersible known as Sea Cliff, which has been decommissioned in the wake of military cutbacks and changing priorities.
5_11	0.074770916	Woods Hole and its federal patrons have insufficient money to run Sea Cliff, designed for military work, as a separate vehicle.
5_12	0.078182956	But Woods Hole is happy to cannibalize its parts to improve Alvin, a process now getting under way.
5_13	0.08786675	The trove is rich.
5_14	0.075288456	Alvin cost about $50 million, and Sea Cliff about $200 million.
5_15	0.078005696	The crown jewel of Sea Cliff is its crew capsule.
5_16	0.073412909	The walls are made of a thick layer of super-strong titanium that can withstand pressures down to depths of 3.8 miles (or 6 kilometers).
5_17	0.074355226	So Woods Hole is now studying whether the capsule can be transferred to Alvin, a move that would extend the reach of the tiny submersible by a full mile.

5_21	0.07516324	Eager to push even deeper and capitalize on the politics of the moment, the institution is seeing whether further strengthening would allow Alvin to plunge down to depths of 4.3 miles (or 7 kilometers) _ deeper than any of the rival submersibles now operated by Russia, France and Japan.

5_39	0.084772357	``We don't want to screw up the reliability in the process of trying to make the submersible better''.
5_40	0.088628389	When Alvin was first proposed by Woods Hole in the 1960s, it was considered a curiosity.
5_41	0.1052125	Most military officials and scientists of the day cared little about people exploring the deep.
5_42	0.098335987	No regular Navy contractor wanted job.
5_43	0.098823297	So the submersible was built by General Mills, the maker of breakfast cereals.
5_44	0.10286764	The situation changed after a Navy submarine, the Thresher, sank with 129 men in 1963.
5_45	0.091839	Its wreckage remained lost for months.
5_46	0.087774319	In the catastrophe's wake, the Navy decided to throw itself into mastering the abyss.
5_47	0.081534353	No expense was too great.
5_48	0.095196701	The Navy built two Alvin look-alikes, Sea Cliff and Turtle.
5_49	0.095407708	Both were heavier and faster than their forerunner.
5_50	0.099585904	Eventually, in 1984, Sea Cliff dove much deeper, with its stronger crew capsule.
5_51	0.089286864	However, foreign submersibless began to rival Sea Cliff's maximum depth of 3.8 miles and to make new discoveries.
5_52	0.096564218	In 1990, the Japanese pulled ahead with a new submersible that plunged down 4 miles.
5_53	0.095223642	Woods Hole scientists looked on sheepishly in 1994 as the Japanese submersible, Shinkai 6500, set an Atlantic depth record.
5_54	0.089954306	Today, the 31-foot-long Japanese submersible is still unrivaled.
5_55	0.1023583	Such competitive pressure is one reason Woods Hole is eager to have Alvin go deeper.
5_56	0.09334274	The more important reason is raw knowledge.
5_57	0.090076331	Scientists say the inky deep is not only inherently provocative but important to understand if people are to be good planetary stewards.
5_58	0.089563137	It is the Earth's largest habitat, containing, by some estimates, 97 percent of the space inhabited by living things.
5_59	0.081288235	It is also the planet's lifeblood.
5_60	0.091817887	Its voluminous waters supply vital elements that sustain life on the surface and regulate planetary heat flow, keeping the land temperate.
5_61	0.089526637	Geologically, the deep is the planet's most dynamic feature, the place where huge slabs of crust are created and destroyed.
5_62	0.078120882	About 90 percent of the Earth's volcanism happens undersea.
5_63	0.095550737	Gagosian, the Woods Hole director, said a deeper-diving Alvin could better study these cauldrons, which also support lush ecosystems and are suspected of being the place where life arose four billion years ago.
5_64	0.089368377	A deeper-diving Alvin, he said, could not only explore the sites directly but could wire the ocean with sensitive detectors meant to track distant seaquakes.
5_65	0.093941034	A great opportunity for such wiring lies in old telephone cables that criss-cross the sea's abyssal plains, Gagosian said.
5_66	0.088828504	This month, one such cable between California and Hawaii is to be lifted from a depth of 3.1 miles and fitted with geologic detectors _ an oceanographic first.
5_67	0.10249621	A deeper Alvin could service such devices, eliminating the need for lifting the cable, which is a risky job.
5_68	0.096853665	A deeper Alvin would also be able to visit more of humanity's lost worlds.
5_69	0.08788168	The luxury liner, Titanic, resting at a depth of more than two miles, is now within Alvin's reach and was visited in 1986 by the tiny white submersible, but thousands of other wrecks lie deeper.

5_76	0.086147598	He said the upgrade could be done during the sub's next major overhaul, which is scheduled for the end of 2000, allowing it to start the new millennium on an auspicious note.
5_77	0.089049219	With Alvin diving to depths of 3.8 miles (or 6 kilometers), the region outside its reach would shrink dramatically, contracting from something larger than Asia to the size of Europe.
5_78	0.086687137	Gagosian, eager for even greater penetration of the sea's darkness, has asked Woods Hole experts to assess the feasibility of Alvin's plunging to depths of 4.3 miles (or 7 kilometers).

7_0	0.10806271	LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) --Animals living on the ocean floor may be just as susceptible to climate change as surface-dwellers, the science journal, Nature, reports.
7_1	0.078501838	Researchers came to this conclusion after studying the fossil record of ostracods, minute clam-like crustaceans in deep-sea sediment at the bottom of the North Atlantic, dating from the Late Pliocene era more than 2.4 million years ago.

9_0	0.12461295	TIANJIN, May 4 (Xinhua) --Since April last year, China has successfully been using steel caissons to develop oil in the Jinzhou 9-3 Oilfield in the Bohai Sea.
9_1	0.096762271	A cylindrical steel caisson, 13.8 meters tall and 38 meters in diameter, was put in April last year on the seabed in the oilfield's eastern section, where it has been used as a platform for drilling and storage of oil, according to Jiang Hengyu, manager in charge of the project.
9_2	0.10169352	This is the first time China has used this technology in offshore oil production, Jiang said.
9_3	0.081164822	He explained that the new technology effectively prevents sedimentation and icing on a drilling platform, and a new 10-meter-thick oil-bearing stratum has been discovered.

10_0	0.12470398	Down into the lifeless, oxygen-free depths of the Black Sea, and on the edge of the American continental shelf where the Hudson River plunges into the deep ocean, explorers will deploy an array of high-tech gear this week in search of history that has lain out of reach for thousands of years.
10_1	0.10262812	In the Black Sea, a team from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and MIT hopes to find evidence of harbors dating from an era when the waters were hundreds of feet shallower, and perhaps shipwrecks that could reveal ancient deep-water trading routes, possibly the maritime equivalent of the old Silk Road.
10_2	0.10356673	Off the coast of New York, an expedition led by oceanographer Robert Ballard and archeologist Kevin McBride of the University of Connecticut will search for signs of human settlements that may predate any ever found on land on the East Coast, perhaps revealing how and when this part of the continent was first settled _ maybe as far back as the height of the last ice age, 18,000 years ago.
10_3	0.079099268	Coming close on the heels of stunning discoveries last year, the searches represent the dawning of another era in archeology, a dramatic advance made possible by oceanographic research tools, including precisely-controllable robotic vehicles with electronic cameras, and high-resolution sonar detectors.
10_4	0.087389992	Last summer, the most ambitious attempt so far to explore in deep water for traces of humanity's distant past yielded an astonishing trove of data.
10_5	0.077762351	In just three weeks, a Mediterranean expedition, led by Boston University archeologist Anna Marguerite McCann and Ballard, discovered five Roman shipwrecks spanning virtually the entire history of Roman maritime trade.
10_6	0.11254183	These ships lay as much as 2,800 feet deep on the ocean floor.
10_7	0.074793886	Before then, no ancient wreck had been found deeper than 300 feet.
10_8	0.082487765	Because they were so deep, the Roman ships' artifacts were better preserved than any found in shallow water.
10_9	0.073763914	At those depths, McCann said, there is little of the activity that quickly destroys shallower shipwrecks, including wind and wave action, devouring by marine creatures, or looting by treasure hunters.
10_10	0.080318339	``The deep sea's opened up'' for archeology, said McCann in an interview last week.
10_11	0.077294139	And it was last year's remarkably successful Mediterannean research that proved the value of applying the technologies of deep ocean exploration to the old and often tradition-bound field of archeology, she said.
10_12	0.073955953	``It was a breakthrough, a true beginning for marine archeology''.
10_13	0.07459512	Her colleagues in the field were profoundly critical, McCann said, when Ballard first offered back in 1989 to apply his team's equipment and expertise to the untested idea of deep-water archeology.
10_14	0.077918575	They were skeptical because Ballard was not an archeologist, because of his high public profile since his discovery of the wreck of the Titanic, and because they thought robotic deep-sea vehicles would be too clumsy to recover artifacts without breaking them, she said.
10_15	0.085158792	``Ballard is not an archeologist,'' McCann conceded, ``but I'm not an engineer or an oceanographer.
10_16	0.077128036	The technology is here, and there are treasure hunters using this and selling stuff.
10_17	0.08006248	I thought, `We've got to get into this'''.
10_18	0.077524019	In weighing whether to go against her colleagues' advice and join the expedition, said McCann, now 65, who already was considered one of the nation's leading authorities on Roman-era archeology, ``I thought, `Why not?
10_19	0.091257138	I'm old, I don't have to worry about tenure'''.
10_20	0.080137057	Since then, McCann has been recruited by Boston University, which already has one of the nation's leading departments for dry-land archeology, to create a program dedicated to underwater archeology.
10_21	0.086249734	What is needed now, according to both oceanographers and archeologists who have participated in the pioneering deep-water explorations, is a generation of graduate students who will be trained from the start in both traditional archeology and in the technology of deep marine exploration.
10_22	0.087581133	Ballard sees himself as a kind of matchmaker in helping to bring about the marriage of these two fields.
10_23	0.081667818	&UR; &LR; ``There's a new opportunity here,'' he said last week, ``to bring together the world of oceanography with the world of archeology, and to try to create a new field of science''.
10_24	0.099960779	Parts of the relatively shallow near-shore waters of the continental shelf, up to a depth of about 200 feet, have been explored by archeologists using scuba diving equipment for many years.
10_25	0.086383334	But deeper water, where only expensive submersibles, submarines and remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs) can reach, had never been examined by archeologists until McCann decided to sign on as archeology director for Ballard's 1989 trip to Skerki Bank, in the Mediterranean Sea near Sicily.
10_26	0.090413857	That year, with thousands of schoolchildren watching through a satellite link as part of Ballard's educational Jason Project, the team discovered a Roman shipwreck they dubbed the Isis.
10_27	0.084860299	It was eight years before they were able to take the second step _ last year's return expedition to the area.
10_28	0.087311244	This time, they had some new tools: the Navy's NR-1 nuclear submarine to perform the initial reconaissance and locate promising sites, and a sophisticated array of sonar equipment and digital cameras added to the Jason, the world's most precisely-controllable ROV.
10_29	0.088691511	The three-week trip yielded eight discoveries, five of them Roman ships ranging in age from the first century BC to about 400 AD.
10_30	0.086916966	&UR; &LR; ``What we did in the Mediterranean that had never been done before &UR; &LR; was to make quantitatively accurate maps of the site, to allow all the information from that wreck site to be preserved,'' said Dana Yoerger, an oceanographer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution whose job includes guiding the ROVs.
10_31	0.097864251	&UR; &LR; Many groups now have the capability to use these robotic vehicles to take pictures of underwater sites, and to use computers to create photomosaics of an entire site, but Woods Hole alone has the ability to monitor the vehicle's position to within a half-inch as it takes its pictures.
10_32	0.097675832	The shapes and dimensions of objects in its photomosaics can be measured with the precision that archeologists achieve when they measure the position of every artifact and plot it on maps of land sites.
10_33	0.088283718	&UR; &LR; Thanks to the precision of this data, McCann said, ``I think the archeological community has been won over''.
10_34	0.091728663	Being able to find ancient artifacts in such deep sites not only opens up previously unreachable areas for research, it also allows the mapping of trade routes that were previously unknown.
10_35	0.091280688	It also means that ancient wrecks will likely be found in a far better state of preservation than those found in shallower water.
10_36	0.091092482	Ballard, who last year left Woods Hole to head a new organization called the Institute for Exploration, based in Mystic, Conn.
10_37	0.093207594	, said it was the discovery of the Titanic that opened his eyes to that potential.
10_38	0.10241268	&UR; &LR; ``What really amazed me about the Titanic was the preservation environment of the deep sea,'' he said.
10_39	0.099138322	``Ships that found their way to the bottom in deep water were very different'' from those near shore.
10_40	0.089631933	For one thing, near-shore wrecks are often rapidly buried under accumulating sediments; in the deep sea, sediments build up at an imperceptible rate of about a half-inch every thousand years, he said.
10_41	0.091549934	In addition, ships that sink near shore are often quickly torn apart by the pounding surf; in deep water they may settle gently to the bottom and remain undisturbed and virtually intact.
10_42	0.10806642	He offers a vivid vivid illustration of that benign environment.
10_43	0.088161158	When the team returned to the Skerki Bank site, the imprint in the mud of an amphora they had removed eight years earlier was still clearly visible.
10_44	0.088971001	The preservation may be even better in the Black Sea, Ballard said &UR;. &LR; ``It is the largest body of water in the world with no oxygen,'' he said, and without oxygen the marine organisms that often devour all the exposed wood in a wrecked ship are unable to survive there.
10_45	0.09688894	David Mindell, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who will lead the Black Sea expedition, said the explorers hope to find evidence of a trade route directly across the sea through deep water.
10_46	0.088598946	``It would have been the maritime equivalent of the Silk Road,'' he said.
10_47	0.094835383	``It would have been a pretty significant shortcut, if you could make it work, between the Mediterranean and Central Asia''.
10_48	0.088320736	Some ancient texts, he said, suggest such a route was indeed used.
10_49	0.088855716	Oceanographers have found that until about 7,000 years ago, the Black Sea was a freshwater lake about 300 feet shallower than its present level, and that it was flooded when the Mediterranean broke through the Bosporus.
10_50	0.085737556	That flooding, which may have buried ports in areas that are now far offshore, is believed to have taken place very rapidly, and some archeologists think it may have been the origin of the Biblical story of the deluge.
10_51	0.087619472	Similarly, the site Ballard's group will explore this week off Long Island was also high and dry for many millennia, and may hold sites that were once hunting encampments on land.
10_52	0.088063416	Until about 12,000 years ago, when most of what is now New England was buried under a mile-thick sheet of ice, the continental shelf was exposed and may have been occupied by the ancestors of native Americans.

11_3	0.0888713	After surveys indicated poor reserves in large tracts of the original zone, China has given up the right for about half of the area.
11_4	0.077472477	It will now concentrate on the new, smaller mining zone which geologists estimate could have an annual production capacity of three million tons of rare metals such as manganese, nickel and cobalt.
11_5	0.078208134	The reserves are expected to last for at least 20 years, which will help ease the shortage of such rare metals in China throughout the early part of the next century.

14_3	0.078671045	"My own work will involve looking at the description of the rocks and interpreting the environment in which they were formed," Woolfe was quoted by the Australian Associated Press as saying.
14_4	0.092322773	He said the scientists were excited by the project because nothing was known about what happened in the Antarctic when the ice sheet was first forming.
14_5	0.078762253	"We think we'll find there was a time when there was no ice at all in the Antarctic.

19_0	0.14751196	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ Dutch scientists say they have discovered toxic industrial chemicals in the tissue of whales that normally feed in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean.
19_1	0.080840196	While the quantities detected may not be harmful to the huge mammals, the scientists say their findings, presented at a conference in Stockholm last week, should serve as a warning of how far the chemicals have penetrated the ocean's food chain.
19_2	0.074172226	Some findings also were reported in Nature magazine in July.
19_3	0.077028793	At issue are so-called polybrominated compounds that are used as flame retardants in many everyday products, like television-set casings and children's clothing.
19_4	0.076460683	While these chemicals can be useful to consumers, they appear to be resilient and harmful in nature.
19_5	0.085840266	Scientists say they behave much like PCBs and DDT, which were banned for their toxicity.
19_6	0.08392463	Now the scientists say they have evidence that the brominated compounds enter the atmosphere and river and sea water, probably because they are not fully destroyed in waste incinerators.
19_7	0.086299861	The molecules do not dissolve easily in water and eventually find their way into animal and perhaps human tissue, they say.
19_8	0.089493014	``The study showed that we are seeing warning signals that more serious problems may be ahead,'' said Jacob de Boer, of the Netherlands Institute for Fisheries Research, who led the team that analyzed the whale tissue.

19_11	0.088781235	For their most recent study, de Boer and a team of 10 Dutch scientists examined 13 sea mammals, including sperm and minke whales that were stranded on the Dutch coast in 1996 and 1997.
19_12	0.11528274	They said they found traces of the compounds in the animals' fat and sometimes in the liver.
19_13	0.085796855	Significant levels of the compounds had already been found in sea creatures that live near the coast, like dolphins and seals, but finding them in minke and sperm whales is more disturbing, de Boer said, because these whales normally feed at a depth of about 1,000 to 3,600 feet and the males hunt as far north as Iceland, where the ocean is presumed to be clean. &QL;

23_0	0.097881467	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) --Phoenician mariners sailed more than 2,500 years ago into the uncertain waters of the Mediterranean, praying to their storm god for a successful voyage -- only to meet death in a fierce tempest.
23_1	0.094971232	Now, American explorer Robert Ballard has located their two ships --the world's oldest known deep-water sea wrecks -- using the same techniques he used to find the Titanic.
23_2	0.081269621	The vessels' cargo --large ceramic containers of wine -- was probably headed to the Pharaoh's table in Egypt or to the Phoenician colony of Carthage in present-day Tunisia, Ballard told a news conference Wednesday, in announcing the discovery.
23_3	0.075654225	The ships' contents indicate they set sail from the Phoenician port of Tyre --now a city in Lebanon -- around 750 B.C.
23_4	0.079734354	Both vessels were transporting hundreds of ceramic jugs, called amphorae, filled with wine.

23_6	0.081328284	Archaeologist Lawrence Stager, one of several Harvard University scientists on Ballard's team, said the discovery of the pristine jugs ``was one of our greatest moments''.
23_7	0.074450731	The ships were also almost perfectly preserved --a result of the bitter cold deep-sea waters, where sunlight cannot reach, the pressure is intense and sediment scarcely accumulates.

23_10	0.080958633	Ballard, a former Naval officer and oceanographer, uncovered the Phoenician vessels about 30 miles off Israel with the aid of an underwater robot, deep-water tracking equipment and a global positioning satellite.
23_11	0.08092758	He was led to the area after a team looking for the Dakkar, an Israeli submarine that sank 35 years ago, photographed what appeared to be the remains of an ancient shipwreck.
23_12	0.10305305	The vessels were discovered sitting upright on the ocean floor at a depth of about 1,500 feet.
23_13	0.083301043	The fact that they sank straight to the bottom and were located within two miles of each other indicated they sank in a storm, Ballard said.
23_14	0.084467281	Ballard said the deep-sea route used by the two vessels was not previously known as one traveled by Phoenicians, and he hopes to find more ancient wrecks along the same path.
23_15	0.085789513	One ship is approximately 60 feet long and the other measures 45 feet.
23_16	0.089400822	The vessels were probably part of a fleet of cargo ships on consignment, Stager said.

23_18	0.096769987	Incense offerings were made at the beginning and end of every voyage, but Stager said desperate sailors might also have used the incense stands during the violent storm that sank the boats.
23_19	0.093150213	Based on the pots and crockery found aboard, Stager said he believed there were about a half-dozen sailors on each ship and that fish stew would have been a typical meal for the crew.
23_20	0.094125053	Ballard said the two vessels were the first intact Phoenician ships ever found, and will aid historians and archaeologists, who until now had to rely on classical texts and the Bible for an idea about Phoenician shipping.
