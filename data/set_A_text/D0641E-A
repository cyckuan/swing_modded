2_12	0.8157894736842105	A U.N. scientific panel has predicted that unless these greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, the earth's average surface temperature will rise by some 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century, with a best estimate of about 3.5 degrees, compared with a rise of 5 to 9 degrees since the depths of the last ice age 18,000 to 20,000 years ago.

13_4	0.9285714285714286	Greenhouse gas emissions - blamed for global warming - may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century, a new scientific study predicted recently.
13_5	0.10714285714285714	Using recent technological advances in climate modelling and new scientific research on ice and oceans, Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist at the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund, made three predictions on the impact of climate change on the Antarctic Ice Sheet.
13_6	0.14814814814814814	In two of the three scenarios, complete melting would raise global sea level by an average four to six metres, causing major coastal flooding worldwide, Oppenheimer wrote in the latest issue of the scientific journal Nature'.
13_7	0.2	In the other scenario, the internal ice shifting within the ice sheet could cause the melting to slow down.
13_8	0.13043478260869565	With its 3.8 million cubic kilometers of ice at the South Pole, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet posed the 'most immediate threat of a large sea-level rise, owing to its potential instability,'' Oppenheimer said.
13_9	1.1428571428571428	Changes in ocean temperature and circulation expected to accompany global warming could disintegrate the large ice sheet, as early as next century, he said.
13_10	1.4	The West Antarctic Ice Sheet first attracted widespread attention 30 years ago when scientists suggested that global warming caused by greenhouse gases might cause its disintegration.
13_11	1.2857142857142858	Greenhouse gas emissions - including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
13_12	0.1111111111111111	In 1995 an international panel of scientists that advises the United Nations on the issue, predicted that the average global temperatures could heat up between one and 3.5 degrees Celsius during the next century.
13_13	0.08695652173913043	Last year, scientists declared 1997 the warmest year on record, and the fact that nine of the past 11 years set new records for warm temperatures bolstered the view that greenhouse emissions were raising the average temperature.
13_14	0.7333333333333333	Over time, these increases could cause changes in climate, including the increased frequency and intensity of storms, floods, heat waves, and droughts, the scientists said.
13_15	0.23809523809523808	To deal with this threat 38 industrialised countries agreed at a conference last December in Kyoto, Japan to reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gases by about six percent overall between 2008 and 2012.
13_16	0.6206896551724138	While countries work out the details of the Kyoto agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that the lack of scientific understanding of the effects of global warming on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet limits the ability to predict the risk of the collapse' or melting'.
13_17	0.8421052631578947	But Oppenheimer warned that, as countries begin to formulate global warming policies, 'the potential hazards from the collapse of the ice sheet is too large and irreversible'' to be considered at a later date.

13_20	0.07692307692307693	Similarly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that over the past century Antarctica did not cause sea-levels to rise at all.
13_21	0.0	Yet, recent studies had found high melting rates under the floating ice, he added.
13_22	0.1875	In combination with other findings of shrinking icebergs, these new melting rates exceeded the estimated growth of the ice in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
13_23	0.3125	Oppenheimer pointed to studies made of two ice shelves to the north of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that had been disintegrating for several decades, possibly because of local atmospheric warming.
13_24	0.2	While most scientists agreed that the ice sheet was shrinking, they disagreed on how fast it will melt and what the consequences would be.
13_25	0.9375	In an effort to simplify the controversy, Oppenheimer produced what he believed would be the three most probable effects of global warming on this relatively unstable sheet of ice.
13_26	0.17647058823529413	Each of the three most likely possibilities varied according to how fast the West Antarctic Ice Sheet responded to the melting and disintegration of various glaciers and ice shelves in the area.
13_27	0.2857142857142857	Using the climate change predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel and the continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions, Oppenheimer predicted that in two of the possible scenarios sea levels would rise four to six metres.

20_5	0.2777777777777778	The 56-year-old leading expert on the physical processes of the atmosphere put up the challenge as climate experts firm up their view that human activity is seriously altering the atmosphere.
20_6	0.36363636363636365	Last fall, a panel of scientist, convened by the United Nations to advise the world's governments, concluded for the first time that green house gases like carbon dioxide are responsible for changing global climate.
20_7	0.4666666666666667	The panel also predicted that if emissions of the gases are not reduced, the average global temperature will increase by 1.8 degrees to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit.
20_8	0.0	Lindzen disapproved this formal consensus about the climate change, saying that the conclusions are based on computerized models of the climate system.
20_9	0.0	"I do not accept the model results of evidence," he said.
20_10	0.3076923076923077	The physics of the atmosphere permit only a minor and untroubling warming despite the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, he argued.
20_11	0.26666666666666666	Lindzeb's idea is based on a fundamental point of physics: carbon dioxide and the other waste gases generate only a small amount of warming.
20_12	0.13333333333333333	The main candidate, whose presumed amplifying effect is built into the computer models, is water vapor --also a heat-trapping gas, and the most powerful one since there is so much of it and it is so pervasive.
20_13	0.1111111111111111	The theory is that a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor, thereby increasing the warming even more.
20_14	0.0	Without this amplification, Dr.

21_0	1.5454545454545454	At this stage of research, scientists cannot firmly link global warming to changes in circulation patterns.
21_1	0.058823529411764705	But one study by British and Italian scientists, reported recently in the journal Nature, examined data on atmospheric circulation over the last 50 years in the Northern Hemisphere.
21_2	0.0	The researchers looked to see whether there had been any change in frequency of large-scale circulation regimes.

21_4	0.0	In a general warming of the globe, the air above those land areas would be expected to warm more than that above the oceans, because of differing abilities to absorb heat.
21_5	0.07692307692307693	But the authors of the new study postulate that the change in circulation patterns is the main reason the land has lately warmed so much.
21_6	0.0	That is, they say, the climate of the hemisphere shifts naturally back and forth between two dominant regimes.
21_7	0.0	Both the North Atlantic and North Pacific oscillations are believed to be affected by this shift.
21_8	0.0	But if some external influence imparts a warming or cooling impulse, the scientists say, the oscillation could be tipped in favor of one regime or the other.
21_9	0.8181818181818182	The external influence could be either natural, like a change in solar radiation, or artificial, like carbon dioxide emissions.

21_12	1.4615384615384615	While the study does not prove that human-induced global warming is what caused the change in frequency of circulation patterns, he said, the change is consistent with it.
21_13	1.1538461538461537	Such global warming would not produce new types of weather patterns, he said, but it would change the probability of occurrence of existing ones, Palmer said.
21_14	0.14285714285714285	And differing regional patterns of warming are a direct consequence of that, he said.
21_15	0.0	Another oscillation, in the Arctic, involves the strength of high-altitude winds that circle the North Pole near the Arctic Circle.
21_16	0.0	The winds oscillate between stronger and weaker states, with consequences for weather and climate farther south.
21_17	1.875	Some experts believe that the Arctic oscillation is being altered by global warming.
21_18	0.23529411764705882	The theory is that at certain critical altitudes, roughly from 6 to 12 miles, increasing carbon dioxide has the effect of warming the tropics but cooling the polar regions.
21_19	0.0	This would increase the temperature contrast between the two regions and thereby strengthen the pole-girdling vortex of winds.
21_20	0.0	This, according to the new thinking, would in turn strengthen westerly winds off the Atlantic, making northern Eurasia warmer and wetter.

21_22	0.06666666666666667	John Michael Wallace, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington, think that the Arctic and North Atlantic oscillations are so closely tied together as to be the same thing.

21_29	0.2	Historically, El Nino has appeared every two to seven years, with La Nina showing up less often.
21_30	0.2222222222222222	But over the last two decades, El Nino has appeared more frequently than before, and in much of the 1990s it seemed to go on more or less continuously.
21_31	5.0	Could this be related to global warming?
21_32	0.0	A number of scientists have raised the possibility.
21_33	0.0	Dr. Kevin Trenberth, a climate researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
21_34	0.0625	, has postulated that the time interval between El Nino visitations depends on how long it takes to recharge the tropical system by re-accumulating heat at the sea surface.
21_35	1.5454545454545454	Global warming, he suggests, may enable the system to recharge more rapidly, thereby making El Nino appear more often.
21_36	0.0	Another study reported recently in Nature appeared to lend some credence to this view.
21_37	0.7272727272727273	The researchers, at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, used a computerized model of the climate system's general circulation to investigate the effects of global warming on El Nino's frequency.
21_38	0.09090909090909091	In the past, these climate models have been unable to simulate the behavior of the tropical Pacific finely enough to address the issue.

23_0	1.3125	Scientists looking for signs of global warming should spend more time scrutinizing Earth's weather circulation patterns, a new study suggests.
23_1	0.0	Researchers who studied northern winters since mid-century found that a weather pattern favoring typically milder winters was two to three times more likely to arise in the mid-1990s than around 1950.
23_2	1.0588235294117647	The findings suggest that global warming blamed on human industry is manifesting itself not just by causing a global rise in temperatures but by also favoring certain established weather patterns.

23_7	0.058823529411764705	Palmer and two colleagues from the Interuniversity Computing Centre in Bologna, Italy, studied atmospheric circulation data for winters in the Northern Hemisphere from 1949 to 1994.
23_8	0.08695652173913043	They charted air circulation patterns into four ``clusters'' of high and low pressure systems, finding that the grouping favoring mild winters arose more frequently while patterns causing severe winters occurred less often.

23_10	0.6666666666666666	They mean climatologists should devote more time to scrutinizing shifts in the natural variability of weather circulation patterns to understand global warming, said Tom Karl, director of the National Climate Data Center in Asheville, N.C.

24_0	0.8823529411764706	LONDON _ Global warming could wipe out many species of plants and animals by the end of the 21st century, the World Wide Fund for Nature said in a report issued here Thursday.
24_1	0.03571428571428571	The fund, known in the United States as the World Wildlife Fund, paints a devastating picture of the ability of species from Arctic polar bears and walruses, to New England sugar maple trees, to survive unless they can migrate quickly and adapt to their new environment.
24_2	0.0	Particularly at risk, the report says, are species that are rare or live in mountainous or isolated places.
24_3	0.0	Among those singled out as vulnerable are the gelada baboon in Ethiopia; the monarch butterfly, which spends winters in Mexico; the Australian mountain pygmy possum; the northern spruce in New York state, and the spoon-billed sandpiper, which breeds in the far northeastern reaches of Russia.
24_4	0.0	According to the report, up to 70 percent of the natural habitat could be lost, and 20 percent of the species rendered extinct, in the Arctic and northernmost areas of places like Canada, Russia and Scandinavia, where warming is predicted to be most rapid.
24_5	0.0	Places farther to the south, including parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Iceland and Kyrgyzstan, could lose more than half of their natural habitat.
24_6	0.625	In the United States, the report says, more than a third of the existing habitat in Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas could be irrevocably altered by global warming.
24_7	0.06666666666666667	The report is based on the often used, but disputed, assumption that by the year 2100 there will have been a doubling of the emissions of carbon monoxide into the atmosphere from the level at the start of the industrial revolution.
24_8	1.1111111111111112	``Rapid rates of global warming are likely to increase rates of habitat loss and species extinction, most markedly in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere,'' the report says.
24_9	1.3636363636363635	``Extensive areas of habitat may be lost to global warming and many species may be unable to shift their ranges fast enough to keep up''.
24_10	0.0	According to Jennifer L.
24_11	0.0	Morgan, director of the World Wildlife Fund Climate Change Campaign in Washington, some species would have to migrate at a rate 10 times faster than after the last ice age in order to survive into the next century.
24_12	0.0	``Climate change is coming at us much faster than many habitats are going to be able handle,'' Morgan said.
24_13	0.18181818181818182	``The speed of change caused by the change in climate is greater than most ecosystems are going to be able to adapt to.''
