0_0	0.5509806	WASHINGTON _ The Library of Congress has reached a tentative agreement with the family of the Rev.
0_1	0.038688647	Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
0_2	0.09586444	to buy the slain civil rights leader's private papers for $20 million.
0_3	0.28143879	Though the price is the largest amount of money the Library of Congress has ever paid for a collection of papers, some researchers and students of the civil rights era question the historic value of the material.
0_4	0.10592029	Under the agreement, first reported this week in Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, the King family will transfer to the library King's letters, notes, and first drafts of speeches which are now at the Martin Luther King Center in Atlanta.
0_5	0.11010707	The collection, which is made up of about 80,000 items, was valued at $30 million by Sotheby's, which did a private appraisal at the request of the King family.
0_6	0.081893879	The King family originally wanted the full $30 million, but when Library officials balked, the family agreed to reduce the payment request to $20 million and take a $10 million tax deduction.
0_7	0.080603395	``By accepting a payment that is substantially below market value, we are meeting our fiduciary responsibility to the estate of Dr.
0_8	0.09987336	King while making a substantial gift to the nation,'' said a statement issued in the name of Dexter Scott King, the civil rights leader's son who now heads the King Center in Atlanta and is executor of the King estate.
0_9	0.15711621	The deal is subject to Congress passing legislation appropriating money for the library to buy the King collection.
0_10	0.065501765	The Senate passed such a measure by unanimous consent Friday.
0_11	0.0775781	Sponsors of the House bill say they hope to gain passage within the next few weeks.
0_12	0.48496359	The Library of Congress rarely spends money to acquire historic documents.
0_13	0.25156226	Since the library is the Copyright Office of the United States it automatically gets copies of books and manuscripts that are published in the United States.
0_14	0.1542908	The last time the library purchased a collection was in 1930, when it spent $1.5 million to buy a rare-book collection that included one of three perfect copies of the Gutenberg Bible.
0_15	0.14877813	To date, that was the most the library had ever paid for a collection.
0_16	0.078810142	Some historians say the King papers that are being purchased are worth more for their prestige value than their historical content.
0_17	0.092696804	The King family retains control of the official papers of civil rights groups such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which King headed, the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Non-violent Co-ordinating Committee.
0_18	0.07285625	These papers are currently housed at the King Center, and will remain there.

0_20	0.09575325	OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) ``Ask anybody who is a historian of the movement, and they would say that the SNCC papers are worth more to scholars than the King papers,'' said David Garrow, a historian at Emory University and author of ``Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King Jr.
0_21	0.06443877	, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference''.
0_22	0.1045304	Indeed, in 1997, both Stanford University and Emory entered into negotiations with the King family to buy some of the papers housed at the King Center.
0_23	0.15918856	But the two universities were not really interested in the material that now may be sold to the Library of Congress, according to Phillip Jones, chairman of Intellectual Properties Management, an Atlanta company that oversees the King estate.
0_24	0.13150868	It is unclear whether the payments the King family will receive from the library will be used to maintain official documents like the SCLC papers that are still housed at the King Center.
0_25	0.11029744	Some historians say they fear that should the originals of King's personal papers be removed from the King Center, the King family will lose interest in protecting the rest of the collection.
0_26	0.29722168	The Library of Congress has long been a repository of the papers or leaders and organizations of the African American civil rights movement.
0_27	0.12701986	Among the official papers housed there are those of The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Urban League and the private papers of A.
0_28	0.08334999	Phillip Randolph, Thurgood Marshall, Booker T.
0_29	0.061497047	Washington and Bayard Rustin.
0_30	0.16888158	But, unlike the King papers, all were donated to the library.
0_31	0.10732334	The pending sale of King's papers has again raised the question of the King family trying to capitalize financially on the legacy of one of the towering figures of the 20th Century and an icon to many Americans of all races.
0_32	0.081227473	In 1996, the family sued CBS for copyright infringement when it included excerpts from King's famous speech during the 1963 March on Washington.
0_33	0.087674005	The speech, which included the memorable lines, ``I have a dream,'' is considered one of the great pleas for racial harmony and justice.
0_34	0.097926232	Last year, a federal judge in Washington denied the Kings' claim, ruling that the speech was in the public domain.
0_35	0.12641006	``The family is amazing, isn't it''? said Gilbert Jonas, one of the chief fund-raisers for the NAACP for 30 years who recently donated his papers to the library.
0_36	0.078530789	``They're first ones, in my knowledge, from the civil rights era who have made money on it.
0_37	0.061247265	They're really creating an image that was counter to his''.
0_38	0.078479229	But others defend the King family's right to earn money.
0_39	0.088633323	``I never quite understood why the issue of money was used against the King family when any other family that owns a valuable piece of property would not be expected to just give it away,'' said Clayburn Carson, a history professor at Stanford who was involved in the negotiations to purchase many of the papers from the King Center in 1997.
1_0	0.39934693	The Library of Congress, the world's most voluminous library, grew by the equivalent of 2 million books on a single day last week.
1_1	0.12912979	But rather than build thousands of new stacks to accommodate the growth, the library could fit the new addition into a small filing cabinet.
1_2	0.16965649	That is because the latest donation to the library came in the form of computer disks _ 44 of them, each carrying 40 gigabytes of information.
1_3	0.15711369	The disks include a snapshot of the entire contents of the World Wide Web during the first two months of 1997, including each of the millions of individual Web sites _ the good, the bad, and even the smutty stuff Congress does not want kids to see.
1_4	0.093593473	The collection was gathered, stored and donated by Alexa Internet of San Francisco, which has developed a tool bar that makes it easy to view Web-site background information like where the site is located, whether it has a privacy policy, or if it has won third-party endorsements or awards.
1_5	0.089917897	The company's president, Brewster Kahle, said the donation preserves a moment in the life of the ever-evolving Web and can become a resource for sociologists and, eventually, historians who want to understand our era.
1_6	0.15481057	Alas, while the disks are on display at the library _ as part of an interactive sculpture _ their contents are not _ yet.
1_7	0.31474105	``It's kind of a laboratory experiment for us,'' said Guy Lamolinara, a spokesman for the Library of Congress, noting that some of the material was not suitable for the collections, and the library was still working out copyright issues.
1_8	0.089849286	``We will be using it to explore how to preserve digital materials, and how to provide access to these materials''.
1_9	0.073438248	Kahle, who also oversees the non-profit organization Internet Archive, said the Web is growing at a rate of 1.5 million pages a day.
1_10	0.19672824	Sounds as if the Library of Congress, in planning for future donations, had better set aside a large file cabinet.
1_11	0.075014337	Videophone Call-Ins On a Cable TV Channel The Internet has made it possible to perform all sorts of tasks without leaving the house _ banking, working, even dating.
1_12	0.073680409	Credit ZDTV, a fledgling 24-hour cable channel with programming focused on computer issues, for using the Net to make a virtual community out of yet another group: the studio audience.
1_13	0.082702237	The San Francisco-based network urges viewers to call in to its programs using Internet-based videophones, which transmit not just voices, but faces.
1_14	0.068678965	``Larry King says, `We'll go to Altoona, Pa.

1_16	0.063465669	With ZDTV, you'll see the caller''.
1_17	0.076107205	To encourage wider participation, ZDTV will give away up to 10,000 videophones, called Netcams because they transmit their audio and video signals over the Internet.
1_18	0.088414444	From Oct.
1_19	0.077562961	26 to 31, it plans to give away one videophone every hour, on its Web site, Drebin said.
1_20	0.073621215	But there are lingering questions like whether viewers want to see each other in the slow-motion video that comes across a videophone with a modem connection.
1_21	0.057654085	Then again, there may not be too many viewers to complain.
1_22	0.080512764	ZDTV, which is owned by Ziff-Davis and began broadcasting in May, reaches only 8 million homes, a strong start, but a far cry from a mass audience.
1_23	0.082724418	Survey Will Track Internet Audiences The question is not whether people are tuning in to radio programs over the Internet _ they are, albeit not in mass numbers.
1_24	0.071228533	The question is whether the listeners count.
1_25	0.085183883	As radio stations decide whether to spend money to stream their audio content over their Web sites, many are struggling with the business model.
1_26	0.090638413	They want to be able to measure the size of their Internet audience _ and, in turn, market it to advertisers _ before they make the investment in audio streaming.
1_27	0.082495599	Toward that end, The Arbitron Co.
1_28	0.080950604	, which measures traditional radio audiences in local markets, last week announced plans to modify its surveys to track which of the stations' listeners tune in over the Internet.
1_29	0.07483347	The new plan is a joint effort between Arbitron NewMedia and RadioWave.com Inc.
1_30	0.095182797	, the interactive radio subsidiary of Motorola.
1_31	0.078472918	There are 1,708 radio stations worldwide that stream audio, up from 763 a year ago, said BRS Media, an Internet radio consulting agency.
1_32	0.085279518	But thousands of others _ among them, CBS Corp.
1_33	0.084784788	, which owns about 160 radio stations and has a policy against streaming audio _ have abstained, in part because they want to be able to accurately measure the audiences.
1_34	0.089672008	Volunteers Answer Questions Via Internet NEW YORK _ The copious information available on the Net is all well and good, as far as Steve Gordon, a New York lawyer is concerned, except that Gordon figures that people spend hours trying to find the one bit of expertise they are looking for.
1_35	0.076511847	So he decided to put a bunch of the experts in one place.
1_36	0.084388395	Gordon recently launched Allexperts (www.allexperts.com), a Web site that allows visitors to question 2,000 e-mail volunteers on topics like entertainment, computers, and medicine and get a free reply.
1_37	0.098417119	Some of the volunteers are not exactly experts _ the television and music volunteers are entertainment fanatics whom Gordon discovered in chat rooms, news groups and on Web sites _ but in the case of the medical sites, most volunteers are doctors or academics, Gordon said.
1_38	0.092274768	``If you have a keen or critical question, you don't spend two hours researching it,'' Gordon said.
1_39	0.062747723	``You can spend two minutes researching it''.
1_40	0.091287839	Gordon says the site does not vouch for the replies, which he says are meant to serve as general information, not specific advice or diagnosis.
1_41	0.078634892	``It's a chance to talk to people that you might not have a chance to,'' he said.

1_44	0.084784903	In keeping with this trend, Lexmark International Inc.
1_45	0.081066192	of Lexington, Ky.
1_46	0.077718176	, is scheduled next week to ship a new inkjet printer that is also a digital darkroom.
1_47	0.085068659	The Lexmark Photo Jetprinter 5770 is designed to print digital pictures without a personal computer.
1_48	0.073765057	The Photo Jetprinter has a slot into which users can insert a digital film cartridge.
1_49	0.079112261	This means users no longer have to upload the pictures onto a PC, format them and send them to the printer, said Patrick King, Lexmark's general manager for Digital Photo Printer.
1_50	0.086696639	The printer is expected to sell for $349, and individual pictures will cost around 60 cents, taking into account the cost of ink and paper, King said.
1_51	0.079963552	He said that compared with a cost of 40 cents to 70 cents per print for pictures developed at a conventional lab.
1_52	0.059839007	``It's on the upper end,'' King said.
1_53	0.074097987	``But the difference is, with our printer, you're only paying for the ones you want''.
1_54	0.083050538	With some estimates that the digital camera and photoprinter industry will reach $6 billion a year by 2002, Lexmark believes the new printer is worth an investment in research and development.

1_58	0.086558765	The group reasons that, if the software were readily available, it would be easier for programmers to enhance programs and fix bugs.
1_59	0.082640791	Already, thousands of developers freely and openly distribute their source code.
1_60	0.090799583	Still, and not surprisingly, the concept meets with no small friction from companies that are no keener about publishing their source code than Coca-Cola is about publishing its secret formula.
1_61	0.088449423	The foundation, which was started by Richard Stallman, on Friday presented its first Free Software Award to Larry Wall for his contribution to free software development.

5_0	0.10935072	JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) --Libraries are still a more accurate source of information than the Internet, thus students should not confine their research only to the Net, according to a Bar-Ilan University researcher in Israel.

6_0	0.15793047	WASHINGTON _ A renowned letter by Thomas Jefferson, which is the highlight of a traveling Library of Congress exhibition intended as a historical survey of religion and the founding of the nation, has been seized upon by conservative Christian leaders as support for their campaign for classroom prayer, taxpayer-financed vouchers for religious schools and posting the Ten Commandments in courtrooms.
6_1	0.12551253	Some conservative groups and scholars say the Library's analysis of Jefferson's letter is authoritative evidence that could be used in the courts to knock down the barrier between religion and government.
6_2	0.1974683	At the heart of the exhibition _ and of the controversy _ is a famous letter written by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802.
6_3	0.099286483	In it, the nation's third president coined the phrase ``wall of separation between Church and State''.
6_4	0.081234163	Jefferson's letter has been used in Supreme Court cases for more than a century to describe the proper relationship between religion and government.
6_5	0.19761218	The Library of Congress' analysis of the Jefferson letter, released at a news conference in May and written by James Hutson, chief of the library's manuscript division, asserted that Jefferson never meant his letter to be used as the foundation for law, but instead was aimed at winning political favor with New England constituents.
6_6	0.086930356	Hutson's analysis said: ``The Danbury Baptist Letter was never conceived by Jefferson to be a statement of fundamental principles; it was meant to be a political manifesto, nothing more''.
6_7	0.065188642	The conservative leaders said this was proof that Jefferson's ``wall'' metaphor should never have been interpreted as an overarching principle.
6_8	0.16651583	The Christian Coalition immediately issued a news release headlined ``Library of Congress Skewers `Wall of Separation' Myth,'' and said the library's findings should bolster the campaign for the ``religious freedom amendment''.
6_9	0.078060533	The magazine of Focus on the Family, a multimedia ministry, called Jefferson's wall ``flimsy''.
6_10	0.080278544	Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council wrote that Jefferson's words had been ``twisted by liberals''.
6_11	0.10410917	And last month the controversy ricocheted from Christian radio to the ivory tower, when 24 legal scholars and historians sent a letter to the library complaining that its interpretation of the Jefferson letter was misleading and ``unbalanced''.
6_12	0.12968316	``We are concerned for really one fundamental reason,'' said Robert Alley, professor emeritus of humanities at the University of Richmond and one of two scholars who drafted the letter to the library.
6_13	0.085860371	``If you're going to be the keeper of the precious documents of the nation, you ought not to put them on display with biased analysis, and certainly not with a paper that has not been read by its peers and judged for its qualities, and with as many egregious observations of opinion''.
6_14	0.15582529	In an interview at the Library of Congress, Hutson, caretaker of the library's manuscripts for 16 years, said he was amazed that a brief paper he wrote as a ``press primer'' without footnotes had been caught up in a tug of war with national policy implications.
6_15	0.075046207	``The last thing we want to do here is offer opinions on constitutional law,'' Hutson said, his face flushing.
6_16	0.04706079	(STORY CAN END HERE.
6_17	0.077159554	OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn Hutson is 61, a Presbyterian churchgoer, a Yale graduate and an expert on Benjamin Franklin.
6_18	0.08705559	He said he was chagrined that the uproar had overshadowed the 211 other documents and artifacts he painstakingly collected for the exhibition.
6_19	0.080173452	He said he would not repudiate the thesis of his paper, but added, ``Maybe I should have been more careful, but I really did try to guard against anything like this happening''.
6_20	0.094493211	The tempest began when Hutson set out to decipher the blotted-out lines in the first draft of Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptist Association.
6_21	0.085905806	The final version says that ``religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &AMP; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &AMP; not opinions''.
6_22	0.090848164	Jefferson restated the First Amendment's religion clause, and followed with the words ``thus building a wall of separation between Church and State''.
6_23	0.083868711	Hutson asked the FBI to use its computer laboratory to uncover the inked-out words in Jefferson's letter, just as the bureau had done with a diary of Theodore Roosevelt's.
6_24	0.090754468	In doing so, Hutson was performing excavation on a document that is a touchstone of American history.
6_25	0.0920792	The ``wall of separation'' metaphor, though not found in the Constitution, is often invoked as shorthand for the religion clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution, which says that ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof''.
6_26	0.094695396	The import of the ``separation'' language has been argued over by scholars and cited in at least 50 Supreme Court cases dealing with the relationship between government and religion.
6_27	0.094999917	The Supreme Court declared in Reynolds vs.
6_28	0.12439498	United States in 1878 that the ``wall'' metaphor was ``almost an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect'' of the First Amendment.
6_29	0.08926317	Since then, justices like Potter Stewart and William Rehnquist have argued that Jefferson's words were misused.
6_30	0.089393517	The FBI discovered that Jefferson had crossed out the word ``eternal'' preceding ``separation of Church and State'' _ as some scholars had correctly guessed years before _ and inked over ``the duties of my station, which are merely temporal''.
6_31	0.086382129	That last word meant secular, as opposed to spiritual.
6_32	0.087730318	In his essay, Hutson surmised that Jefferson removed these phrases because they might sound ``too anti-religious to pious New England ears''.
6_33	0.079796768	Jefferson's letter, dated Jan.
6_34	0.084512511	1, 1802, was meant to reassure the Baptists of Connecticut, who were suffering persecution from the Congregationalists in control of that state.
6_35	0.083276671	Jefferson also wrote that as president, he would not proclaim national feast days and thanksgivings.
6_36	0.081520894	But Hutson said that Jefferson omitted that section because his advisers warned that it might offend potential political allies.
6_37	0.089175294	Two days after writing the Danbury Baptist letter, Jefferson attended church services held in the House of Representatives, Hutson wrote, which was ``his way of offering symbolic support for religious faith and for its beneficent role in republican government''.
6_38	0.09395834	Conservatives like Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition, embraced Hutson's findings, saying, ``Some in the American elite would love to exclude all semblance of religious expression in the public square, and I think that runs counter to what Thomas Jefferson meant''.
6_39	0.10112731	David Barton, president of WallBuilders, a group that says it aims to restore biblical values in public policy, said, ``The library has confirmed what a lot of us have already been saying, that that letter was never meant to be a national policy paper''.
6_40	0.070806024	The backlash followed.
6_41	0.092421498	In June, Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, an advocacy group in Washington, asked the library to declare Hutson's research ``merely one opinion,'' with which Lynn said most scholars disagree.
6_42	0.10415322	The letter from the 24 scholars, written by them but faxed to the library by Americans United, lambasted Hutson's basic contention that Jefferson's letter was a matter of politics and not principle.
6_43	0.051124282	Robert M.
6_44	0.091764877	O'Neill, director of the Thomas Jefferson Center and a professor of law at the University of Virginia, who helped draft the scholars' letter, said, ``The fact that there may have been a political context for Jefferson's letter hardly disqualifies it as an assertion of principle, especially since it is so consistent with everything else he did or said on this issue''.
6_45	0.089008753	The controversy may reverberate in the courts, said Daniel Dreisbach, an associate professor of justice at American University.
6_46	0.087315439	``I'll bet you my house,'' he said, that some judges, faced with a case on school vouchers or creches on city hall steps, will say, ``We shouldn't be basing constitutional law on the Danbury letter''.
6_47	0.087347925	The exhibition is now closed in Washington, and will soon travel to Dallas, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and southern California.
6_48	0.094933874	The library, whose staff members say they are not accustomed to such controversy, is now trying to calm the furor.
6_49	0.16408957	In a letter in response to the 24 scholars, James Billington, the librarian of Congress, said that ``the library has no control whatsoever over the use that is made of, nor of the interpretation given to, the many materials that it presents to the public''. &QL;

7_2	0.16031991	After spending a week playing with The Library of Congress: Eyes of the Nation, a new CD-ROM exploring the American experience through documents selected from the world's largest archive, I've been partly converted, much like the wayward Puritan of the 1650s who made a ``halfway covenant'' with his faith.
7_3	0.066557627	Used in conjunction with more traditional methods, the CD-ROM may well revolutionize the way we teach history.
7_4	0.11335028	The Eyes of the Nation CD-ROM is divided into five parts.
7_5	0.49042921	All provide a glimpse of the treasures to be found in the Library of Congress' fabulous special collections.
7_6	0.049304505	(The DVD-ROM version has 19 additional exhibits, more than 1,000 additional images and three hours of full-screen video).
7_7	0.089206906	Part One introduces the viewer to the world of rare books, maps, prints and photographs, including the first known slave narrative published on American soil (1760), a detailed sketch of the Gettysburg battlefield by a Confederate topographer (1863), and a poignant photo of two black women on their knees, decorating the grave of a black soldier in the segregated Arlington National Cemetery (1943).
7_8	0.083416188	Parts Two and Three divide the 3,000 images on this CD-ROM along chronological and thematic lines.
7_9	0.070402701	Following a concise and beautifully crafted overview of the American experience by the historian Alan Brinkley, the images are placed into categories like Arts, Entertainment, Transportation and War.
7_10	0.075299141	Each category contains a time line covering the course of American history.
7_11	0.065406111	A journey into The African-African Experience, for example, elicits a dozen images from the years 1947 to 1957, including those of Charlie Parker playing the alto saxophone, Marian Anderson performing with the New York Philharmonic, Rosa Parks being fingerprinted by the police in Montgomery, Ala.
7_12	0.07328454	, and social psychologist Kenneth Clark performing the doll study that swayed several Supreme Court justices in Brown vs.
7_13	0.053355053	Board of Education.
7_14	0.047649039	All the images are accompanied by crisp commentary.
7_15	0.098090202	Part Four, my favorite, contains a series of multimedia exhibits created specifically for Eyes of the Nation.
7_16	0.087517787	These include things like the step-by-step construction of the U.S.
7_17	0.063972409	Capitol and the satirical cartoons of the Gilded Age (1875-1900), in which politicians, capitalists, immigrants and reformers are savagely lampooned, in lavish color, by a rising class of American artists.
7_18	0.086162339	Carefully narrated, these exhibits demonstrate the ability of archivists to create a powerful sense of time and place through the creative use of primary sources.
7_19	0.20912252	Part Five links the CD-ROM to the Library of Congress' American Memory Web site, providing instant access to hundreds of thousands of historical documents.
7_20	0.079026034	Eyes of the Nation is billed as user-friendly, and it partly succeeds.
7_21	0.077287742	All the images can be individually retrieved, filed in portfolios created by users, and printed.
7_22	0.065224494	All contain a written commentary.
7_23	0.085078585	The viewer can also enlarge the image and zoom in on the contents _ a good idea when reading an old letter or studying battlefield maps.
7_24	0.09000531	Yet the search function is confusing and incomplete.
7_25	0.062732515	While including all the images, it does not search the larger text.
7_26	0.088643067	So my attempts to locate J.

7_30	0.048797764	There also appears to be no cross-referencing.

7_32	0.086306606	She is categorized under ``feminism, women's liberation,'' and a viewer seeking more information about her is given the image of that noted athlete Bella Abzug.
7_33	0.085670421	Worse, my search for Dwight D.

7_35	0.020586574	There are other problems.
7_36	0.07675934	After 1970, the project clearly loses momentum.
7_37	0.080562238	The scenes become predictable: space shuttles, presidents and first ladies, Michael Jackson performing ``Thriller''.
7_38	0.082804317	There is little about the major changes transforming the nation, like the extraordinary influx of immigrants from Asia and Latin America.
7_39	0.087727866	At certain times, the project veers down a slippery political road.
7_40	0.089519915	You could easily come away from the images and commentary on Vietnam with the feeling that every single American, with the exception of the Pentagon planners, deeply opposed the conflict.

7_43	0.078259269	A third shows a CIA map of South Vietnam, but the commentary ignores that image in favor of a diatribe against ``the military-industrial complex''.
7_44	0.092170153	There are five separate images of the Vietnam Memorial, emphasizing heartache and loss.
7_45	0.074424709	The ninth image takes on the Persian Gulf war.

8_0	0.094189723	WASHINGTON _ The biggest debate on Capitol Hill _ the one that tells us most about our national character, the one that offers the insight into the national mind _ is not about the future of Medicare, or how to use the budget surplus, or whether taxes should be cut, or whether defense spending ought to rise.
8_1	0.072964399	The biggest debate on Capitol Hill is over whether books ought to be shelved by size.
8_2	0.12524337	The argument is raging only yards from the Capitol, in the national library _ or, more precisely, in Congress's library _ and it is being joined with as much passion as any floor debate in the House, and watched with as much attention as any mark-up session in a Senate appropriations subcommittee.
8_3	0.18846193	Shelving books by size, rather than content, is the idea of some administrators of the library, which is awash in books.
8_4	0.039291492	Too many books.
8_5	0.083574722	If all the large books were together on big shelves, all the small books would be together on small shelves, there would be no gaping holes _ lost space _ in between.
8_6	0.074765817	Such a plan could, say its supporters, increase shelf availability by as much as 33 percent.
8_7	0.045032246	Ah, but at what cost?
8_8	0.093837135	At stake is the place of the written word in the American imagination; the nation's devotion to the fine and practiced art of browsing, even in the amazon.com age; the scholar's impulse to break learning into subject areas; the researcher's conviction that a truth, if not necessarily the truth, can be stumbled upon if only a liberated mind is let loose amongst the stacks of a great library.
8_9	0.071166163	The debate is stirring unusual bitterness inside the ordinarily tranquil study carrels and stacks, which hold 115,506,000 items, including more than 17,772,400 books.
8_10	0.11842601	The very idea of shelving books by size _ the notion of putting the big ones in one section of the library and the little ones somewhere else _ is anathema to book lovers, researchers, and scholars.
8_11	0.12140927	It is a dagger at the heart of the bibliophile's pastime, browsing.

8_31	0.077873688	But around the shelves themselves, in a scene more evocative of an industrial launderer than a national library, are 21 massive yellow tubs, strewn full of books, piled every which way, their jagged edges forming a forbidding glacier field of knowledge.
8_32	0.24649765	This crisis in the rarefied air of the Library of Congress is not a testimony to the sloth of the library's 4,213 employees, nor a dramatic demonstration that the library's annual federal appropriation (some $400 million) is too small.

8_38	0.087799173	There's no prospect of getting more space on Capitol Hill; there simply is no more space on Capitol Hill, and because the Library attracts about 2 million people a year _ making it one of the biggest attractions for tourists in the capital _ the notion of moving the Gutenberg Bible and the Giant Bible of Mainz, both produced in Germany in the 15th century, from their current locations is unthinkable.
8_39	0.088590667	In desperation _ quiet desperation, as Henry David Thoreau might put it _ the library already is taking some significant steps to expand its shelf space.

8_42	0.080543739	The Fort Meade space will not be open to browsing, and any book that a researcher requests won't be available on Capitol Hill for half a day, maybe longer.

8_44	0.08410946	A special library task force has come up with a number of options to ease the strain.
8_45	0.078234918	One is double-shelving, or placing a smaller row of books in front of a larger row.
8_46	0.09160094	The library already employs a similar technique, and so the researcher rummaging through the official papers of the State of Ohio is going to find the volume containing the Senate Journal of 1896 sitting behind the House Journal of 1894 on the shelf; this works only because the volumes are chronological and of uniform size.
8_47	0.074506657	But the real way to save space may be to shelve the books by size.

20_0	0.22160775	WASHINGTON _ In 1990, James Billington, the librarian of Congress, persuaded Congress to provide the first $1 million to start building a national library without walls.
20_1	0.23204288	The idea then was to duplicate much of the Library of Congress' huge holdings in electronic form so people in other parts of the country could have access to the material without traveling to Washington or even leaving home.
20_2	0.2094334	At that time, said Laura Campbell, a Library of Congress official, the only media suitable to the task were the video disk and the CD-ROM.
20_3	0.053284314	``We're not in the distribution business,'' Ms.

20_6	0.043005509	Of course, Ms.
20_7	0.053055392	Campbell said, those were ``the days before the Internet''.
20_8	0.13512508	By 1994, the World Wide Web had evolved, making it easy for even casual computer users to gain access to information on the Internet.
20_9	0.20411935	The Library of Congress saw it as the answer and sought contributions to help put its holdings on line.
20_10	0.086729209	The library solicited a donation from David Packard, the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, who knows something of computers.
20_11	0.059147277	``He said he loved the idea of getting this information out,'' Ms.

20_15	0.046047352	Kellogg Foundation contributed $3 million.
20_16	0.16968668	The $13 million in donations gave the Library of Congress such a jump start that it has reached its goal of raising $45 million for the project from the private sector, while Congress has added $15 million.
20_17	0.54693413	The gateway to the collection, which is stored on a server at the library, is the Library of Congress' American Memory site (memory.loc.gov/ammem/amhome.html).
20_18	0.074306721	It drew 132,000 unique visitors, or people who went to the site at least once, during February, said a spokeswoman for Media Metrix, an Internet measurement company.
20_19	0.14438704	By comparison, the Library of Congress' main government page, Thomas (thomas.loc.gov), which provides access to every part of the federal government, got 249,000 unique visitors that month, according to Media Metrix.
20_20	0.093508367	``Our competitive strength,'' Ms.
20_21	0.06565162	Campbell said, ``is that we have these unique and rare treasures to offer''.

20_33	0.11038664	The goal is to have 5 million by next year, the library's bicentennial.
20_34	0.25920199	The eventual target is to make available 80 million items from the Library of Congress' collection that cannot be easily obtained elsewhere.
20_35	0.10061609	A complete set of Mark Twain is available at just about every American library, so books like that will not be made available on the Internet.
20_36	0.095253725	What will be made available are materials like the earliest movies and sound recordings, maps, manuscripts, the papers of 23 presidents and photographs.
20_37	0.074609773	Fragile rare books are also being put online; less handling means that they will probably last longer.
20_38	0.068881062	Theft from libraries is also reduced when users go digital.
20_39	0.080941348	One such rare item is Ralph Waldo Emerson's 1855 letter praising Walt Whitman's ``Leaves of Grass,'' in which the established Emerson called the little-known Whitman's work ``the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed,'' according to the site.
20_40	0.086837484	Without asking permission, Whitman used Emerson's testimonial in advertising for later editions of his collection of poetry, including some in which he added erotic elements.
20_41	0.062116987	Emerson was not pleased, the entry adds.
20_42	0.13458017	With the Library of Congress site, a teacher of a history course on the American Revolution will be able to have students study not only the final Declaration of Independence but also an earlier draft by Thomas Jefferson with corrections in the margin by Benjamin Franklin and John Adams.

20_45	0.17036406	&QL; nn The shift from video disk and CD-ROM to the Internet has also meant that the Library of Congress has been able to shift its potential electronic audience from schools, universities and school libraries to the desk of any person with a computer and modem.
20_46	0.39415117	The Library of Congress can get its material in the most unexpected ways.
20_47	0.13723275	A collection of early baseball cards, which can be seen on the American Memory site, was gathered by Benjamin K.

20_49	0.076607263	The Edwards collection includes 2,100 baseball cards, produced from 1887 to 1914, and depicts the likes of Ty Cobb, Cy Young, Connie Mack, Walter Johnson and Christy Mathewson.

20_51	0.19986465	To spread the word, the Library of Congress has begun a program to show teachers how to use its collection in their classrooms.
20_52	0.077736279	The program, called American Memory Fellows, sends 50 teachers to Washington for a week each summer and trains them.
20_53	0.085668348	``They agree to spend six weeks on line before coming here,'' Ms.

20_60	0.077420795	Asked how the fellows were chosen, Ms.
20_61	0.11336138	Veccia said that the Library of Congress sought teachers ``who come with an idea of how they are going to use it, who have some facility with the technology _ we really can't be teaching technology skills at this point _ and who are leaders in their fields''.
20_62	0.077178716	The fellowship pays for transportation to Washington and accommodations while here.
20_63	0.092589421	Ms. Veccia said here was not a clear picture of how much of the Internet was being used in the classroom for educational purposes and how much the Internet was simply being used to exchange e-mail messages.
20_64	0.38239921	Besides its own collection, the Library of Congress plans to put other institutions' materials on the American Memory site.
20_65	0.095851183	It has received $2 million from Ameritech to start doing this with material from the New-York Historical Society (which has provided its Civil War collection) and the Chicago Historical Society (the holder of the archives of The Chicago Daily News, a defunct newspaper with a notable sports collection).

22_0	0.20962049	NEW YORK _ Betty Fussell, a food writer best known for a book on the history of corn, says she often buys books rather than trying to use those in the New York Public Library.
