1_2	0.090243278	''We're anxious to get him here and get some photographs at the exhibit''.
1_3	0.038020667	Hope and wife, Delores, arrived Saturday, Grant said.
1_4	0.10837696	Hope is scheduled to attend a private reception Tuesday evening at the library.

1_6	0.075336856	''I'm looking forward to going through this collection myself and reliving and resharing those times and I hope the public feels the same way,'' Anthony Hope said.
1_7	0.094122573	Added Stevens, ''He taught me more than anything to make the stage my home and the audience my family''.
1_8	0.12239326	The exhibit includes 88,000 pages of jokes given to the library by Hope as well as countless other letters, photos, videos and other momentos.

2_1	0.094762124	In truth, I have consciously shied away from them, seeing digital tools as a frivolous assault on scholarly standards.
2_2	0.20436091	After spending a week playing with The Library of Congress: Eyes of the Nation, a new CD-ROM exploring the American experience through documents selected from the world's largest archive, I've been partly converted, much like the wayward Puritan of the 1650s who made a ``halfway covenant'' with his faith.
2_3	0.09401308	Used in conjunction with more traditional methods, the CD-ROM may well revolutionize the way we teach history.
2_4	0.099438371	The Eyes of the Nation CD-ROM is divided into five parts.

2_6	0.051881291	(The DVD-ROM version has 19 additional exhibits, more than 1,000 additional images and three hours of full-screen video).
2_7	0.12308585	Part One introduces the viewer to the world of rare books, maps, prints and photographs, including the first known slave narrative published on American soil (1760), a detailed sketch of the Gettysburg battlefield by a Confederate topographer (1863), and a poignant photo of two black women on their knees, decorating the grave of a black soldier in the segregated Arlington National Cemetery (1943).
2_8	0.078167047	Parts Two and Three divide the 3,000 images on this CD-ROM along chronological and thematic lines.
2_9	0.067678289	Following a concise and beautifully crafted overview of the American experience by the historian Alan Brinkley, the images are placed into categories like Arts, Entertainment, Transportation and War.
2_10	0.090855532	Each category contains a time line covering the course of American history.
2_11	0.07613284	A journey into The African-African Experience, for example, elicits a dozen images from the years 1947 to 1957, including those of Charlie Parker playing the alto saxophone, Marian Anderson performing with the New York Philharmonic, Rosa Parks being fingerprinted by the police in Montgomery, Ala.
2_12	0.010682294	, and social psychologist Kenneth Clark performing the doll study that swayed several Supreme Court justices in Brown vs.

2_14	0.091126828	All the images are accompanied by crisp commentary.
2_15	0.091544481	Part Four, my favorite, contains a series of multimedia exhibits created specifically for Eyes of the Nation.
2_16	0.093414392	These include things like the step-by-step construction of the U.S.
2_17	0.075065573	Capitol and the satirical cartoons of the Gilded Age (1875-1900), in which politicians, capitalists, immigrants and reformers are savagely lampooned, in lavish color, by a rising class of American artists.
2_18	0.082970949	Carefully narrated, these exhibits demonstrate the ability of archivists to create a powerful sense of time and place through the creative use of primary sources.
2_19	0.2433596	Part Five links the CD-ROM to the Library of Congress' American Memory Web site, providing instant access to hundreds of thousands of historical documents.
2_20	0.093135929	Eyes of the Nation is billed as user-friendly, and it partly succeeds.
2_21	0.090681747	All the images can be individually retrieved, filed in portfolios created by users, and printed.
2_22	0.095667054	All contain a written commentary.
2_23	0.079935162	The viewer can also enlarge the image and zoom in on the contents _ a good idea when reading an old letter or studying battlefield maps.
2_24	0.098678182	Yet the search function is confusing and incomplete.
2_25	0.089225612	While including all the images, it does not search the larger text.
2_26	0.099004899	So my attempts to locate J.

2_28	0.089179406	Are they somewhere on this CD-ROM?
2_29	0.092418277	I have no idea.
2_30	0.087846997	There also appears to be no cross-referencing.
2_31	0.092980056	Using the word ``tennis,'' I could find no match for Billie Jean King.
2_32	0.09475316	She is categorized under ``feminism, women's liberation,'' and a viewer seeking more information about her is given the image of that noted athlete Bella Abzug.
2_33	0.10014417	Worse, my search for Dwight D.
2_34	0.093957319	Eisenhower turned up a single image, although I'm certain from my own browsing that there were at least two.
2_35	0.08966445	There are other problems.
2_36	0.096921121	After 1970, the project clearly loses momentum.
2_37	0.092790734	The scenes become predictable: space shuttles, presidents and first ladies, Michael Jackson performing ``Thriller''.
2_38	0.08897433	There is little about the major changes transforming the nation, like the extraordinary influx of immigrants from Asia and Latin America.
2_39	0.084541895	At certain times, the project veers down a slippery political road.
2_40	0.092791185	You could easily come away from the images and commentary on Vietnam with the feeling that every single American, with the exception of the Pentagon planners, deeply opposed the conflict.
2_41	0.089299408	Nine images appear on the time line for War between 1970 and 1991.
2_42	0.093693286	One covers the shooting of student protesters at Kent State; another focuses on ``Apocalypse Now,'' the ultimate anti-war film.
2_43	0.090408955	A third shows a CIA map of South Vietnam, but the commentary ignores that image in favor of a diatribe against ``the military-industrial complex''.
2_44	0.095304393	There are five separate images of the Vietnam Memorial, emphasizing heartache and loss.
2_45	0.09030976	The ninth image takes on the Persian Gulf war.
2_46	0.089458579	It shows a wall of death at the University of Rochester, representing the thousands of Iraqis who were killed in the conflict.
2_47	0.089246482	There is no mention of how the war began or who bears responsibility for the carnage.
2_48	0.090526114	Given the extraordinary scope and beauty of this project, however, these are minor quibbles.
2_49	0.097384113	Eyes of the Nation is not meant to be a textbook.
2_50	0.084219521	It is a compendium of sights and sounds, celebration and protest, pop culture and seminal ideas, reminding us of the richness and diversity of American life.

3_1	0.19407623	The seed of the idea that would become the Library of Congress lay in the fact that while there were sufficient libraries in Philadelphia, where the U.S. government had resided for a decade, there were none in Washington, where the government would soon be.

5_2	0.22687272	House Republicans and Democrats say that if federal funds are used to purchase the papers for $20 million, then the Library of Congress should own the copyright of the collection.
5_3	0.075854845	The King family has expressed an interest in retaining at least partial copyright control, which would result in lucrative royalty fees if the papers are used in a commercial fashion.
5_4	0.14611542	Under such an agreement, if the collection of 80,000 documents is used to create an educational computer program or to write a book, royalties for the use of the King papers would go to the King family.

5_11	0.24472589	Jill Brett, public affairs officer at the Library of Congress, said that 99 percent of its collection is donated and therefore the library accepts donor requests for copyright control in certain circumstances.
5_12	0.10893296	``The library traditionally makes an effort to retain certain rights when we obtain a collection, but we have allowed reasonable restrictions on a case-by-case basis on donations in the past,'' Brett said.
5_13	0.075029213	Reasonable restrictions would include copyright control on literary works of noted authors and historical figures.
5_14	0.10338747	But the purchase of the King papers is different, lawmakers say, because the collection would be purchased, not donated.

9_0	0.21144751	WASHINGTON _ A renowned letter by Thomas Jefferson, which is the highlight of a traveling Library of Congress exhibition intended as a historical survey of religion and the founding of the nation, has been seized upon by conservative Christian leaders as support for their campaign for classroom prayer, taxpayer-financed vouchers for religious schools and posting the Ten Commandments in courtrooms.
9_1	0.10406832	Some conservative groups and scholars say the Library's analysis of Jefferson's letter is authoritative evidence that could be used in the courts to knock down the barrier between religion and government.
9_2	0.16553315	At the heart of the exhibition _ and of the controversy _ is a famous letter written by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802.
9_3	0.084330714	In it, the nation's third president coined the phrase ``wall of separation between Church and State''.
9_4	0.094399801	Jefferson's letter has been used in Supreme Court cases for more than a century to describe the proper relationship between religion and government.
9_5	0.28044321	The Library of Congress' analysis of the Jefferson letter, released at a news conference in May and written by James Hutson, chief of the library's manuscript division, asserted that Jefferson never meant his letter to be used as the foundation for law, but instead was aimed at winning political favor with New England constituents.
9_6	0.095110992	Hutson's analysis said: ``The Danbury Baptist Letter was never conceived by Jefferson to be a statement of fundamental principles; it was meant to be a political manifesto, nothing more''.
9_7	0.094719401	The conservative leaders said this was proof that Jefferson's ``wall'' metaphor should never have been interpreted as an overarching principle.
9_8	0.23242633	The Christian Coalition immediately issued a news release headlined ``Library of Congress Skewers `Wall of Separation' Myth,'' and said the library's findings should bolster the campaign for the ``religious freedom amendment''.
9_9	0.080323781	The magazine of Focus on the Family, a multimedia ministry, called Jefferson's wall ``flimsy''.
9_10	0.089696468	Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council wrote that Jefferson's words had been ``twisted by liberals''.
9_11	0.14788355	And last month the controversy ricocheted from Christian radio to the ivory tower, when 24 legal scholars and historians sent a letter to the library complaining that its interpretation of the Jefferson letter was misleading and ``unbalanced''.
9_12	0.1763343	``We are concerned for really one fundamental reason,'' said Robert Alley, professor emeritus of humanities at the University of Richmond and one of two scholars who drafted the letter to the library.
9_13	0.1004213	``If you're going to be the keeper of the precious documents of the nation, you ought not to put them on display with biased analysis, and certainly not with a paper that has not been read by its peers and judged for its qualities, and with as many egregious observations of opinion''.
9_14	0.22703923	In an interview at the Library of Congress, Hutson, caretaker of the library's manuscripts for 16 years, said he was amazed that a brief paper he wrote as a ``press primer'' without footnotes had been caught up in a tug of war with national policy implications.
9_15	0.095255364	``The last thing we want to do here is offer opinions on constitutional law,'' Hutson said, his face flushing.

9_18	0.1005372	He said he was chagrined that the uproar had overshadowed the 211 other documents and artifacts he painstakingly collected for the exhibition.
9_19	0.082392301	He said he would not repudiate the thesis of his paper, but added, ``Maybe I should have been more careful, but I really did try to guard against anything like this happening''.
9_20	0.096619596	The tempest began when Hutson set out to decipher the blotted-out lines in the first draft of Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptist Association.
9_21	0.045741787	The final version says that ``religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &AMP; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &AMP; not opinions''.
9_22	0.066726339	Jefferson restated the First Amendment's religion clause, and followed with the words ``thus building a wall of separation between Church and State''.
9_23	0.07172927	Hutson asked the FBI to use its computer laboratory to uncover the inked-out words in Jefferson's letter, just as the bureau had done with a diary of Theodore Roosevelt's.
9_24	0.10407762	In doing so, Hutson was performing excavation on a document that is a touchstone of American history.
9_25	0.093947817	The ``wall of separation'' metaphor, though not found in the Constitution, is often invoked as shorthand for the religion clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution, which says that ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof''.
9_26	0.10148819	The import of the ``separation'' language has been argued over by scholars and cited in at least 50 Supreme Court cases dealing with the relationship between government and religion.
9_27	0.097945366	The Supreme Court declared in Reynolds vs.
9_28	0.13438919	United States in 1878 that the ``wall'' metaphor was ``almost an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect'' of the First Amendment.
9_29	0.061930305	Since then, justices like Potter Stewart and William Rehnquist have argued that Jefferson's words were misused.
9_30	0.052490132	The FBI discovered that Jefferson had crossed out the word ``eternal'' preceding ``separation of Church and State'' _ as some scholars had correctly guessed years before _ and inked over ``the duties of my station, which are merely temporal''.
9_31	0.097163285	That last word meant secular, as opposed to spiritual.
9_32	0.069863089	In his essay, Hutson surmised that Jefferson removed these phrases because they might sound ``too anti-religious to pious New England ears''.
9_33	0.087959044	Jefferson's letter, dated Jan.
9_34	0.086261033	1, 1802, was meant to reassure the Baptists of Connecticut, who were suffering persecution from the Congregationalists in control of that state.
9_35	0.096775466	Jefferson also wrote that as president, he would not proclaim national feast days and thanksgivings.
9_36	0.095300148	But Hutson said that Jefferson omitted that section because his advisers warned that it might offend potential political allies.
9_37	0.076009248	Two days after writing the Danbury Baptist letter, Jefferson attended church services held in the House of Representatives, Hutson wrote, which was ``his way of offering symbolic support for religious faith and for its beneficent role in republican government''.
9_38	0.10893908	Conservatives like Randy Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition, embraced Hutson's findings, saying, ``Some in the American elite would love to exclude all semblance of religious expression in the public square, and I think that runs counter to what Thomas Jefferson meant''.
9_39	0.113156	David Barton, president of WallBuilders, a group that says it aims to restore biblical values in public policy, said, ``The library has confirmed what a lot of us have already been saying, that that letter was never meant to be a national policy paper''.
9_40	0.10131659	The backlash followed.
9_41	0.094311933	In June, Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, an advocacy group in Washington, asked the library to declare Hutson's research ``merely one opinion,'' with which Lynn said most scholars disagree.
9_42	0.12797807	The letter from the 24 scholars, written by them but faxed to the library by Americans United, lambasted Hutson's basic contention that Jefferson's letter was a matter of politics and not principle.
9_43	0.059513741	Robert M.
9_44	0.1015877	O'Neill, director of the Thomas Jefferson Center and a professor of law at the University of Virginia, who helped draft the scholars' letter, said, ``The fact that there may have been a political context for Jefferson's letter hardly disqualifies it as an assertion of principle, especially since it is so consistent with everything else he did or said on this issue''.
9_45	0.091269059	The controversy may reverberate in the courts, said Daniel Dreisbach, an associate professor of justice at American University.
9_46	0.07568225	``I'll bet you my house,'' he said, that some judges, faced with a case on school vouchers or creches on city hall steps, will say, ``We shouldn't be basing constitutional law on the Danbury letter''.

9_48	0.093367764	The library, whose staff members say they are not accustomed to such controversy, is now trying to calm the furor.
9_49	0.20218314	In a letter in response to the 24 scholars, James Billington, the librarian of Congress, said that ``the library has no control whatsoever over the use that is made of, nor of the interpretation given to, the many materials that it presents to the public''. &QL;

12_2	0.087955322	to buy the slain civil rights leader's private papers for $20 million.
12_3	0.28386613	Though the price is the largest amount of money the Library of Congress has ever paid for a collection of papers, some researchers and students of the civil rights era question the historic value of the material.
12_4	0.13866089	Under the agreement, first reported this week in Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, the King family will transfer to the library King's letters, notes, and first drafts of speeches which are now at the Martin Luther King Center in Atlanta.
12_5	0.11808865	The collection, which is made up of about 80,000 items, was valued at $30 million by Sotheby's, which did a private appraisal at the request of the King family.
12_6	0.071866481	The King family originally wanted the full $30 million, but when Library officials balked, the family agreed to reduce the payment request to $20 million and take a $10 million tax deduction.

12_8	0.12141946	King while making a substantial gift to the nation,'' said a statement issued in the name of Dexter Scott King, the civil rights leader's son who now heads the King Center in Atlanta and is executor of the King estate.

12_12	0.25744091	The Library of Congress rarely spends money to acquire historic documents.
12_13	0.25029358	Since the library is the Copyright Office of the United States it automatically gets copies of books and manuscripts that are published in the United States.
12_14	0.19421364	The last time the library purchased a collection was in 1930, when it spent $1.5 million to buy a rare-book collection that included one of three perfect copies of the Gutenberg Bible.
12_15	0.10112058	To date, that was the most the library had ever paid for a collection.
12_16	0.092748894	Some historians say the King papers that are being purchased are worth more for their prestige value than their historical content.
12_17	0.093225062	The King family retains control of the official papers of civil rights groups such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which King headed, the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Non-violent Co-ordinating Committee.

12_30	0.11572417	But, unlike the King papers, all were donated to the library.
12_31	0.12344576	The pending sale of King's papers has again raised the question of the King family trying to capitalize financially on the legacy of one of the towering figures of the 20th Century and an icon to many Americans of all races.
12_32	0.078372412	In 1996, the family sued CBS for copyright infringement when it included excerpts from King's famous speech during the 1963 March on Washington.
12_33	0.09342892	The speech, which included the memorable lines, ``I have a dream,'' is considered one of the great pleas for racial harmony and justice.
12_34	0.098183123	Last year, a federal judge in Washington denied the Kings' claim, ruling that the speech was in the public domain.
12_35	0.14946072	``The family is amazing, isn't it''? said Gilbert Jonas, one of the chief fund-raisers for the NAACP for 30 years who recently donated his papers to the library.

12_38	0.094025641	But others defend the King family's right to earn money.
12_39	0.098451717	``I never quite understood why the issue of money was used against the King family when any other family that owns a valuable piece of property would not be expected to just give it away,'' said Clayburn Carson, a history professor at Stanford who was involved in the negotiations to purchase many of the papers from the King Center in 1997.

13_2	0.19126902	That is because the latest donation to the library came in the form of computer disks _ 44 of them, each carrying 40 gigabytes of information.
13_3	0.20878629	The disks include a snapshot of the entire contents of the World Wide Web during the first two months of 1997, including each of the millions of individual Web sites _ the good, the bad, and even the smutty stuff Congress does not want kids to see.
13_4	0.11392424	The collection was gathered, stored and donated by Alexa Internet of San Francisco, which has developed a tool bar that makes it easy to view Web-site background information like where the site is located, whether it has a privacy policy, or if it has won third-party endorsements or awards.
13_5	0.092881153	The company's president, Brewster Kahle, said the donation preserves a moment in the life of the ever-evolving Web and can become a resource for sociologists and, eventually, historians who want to understand our era.
13_6	0.11975252	Alas, while the disks are on display at the library _ as part of an interactive sculpture _ their contents are not _ yet.
13_7	0.36425893	``It's kind of a laboratory experiment for us,'' said Guy Lamolinara, a spokesman for the Library of Congress, noting that some of the material was not suitable for the collections, and the library was still working out copyright issues.
13_8	0.091853383	``We will be using it to explore how to preserve digital materials, and how to provide access to these materials''.
13_9	0.060825677	Kahle, who also oversees the non-profit organization Internet Archive, said the Web is growing at a rate of 1.5 million pages a day.

14_1	0.16367041	This has come to include such varied output as the papers of Thomas Jefferson and the Wright brothers, the original compositions of Leonard Bernstein and the video archives of the Martha Graham Dance Company.
14_2	0.22495199	But the nation's creativity now extends to Web sites, electronic journals and magazines, and CD-ROMs of every sort, and the library has fallen behind in collecting and archiving that digital material, according to a report released on Wednesday by the National Academy of Sciences.
14_3	0.10060368	Unless its administrators act swiftly, the report says, the library will risk diminishing relevance.
14_4	0.16570223	The 260-page report is the most comprehensive overview to date of the Library of Congress' digital preparedness.
14_5	0.15113035	``The nation's creativity is at this point significantly represented by what's happening electronically,'' said James O'Donnell, vice provost of information systems and computing at the University of Pennsylvania and chairman of the committee that produced the National Academy's report.
14_6	0.15242644	The committee included outside experts in digital libraries, databases, computer networking and digital preservation.
14_7	0.189117	``If you keep the mission of the library what it has been, the change in the landscape brought about by networked information is dramatic and brings about unavoidable challenges for the library,'' O'Donnell said.
14_8	0.13191338	Those challenges are, of course, shared by scores of other research libraries faced with the task of collecting, making accessible and preserving the nation's assorted electronica: scholarly journals, books and magazines published in electronic form; multimedia products like CD-ROMs; digital photographs, music and films; and millions of miscellaneous pieces of Internet-based material.
14_9	0.12450406	Further, the report stated, there are built-in limits to the library's ability to respond quickly to trends: As a creature of Congress, it is often mired in governmental bureaucracy.
14_10	0.12434946	The committee said it saw ``signs that the library is already losing the momentum and purchase required to make the next steep ascent'' to respond to the new challenges ``in a timely and effective way''.
14_11	0.093504466	One problem is inadequate infrastructure.
14_12	0.15459058	The library urgently needs a sophisticated system for receiving and managing digital documents deposited with the library and registered for copyright.
14_13	0.09451862	The library also needs to recruit and retain computer experts from a field already suffering a labor shortage.
14_14	0.10953375	The report also emphasized the need for the library to collaborate with other national libraries and institutions.
14_15	0.081684267	Ann Okerson, a committee member who is associate university librarian at Yale University, said: ``At a time when we are trying to build large, interconnected systems, it is unlikely that a single institution could create such complicated systems independently of other key players.
14_16	0.16504442	That goes for the Library of Congress or any other large library or organization''.
14_17	0.12219819	The committee expressed less concern over the library's ongoing efforts to make digital copies of items in its physical collection.
14_18	0.085990658	``Digitizing your analog material is less urgent,'' O'Donnell said.

14_29	0.10026215	The report is a set of recommendations only, and the library is not required to act on them.
14_30	0.080102931	Margaret Hedstrom, a committee member who is an associate professor in the School of Information at the University of Michigan, said, ``I suppose to some degree, a test of how serious they are is which of them they act on, and how soon''.
14_31	0.091726308	Billington said one of the main obstacles to carrying out the report's recommendations is financing.
14_32	0.099262148	In its 2001 budget request, the library asked for a $21 million increase for digital archiving, but the actual increase will probably fall far short of that.
14_33	0.092853753	``A major unresolved issue is how to fund this effort,'' Billington said.

14_36	0.16737594	By the end of this year, the library will have placed 5 million of its 119 million items on its American Memory site (memory.loc.gov), for use by the public.
14_37	0.089502846	The site gets more than 4 million hits each day, most of them from schoolchildren who go there to view artifacts like old baseball cards, Lincoln's papers and historic pamphlets from the National American Woman Suffrage Association.
14_38	0.092731368	A few other pieces of the digital puzzle are falling into place.
14_39	0.1611484	The library has preserved many of its digital resources, including the full-text databases of the Thomas system for legislative information and its own bibliographic databases.
14_40	0.12678392	The library has an extensive collection of CDs and CD-ROMs, and it is about to sign an agreement with the American Physical Society, which will regularly deposit its eight online physics journals.

14_42	0.15952623	``Still, the rapid clip at which digital information of all kinds is proliferating has caught the Library of Congress largely unprepared,'' O'Donnell said.

19_9	0.072047888	The debate is stirring unusual bitterness inside the ordinarily tranquil study carrels and stacks, which hold 115,506,000 items, including more than 17,772,400 books.
19_10	0.12798745	The very idea of shelving books by size _ the notion of putting the big ones in one section of the library and the little ones somewhere else _ is anathema to book lovers, researchers, and scholars.

19_31	0.076332368	But around the shelves themselves, in a scene more evocative of an industrial launderer than a national library, are 21 massive yellow tubs, strewn full of books, piled every which way, their jagged edges forming a forbidding glacier field of knowledge.
19_32	0.25306978	This crisis in the rarefied air of the Library of Congress is not a testimony to the sloth of the library's 4,213 employees, nor a dramatic demonstration that the library's annual federal appropriation (some $400 million) is too small.

19_38	0.088963295	There's no prospect of getting more space on Capitol Hill; there simply is no more space on Capitol Hill, and because the Library attracts about 2 million people a year _ making it one of the biggest attractions for tourists in the capital _ the notion of moving the Gutenberg Bible and the Giant Bible of Mainz, both produced in Germany in the 15th century, from their current locations is unthinkable.
19_39	0.087156714	In desperation _ quiet desperation, as Henry David Thoreau might put it _ the library already is taking some significant steps to expand its shelf space.

19_44	0.093327802	A special library task force has come up with a number of options to ease the strain.
19_45	0.090370608	One is double-shelving, or placing a smaller row of books in front of a larger row.
19_46	0.10301699	The library already employs a similar technique, and so the researcher rummaging through the official papers of the State of Ohio is going to find the volume containing the Senate Journal of 1896 sitting behind the House Journal of 1894 on the shelf; this works only because the volumes are chronological and of uniform size.
19_47	0.088055885	But the real way to save space may be to shelve the books by size.
19_48	0.089091825	Each book would have a fixed place on a fixed shelf.
19_49	0.098724192	No need to keep some empty space at the end of the shelf in the anticipation that new works might be on the way.
19_50	0.09115863	No need to worry just where that new volume should rest, between which other volumes.
19_51	0.080140767	They'd go in, all in a row, catalogued precisely by computer, so that the researcher looking for a copy of James Morris's ``Pax Britannica'' or Carl Yastrzemski and Al Hirshberg's ``Yaz'' would know exactly where to look.

19_62	0.09338333	``But it takes up significant amounts of space''.
19_63	0.11168026	But the argument about shelving books by size is worth having, not only because the great surge in printed material is causing a problem that many libraries _ from Harvard and Cornell to the national libraries of France and Britain _ can no longer avoid.
