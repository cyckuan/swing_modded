0_9	0.16	&UR; ___ &UR; Study shows Ritalin is effective in helping children with ADHD ANAHEIM, California (AP) _ Behavior in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder improves dramatically when they take the controversial drug Ritalin, according to a study.

2_2	0.35714285714285715	And like thousands of parents, Michael and Jill Carroll worry about the drug's side effects, including sleeplessness and loss of appetite.
2_3	0.0	But they keep their child on the medication, in part because they fear child welfare workers will take him away if they don't.
2_4	0.0	Earlier this year, administrators from the school district called Albany County Child Protective Services, alleging child abuse when the Carrolls said they wanted to take Kyle off the drug.
2_5	0.0	As a result, the Carrolls are now on a statewide list of alleged child abusers, and they have been thrust into an Orwellian family court battle to clear their name and to ensure their child isn't removed from their home.
2_6	0.0	``It's beyond the point of whether he should be on it.

2_9	0.0	The Carroll's dilemma is not unique.
2_10	0.125	While there are no reliable statistics on the phenomenon, observers say public schools are increasingly accusing parents of child abuse and neglect if they balk at giving their children medication such as Ritalin, a stimulant being prescribed to an increasing number of students.
2_11	0.3333333333333333	According to a recent report from the American Academy of Pediatrics, as many as 3.8 million school children, mostly boys, have ADHD.
2_12	0.3333333333333333	The disorder is characterized by a short attention span, jumpiness and impulsive behavior.
2_13	0.0	But many cases are misdiagnosed, the study found.
2_14	0.0	Additionally, at least a million children take Ritalin and the use of the drug has risen many times more during the past few years.
2_15	0.0	Along with that increase, schools are using some heavy-handed tactics on parents who may balk at the medication.
2_16	0.0	``The schools are now using child protective services to enforce their own desires and their own policies,'' said David Lansner, a New York City lawyer who has seen cases similar to the Carrolls'.
2_17	0.0	``This thing is so scary,'' remarked Patricia Weathers, of Millbrook, N.Y., a suburb of Poughkeepsie.
2_18	0.0	Officials at the Millbrook school district called police and child protective services when she took her 9-year-old son, Michael Mozer, off medications earlier this year.
2_19	0.0	She said a drug cocktail including Ritalin, the anti-depressant Paxil and Dexedrine, a stimulant like Ritalin, caused her boy to hallucinate.

2_30	0.0	He also went to summer school.
2_31	0.0	But last fall, when Kyle started second grade, the Ritalin and extra help didn't seem to do much good.
2_32	0.0	The Carrolls grew concerned when Kyle was only sleeping about five hours a night and eating just one meal a day.
2_33	0.0	So they told school officials they wanted to take Kyle off Ritalin for two weeks to see if that helped.
2_34	0.0	That's when they got a call, then a visit, from a Child Protective Services worker.
2_35	0.0	The visit led to a family court appearance in April, which was continued to later this month.
2_36	0.0	The hearing will give the Carrolls a chance to clear their name _ to some extent.
2_37	0.0	If cleared, their case in the state register of alleged abusers will be sealed, but it could be opened in the future if there are other allegations of abuse.
2_38	0.0	Jill Carroll is particularly concerned because she's training to become a childcare worker.
2_39	0.0	Being in the state register could keep her from working in that field.
2_40	0.0	Moreover, the Carrolls still don't know all the details of the charges against them.
2_41	0.0	The ``intake report'' on their case states that ``Fa (father) is refusing to give the ch (child) the Ritalin''.
2_42	0.0	But several lines on the report are blacked out with a marking pen.
2_43	0.0	It's roughly analogous to a criminal facing charges but not being told what they are.
2_44	0.0	Complaints to Child Protective Services are also anonymous, so suspects don't know who has leveled the charges.
2_45	0.0	In this case, however, the Carrolls say they were told that a school guidance counselor made the complaint.
2_46	0.0	Michael Carroll noted this wasn't his first brush with Child Protective Services.
2_47	0.0	Last year, he said, a social worker checked on an anonymous rumor that he had gotten drunk and struck family members, but the allegations turned out to be groundless.
2_48	0.0	No charges were filed, and the Carrolls were not ``indicated,'' or written up in the state register like they were for the Ritalin episode.

4_1	0.29411764705882354	The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday issued its first guidelines for ADHD, hoping to eliminate incorrect diagnoses and make sure untreated children get the help they need.

6_12	0.0	A study by Dr.
6_13	0.15	Julie Magno Zito at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy in Baltimore found that as many as 1.5 percent of American children between the ages of 2 and 4 are taking stimulants such as Ritalin, as well as antidepressants and antipsychotics.
6_14	0.0	According to Zito's findings, stimulant use in this age group (Ritalin in 90 percent of the cases) rose two- to threefold from 1991 to 1995, while the rate of antidepressant prescriptions nearly doubled during the same time period.

6_19	0.04	Dr. Jerry Rushton, a pediatrician at the University of Michigan School of Medicine in Ann Arbor, says that clinicians simply know more about childhood mental illnesses now than they did in the past _ and with this knowledge has come a rise in the number of diagnoses and prescriptions.
6_20	0.0	According to Rushton, heightened awareness among clinicians stems in part from mental health research conducted during the 1990s, which provided evidence that identifiable, biologically-based mental illnesses, such as depression, can occur in children as young as 2 or 3 years old.
6_21	0.07692307692307693	Another factor underlying the rise in prescriptions, says Rushton, is the emergence of a new class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil, which have fewer, less serious side effects than the previous generation of antidepressants.
6_22	0.0	They have been increasingly prescribed over the last decade by pediatricians for treating depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety in children.

6_27	0.45454545454545453	A case in point is ADHD, which has become increasingly common in the years since it was first described by the American Psychiatric Association in 1980.
6_28	0.7142857142857143	In 1987, the APA redefined the criteria for diagnosing ADHD to include individuals with either hyperactivity or impulsive behavior, and not necessarily both, as was previously the case.
6_29	0.2857142857142857	The result was a skyrocketing increase in the number of ADHD diagnoses.
6_30	0.2727272727272727	Figures released by the APA in May indicate that anywhere from 4 percent to 12 percent of all American children _ some 2.5 million _ are now thought to have the disorder, making it the most common pediatric mental illness in the United States.
6_31	0.0	And according to Zito, the dramatic rise in prescriptions for Ritalin can be linked directly to the increased national caseload of pediatric ADHD.
6_32	0.047619047619047616	Parents who consult a professional about their child's behavior will likely confront a managed care system widely viewed by clinicians and patients as inadequate or unresponsive where mental health coverage is concerned.

6_35	0.19047619047619047	Many insurance companies restrict access to psychiatric specialists, limit the number of visits for psychotherapy and encourage primary care physicians to prescribe medications rather than to try longer-term psychosocial interventions.
6_36	0.0	And, according to Koplewicz, most children are evaluated for mental illness not by child psychiatrists, but by pediatricians, many of whom have little training in mental health.
6_37	0.0	By refusing to cover the cost of psychiatric referrals, managed care companies are limiting the resources available to pediatricians, he says, which may add pressure to reach for the prescription pad.
6_38	0.0	Experts, including Koplewicz, say that children with mental illness who don't get treatment are likely to suffer from negative self-esteem and poor relationships with others, and are at a much higher risk of delinquency, occupational problems and suicide later on in life.
6_39	0.0	If you are worried that your pediatrician cannot devote the time needed to conduct a comprehensive mental health evaluation because of an overwhelming schedule, ask for a recommendation to a qualified expert who can conduct a thorough assessment, which should include in-depth interviews with the child, parents and teachers, and a review of school records and family history.
6_40	0.09523809523809523	Unfortunately, many pediatricians feel pressure to prescribe medications for mental and emotional health problems simply as a way to do something for a child in light of the limitations managed care places on physicians, says Dr.

6_43	0.0	In one of the largest studies of its kind ever conducted, a team of researchers at six sites around the country, led by Jensen, followed 579 children with ADHD for 14 months to assess their progress with various forms of treatment.
6_44	0.2	The researchers found that medication was substantially more effective than behavior-modification therapy in treating children with ADHD alone.
6_45	0.0	In cases where children had problems in addition to ADHD, such as depression or anxiety, combining medication with behavior therapy provided an advantage.
6_46	0.0	Medical knowledge surrounding the most effective treatment of mental illnesses in children is still evolving.
6_47	0.0	Because so few of these studies have been completed, a consensus among experts on the benefits of medication over psychosocial approaches has yet to emerge.
6_48	0.0	Ultimately, parents need to discuss all the available treatment options with their pediatrician so they can make an informed decision about what will be best for their child, says Koplewicz.
6_49	0.0	After the evaluation, he says, ``the critical thing is that you as a parent understand the diagnosis, as well as the benefits and risks of each treatment option under consideration''.

16_11	0.0	Though he excels in music and arts and his intelligence level is way beyond his years, he is easily frustrated, cries frequently and does not do what he is told.
16_12	0.0	His teachers call me all the time, telling me he is a discipline problem and will not finish his work.
16_13	0.0	He also does not seem to get along with other children and is very unorganized.
16_14	0.0	Could he be ADHD _ even though he makes straight A's when he chooses to do his work?

16_16	0.5454545454545454	DR. BRAZELTON: The diagnosis of ADHD _ Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder _ doesn't occur to me.
16_17	0.0	Too many adults (teachers and parents) use it as a sort of wastebasket diagnosis.
16_18	0.0	Instead, I would think that your son is feeling too much pressure to perform.
16_19	0.0	He may be a perfectionist and may not want to take chances on being anything but perfect.
16_20	0.0	The gifted program may be too pressured an environment for an already inner-pressured child.
16_21	0.0	Hearing that other children shun him and that he is disorganized worries me.
16_22	0.0	I urge you to have your son evaluated by a child psychologist or therapist.
16_23	0.0	It sounds as if he may be feeling overwhelmed or depressed.
16_24	0.0	QUESTION: Our 26-month-old son is very loving and well-behaved, but when he gets mad or frustrated he acts out by hitting, kicking or throwing things.
16_25	0.0	What would you suggest we do?
16_26	0.0	When we put him in timeout, he gets frantic and more out of control _ not calmer.
16_27	0.0	_ R.H., Missouri City, Texas DR.
16_28	0.0	BRAZELTON: His out-of-control, hurting behaviors are a mark of how frightening it is to lose control.
16_29	0.0	He needs you to help him regain control and to help him understand his behavior.
16_30	0.0	Hold him or contain him when he gets out of control (a timeout is just for that purpose).
16_31	0.0	As soon as you break the cycle, tell him that you understand how upset he is but that you also want to help him learn to control himself.
16_32	0.0	It's too frightening to everyone (including him) when he loses it.
16_33	0.0	QUESTION: When my 4-year-old son wakes up at night, he comes into our bed, saying he is afraid.
16_34	0.0	We welcome him with open arms and do not take him back to his bed.
16_35	0.0	My question: By allowing him to come into our bed, are we preventing him from learning to overcome his fears and anxieties?
16_36	0.0	Or is he learning a sense of love, security and self-importance from us?
16_37	0.0	_ M.J.M., Boca Raton, Fla.
16_38	0.0	DR. BRAZELTON: Both.
16_39	0.0	You are certainly offering him security by accepting him.
16_40	0.0	But you aren't helping him overcome his age-appropriate fears and nightmares.
16_41	0.0	These are normal at his age, when he is learning about his own aggressive feelings.
16_42	0.0	During the day, he will need your help with those fears and your understanding.
16_43	0.0	He will best learn how to handle angry and aggressive feelings from you and your spouse by modeling on you both as you handle your own feelings.
16_44	0.0	I won't tell you when to begin helping him go back to his own bed, but it should be a goal.
16_45	0.0	He'd be proud if he could learn to handle his own fears.
16_46	0.0	QUESTION: I am very upset about my 4 1/2-year-old grandson.
16_47	0.0	He is a bright, happy, verbal youngster at home.
16_48	0.0	However, in daycare/nursery school, he will not speak with the children or teacher.
16_49	0.0	This has been the problem since he started daycare at 2 1/2.
16_50	0.0	His parents have been going with him to therapy for 16 months _ with two different therapists.
16_51	0.0	He still won't speak in school, though he participates in all activities.
16_52	0.0	What are your thoughts?
16_53	0.0	_ R.W., Baltimore, Md.
16_54	0.0	DR. BRAZELTON: I assume that his parents have gotten an evaluation from the therapists about whether your grandson has a hypersensitive hearing problem or a sensory integration problem, which can lead to an autistic-like interference in handling complex environments.
16_55	0.0	If he hasn't been evaluated, he should be.
16_56	0.0	But if your grandson is not plagued with such a problem, he may just be a child who participates visually.
16_57	0.0	I have seen children who are part of the group without ever participating openly.
16_58	0.0	If no one pushes him, he'll probably start communicating on his own.

19_0	0.2	WASHINGTON _ When a little green pill turns a miserable, rowdy, troublemaking kid into an attentive, quiet and apparently happy youngster, it is either correcting an imbalance of brain chemistry or suppressing the child's natural spontaneity and innovative impulses.
19_1	0.0	It depends on who's describing it.
19_2	0.2916666666666667	But sales of the pill, the stimulant methylphenidate, which is marketed under the trade name Ritalin, have more than doubled in the past decade as more and more parents, teachers and therapists turn to the drug to treat a condition known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
19_3	0.0	While the drug, which acts on the brain in much the same way as cocaine, is increasingly used to make better students out of elementary school children deemed to have ``developmental disorders,'' a growing number of specialists has begun to question the wisdom of using the drug.
19_4	0.4444444444444444	In addition to methylphenidate, stimulates such as amphetamines are sometimes used to treat ADHD, but to a lesser extent.
19_5	0.0	A committee of psychiatrists, neurologists, pediatricians, pharmacologists and educators will listen to experts on different sides of the controversy before attempting Wednesday to issue a ``consensus statement'' on ADHD and its treatment.

19_13	0.7619047619047619	People with behavioral patterns that cause them to be diagnosed as having ADHD _ impulsiveness, inability to concentrate, difficulty learning _ appear to have a deficiency in certain brain receptors involved in processing the neurotransmitter dopamine, according to this view.
19_14	0.1	Like cocaine, methylphenidate inhibits a brain chemical that removes dopamine from certain areas of the brain.
19_15	0.0	In effect, it increases the time the reduced number of receptors is exposed to dopamine.

19_17	0.6428571428571429	For one thing, while ADHD has been thought of as a temporary condition that children ``grow out of,'' recent findings suggest it may be a chronic condition that can last a lifetime.

24_0	0.125	WASHINGTON (AP) --Millions of American children take drugs daily to calm hyperactivity, but medical science has been uncertain how the drugs affect the brain.
24_1	0.6153846153846154	New research in mice suggests that drugs such as Ritalin quiet hyperactivity by boosting the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter, in the brain.
24_2	0.0	A study appears Friday in the journal Science.
24_3	0.5333333333333333	Between 3 and 6 percent of American school-age children suffer from a condition called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
24_4	0.0	These children are restless and impulsive and have difficulty concentrating.
24_5	0.25	Drugs such as Ritalin and Dexedrine have a calming effect, but their action has been poorly understood.
24_6	0.058823529411764705	Howard Hughes Medical Institute researchers at Duke University discovered the serotonin action of Ritalin by eliminating the possibility that the drug was acting on other brain chemicals.
24_7	0.0	They used a laboratory mouse strain that had been genetically manipulated to lack a key protein in the processing of dopamine, another neurotransmitter.
24_8	0.0	Such mice have symptoms similar to those of ADHD.
24_9	0.0	When the mice lacking normal dopamine were given Ritalin, they were calmed, proving that the drug was not acting on dopamine.
24_10	0.1	The researchers then blocked the effects of norepinephrine, another brain chemical, but this had no effect on the ADHD symptoms.
24_11	0.0	Finally, the researchers gave the mice Prozac, a drug that inhibits the action of serotonin.
24_12	0.0	The ADHD symptoms declined dramatically in the mice.
24_13	0.26666666666666666	The results, said the researchers, show that Ritalin acts on the serotonin levels in the brain by restoring a proper balance between serotonin and other natural brain chemicals.
