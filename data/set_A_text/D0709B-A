1_0	0.11696999	When a stunning Angelina Jolie announced a few minutes after winning a Golden Globe that she would take a plunge, gown and all, in the hotel swimming pool, she must have seemed insane to anyone who had just watched her wiggle to the stage to claim her award for her part in ``Gia,'' an HBO movie.
1_1	0.067867963	The white and silver racer-back gown she wore so closely outlined the best of what Ms.
1_2	0.070095165	Jolie has to offer that it seemed she had already been dipped in water.
1_3	0.096598823	Awards shows like the Golden Globes, which took place last month, have become a huge influence on fashion, previewing what designers are likely to put on runways and stimulating sales.
1_4	0.11253405	Ms. Jolie's dress, by Randolph Duke, turned up in his show last Friday.
1_5	0.066221346	The lace-and-sequin gown that Halston's Kevan Hall put on Christine Lahti for the Golden Globes presaged the cobweb and beaded lace gowns he presented last week for fall.
1_6	0.067140519	And the black and white outfit designed by Pamela Dennis for Calista Flockhart begot long trumpet skirts on the catwalk, including one in rich ruby sequins.
1_7	0.087564686	But on the whole, evening-wear designers showing for fall 1999 are a demure bunch.
1_8	0.091600057	There was plenty of beauty worthy of the Oscars, the Golden Globes or even the Grammys, which offer a chance for more fashion-watching tomorrow night, but little to elicit heart palpitations.
1_9	0.080536842	This design approach suited the moment well, for with a few exceptions, it was a sexless season.
1_10	0.063235423	Not that celibate fashion is bad.
1_11	0.0082205548	It's just different.
1_12	0.075152251	Tommy Hilfiger and Daryl Kerrigan, in her Daryl K collection, ripped with wonderful abandon into both ends of the sexless spectrum.
1_13	0.075088476	As American as cornflakes, Hilfiger plays the wide-eyed innocent of fashion who just might have a dirty little secret.
1_14	0.068381112	He gives enough edge to his approachable clothes that they are just safely this side of Kmart oblivion.
1_15	0.078937481	To the sounds of a live rock band, Sugar Ray, the more to underline the hip Hilfiger-music connection, the designer sent men's and women's clothes rocking down the runway together.
1_16	0.088829904	His mix of sports, music and high fashion was a potent brew, especially in long nylon skirts and leather jeans with white stitching.
1_17	0.081112126	The collection was further elevated by terrific fur vests, python patchwork pants and an evening gown of leather and wool fit for a biker princess.
1_18	0.069725493	Ms. Kerrigan's collection was a pirate's treasure worth of creativity.
1_19	0.070989648	There was no guesswork in trying to figure out her inspirational mother lode.
1_20	0.024506278	It was war.
1_21	0.09580085	She masterfully rolled the concept into her funky street-wear esthetic, with parachute nylon jackets over slim pants, holey sweaters and shorts over trousers.
1_22	0.094491806	Menacingly dark colors were intercepted by flashes of reflective utilitarian orange or white in luxuriously ragged shearling coats or nylon hooded jackets that partly hid the models' faces.
1_23	0.082541634	That war should be text for a Kerrigan show is not surprising given that Ms.
1_24	0.10385195	Kerrigan hails from Ireland, where an awareness of violence is never far from mind.
1_25	0.071226475	Whether it was Ireland or the millennium that drove her, the results were masterly.
1_26	0.10283525	The pretty, festive clothes of the many designers who showed evening wear in the last days of the shows, which ended Friday, balanced the aggressive message of designers like Ms.
1_27	0.082372906	Kerrigan. In his second season as chief designer for Halston, Hall made a short excursion into day wear, and it was most promising: a studded chocolate suede dress with decolletage abounding; a lush vanilla frappe of a wrap jacket over a crisp white Halston shirt.
1_28	0.094103795	Beaded tweed gowns and silvery sheaths were tantalizing.
1_29	0.087846043	There were, though, unnecessarily mundane gowns, like a black velvet column that made one wonder which member of his front row Hall was playing to.
1_30	0.082243313	If you were Lynn Whitfield, a diva who has to make an entrance, it lacked impact.
1_31	0.089114616	If you were Dawn Mello, the president of Bergdorf Goodman, looking for something simple and elegant for a conservative customer, you were probably thrilled to bits _ even the oldest women keep lovely backs.
1_32	0.092151368	Understatement permeated Vera Wang's collection, as if earthiness precluded sultriness in evening wear.
1_33	0.08435093	Ms. Wang offered gauze or tulle dresses decorated with beads in the shape of palm fronds.
1_34	0.093549259	Throughout the collections, designers of evening wear have pushed the idea of knits for after 8, and Ms.
1_35	0.090121975	Wang handily paired skirts and dresses with turtlenecks and ponchos, infusing the collection with a very American spirit.
1_36	0.08444807	A wonderful impact of the American shows' going first on the international calendar (London, Milan and Paris follow in the next few weeks) was that designers plumbed American culture and style rather than European.
1_37	0.06532593	This is not to suggest that there were no outside influences.
1_38	0.096108527	There were touches of modern and ancient Asia everywhere, at Ms.
1_39	0.057758546	Wang's show and at Duke's.
1_40	0.083526587	It was uplifting to see Duke back on the runways after his unceremonious exit from Halston last summer.
1_41	0.08269205	In the audience were his new backers, Juliana Holt and her husband, Peter, who owns the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association.
1_42	0.086811708	Duke used cashmere or fleece in a variety of sweaters _ off-the-shoulder, bateau necklines and hooded sweatshirts _ pairing them with pave gowns, beaded skirts and, prettiest of all, debutante tulle skirts in fondant colors.
1_43	0.080338163	But Duke's decision to use all Asian, Eurasian and Afro-Asian models was regrettable.
1_44	0.0856526	Making race a part of an esthetic unwittingly paves the way for Asian, Latina or African models to be left out in the cold when their look doesn't work with the mood of the season, as has happened before.
1_45	0.10108447	Vivienne Tam and Han Feng managed to invoke an Asian point of view without typecasting.
1_46	0.098165818	Fresh and original, Ms.
1_47	0.09127972	Tam incorporated futuristic nylon puffed jackets shading the face, luminous sparkly dresses juxtaposed with Chinese brocades, and Chinese spiritual icons embroidered onto T-shirts.
1_48	0.090675597	Ms. Tam had her false starts, but she is unquestionably pointed toward the future.
1_49	0.091756483	Not so, Ms.
1_50	0.090304098	Feng, who in her zeal to make clothes intellectual, turned in an uncharacteristically dank collection.
1_51	0.10078419	Turbid colors like brown, gray and loden were used in mandarin jackets over wide-leg trousers.
1_52	0.083439707	Yohji Yamamoto makes this awkward asexual proportion look easy.
1_53	0.083011822	Ms. Feng shows us that, clearly, it is not.

12_0	0.096916361	&LR; LOS ANGELES _ When Angelina Jolie was a little girl, her brother would point a home video camera at her and plead, ``C'mon, Ange, give us a show''!
12_1	0.074653341	And Jolie would happily oblige, much to the delight of her actress mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who would provide the kids with costumes for elaborate performances.
12_2	0.069408689	Jolie's father, actor Jon Voight, encouraged her as well.
12_3	0.078052897	Nobody ever told Jolie to be quiet or stop talking.
12_4	0.082781259	Instead, as she was growing up, she was constantly challenged to examine her feelings and question the world around her.
12_5	0.068162884	``I was being prepared to respond to other people, to listen to other people, to express what I was feeling, to be bold, to be really honest, to let things hurt if they hurt and not be in denial about what was going on inside me,'' the 23-year-old Jolie says.
12_6	0.078779503	``And, yeah, those things have helped me as an actress but they've also helped me live my life.
12_7	0.074321338	Because, to me, to prepare to be a good actor is to prepare to live life''.
12_8	0.085629407	The preparation has paid handsome dividends since the beautiful Jolie began using her talents for more than family productions.
12_9	0.079514235	She has stolen every movie she has appeared in, giving passionate performances in otherwise forgettable fare like ``Hackers'' and the recent ``Playing by Heart''.
12_10	0.064470675	Where Jolie has really made her mark is in television, winning back-to-back Golden Globes and Emmy nods for the cable movies ``Gia'' and ``George Wallace''.
12_11	0.11898648	In the former, she played a doomed fashion model; in the latter, she was the wife of an American icon.
12_12	0.066251741	Together, the two turns displayed an incredible range.
12_13	0.069194516	``The world is full of beautiful girls, but they're not Angelina Jolie,'' says director John Frankenheimer, who worked with Jolie on ``Wallace''.
12_14	0.07427744	``She's fun, honest, intelligent, gorgeous and divinely talented.
12_15	0.054249925	She brings a hell of a lot to the party''.
12_16	0.073443276	Audiences should find cause for celebration with Jolie's upcoming trio of movies.
12_17	0.059474647	In the current air-traffic controller comedy, ``Pushing Tin,'' Jolie plays an unhappy wife given to consuming vodka by the barrel.
12_18	0.099860068	Arriving this fall is ``Girl Interrupted,'' the true story of a young woman wrongly placed in a mental institution.
12_19	0.0012475446	Winona Ryder stars; Jolie plays her schizophrenic friend.
12_20	0.080476076	Still later will be ``The Bone Collector,'' a thriller that has Jolie playing a cop partnered with Denzel Washington.
12_21	0.082981424	On that one, Jolie's name will appear above the title for the first time in her young career.
12_22	0.077491275	It sounds as though Jolie is always working, and she readily admits as much.
12_23	0.05131014	She did take a break once.
12_24	0.089195188	Jolie had just finished ``Gia,'' a part so rich and so complex that she figured she'd never see the likes of it again.
12_25	0.0845785	She was married, if just temporarily, to actor Jonny Lee Miller, who she met while making ``Hackers''.
12_26	0.025490542	And she was achingly unhappy.
12_27	0.084231731	``It's like I had all the things I had always wanted in my life and there was still something about me that was very empty,'' Jolie says.
12_28	0.076792281	``I didn't know if I was going to be hungry again in my life for certain things.
12_29	0.07201641	And I didn't know what more I had to give''.
12_30	0.047347154	So Jolie took a break.
12_31	0.11522881	Sort of.
12_32	0.083223095	She took writing and directing classes at New York University, road the subways a lot and realized _ it didn't take too long _ that she really loved acting and that she had much more of herself to give to her profession.
12_33	0.090396103	And now, she's not quite sure how to stop giving.
12_34	0.069245392	Jolie has worked constantly for the past 18 months and when she isn't on a set, she's usually reading or writing or acting on the stage.
12_35	0.07852879	She's constantly looking for characters to play that will help her evolve as a person.
12_36	0.095124244	It's almost as if outside of acting, she can't find the motivation to grow.
12_37	0.081382904	At one point, Jolie noticed that her characters were taking trips and going out to dinner while she always sat at home, absorbed in the process of soaking up their fictional lives.
12_38	0.079637536	Acting was her professional life !ital!and!off! her personal life.
12_39	0.08449804	``She has always had a tremendous amount of energy, and the signals were always there that she might give that to acting,'' says father Voight.
12_40	0.078832723	But then, Voight must have always considered the possibility.
12_41	0.078409632	He and Bertrand, who divorced when Jolie was 2, purposely gave her a middle name that could double as a surname and thus relieve her of an unwanted burden should she choose a show-business career.
12_42	0.090864977	Jolie doesn't go into too many specifics about her early years with Voight, only to say that they had a ``stormy relationship'' because they are so much alike.
12_43	0.079736738	On this subject, like so many others, she's straightforward and yet a bit mysterious.
12_44	0.092471094	Jolie often obliquely refers to ``things'' she has gone through and endured in her life with the unspoken understanding that these are things you don't get to know about.
12_45	0.091610792	She reveals herself through her acting.
12_46	0.10366197	And that's enough.
12_47	0.10913001	That's all she's willing to give.
12_48	0.10375331	``For me, acting is a real experience,'' Jolie says.
12_49	0.091910405	``I choose roles that fit where I am in my life and open up to them because that's the way I'm opening up.
12_50	0.078797627	I make them real and I get close to people.
12_51	0.086775426	I know there's a false reality to acting, but the way I do it, it's my life and it's not fake.
12_52	0.032335998	It's not just a movie.
12_53	0.070242687	It's a real experience that I remember forever''.
12_54	0.071888585	Says Voight: ``She has a very strong, specific presence on screen.
12_55	0.087043701	There's a certain honesty there that I think is pretty rare, pretty special''.
12_56	0.08521695	Jolie would like to keep building on that but realizes that challenging roles for young actresses are few and far between.
12_57	0.089323529	She also knows the situation doesn't improve when actresses mature and lose their status as the Next Big Thing.
12_58	0.073076106	``I'll never work in this business just to work,'' Jolie says.
12_59	0.078234391	`It would kill me to feel like I wasn't really doing anything.
12_60	0.088434749	I'm hoping to keep growing and changing so that I'll have more to offer and be able to express it through my work.
12_61	0.095150804	And if Hollywood doesn't want to accept that or is critical of me for growing up and aging, then that's their loss because I know there's a need for it''.
12_62	0.094426751	``In fact,'' Jolie continues, ``it might make me more aggressive to go through that transition because it's such an important one to express.
12_63	0.079890498	It's what life is all about''.
12_64	0.10649282	And for Angelina Jolie, acting and life are entirely interwoven, tangled up in a beautiful tapestry that keeps growing. &QL;

23_1	0.076555535	We decided to start with the ``lowest'' award, but there was some debate as to which award that might be.
23_2	0.121204	On the official Academy Awards Web site (www.oscar.com), the acting awards take precedence over director.
23_3	0.064710705	We decided, however, that Best Director is more important than the supporting-acting awards.
23_4	0.060641943	Which is why we're starting with Best Supporting Actress.
23_5	0.084543876	The irrational subjectivity of that becomes clear when you realize what a strong field this year's Best Supporting Actress nominees comprise.
23_6	0.041868894	Empathy played well in this category.
23_7	0.083895561	Toni Collette is supremely empathetic as the troubled mother of a haunted little boy in ``The Sixth Sense''.
23_8	0.090137016	It was a pleasant surprise to see the academy recognize this, since she was upstaged by co-star (and co-nominee) Haley Joel Osment and by the movie's twist ending.
23_9	0.084012129	Samantha Morton earned a nod for her performance as a sweet, mute woman who puts up with a jazz guitarist who takes her for granted in ``Sweet and Lowdown;'' because she's the only person who can't interrupt his motor-mouthed self-absorption, she's actually able to see through to his pain.
23_10	0.087497174	And Chloe Sevigny, the type of actress who always looks as if she's lost in a pleasant daydream, is touching as a woman who falls for an impostor in ``Boys Don't Cry'' _ and, once the ruse is revealed, remains committed because she knows that the emotions remain real.
23_11	0.09752333	The other two nominees provide a flip side to the empathy, with Angelina Jolie and Catherine Keener as women who are looking out only for themselves in, respectively, ``Girl, Interrupted'' and ``Being John Malkovich''.

23_15	0.088828684	And each, having risen up from the ranks of premium-cable TV (Jolie) and independent films (Keener), has more familiarity than the competition.
23_16	0.080764386	Collette and Sevigny also have some indie-film cred, but Keener is a busier, more versatile actress.
23_17	0.095190965	Morton, despite having a few movies under her belt, is more of an unknown _ but she's in a Woody Allen movie, and Allen's movies have historically done well in this category.
23_18	0.10065933	Although it's a wide-open race, Jolie would appear to have the edge, having come off a Golden Globe win for ``Girl, Interrupted''.
23_19	0.084213964	Having an Oscar-winning pedigree _ dad Jon Voight won in 1978 for ``Coming Home'' _ can't hurt.

24_11	0.085193505	One was the success of MGM films on digital video disc, a format with fatter margins than VHS tapes; cutbacks in staffing and overhead; and the resecuring of video and television rights previously tied up in long-term deals to outside companies.

24_21	0.091700581	This year started inauspiciously for MGM, with ``Supernova'' opening to bad reviews and sparse box office.
