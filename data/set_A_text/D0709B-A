0_3	0.12965804	Ed Harris of ``The Truman Show'' and Lynn Redgrave of ``Gods and Monsters'' won motion picture supporting actor honors.
0_4	0.07672723	The Golden Globes honorees lived up to the irreverence for which the show has become known, but Fox's acceptance speech added a touching note.

0_6	0.096540077	``We're so lucky to do what we do...
0_7	0.093262935	and just take every day and enjoy it,'' Fox said.
0_8	0.052260083	Paltrow played the upper-crust lady who becomes the lover and muse of William Shakespeare in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which also won best screenplay.
0_9	0.031165269	In ``Little Voice,'' Caine played a sleazy agent who tries to turn a meek woman with powerful musical gift for show tunes into a star.
0_10	0.093942782	``Oh, what a shock,'' Caine said as he picked up his honor.
0_11	0.097653774	``My career must be slipping.
0_12	0.089731531	This is the first time I've been available to pick up an award''.

0_15	0.051981311	``Bulworth,'' ``Elizabeth,'' ``Gods and Monsters'' and ``Little Voice'' had three nominations apiece.
0_16	0.062666938	The awards, broadcast from a hotel ballroom by NBC, were plagued by problems with sound cutting out and the picture freezing momentarily.
0_17	0.052270692	Harris set the tone for the notoriously freewheeling awards show by coming on stage with a toothpick in his mouth, saying, ``Oh man, I just got through eating dinner''.
0_18	0.066744832	Backstage he noted that ``The Truman Show'' came out in the summer, long before studios traditionally roll out their award-worthy product.
0_19	0.09497115	``I'm glad that people didn't forget about it,'' he said.
0_20	0.051001917	Redgrave, who played the crusty but loving maid to an aging horror director in ``Gods and Monsters,'' said, ``It's been 32 years since I stood one of these on a mantelpiece and it's been crying out for a friend ever since''.

0_29	0.10298626	The Golden Globes, selected by reporters from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, are awarded for both film and television in a nationally televised ceremony in a hotel ballroom in what can be a much more colorful affair than the stuffy Academy Awards.
0_30	0.1071904	Last year alone, Christine Lahti was in the bathroom when she was announced as a winner for ``Chicago Hope''.

0_34	0.092957107	The awards also provide a valuable promotional tool for studios.
0_35	0.084830542	The morning after the ceremony, newspaper advertisements for films trumpet their Golden Globe hauls.
0_36	0.095164245	One award was announced before the ceremony: Nicholson was honored with the Cecil B.

0_38	0.082476485	Nicholson has been nominated for 14 Globes and won five.
0_39	0.082857755	For the fourth straight year, NBC dedicated three hours of prime-time to the awards, reflecting how far the ceremony has come in prestige.
0_40	0.08348207	The awards had once been buffeted by controversy over allegations of corrupt voting and long suffered credibility problems, with the lowlight being the 1981 event that awarded Pia Zadora a statue for the bomb ``Butterfly''.
0_41	0.09730116	Networks refused to show the program.
0_42	0.095701599	The association worked to regain respectability.
0_43	0.092862693	In 1996, after a 14-year absence from network exposure, the program was back on the air.
0_44	0.082845613	This year, NBC asked Golden Globe voters to sign waivers indicating they did not accept gifts or perks from Hollywood studios, the Washington Post reported Saturday.
0_45	0.082366022	Foreign Press Association President Helmut Voss said the waivers indicated ``during our journalistic activities, including out-of-town travel, that we did not accept any gifts other than those that are the customary promotional gifts of the studios.''
1_0	0.079128725	NEW YORK (AP) --The woman on the magazine cover isn't Kate or Claudia or another fab supermodel.
1_1	0.093585394	Still, she's so famous that the browser almost has to take a second look --and may even buy the magazine.
1_2	0.093462706	The cover girl's appeal?
1_3	0.094813357	She's a superstar, not a supermodel.
1_4	0.058700995	Fashion magazine editors are putting more famous faces from movies and television to music on covers, hoping the box office power of Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore or Mariah Carey will succeed at newsstands.
1_5	0.091738873	It seems the obvious solution when they're saying in publishing circles that supermodels are as passe as last season's hemline.
1_6	0.095881124	Some critics say models have exhibited less-than-model behavior.
1_7	0.093448784	Ot they've become boring.
1_8	0.098398881	Or even worse --old.
1_9	0.051093645	The megamodels still have cover girl faces, but their star power has dimmed, now that the runways are no longer ruled by the deified six: Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Claudia Schiffer and Kate Moss.
1_10	0.10019228	And their heirs aren't apparent.
1_11	0.098188066	But no one is yet sure whether entertainers or models sell better.
1_12	0.058876047	Last January, a death knell directive from leading fashion editor Linda Wells appeared in The New York Times: ``Nobody cares about models anymore''.
1_13	0.08375239	Now Ms.
1_14	0.096258018	Wells, the editor of Allure, is not so sure.
1_15	0.10035613	``I sounded too harsh.
1_16	0.090624471	It is not as dire as that,'' she said.
1_17	0.083723805	Still, she added, ``Americans might be slightly less captivated by models' daily habits and...
1_18	0.098867791	their latest spats with their boyfriends or agents''.
1_19	0.062677927	Allure, which had a cover ratio of 10 models to two stars in 1998, is flip-flopping those figures.
1_20	0.085757584	Vogue increased celebrity covers last year from two to seven.
1_21	0.095643689	Mademoiselle and Elle also have swung to star power.
1_22	0.093987909	``I'm gambling on this, and it's an important gamble,'' said Ms.
1_23	0.11037381	Wells, who lined up actresses Angelina Jolie and Julianne Moore for spring covers.
1_24	0.091171716	``We are putting a lot more celebrities on the cover because I believe they will sell more.
1_25	0.088852258	After all, that's what we're trying to do, sell magazines''.
1_26	0.096639887	Choosing a hot cover is not an exact science.
1_27	0.095583824	Not every celebrity cover scores.
1_28	0.08906412	Sometimes it's timing --fall fashion issues are usually best sellers, for instance.
1_29	0.088407904	And according to magazine sales, today's fashion face is Oprah Winfrey.
1_30	0.075583861	Her October cover was Vogue's 1998 best seller, with some 810,000 newsstand sales.
1_31	0.084954083	The talk-show queen likewise reigned in first place at In Style, with 844,000 newsstand sales for November.
1_32	0.051679793	Calista Flockhart of ``Ally McBeal'' was Harper's Bazaar's top seller for 1998.
1_33	0.071921921	Public personalities also are stealing the spotlight --a Hillary Rodham Clinton cover on Vogue got excellent grades.
1_34	0.047653478	``Some women's magazines are tossing off models because people identify more with celebrities,'' said Lisa Granatstein, senior editor at Mediaweek, a New York-based trade magazine.
1_35	0.070390773	She explained the celebrities' appeal: ``You know they've just broken up with their husband, you know their latest movie, you know their every move''.
1_36	0.064375024	Eleanor Lambert, who founded the New York designer previews known as Fashion Week, said that the word ``supermodel'' derived from ``a group of young women with slatlike bodies and colorless personalities''.
1_37	0.057376103	Still, today's supermodels could flourish by making the transition from model to actress as did Audrey Hepburn, Jane Fonda, Cybill Shepherd, Kim Basinger and Sharon Stone.
1_38	0.092765629	Naomi Campbell could be the next escapee to film stardom in the upcoming ``Prisoner of Love''.
1_39	0.093255864	``I always say it is my last (modeling) season because I think they're not going to want me anymore,'' she told Vogue.
1_40	0.086658632	No wonder she worries --the headline on her profile in the March issue read ``The Last Supermodel''.
1_41	0.10578024	Is Ms.
1_42	0.08805108	Campbell indeed the end of a breed?
1_43	0.082053781	About 10 years have passed since the decade's best-known mannequins revolutionized the genre.
1_44	0.090226029	Perhaps they were too hot not to cool down.
1_45	0.091375188	Or maybe the supermodel image just got old --literally -- since most of the big names are over 30.
1_46	0.092591135	Some style watchers expect another generation of megamodels on the horizon.
1_47	0.084251939	``As long as there have been magazines, there have been star models,'' said Eileen Ford, who founded Ford Models in 1947.
1_48	0.093090767	Ms. Ford would know.
1_49	0.081534162	On her payroll were Cheryl Tiegs, who racked up 24 Glamour covers between 1967 and 1989, and Christie Brinkley, who scored 19, from 1975 to 1989.
1_50	0.089388622	``I suspect at some point the celebrity tide will swing back,'' said Elaina Richardson, editor of Elle.
1_51	0.094457899	``If you think about a Twiggy or a Jean Shrimpton, there have been very famous models who had more celebrity than most actresses''.
1_52	0.082451767	Still, Ms.
1_53	0.093995437	Richardson put actress Cate Blanchett on the magazine's cover for May and stockpiled 1998 covers with Sharon Stone, Minnie Driver and Salma Hayek.
1_54	0.093848425	It could be, however, that neither celebrities nor models are the biggest draw.
1_55	0.087069355	Ms. Ford recalled that McCall's once ran a test to see whether a model or a strawberry shortcake on the cover would draw more readers.
1_56	0.077462988	``You know which (sold more), don't you --the strawberry shortcake,'' she said.
1_57	0.098536917	''We almost died of horror.''
2_0	0.085306498	As a thriller, ``The Bone Collector'' is a bit above average _ creepy enough, but a bit short on logic and believability.
2_1	0.19150759	But it does boast two of this year's Oscar nominees in starring roles _ Denzel Washington, who is up in the best actor category for his role of wrongly convicted boxer Rubin Carter in ``Hurricane,'' and Angelina Jolie, who received the best supporting actress nod for her role as the mentally disturbed teen, Lisa, in ``Girl, Interrupted''.
2_2	0.17299995	Both already picked up Golden Globe Awards earlier in the year, and Jolie won a Screen Actors Guild statuette on Sunday.
2_3	0.038875389	``Collector'' is another serial-killer story, the twist being that Washington's character _ forensic detective Lincoln Rhyme _ is a quadriplegic.
2_4	0.099125795	Rhyme had been injured while investigating a crime.
2_5	0.061106058	He remains on the force, however _ albeit bedridden and surrounded by an array of high-tech gadgetry _ and continues to help solve crimes.
2_6	0.068372685	Jolie plays Amelia Donaghy, a smart beat cop who Rhyme recognizes has potential to be more.
2_7	0.094463453	Jolie and Washington make a compelling combination, with both playing variations of roles that they are known for.
2_8	0.048208188	Even in action roles, Washington comes across as cerebral, and _ except for flashbacks to when his character wasn't paralyzed _ that's what you see in this film.
2_9	0.10020084	But Washington, a former best supporting actor Oscar winner, can do a lot with a little.
2_10	0.068276829	And while his Rhyme character is fairly predictably drawn, Washington imbues him with strength and dignity without overreaching, making him far more real than any of the events in the movie.
2_11	0.095039785	The characters Jolie plays, on the other hand, always seem dangerous _ either to themselves, others or both.
2_12	0.095787217	Donaghy is no exception, carrying around a lot of past baggage.
2_13	0.095758725	It's not the character but Jolie's edginess, an animal-on-the-prowl quality, that keeps you watching.
2_14	0.12270262	Jolie, the daughter of Academy Award-winning actor Jon Voight, has already picked up a couple of Emmys.
2_15	0.082300285	Oscar won't be far behind.
2_16	0.1169001	Washington, who is nominated along with another former winner in the best supporting actor category, Kevin Spacey, is a favorite to win the Oscar.
2_17	0.074520659	But win or lose, go back and check out some of Washington's previous work, particularly in his films with Spike Lee _ ``Mo Better Blues (1990), ``Malcolm X'' (1992) and ``He Got Game'' (1998) Others include ``Cry Freedom'' (1987), in which he played South African activist Steven Biko; ``Glory,'' for which he won his Oscar; Carl Franklin's `Devil in a Blue Dress'' (1995), which is based on the Walter Mosley novel; and ``Courage Under Fire'' (1996).
2_18	0.091665877	Jolie has a much shorter resume, but check out last year's ``Pushing Tin'' and ``Gia,'' the HBO movie where she played outrageous supermodel Gia Carangi, who died of AIDS.

3_2	0.060275969	Artist, writer, filmmaker and performer, he gained fame during the brief East Village art boom of the 1980's.
3_3	0.093955897	But he kept himself outside the hype and went his own way.

3_15	0.032381976	To a nation with little patience for quaint remnants, he can seem an anomalous holdover of the British Empire, which much of his music appeared to embody in its doughty as in brave/valiant, or dowdy, as in unstylish? staunchness and solemnity.
3_16	0.055507264	But Elgar deserves respect for more than just those ``Pomp and Circumstance'' marches; some listeners have found a core of deep humanity in his work, even under the occasional bluster.

10_0	0.078348376	During a meeting to discuss Oscar coverage, some Life &AMP; Arts staff members decided that we should do a week-by-week look at the Big Six categories: Best Picture, Best Director and the four acting categories.
10_1	0.091982641	We decided to start with the ``lowest'' award, but there was some debate as to which award that might be.
10_2	0.094780241	On the official Academy Awards Web site (www.oscar.com), the acting awards take precedence over director.
10_3	0.093722503	We decided, however, that Best Director is more important than the supporting-acting awards.
10_4	0.095049913	Which is why we're starting with Best Supporting Actress.
10_5	0.076639038	The irrational subjectivity of that becomes clear when you realize what a strong field this year's Best Supporting Actress nominees comprise.
10_6	0.093474276	Empathy played well in this category.
10_7	0.072994161	Toni Collette is supremely empathetic as the troubled mother of a haunted little boy in ``The Sixth Sense''.
10_8	0.088814168	It was a pleasant surprise to see the academy recognize this, since she was upstaged by co-star (and co-nominee) Haley Joel Osment and by the movie's twist ending.
10_9	0.043794279	Samantha Morton earned a nod for her performance as a sweet, mute woman who puts up with a jazz guitarist who takes her for granted in ``Sweet and Lowdown;'' because she's the only person who can't interrupt his motor-mouthed self-absorption, she's actually able to see through to his pain.
10_10	0.046549386	And Chloe Sevigny, the type of actress who always looks as if she's lost in a pleasant daydream, is touching as a woman who falls for an impostor in ``Boys Don't Cry'' _ and, once the ruse is revealed, remains committed because she knows that the emotions remain real.
10_11	0.1012343	The other two nominees provide a flip side to the empathy, with Angelina Jolie and Catherine Keener as women who are looking out only for themselves in, respectively, ``Girl, Interrupted'' and ``Being John Malkovich''.
10_12	0.0759884	Jolie walks away with ``Girl, Interrupted'' as a sociopath whose charm and mischievous nature belie a cold-hearted cruel streak.
10_13	0.056642265	Keener was first among equals in ``Malkovich's'' ensemble as a scheming woman who finds a way to take advantage of just about anything _ including a passageway inside a character actor's head.
10_14	0.077176817	Jolie and Keener have shown plenty of range in the past year, each playing more selfless women (Jolie in last spring's ``Playing by Heart,'' Keener in the current ``Simpatico'') who end up benefiting from their selflessness.
10_15	0.076467471	And each, having risen up from the ranks of premium-cable TV (Jolie) and independent films (Keener), has more familiarity than the competition.
10_16	0.096777761	Collette and Sevigny also have some indie-film cred, but Keener is a busier, more versatile actress.
10_17	0.086647874	Morton, despite having a few movies under her belt, is more of an unknown _ but she's in a Woody Allen movie, and Allen's movies have historically done well in this category.
10_18	0.099864629	Although it's a wide-open race, Jolie would appear to have the edge, having come off a Golden Globe win for ``Girl, Interrupted''.
10_19	0.064558312	Having an Oscar-winning pedigree _ dad Jon Voight won in 1978 for ``Coming Home'' _ can't hurt.
10_20	0.060302774	She's my bet for who'll take home the statue, but if I were able to vote, I'd pick Sevigny, who gives a heart to the otherwise dark and mean ``Boys Don't Cry''.

11_12	0.033646015	She isn't adorned with jewels but with tattoos, including a large ``H,'' which stands for Haven, her brother's middle name.
11_13	0.088896916	Recently she took a plunge of a different sort and married actor Billy Bob Thornton.
11_14	0.088429017	No one even knew the two actors, who met on the set of 1998's ``Pushing Tin,'' were dating.

11_25	0.094830534	``I didn't do the film because it was high art.
11_26	0.090821401	It was my summer vacation last year and frankly I wanted to learn about cars,'' Jolie confesses.
11_27	0.093311942	She learned a few practical tips from someone who really knows his wheels.
11_28	0.098711488	``I do know how to steal a car now, although maybe I shouldn't get that out there,'' she says.
11_29	0.089155348	``We actually had a real thief on the set escorted by his prison guard.

11_33	0.059264471	Forget logic.
11_34	0.11442006	Jolie says that after ``The Bone Collector'' (1999) and her Oscar winning turn as mental patient Lisa in ``Girl, Interrupted'' (1999), she was ready for some screen fun.
11_35	0.090829377	But Jolie cautions that she's still a serious actress.
11_36	0.082193012	In fact, that's why she turned down one of the leads in the upcoming big screen version of ``Charlie's Angels''.
11_37	0.083385487	``The `Charlie's Angels' people had a few selling points,'' Jolie says.
11_38	0.092289402	``They told me there weren't many good characters for strong women.

11_41	0.090810992	``I looked at it as a money job.
11_42	0.092575468	Given the fact that I don't really like to get dressed up in high heels, it wasn't worth it to me.
11_43	0.082604948	I figured that my fun job was `Gone in 60 Seconds'.
11_44	0.093220653	And frankly, I thought car thieves and hanging out with the boys was just so much cooler''.

13_0	0.14393018	When a stunning Angelina Jolie announced a few minutes after winning a Golden Globe that she would take a plunge, gown and all, in the hotel swimming pool, she must have seemed insane to anyone who had just watched her wiggle to the stage to claim her award for her part in ``Gia,'' an HBO movie.
13_1	0.096236409	The white and silver racer-back gown she wore so closely outlined the best of what Ms.

13_5	0.059369058	The lace-and-sequin gown that Halston's Kevan Hall put on Christine Lahti for the Golden Globes presaged the cobweb and beaded lace gowns he presented last week for fall.
13_6	0.061217717	And the black and white outfit designed by Pamela Dennis for Calista Flockhart begot long trumpet skirts on the catwalk, including one in rich ruby sequins.
13_7	0.083166464	But on the whole, evening-wear designers showing for fall 1999 are a demure bunch.
13_8	0.085142323	There was plenty of beauty worthy of the Oscars, the Golden Globes or even the Grammys, which offer a chance for more fashion-watching tomorrow night, but little to elicit heart palpitations.

13_10	0.098266233	Not that celibate fashion is bad.
13_11	0.090708055	It's just different.
13_12	0.054211245	Tommy Hilfiger and Daryl Kerrigan, in her Daryl K collection, ripped with wonderful abandon into both ends of the sexless spectrum.
13_13	0.093157684	As American as cornflakes, Hilfiger plays the wide-eyed innocent of fashion who just might have a dirty little secret.
13_14	0.091964892	He gives enough edge to his approachable clothes that they are just safely this side of Kmart oblivion.
13_15	0.033334939	To the sounds of a live rock band, Sugar Ray, the more to underline the hip Hilfiger-music connection, the designer sent men's and women's clothes rocking down the runway together.
13_16	0.050035985	His mix of sports, music and high fashion was a potent brew, especially in long nylon skirts and leather jeans with white stitching.
13_17	0.046450903	The collection was further elevated by terrific fur vests, python patchwork pants and an evening gown of leather and wool fit for a biker princess.
13_18	0.0847502	Ms. Kerrigan's collection was a pirate's treasure worth of creativity.
13_19	0.093229066	There was no guesswork in trying to figure out her inspirational mother lode.
13_20	0.098126861	It was war.

13_22	0.02860815	Menacingly dark colors were intercepted by flashes of reflective utilitarian orange or white in luxuriously ragged shearling coats or nylon hooded jackets that partly hid the models' faces.
13_23	0.094959066	That war should be text for a Kerrigan show is not surprising given that Ms.

13_26	0.086627775	The pretty, festive clothes of the many designers who showed evening wear in the last days of the shows, which ended Friday, balanced the aggressive message of designers like Ms.
13_27	0.057882024	Kerrigan. In his second season as chief designer for Halston, Hall made a short excursion into day wear, and it was most promising: a studded chocolate suede dress with decolletage abounding; a lush vanilla frappe of a wrap jacket over a crisp white Halston shirt.
13_28	0.081871338	Beaded tweed gowns and silvery sheaths were tantalizing.
13_29	0.066717163	There were, though, unnecessarily mundane gowns, like a black velvet column that made one wonder which member of his front row Hall was playing to.
13_30	0.09524271	If you were Lynn Whitfield, a diva who has to make an entrance, it lacked impact.
13_31	0.062909296	If you were Dawn Mello, the president of Bergdorf Goodman, looking for something simple and elegant for a conservative customer, you were probably thrilled to bits _ even the oldest women keep lovely backs.
13_32	0.063873604	Understatement permeated Vera Wang's collection, as if earthiness precluded sultriness in evening wear.
13_33	0.073413424	Ms. Wang offered gauze or tulle dresses decorated with beads in the shape of palm fronds.
13_34	0.094772392	Throughout the collections, designers of evening wear have pushed the idea of knits for after 8, and Ms.
13_35	0.076713354	Wang handily paired skirts and dresses with turtlenecks and ponchos, infusing the collection with a very American spirit.
13_36	0.083512867	A wonderful impact of the American shows' going first on the international calendar (London, Milan and Paris follow in the next few weeks) was that designers plumbed American culture and style rather than European.
13_37	0.088349611	This is not to suggest that there were no outside influences.
13_38	0.10228789	There were touches of modern and ancient Asia everywhere, at Ms.
13_39	0.094155241	Wang's show and at Duke's.
13_40	0.093429631	It was uplifting to see Duke back on the runways after his unceremonious exit from Halston last summer.
13_41	0.082396298	In the audience were his new backers, Juliana Holt and her husband, Peter, who owns the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association.
13_42	0.076574489	Duke used cashmere or fleece in a variety of sweaters _ off-the-shoulder, bateau necklines and hooded sweatshirts _ pairing them with pave gowns, beaded skirts and, prettiest of all, debutante tulle skirts in fondant colors.
13_43	0.094820659	But Duke's decision to use all Asian, Eurasian and Afro-Asian models was regrettable.
13_44	0.08900982	Making race a part of an esthetic unwittingly paves the way for Asian, Latina or African models to be left out in the cold when their look doesn't work with the mood of the season, as has happened before.
13_45	0.072904578	Vivienne Tam and Han Feng managed to invoke an Asian point of view without typecasting.
13_46	0.09815075	Fresh and original, Ms.
13_47	0.082012413	Tam incorporated futuristic nylon puffed jackets shading the face, luminous sparkly dresses juxtaposed with Chinese brocades, and Chinese spiritual icons embroidered onto T-shirts.
13_48	0.098209112	Ms. Tam had her false starts, but she is unquestionably pointed toward the future.
13_49	0.081011965	Not so, Ms.
13_50	0.088197462	Feng, who in her zeal to make clothes intellectual, turned in an uncharacteristically dank collection.
13_51	0.075800487	Turbid colors like brown, gray and loden were used in mandarin jackets over wide-leg trousers.

16_1	0.095785786	After Jolie's gushing words of love for her brother at the Oscars in March, rumor-mongers hinted at incest.
16_2	0.040555366	After her whirlwind Vegas marriage to Billy Bob Thornton last month, the gossip mill had Jolie breaking up Thornton's relationship with Laura Dern.
16_3	0.044511143	After word leaked out about a steamy scene between Jolie and Antonio Banderas for an upcoming movie, the tabloid talkers speculated they were fooling around for real.
16_4	0.067609096	None of it is true, Jolie said in an interview to promote her new movie ''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' which opens Friday.
16_5	0.090996591	''It hurts when people just make light of things that are important to you,'' Jolie said.
16_6	0.04981411	''Like taking your relationship with your brother, which is a very beautiful thing, and twisting it so your parents are watching the TV, it's a moment they'll remember forever, and now rather than seeing a beautiful moment for their children, they're thinking, 'Oh, my God, the whole world is calling our children perverted publicly'''.
16_7	0.081116788	Jolie said she and brother Jamie Haven, the children of actor Jon Voight, are close siblings, nothing more.
16_8	0.08942759	''We actually felt like the people who wrote that should be a little embarrassed because they came up with it,'' Jolie said.
16_9	0.05147721	''That's what's weird''.
16_10	0.086445399	As for her abrupt nuptials to Thornton, Jolie laughs off rumors that he married her only as a friend who felt she needed looking out for.
16_11	0.065971845	They met while filming ''Pushing Tin'' two years ago but did not become involved until a few months ago, she said.
16_12	0.07609462	''If the rumor is he's with me because he wants to look after me, I think that's beautiful,'' Jolie said.

16_38	0.092950682	It's another choice that may raise eyebrows, given the critical acclaim Jolie has earned.

18_0	0.14371016	&LR; LOS ANGELES _ When Angelina Jolie was a little girl, her brother would point a home video camera at her and plead, ``C'mon, Ange, give us a show''!
18_1	0.041118281	And Jolie would happily oblige, much to the delight of her actress mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who would provide the kids with costumes for elaborate performances.
18_2	0.10059484	Jolie's father, actor Jon Voight, encouraged her as well.
18_3	0.094888369	Nobody ever told Jolie to be quiet or stop talking.
18_4	0.090932323	Instead, as she was growing up, she was constantly challenged to examine her feelings and question the world around her.
18_5	0.10753286	``I was being prepared to respond to other people, to listen to other people, to express what I was feeling, to be bold, to be really honest, to let things hurt if they hurt and not be in denial about what was going on inside me,'' the 23-year-old Jolie says.
18_6	0.092195173	``And, yeah, those things have helped me as an actress but they've also helped me live my life.
18_7	0.091032667	Because, to me, to prepare to be a good actor is to prepare to live life''.
18_8	0.089783859	The preparation has paid handsome dividends since the beautiful Jolie began using her talents for more than family productions.
18_9	0.072708931	She has stolen every movie she has appeared in, giving passionate performances in otherwise forgettable fare like ``Hackers'' and the recent ``Playing by Heart''.
18_10	0.092410577	Where Jolie has really made her mark is in television, winning back-to-back Golden Globes and Emmy nods for the cable movies ``Gia'' and ``George Wallace''.
18_11	0.095289085	In the former, she played a doomed fashion model; in the latter, she was the wife of an American icon.
18_12	0.092881702	Together, the two turns displayed an incredible range.
18_13	0.097195538	``The world is full of beautiful girls, but they're not Angelina Jolie,'' says director John Frankenheimer, who worked with Jolie on ``Wallace''.
18_14	0.061028258	``She's fun, honest, intelligent, gorgeous and divinely talented.
18_15	0.088850382	She brings a hell of a lot to the party''.
18_16	0.088972379	Audiences should find cause for celebration with Jolie's upcoming trio of movies.
18_17	0.075856456	In the current air-traffic controller comedy, ``Pushing Tin,'' Jolie plays an unhappy wife given to consuming vodka by the barrel.
18_18	0.083243959	Arriving this fall is ``Girl Interrupted,'' the true story of a young woman wrongly placed in a mental institution.
18_19	0.062034997	Winona Ryder stars; Jolie plays her schizophrenic friend.
18_20	0.096759847	Still later will be ``The Bone Collector,'' a thriller that has Jolie playing a cop partnered with Denzel Washington.
18_21	0.087110337	On that one, Jolie's name will appear above the title for the first time in her young career.
18_22	0.09336863	It sounds as though Jolie is always working, and she readily admits as much.
18_23	0.092735104	She did take a break once.
18_24	0.093301173	Jolie had just finished ``Gia,'' a part so rich and so complex that she figured she'd never see the likes of it again.
18_25	0.083513616	She was married, if just temporarily, to actor Jonny Lee Miller, who she met while making ``Hackers''.
18_26	0.087662577	And she was achingly unhappy.
18_27	0.090202433	``It's like I had all the things I had always wanted in my life and there was still something about me that was very empty,'' Jolie says.
18_28	0.090160305	``I didn't know if I was going to be hungry again in my life for certain things.
18_29	0.092005932	And I didn't know what more I had to give''.
18_30	0.092694354	So Jolie took a break.
18_31	0.099470033	Sort of.
18_32	0.051444275	She took writing and directing classes at New York University, road the subways a lot and realized _ it didn't take too long _ that she really loved acting and that she had much more of herself to give to her profession.
18_33	0.09657729	And now, she's not quite sure how to stop giving.
18_34	0.064838941	Jolie has worked constantly for the past 18 months and when she isn't on a set, she's usually reading or writing or acting on the stage.
18_35	0.091060692	She's constantly looking for characters to play that will help her evolve as a person.
18_36	0.097705314	It's almost as if outside of acting, she can't find the motivation to grow.
18_37	0.052945338	At one point, Jolie noticed that her characters were taking trips and going out to dinner while she always sat at home, absorbed in the process of soaking up their fictional lives.
18_38	0.089967606	Acting was her professional life !ital!and!off! her personal life.
18_39	0.092516593	``She has always had a tremendous amount of energy, and the signals were always there that she might give that to acting,'' says father Voight.
18_40	0.095449163	But then, Voight must have always considered the possibility.
18_41	0.056420165	He and Bertrand, who divorced when Jolie was 2, purposely gave her a middle name that could double as a surname and thus relieve her of an unwanted burden should she choose a show-business career.
18_42	0.087659978	Jolie doesn't go into too many specifics about her early years with Voight, only to say that they had a ``stormy relationship'' because they are so much alike.
18_43	0.092885043	On this subject, like so many others, she's straightforward and yet a bit mysterious.
18_44	0.082941742	Jolie often obliquely refers to ``things'' she has gone through and endured in her life with the unspoken understanding that these are things you don't get to know about.
18_45	0.10102772	She reveals herself through her acting.
18_46	0.089178652	And that's enough.
18_47	0.10261276	That's all she's willing to give.
18_48	0.07799042	``For me, acting is a real experience,'' Jolie says.
18_49	0.083031495	``I choose roles that fit where I am in my life and open up to them because that's the way I'm opening up.
18_50	0.092447041	I make them real and I get close to people.
18_51	0.086830769	I know there's a false reality to acting, but the way I do it, it's my life and it's not fake.
18_52	0.086877967	It's not just a movie.
18_53	0.092074002	It's a real experience that I remember forever''.
18_54	0.091511907	Says Voight: ``She has a very strong, specific presence on screen.
18_55	0.09426137	There's a certain honesty there that I think is pretty rare, pretty special''.
18_56	0.094700009	Jolie would like to keep building on that but realizes that challenging roles for young actresses are few and far between.
18_57	0.085116882	She also knows the situation doesn't improve when actresses mature and lose their status as the Next Big Thing.
18_58	0.092637836	``I'll never work in this business just to work,'' Jolie says.
18_59	0.092633099	`It would kill me to feel like I wasn't really doing anything.
18_60	0.094452383	I'm hoping to keep growing and changing so that I'll have more to offer and be able to express it through my work.
18_61	0.088942712	And if Hollywood doesn't want to accept that or is critical of me for growing up and aging, then that's their loss because I know there's a need for it''.
18_62	0.090244151	``In fact,'' Jolie continues, ``it might make me more aggressive to go through that transition because it's such an important one to express.
18_63	0.097031062	It's what life is all about''.
18_64	0.087631416	And for Angelina Jolie, acting and life are entirely interwoven, tangled up in a beautiful tapestry that keeps growing. &QL;

20_1	0.085664109	to its strongest quarter in a dozen years, studio officials said Tuesday.

20_10	0.010497934	Dan Taylor, the studio's senior executive vice president and chief financial officer, credited the improved quarterly performance to a variety of factors.
20_11	0.039286549	One was the success of MGM films on digital video disc, a format with fatter margins than VHS tapes; cutbacks in staffing and overhead; and the resecuring of video and television rights previously tied up in long-term deals to outside companies.
