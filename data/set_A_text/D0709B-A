0_4	0.087809913	The Golden Globes honorees lived up to the irreverence for which the show has become known, but Fox's acceptance speech added a touching note.

0_6	0.085424581	``We're so lucky to do what we do...
0_7	0.073238511	and just take every day and enjoy it,'' Fox said.

0_9	0.075644598	In ``Little Voice,'' Caine played a sleazy agent who tries to turn a meek woman with powerful musical gift for show tunes into a star.
0_10	0.073988526	``Oh, what a shock,'' Caine said as he picked up his honor.
0_11	0.086053568	``My career must be slipping.

0_16	0.079610414	The awards, broadcast from a hotel ballroom by NBC, were plagued by problems with sound cutting out and the picture freezing momentarily.
0_17	0.080127107	Harris set the tone for the notoriously freewheeling awards show by coming on stage with a toothpick in his mouth, saying, ``Oh man, I just got through eating dinner''.
0_18	0.081992403	Backstage he noted that ``The Truman Show'' came out in the summer, long before studios traditionally roll out their award-worthy product.
0_19	0.084808189	``I'm glad that people didn't forget about it,'' he said.
0_20	0.085361728	Redgrave, who played the crusty but loving maid to an aging horror director in ``Gods and Monsters,'' said, ``It's been 32 years since I stood one of these on a mantelpiece and it's been crying out for a friend ever since''.

0_29	0.095696169	The Golden Globes, selected by reporters from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, are awarded for both film and television in a nationally televised ceremony in a hotel ballroom in what can be a much more colorful affair than the stuffy Academy Awards.

0_34	0.091476989	The awards also provide a valuable promotional tool for studios.
0_35	0.087655361	The morning after the ceremony, newspaper advertisements for films trumpet their Golden Globe hauls.
0_36	0.090340827	One award was announced before the ceremony: Nicholson was honored with the Cecil B.

0_38	0.0864787	Nicholson has been nominated for 14 Globes and won five.
0_39	0.086528057	For the fourth straight year, NBC dedicated three hours of prime-time to the awards, reflecting how far the ceremony has come in prestige.
0_40	0.087481483	The awards had once been buffeted by controversy over allegations of corrupt voting and long suffered credibility problems, with the lowlight being the 1981 event that awarded Pia Zadora a statue for the bomb ``Butterfly''.
0_41	0.095609156	Networks refused to show the program.
0_42	0.09100976	The association worked to regain respectability.
0_43	0.085584497	In 1996, after a 14-year absence from network exposure, the program was back on the air.
0_44	0.084592713	This year, NBC asked Golden Globe voters to sign waivers indicating they did not accept gifts or perks from Hollywood studios, the Washington Post reported Saturday.
0_45	0.086928935	Foreign Press Association President Helmut Voss said the waivers indicated ``during our journalistic activities, including out-of-town travel, that we did not accept any gifts other than those that are the customary promotional gifts of the studios.''
1_0	0.12027493	NEW YORK (AP) --The woman on the magazine cover isn't Kate or Claudia or another fab supermodel.
1_1	0.089539619	Still, she's so famous that the browser almost has to take a second look --and may even buy the magazine.
1_2	0.077127729	The cover girl's appeal?
1_3	0.08236979	She's a superstar, not a supermodel.
1_4	0.080976695	Fashion magazine editors are putting more famous faces from movies and television to music on covers, hoping the box office power of Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore or Mariah Carey will succeed at newsstands.
1_5	0.07619112	It seems the obvious solution when they're saying in publishing circles that supermodels are as passe as last season's hemline.
1_6	0.079201686	Some critics say models have exhibited less-than-model behavior.
1_7	0.077792277	Ot they've become boring.
1_8	0.08847004	Or even worse --old.
1_9	0.073224868	The megamodels still have cover girl faces, but their star power has dimmed, now that the runways are no longer ruled by the deified six: Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Claudia Schiffer and Kate Moss.
1_10	0.090547656	And their heirs aren't apparent.
1_11	0.081006786	But no one is yet sure whether entertainers or models sell better.
1_12	0.077176318	Last January, a death knell directive from leading fashion editor Linda Wells appeared in The New York Times: ``Nobody cares about models anymore''.
1_13	0.099858286	Now Ms.
1_14	0.083919984	Wells, the editor of Allure, is not so sure.
1_15	0.091404912	``I sounded too harsh.
1_16	0.076573322	It is not as dire as that,'' she said.
1_17	0.08834719	Still, she added, ``Americans might be slightly less captivated by models' daily habits and...
1_18	0.090248859	their latest spats with their boyfriends or agents''.
1_19	0.080093191	Allure, which had a cover ratio of 10 models to two stars in 1998, is flip-flopping those figures.
1_20	0.081135532	Vogue increased celebrity covers last year from two to seven.
1_21	0.085774452	Mademoiselle and Elle also have swung to star power.
1_22	0.08083239	``I'm gambling on this, and it's an important gamble,'' said Ms.
1_23	0.10509455	Wells, who lined up actresses Angelina Jolie and Julianne Moore for spring covers.
1_24	0.085296489	``We are putting a lot more celebrities on the cover because I believe they will sell more.
1_25	0.090156883	After all, that's what we're trying to do, sell magazines''.
1_26	0.088678267	Choosing a hot cover is not an exact science.
1_27	0.086819649	Not every celebrity cover scores.
1_28	0.086760471	Sometimes it's timing --fall fashion issues are usually best sellers, for instance.
1_29	0.096130746	And according to magazine sales, today's fashion face is Oprah Winfrey.
1_30	0.090800569	Her October cover was Vogue's 1998 best seller, with some 810,000 newsstand sales.
1_31	0.10351562	The talk-show queen likewise reigned in first place at In Style, with 844,000 newsstand sales for November.
1_32	0.090581578	Calista Flockhart of ``Ally McBeal'' was Harper's Bazaar's top seller for 1998.
1_33	0.096659816	Public personalities also are stealing the spotlight --a Hillary Rodham Clinton cover on Vogue got excellent grades.
1_34	0.093356303	``Some women's magazines are tossing off models because people identify more with celebrities,'' said Lisa Granatstein, senior editor at Mediaweek, a New York-based trade magazine.
1_35	0.092520814	She explained the celebrities' appeal: ``You know they've just broken up with their husband, you know their latest movie, you know their every move''.
1_36	0.090364814	Eleanor Lambert, who founded the New York designer previews known as Fashion Week, said that the word ``supermodel'' derived from ``a group of young women with slatlike bodies and colorless personalities''.
1_37	0.098992943	Still, today's supermodels could flourish by making the transition from model to actress as did Audrey Hepburn, Jane Fonda, Cybill Shepherd, Kim Basinger and Sharon Stone.
1_38	0.09250702	Naomi Campbell could be the next escapee to film stardom in the upcoming ``Prisoner of Love''.
1_39	0.091012708	``I always say it is my last (modeling) season because I think they're not going to want me anymore,'' she told Vogue.
1_40	0.0882159	No wonder she worries --the headline on her profile in the March issue read ``The Last Supermodel''.
1_41	0.096969346	Is Ms.
1_42	0.075381864	Campbell indeed the end of a breed?
1_43	0.10565245	About 10 years have passed since the decade's best-known mannequins revolutionized the genre.
1_44	0.078077381	Perhaps they were too hot not to cool down.
1_45	0.086929064	Or maybe the supermodel image just got old --literally -- since most of the big names are over 30.
1_46	0.086705823	Some style watchers expect another generation of megamodels on the horizon.
1_47	0.093560209	``As long as there have been magazines, there have been star models,'' said Eileen Ford, who founded Ford Models in 1947.
1_48	0.087848622	Ms. Ford would know.
1_49	0.10528022	On her payroll were Cheryl Tiegs, who racked up 24 Glamour covers between 1967 and 1989, and Christie Brinkley, who scored 19, from 1975 to 1989.
1_50	0.10024258	``I suspect at some point the celebrity tide will swing back,'' said Elaina Richardson, editor of Elle.
1_51	0.089435003	``If you think about a Twiggy or a Jean Shrimpton, there have been very famous models who had more celebrity than most actresses''.
1_52	0.095140418	Still, Ms.
1_53	0.086545871	Richardson put actress Cate Blanchett on the magazine's cover for May and stockpiled 1998 covers with Sharon Stone, Minnie Driver and Salma Hayek.
1_54	0.091087138	It could be, however, that neither celebrities nor models are the biggest draw.
1_55	0.093548967	Ms. Ford recalled that McCall's once ran a test to see whether a model or a strawberry shortcake on the cover would draw more readers.
1_56	0.093580014	``You know which (sold more), don't you --the strawberry shortcake,'' she said.
1_57	0.090003543	''We almost died of horror.''
2_0	0.095899264	As a thriller, ``The Bone Collector'' is a bit above average _ creepy enough, but a bit short on logic and believability.
2_1	0.14270938	But it does boast two of this year's Oscar nominees in starring roles _ Denzel Washington, who is up in the best actor category for his role of wrongly convicted boxer Rubin Carter in ``Hurricane,'' and Angelina Jolie, who received the best supporting actress nod for her role as the mentally disturbed teen, Lisa, in ``Girl, Interrupted''.
2_2	0.1474533	Both already picked up Golden Globe Awards earlier in the year, and Jolie won a Screen Actors Guild statuette on Sunday.
2_3	0.075254484	``Collector'' is another serial-killer story, the twist being that Washington's character _ forensic detective Lincoln Rhyme _ is a quadriplegic.
2_4	0.088247032	Rhyme had been injured while investigating a crime.
2_5	0.07501755	He remains on the force, however _ albeit bedridden and surrounded by an array of high-tech gadgetry _ and continues to help solve crimes.
2_6	0.079409804	Jolie plays Amelia Donaghy, a smart beat cop who Rhyme recognizes has potential to be more.
2_7	0.08491486	Jolie and Washington make a compelling combination, with both playing variations of roles that they are known for.
2_8	0.078944359	Even in action roles, Washington comes across as cerebral, and _ except for flashbacks to when his character wasn't paralyzed _ that's what you see in this film.
2_9	0.1052717	But Washington, a former best supporting actor Oscar winner, can do a lot with a little.
2_10	0.082793823	And while his Rhyme character is fairly predictably drawn, Washington imbues him with strength and dignity without overreaching, making him far more real than any of the events in the movie.
2_11	0.087565409	The characters Jolie plays, on the other hand, always seem dangerous _ either to themselves, others or both.
2_12	0.090327998	Donaghy is no exception, carrying around a lot of past baggage.
2_13	0.091929426	It's not the character but Jolie's edginess, an animal-on-the-prowl quality, that keeps you watching.
2_14	0.10779242	Jolie, the daughter of Academy Award-winning actor Jon Voight, has already picked up a couple of Emmys.
2_15	0.083184565	Oscar won't be far behind.
2_16	0.10332678	Washington, who is nominated along with another former winner in the best supporting actor category, Kevin Spacey, is a favorite to win the Oscar.
2_17	0.090381416	But win or lose, go back and check out some of Washington's previous work, particularly in his films with Spike Lee _ ``Mo Better Blues (1990), ``Malcolm X'' (1992) and ``He Got Game'' (1998) Others include ``Cry Freedom'' (1987), in which he played South African activist Steven Biko; ``Glory,'' for which he won his Oscar; Carl Franklin's `Devil in a Blue Dress'' (1995), which is based on the Walter Mosley novel; and ``Courage Under Fire'' (1996).
2_18	0.090954137	Jolie has a much shorter resume, but check out last year's ``Pushing Tin'' and ``Gia,'' the HBO movie where she played outrageous supermodel Gia Carangi, who died of AIDS.

3_2	0.084168752	Artist, writer, filmmaker and performer, he gained fame during the brief East Village art boom of the 1980's.
3_3	0.077367897	But he kept himself outside the hype and went his own way.

3_15	0.08262292	To a nation with little patience for quaint remnants, he can seem an anomalous holdover of the British Empire, which much of his music appeared to embody in its doughty as in brave/valiant, or dowdy, as in unstylish? staunchness and solemnity.
3_16	0.087681823	But Elgar deserves respect for more than just those ``Pomp and Circumstance'' marches; some listeners have found a core of deep humanity in his work, even under the occasional bluster.

10_0	0.09961059	During a meeting to discuss Oscar coverage, some Life &AMP; Arts staff members decided that we should do a week-by-week look at the Big Six categories: Best Picture, Best Director and the four acting categories.
10_1	0.088015491	We decided to start with the ``lowest'' award, but there was some debate as to which award that might be.
10_2	0.10777862	On the official Academy Awards Web site (www.oscar.com), the acting awards take precedence over director.
10_3	0.075462439	We decided, however, that Best Director is more important than the supporting-acting awards.
10_4	0.071341384	Which is why we're starting with Best Supporting Actress.
10_5	0.077734235	The irrational subjectivity of that becomes clear when you realize what a strong field this year's Best Supporting Actress nominees comprise.
10_6	0.077171429	Empathy played well in this category.
10_7	0.078076608	Toni Collette is supremely empathetic as the troubled mother of a haunted little boy in ``The Sixth Sense''.
10_8	0.083297766	It was a pleasant surprise to see the academy recognize this, since she was upstaged by co-star (and co-nominee) Haley Joel Osment and by the movie's twist ending.
10_9	0.081410869	Samantha Morton earned a nod for her performance as a sweet, mute woman who puts up with a jazz guitarist who takes her for granted in ``Sweet and Lowdown;'' because she's the only person who can't interrupt his motor-mouthed self-absorption, she's actually able to see through to his pain.
10_10	0.083430016	And Chloe Sevigny, the type of actress who always looks as if she's lost in a pleasant daydream, is touching as a woman who falls for an impostor in ``Boys Don't Cry'' _ and, once the ruse is revealed, remains committed because she knows that the emotions remain real.
10_11	0.093740273	The other two nominees provide a flip side to the empathy, with Angelina Jolie and Catherine Keener as women who are looking out only for themselves in, respectively, ``Girl, Interrupted'' and ``Being John Malkovich''.
10_12	0.087686687	Jolie walks away with ``Girl, Interrupted'' as a sociopath whose charm and mischievous nature belie a cold-hearted cruel streak.
10_13	0.090199476	Keener was first among equals in ``Malkovich's'' ensemble as a scheming woman who finds a way to take advantage of just about anything _ including a passageway inside a character actor's head.
10_14	0.089685389	Jolie and Keener have shown plenty of range in the past year, each playing more selfless women (Jolie in last spring's ``Playing by Heart,'' Keener in the current ``Simpatico'') who end up benefiting from their selflessness.
10_15	0.09424748	And each, having risen up from the ranks of premium-cable TV (Jolie) and independent films (Keener), has more familiarity than the competition.
10_16	0.096267278	Collette and Sevigny also have some indie-film cred, but Keener is a busier, more versatile actress.
10_17	0.089722783	Morton, despite having a few movies under her belt, is more of an unknown _ but she's in a Woody Allen movie, and Allen's movies have historically done well in this category.
10_18	0.094678628	Although it's a wide-open race, Jolie would appear to have the edge, having come off a Golden Globe win for ``Girl, Interrupted''.
10_19	0.086080798	Having an Oscar-winning pedigree _ dad Jon Voight won in 1978 for ``Coming Home'' _ can't hurt.
10_20	0.08935206	She's my bet for who'll take home the statue, but if I were able to vote, I'd pick Sevigny, who gives a heart to the otherwise dark and mean ``Boys Don't Cry''.

11_8	0.077722014	She sighs and says, ``People are suddenly concerned about my hair?
11_9	0.085902312	Please. I was like, `I don't think we fooled anyone'''.
11_10	0.069549333	Jolie, 25, delights in making waves.
11_11	0.11754935	This is a woman who literally jumped in a swimming pool in her ballgown after winning a Golden Globe Award for ``Gia'' (1998).
11_12	0.074562622	She isn't adorned with jewels but with tattoos, including a large ``H,'' which stands for Haven, her brother's middle name.
11_13	0.087655081	Recently she took a plunge of a different sort and married actor Billy Bob Thornton.
11_14	0.077894705	No one even knew the two actors, who met on the set of 1998's ``Pushing Tin,'' were dating.
11_15	0.083400138	``Hey, when I'm 90, they will never be able to say, `Oh, she was just another boring starlet,'' Jolie says.
11_16	0.09756724	That's an understatement.

11_24	0.077506894	It's the story of two rival car thief gangs who have 24 hours to prove which group can ``collect'' the most merchandise.
11_25	0.11099187	``I didn't do the film because it was high art.
11_26	0.080377903	It was my summer vacation last year and frankly I wanted to learn about cars,'' Jolie confesses.
11_27	0.078268458	She learned a few practical tips from someone who really knows his wheels.
11_28	0.087717282	``I do know how to steal a car now, although maybe I shouldn't get that out there,'' she says.
11_29	0.076947198	``We actually had a real thief on the set escorted by his prison guard.
11_30	0.072481125	I didn't know who they were the first time.

11_32	0.083012927	I asked the thief a million questions and this guy could rip apart an entire car and tell you every single part of it''.
11_33	0.087699449	Forget logic.
11_34	0.087797413	Jolie says that after ``The Bone Collector'' (1999) and her Oscar winning turn as mental patient Lisa in ``Girl, Interrupted'' (1999), she was ready for some screen fun.
11_35	0.075878337	But Jolie cautions that she's still a serious actress.
11_36	0.087276689	In fact, that's why she turned down one of the leads in the upcoming big screen version of ``Charlie's Angels''.
11_37	0.088341969	``The `Charlie's Angels' people had a few selling points,'' Jolie says.
11_38	0.083517928	``They told me there weren't many good characters for strong women.

11_40	0.084227672	``I was also told that doing `Charlie's Angels' `will make you a big star,' which is frightening and not a plus in my book,'' Jolie says.
11_41	0.077263582	``I looked at it as a money job.
11_42	0.088275767	Given the fact that I don't really like to get dressed up in high heels, it wasn't worth it to me.
11_43	0.084175181	I figured that my fun job was `Gone in 60 Seconds'.
11_44	0.088469605	And frankly, I thought car thieves and hanging out with the boys was just so much cooler''.
11_45	0.085717884	Hanging out on the A list in Hollywood leaves her cold.

13_0	0.1166573	When a stunning Angelina Jolie announced a few minutes after winning a Golden Globe that she would take a plunge, gown and all, in the hotel swimming pool, she must have seemed insane to anyone who had just watched her wiggle to the stage to claim her award for her part in ``Gia,'' an HBO movie.
13_1	0.081701418	The white and silver racer-back gown she wore so closely outlined the best of what Ms.

13_5	0.076649921	The lace-and-sequin gown that Halston's Kevan Hall put on Christine Lahti for the Golden Globes presaged the cobweb and beaded lace gowns he presented last week for fall.
13_6	0.077243708	And the black and white outfit designed by Pamela Dennis for Calista Flockhart begot long trumpet skirts on the catwalk, including one in rich ruby sequins.
13_7	0.084217525	But on the whole, evening-wear designers showing for fall 1999 are a demure bunch.
13_8	0.081390053	There was plenty of beauty worthy of the Oscars, the Golden Globes or even the Grammys, which offer a chance for more fashion-watching tomorrow night, but little to elicit heart palpitations.

13_11	0.075758996	It's just different.
13_12	0.073531423	Tommy Hilfiger and Daryl Kerrigan, in her Daryl K collection, ripped with wonderful abandon into both ends of the sexless spectrum.
13_13	0.075822435	As American as cornflakes, Hilfiger plays the wide-eyed innocent of fashion who just might have a dirty little secret.
13_14	0.075242825	He gives enough edge to his approachable clothes that they are just safely this side of Kmart oblivion.
13_15	0.077340584	To the sounds of a live rock band, Sugar Ray, the more to underline the hip Hilfiger-music connection, the designer sent men's and women's clothes rocking down the runway together.
13_16	0.080718463	His mix of sports, music and high fashion was a potent brew, especially in long nylon skirts and leather jeans with white stitching.
13_17	0.083173913	The collection was further elevated by terrific fur vests, python patchwork pants and an evening gown of leather and wool fit for a biker princess.
13_18	0.078026581	Ms. Kerrigan's collection was a pirate's treasure worth of creativity.
13_19	0.080345021	There was no guesswork in trying to figure out her inspirational mother lode.
13_20	0.099261806	It was war.

13_22	0.097700335	Menacingly dark colors were intercepted by flashes of reflective utilitarian orange or white in luxuriously ragged shearling coats or nylon hooded jackets that partly hid the models' faces.
13_23	0.088160222	That war should be text for a Kerrigan show is not surprising given that Ms.

13_27	0.088143021	Kerrigan. In his second season as chief designer for Halston, Hall made a short excursion into day wear, and it was most promising: a studded chocolate suede dress with decolletage abounding; a lush vanilla frappe of a wrap jacket over a crisp white Halston shirt.
13_28	0.091175168	Beaded tweed gowns and silvery sheaths were tantalizing.
13_29	0.092414808	There were, though, unnecessarily mundane gowns, like a black velvet column that made one wonder which member of his front row Hall was playing to.
13_30	0.092000983	If you were Lynn Whitfield, a diva who has to make an entrance, it lacked impact.
13_31	0.091173542	If you were Dawn Mello, the president of Bergdorf Goodman, looking for something simple and elegant for a conservative customer, you were probably thrilled to bits _ even the oldest women keep lovely backs.
13_32	0.10574177	Understatement permeated Vera Wang's collection, as if earthiness precluded sultriness in evening wear.
13_33	0.090754093	Ms. Wang offered gauze or tulle dresses decorated with beads in the shape of palm fronds.
13_34	0.10276751	Throughout the collections, designers of evening wear have pushed the idea of knits for after 8, and Ms.
13_35	0.093502039	Wang handily paired skirts and dresses with turtlenecks and ponchos, infusing the collection with a very American spirit.
13_36	0.089385389	A wonderful impact of the American shows' going first on the international calendar (London, Milan and Paris follow in the next few weeks) was that designers plumbed American culture and style rather than European.
13_37	0.089636539	This is not to suggest that there were no outside influences.
13_38	0.11352528	There were touches of modern and ancient Asia everywhere, at Ms.
13_39	0.083696451	Wang's show and at Duke's.
13_40	0.089859157	It was uplifting to see Duke back on the runways after his unceremonious exit from Halston last summer.
13_41	0.087275531	In the audience were his new backers, Juliana Holt and her husband, Peter, who owns the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association.
13_42	0.096084671	Duke used cashmere or fleece in a variety of sweaters _ off-the-shoulder, bateau necklines and hooded sweatshirts _ pairing them with pave gowns, beaded skirts and, prettiest of all, debutante tulle skirts in fondant colors.
13_43	0.09419692	But Duke's decision to use all Asian, Eurasian and Afro-Asian models was regrettable.
13_44	0.087019117	Making race a part of an esthetic unwittingly paves the way for Asian, Latina or African models to be left out in the cold when their look doesn't work with the mood of the season, as has happened before.
13_45	0.10658674	Vivienne Tam and Han Feng managed to invoke an Asian point of view without typecasting.
13_46	0.094523682	Fresh and original, Ms.
13_47	0.1014722	Tam incorporated futuristic nylon puffed jackets shading the face, luminous sparkly dresses juxtaposed with Chinese brocades, and Chinese spiritual icons embroidered onto T-shirts.
13_48	0.098793338	Ms. Tam had her false starts, but she is unquestionably pointed toward the future.
13_49	0.085975848	Not so, Ms.
13_50	0.091976701	Feng, who in her zeal to make clothes intellectual, turned in an uncharacteristically dank collection.
13_51	0.10293843	Turbid colors like brown, gray and loden were used in mandarin jackets over wide-leg trousers.

16_1	0.10791888	After Jolie's gushing words of love for her brother at the Oscars in March, rumor-mongers hinted at incest.
16_2	0.083613275	After her whirlwind Vegas marriage to Billy Bob Thornton last month, the gossip mill had Jolie breaking up Thornton's relationship with Laura Dern.
16_3	0.080216023	After word leaked out about a steamy scene between Jolie and Antonio Banderas for an upcoming movie, the tabloid talkers speculated they were fooling around for real.
16_4	0.092455985	None of it is true, Jolie said in an interview to promote her new movie ''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' which opens Friday.
16_5	0.079536115	''It hurts when people just make light of things that are important to you,'' Jolie said.
16_6	0.073661505	''Like taking your relationship with your brother, which is a very beautiful thing, and twisting it so your parents are watching the TV, it's a moment they'll remember forever, and now rather than seeing a beautiful moment for their children, they're thinking, 'Oh, my God, the whole world is calling our children perverted publicly'''.
16_7	0.086571567	Jolie said she and brother Jamie Haven, the children of actor Jon Voight, are close siblings, nothing more.
16_8	0.079567722	''We actually felt like the people who wrote that should be a little embarrassed because they came up with it,'' Jolie said.
16_9	0.090754762	''That's what's weird''.
16_10	0.075121865	As for her abrupt nuptials to Thornton, Jolie laughs off rumors that he married her only as a friend who felt she needed looking out for.
16_11	0.078256232	They met while filming ''Pushing Tin'' two years ago but did not become involved until a few months ago, she said.
16_12	0.077102221	''If the rumor is he's with me because he wants to look after me, I think that's beautiful,'' Jolie said.

18_1	0.089147505	And Jolie would happily oblige, much to the delight of her actress mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who would provide the kids with costumes for elaborate performances.
18_2	0.088697279	Jolie's father, actor Jon Voight, encouraged her as well.
18_3	0.09690458	Nobody ever told Jolie to be quiet or stop talking.
18_4	0.081080852	Instead, as she was growing up, she was constantly challenged to examine her feelings and question the world around her.
18_5	0.08371576	``I was being prepared to respond to other people, to listen to other people, to express what I was feeling, to be bold, to be really honest, to let things hurt if they hurt and not be in denial about what was going on inside me,'' the 23-year-old Jolie says.
18_6	0.07621343	``And, yeah, those things have helped me as an actress but they've also helped me live my life.
18_7	0.08360409	Because, to me, to prepare to be a good actor is to prepare to live life''.
18_8	0.078599924	The preparation has paid handsome dividends since the beautiful Jolie began using her talents for more than family productions.
18_9	0.085517872	She has stolen every movie she has appeared in, giving passionate performances in otherwise forgettable fare like ``Hackers'' and the recent ``Playing by Heart''.
18_10	0.10129714	Where Jolie has really made her mark is in television, winning back-to-back Golden Globes and Emmy nods for the cable movies ``Gia'' and ``George Wallace''.
18_11	0.11076975	In the former, she played a doomed fashion model; in the latter, she was the wife of an American icon.
18_12	0.078765956	Together, the two turns displayed an incredible range.
18_13	0.10938191	``The world is full of beautiful girls, but they're not Angelina Jolie,'' says director John Frankenheimer, who worked with Jolie on ``Wallace''.
18_14	0.087375197	``She's fun, honest, intelligent, gorgeous and divinely talented.
18_15	0.082415498	She brings a hell of a lot to the party''.
18_16	0.077674785	Audiences should find cause for celebration with Jolie's upcoming trio of movies.
18_17	0.085392374	In the current air-traffic controller comedy, ``Pushing Tin,'' Jolie plays an unhappy wife given to consuming vodka by the barrel.
18_18	0.086884634	Arriving this fall is ``Girl Interrupted,'' the true story of a young woman wrongly placed in a mental institution.
18_19	0.07217459	Winona Ryder stars; Jolie plays her schizophrenic friend.
18_20	0.087992915	Still later will be ``The Bone Collector,'' a thriller that has Jolie playing a cop partnered with Denzel Washington.
18_21	0.081918738	On that one, Jolie's name will appear above the title for the first time in her young career.
18_22	0.082006672	It sounds as though Jolie is always working, and she readily admits as much.
18_23	0.077829195	She did take a break once.
18_24	0.085360604	Jolie had just finished ``Gia,'' a part so rich and so complex that she figured she'd never see the likes of it again.
18_25	0.08132869	She was married, if just temporarily, to actor Jonny Lee Miller, who she met while making ``Hackers''.
18_26	0.074072155	And she was achingly unhappy.
18_27	0.08379732	``It's like I had all the things I had always wanted in my life and there was still something about me that was very empty,'' Jolie says.
18_28	0.08544711	``I didn't know if I was going to be hungry again in my life for certain things.
18_29	0.08571388	And I didn't know what more I had to give''.
18_30	0.078050155	So Jolie took a break.
18_31	0.10252485	Sort of.
18_32	0.086509317	She took writing and directing classes at New York University, road the subways a lot and realized _ it didn't take too long _ that she really loved acting and that she had much more of herself to give to her profession.
18_33	0.09905796	And now, she's not quite sure how to stop giving.
18_34	0.088360389	Jolie has worked constantly for the past 18 months and when she isn't on a set, she's usually reading or writing or acting on the stage.
18_35	0.086756966	She's constantly looking for characters to play that will help her evolve as a person.
18_36	0.10344922	It's almost as if outside of acting, she can't find the motivation to grow.
18_37	0.092146469	At one point, Jolie noticed that her characters were taking trips and going out to dinner while she always sat at home, absorbed in the process of soaking up their fictional lives.
18_38	0.080779356	Acting was her professional life !ital!and!off! her personal life.
18_39	0.08966919	``She has always had a tremendous amount of energy, and the signals were always there that she might give that to acting,'' says father Voight.
18_40	0.085169587	But then, Voight must have always considered the possibility.
18_41	0.09442664	He and Bertrand, who divorced when Jolie was 2, purposely gave her a middle name that could double as a surname and thus relieve her of an unwanted burden should she choose a show-business career.
18_42	0.089713417	Jolie doesn't go into too many specifics about her early years with Voight, only to say that they had a ``stormy relationship'' because they are so much alike.
18_43	0.095761175	On this subject, like so many others, she's straightforward and yet a bit mysterious.
18_44	0.091223404	Jolie often obliquely refers to ``things'' she has gone through and endured in her life with the unspoken understanding that these are things you don't get to know about.
18_45	0.091706511	She reveals herself through her acting.
18_46	0.095707034	And that's enough.
18_47	0.10063812	That's all she's willing to give.
18_48	0.080166868	``For me, acting is a real experience,'' Jolie says.
18_49	0.087706716	``I choose roles that fit where I am in my life and open up to them because that's the way I'm opening up.
18_50	0.090187981	I make them real and I get close to people.
18_51	0.090708036	I know there's a false reality to acting, but the way I do it, it's my life and it's not fake.
18_52	0.075990208	It's not just a movie.
18_53	0.081327324	It's a real experience that I remember forever''.
18_54	0.085370201	Says Voight: ``She has a very strong, specific presence on screen.
18_55	0.095882969	There's a certain honesty there that I think is pretty rare, pretty special''.
18_56	0.08796483	Jolie would like to keep building on that but realizes that challenging roles for young actresses are few and far between.
18_57	0.089950081	She also knows the situation doesn't improve when actresses mature and lose their status as the Next Big Thing.
18_58	0.090439749	``I'll never work in this business just to work,'' Jolie says.
18_59	0.092729441	`It would kill me to feel like I wasn't really doing anything.
18_60	0.089806113	I'm hoping to keep growing and changing so that I'll have more to offer and be able to express it through my work.
18_61	0.093250089	And if Hollywood doesn't want to accept that or is critical of me for growing up and aging, then that's their loss because I know there's a need for it''.
18_62	0.09052601	``In fact,'' Jolie continues, ``it might make me more aggressive to go through that transition because it's such an important one to express.
18_63	0.090853486	It's what life is all about''.
18_64	0.10404885	And for Angelina Jolie, acting and life are entirely interwoven, tangled up in a beautiful tapestry that keeps growing. &QL;
19_0	0.16148791	NEW YORK (AP) --The director and producer of the serial-killer thriller ``The Bone Collector,'' due out Friday, readily admit Universal Studios executives didn't want Angelina Jolie.
19_1	0.082361506	The 24-year-old daughter of actor John Voigt, known for her Barbie-doll figure, tattoos and knives, had quit acting and was attending film school.
19_2	0.074349695	``They wanted an 'established' actress,'' director Phillip Noyce tells Entertainment Weekly in its Nov.
19_3	0.095832133	5 edition.
19_4	0.085299378	It took some heated arguments --with Noyce and producer Martin Bregman both fighting for Jolie -- and a serious slash to the film's budget to get Universal to agree, adds Bregman.
19_5	0.10362815	Bregman says he faced similar problems getting then-unknown Michelle Pfeiffer into ``Scarface''.
19_6	0.077096764	``Nobody knew who she was,'' he says.
19_7	0.09854204	``Angie's enormously gifted, and I usually get what I want''.
19_8	0.1063665	Jolie, who appeared in the TNT miniseries ``George Wallace'' and the HBO film ``Gia,'' plays a stuntwoman in ``The Bone Collector'' who tracks a serial killer for a quadriplegic cop played by Denzel Washington.
20_0	0.10019691	LOS ANGELES _ Agent 007 and a massive restructuring effort helped drive Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.
20_1	0.083575265	to its strongest quarter in a dozen years, studio officials said Tuesday.
20_2	0.083563347	MGM recorded its second consecutive profitable quarter during the final three months of 1999, thanks to the impact of a new James Bond flick, ``The World is Not Enough,'' improved video results and a corporate overhaul.
20_3	0.076733287	For the quarter ended Dec.
20_4	0.078025984	31, Santa Monica-based MGM earned $15.2 million, 8 cents per share, on revenues of $372.2 million.
20_5	0.076260039	This compares with a loss of $43.7 million, or 41cents, on revenue of $383.4 million in the 1998 fourth quarter.
20_6	0.079172423	Still, the company ended up in the red for all of 1999.
20_7	0.074048725	For the year MGM lost $530.9 million, $3.36 a share, on revenue of $1.142 billion.
20_8	0.081169613	In 1998 the company lost $157.65 million, $2.08 a share, on sales of $1.24 billion.
20_9	0.087957992	The 1999 loss reflects a pretax charge of $440 million to cover restructuring costs.
20_10	0.086670908	Dan Taylor, the studio's senior executive vice president and chief financial officer, credited the improved quarterly performance to a variety of factors.
20_11	0.0824236	One was the success of MGM films on digital video disc, a format with fatter margins than VHS tapes; cutbacks in staffing and overhead; and the resecuring of video and television rights previously tied up in long-term deals to outside companies.
20_12	0.094609952	The rights were resecured without a cash outlay.
20_13	0.086303108	``If you exclude the performance of `The World is Not Enough' in the fourth quarter, we still far more than doubled our...
20_14	0.095677409	performance,'' Taylor said about earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
20_15	0.1018717	Matthew Harrigan, senior vice president at Denver-based investment firm Hanifren, Imhoff Inc.
20_16	0.086102997	, said the actions of new management seem to be putting MGM back on track.
20_17	0.091517329	``The results moderately exceeded expectations, by about $10 million.
20_18	0.091431559	But more importantly, there's good momentum on the deal side,'' Harrigan said.
20_19	0.090824228	``It looks like they've cobbled together a nice film slate for 2001 ...
20_20	0.089993987	and gone a long, long way toward changing the limited talent relationships they've had over the last two years''.
20_21	0.088570509	This year started inauspiciously for MGM, with ``Supernova'' opening to bad reviews and sparse box office.
20_22	0.088422697	On the television side, MGM's syndicated ``National Enquirer TV'' has just been picked up for a second season, and two new shows are being launched: ``Sexwars'' and ``Chatroom America''.
20_23	0.091802113	The latest Bond film is one of the most profitable of the decades-long franchise, collecting more than $320 million so far at the worldwide box office.
20_24	0.08741194	It is expected to continue to fill MGM's coffers this year, as it is released to pay-TV and video.
20_25	0.094501504	Three other MGM releases _ ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' ``Stigmata'' and ``Tea With Mussolini'' _ also performed above expectations, Taylor said.
20_26	0.081519802	MGM outlined a slate of 14 films for 2001.
20_27	0.085633565	Among them are a remake of ``Rollerball'' directed by John McTiernan, a sequel to ``Silence of the Lambs'' titled ``Hannibal'' and the sequel ``Basic Instinct 2''.
20_28	0.084698004	Studio executives have high hopes for such star-studded upcoming theatrical releases as ``Autumn in New York,'' starring Richard Gere and Winona Ryder; ``Dancing in the Dark,'' with Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie; and ``Heartbreakers,'' featuring Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt.

22_6	0.073953472	Scientific or not, the survey was ''American Beauty's'' clincher for best buzz going into the Oscar show, broadcast on ABC with Billy Crystal as host.
22_7	0.097261189	The poll's other favorites also seemed to reflect pre-Oscar conventional wisdom: Denzel Washington for leading actor in ''The Hurricane,'' Hilary Swank for leading actress in ''Boys Don't Cry,'' Michael Caine for supporting actor in ''The Cider House Rules,'' and Jolie for supporting actress.

22_14	0.086083446	The academy also extended the voting deadline a few days to last Thursday, meaning the accountants had to work overtime on awards weekend.
