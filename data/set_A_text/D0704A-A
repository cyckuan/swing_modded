0_0	0.27569772	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With the 10th anniversary of Myanmar's failed democracy uprising approaching, London-based Amnesty International is urging the military government to avoid possible violence by improving human rights.
0_1	0.19254913	``As this important anniversary approaches, we hope that you will begin to defuse possibilities for conflict by taking immediate steps towards improving the human rights situation,'' Amnesty's International Secretary General Pierre Sane said Thursday.
0_2	0.093641035	His comments were contained in an open letter to Gen.
0_3	0.12527547	Than Shwe, leader of the military government.
0_4	0.019721464	Sane suggested releasing political prisoners who were old and sick, freeing jailed members of democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's political party and ending repression against candidates who won a 1990 election the military refused to honor.
0_5	0.060906938	August 8th will be the tenth anniversary of the day when millions of people across Myanmar, then called Burma, demanded an end to 26 years of military rule and the installation of a democratic government.
0_6	0.06284464	The military responded with brutal force, gunning down at least 3,000 protesters, including Buddhist monks, and jailing thousands of others.
0_7	0.069877913	Rumors of planned civil disobedience inside Myanmar on the anniversary have been circulating in Myanmar exile communities in Bangkok.
0_8	0.095020859	The anniversary ``holds great symbolic significance for the Burmese people and for the international community.
0_9	0.10981702	Amnesty International is deeply concerned, therefore, about the potential for heightened tension at this time between the authorities and political activists,'' Sane wrote.
0_10	0.073193239	``This has been reflected over the past few weeks by political arrests and increased restrictions and surveillance of opposition leaders,'' he added, referring to the recent beating of members of Aung San Suu Kyi's party by government security forces as they tried to visit her compound.
1_0	0.21463147	(by Wang Jinyu) NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) --The Kenyan government last night criticized Amnesty International (AI) for its "presumptuous" report "calculated to incite Kenyans against their government".
1_1	0.19322297	In a press release issued here on Wednesday following a 12-day fact-finding mission in Kenya, the AI accused the government of violations of human rights and of dragging its feet on legal and constitutional reforms.
1_2	0.15361553	In a strongly worded rejoinder last evening to the AI statement, the Kenyan government told the visiting AI Secretary-General Pierre Sane that it would not tolerate prescriptions from AI on how to deal with alleged violations of human rights.
1_3	0.13003441	Kenya reminded AI that it had machinery and a working system of handling matters such as human rights violations and would continue to address itself to cases of human rights violations.
1_4	0.11353787	The rejoinder said that the AI obsession with the torture and human rights violations in Kenya were not genuine but were political in support of opposition political activities.
1_5	0.10676854	It pointed out that some cases of torture and human rights violations had always been individualized and the government had already taken actions against the perpetrators of such crimes.
1_6	0.11101346	"If Amnesty wanted to be fair and objective, it should have recognized the positive steps that the government has taken to deal with law enforcement officers who have gone overboard in the execution of their duties".
1_7	0.13063822	During its stay in Kenya, the AI delegation claimed that they interviewed a cross section of Kenyans, among them politicians, human rights activists, donors and diplomats, and released a manifesto on human rights situation in Kenya to which Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti reacted angrily.
1_8	0.17233988	In a commentary, the local newspaper Kenya Times, organ of the ruling Kenya African National Union, accused AI of having taken side on Kenya's political affairs, asking "can Amnesty International be trusted to produce a credible report on the human rights situation in this country"?
1_9	0.17070145	The commentary said that "while hundreds of thousands of innocent people were slaughtered in Rwanda, Amnesty International was busy searching for non-existent 'evidence' of human rights abuses in peaceful Kenya."
2_0	0.20631222	DAR ES SALAAM, August 7 (Xinhua) --The Tanzanian government today characterized the 1996 Amnesty International Report as biased and aimed at sowing seeds of hatred among the Tanzanian population.
2_1	0.18721256	This stand was included in a press release issued by the Tanzanian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, which said the report is one-sided narration derived from hear-say and wild allegations made by some disgruntled members of the Tanzania community bent on furthering their personal and political ends.
2_2	0.21542658	The press release accused the Amnesty International of portraying a negative image of Tanzania as a hostile country to refugees while internationally omitting the great care it has always undertaken to uphold conventions governing the accommodation of refugees.
2_3	0.25101884	On the allegation that there were acts of human rights violations in Zanzibar, the release deplored the organization's report for relying only on complaints made by the opposition party in Zanzibar without carrying any considerations or views of the government and the ruling party.
2_4	0.22689346	In conclusion, the press release of the Tanzanian Foreign Ministry said the Amnesty International report seriously lacks probity and in-depth scientific research, an absolute essential for the credibility of any presentation on social work.
3_0	0.2711217	NAIROBI, March 14 (Xinhua) --The Rwandan government has expressed deep outrage about Amnesty International's continued campaign aimed at tarnishing the image of the country.
3_1	0.25350672	The Rwandan government said that the London-based international human rights watchdog is siding with "genocidal" forces sowing terror in parts of the northwest of the country.
3_2	0.099656938	In issuing slanderous and baseless allegations that the Rwandan army has massacred hundreds of unarmed civilians, Amnesty International "is serving the interests of those who decimated up to one million people in 1994," the army spokesman Emmanuel Ndahiro told Rwanda News Agency (RNA) Saturday.
3_3	0.14582126	Amnesty International released a press statement on Friday in which it accused the army of killing several hundreds of civilians for the January-February period.
3_4	0.16517024	Reports published by Amnesty International since the Rwandan Patriotic Front took over power in 1994, have always been characterized by bias and tendentious allegations which throw doubt on its commitment to the defense of human rights.
3_5	0.19338751	"Amnesty seems to be another hand of the insurgency and therefore is pushing the arguments and the agenda of the criminals who are continuing the genocide," Ndahiro observed, accusing Amnesty International of being the mouthpiece of Hutu hardliners.
3_6	0.10577334	For Rwandan authorities, it is no surprise that Amnesty International is making up new reports shortly before the visit by the U.S.
3_7	0.081337086	President Bill Clinton later this month.
3_8	0.17946271	"Amnesty International is part of international lobbies championing the cause, if any, of diehard Hutu extremists," Ndahiro alleged.
3_9	0.14700763	"It is totally unacceptable that at a time some people are trying to associate with Rwandans in the process of recovery from the aftermath of the genocide, Amnesty International is busy mud-slinging the Rwandan government," he noted.
4_0	0.37893906	MOSCOW (AP) _ Serious human rights violations persist in Russia despite President Boris Yeltsin's declaration of 1998 as Russia's Year of Human Rights, Amnesty International said Monday.
4_1	0.005019887	Derek G.
4_2	0.16477149	Evans, deputy secretary general of the human rights group, said in a statement that torture of prisoners continues, the death penalty has not been abolished and there is still no alternative military service for conscientious objectors.
4_3	0.076304838	``Amnesty International remains seriously concerned at the deep gap emerging between the president's declared intentions and the practical measures being put in place,'' Evans said after meeting with Russian media.
4_4	0.022516661	Although Russia promised to abolish capital punishment when it joined the Council of Europe in 1996, Justice Minister Pavel Krashennikov said last week it would be premature to do away with the death penalty.
4_5	0.074908041	Evans said the Russian government was keeping the death penalty because it did not want the expense of providing for life imprisonment for about 1,000 people.
4_6	0.094390961	``In other words, it is cheaper to kill,'' he said.
4_7	0.12345612	Another concern for Amnesty International is conscientious objection to military service.
4_8	0.047110058	``While the Russian Federation's Constitution guarantees this right, no legislation has been enacted to create an alternative civilian service of non-punitive length,'' Evans said.
4_9	0.096843019	He also said that civilian prisoners in pre-trial detention were kept in conditions ``so severe as to constitute torture''.
4_10	0.20749087	Evans said Amnesty International has provided the government with a preliminary analysis of the human rights situation in Russia and some 51 proposals for meeting international standards. (jai/mr)
5_0	0.16001895	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A leader of Brazil's landless movement, sentenced to 26 years for his part in two killings, did not receive a fair trial, Amnesty International said Tuesday.
5_1	0.12124464	The human rights group called for an impartial retrial of Jose Rainha Jr.
5_2	0.11054494	, one of the leaders of the Landless Rural Workers Movement and said he was a potential prisoner of conscience, in a report that was to be issued Wednesday.
5_3	0.088192285	Amnesty International uses the term ``prisoner of conscience,'' for people punished for their ideals rather than for criminal acts.
5_4	0.037882483	Rainha was found guilty last November of participating in the 1989 killings of a farmer and police officer that occurred when movement members stormed a farm in Pedro Canario 370 miles (600 kms) northeast of Rio de Janeiro.
5_5	0.088493724	He was sentenced to 26 years in prison.
5_6	0.05567747	The landless movement promotes the takeover of land it considers unproductive as a way to pressure the government into speeding up its agrarian reform program.
5_7	0.12759975	Amnesty Internation's report was to call for stepped-up pressure up against police violence and maintains that human rights violations continue against Indians and the landless, Fiona Macaulay, the organization's Brazilian researcher, said by telephone from London.
5_8	0.13440114	The report, however, praised the government for creating a National Human Rights Secretary.
5_9	0.088876049	It also backed moves to protect crime witnesses and reform the country's police and criminal justice system.
5_10	0.053175722	Rainha remains free pending a retrial, which Brazilian law grants anyone sentenced to more than 20 years for a single crime.
5_11	0.11152067	Rainha is due to be retried later this year in Vitoria, the capital of Espirito Santo, a move that Amnesty International has backed.
5_12	0.11826688	Amnesty International has said in the past that there is ``compelling evidence'' that Rainha was falsely convicted of the killings.
5_13	0.085832657	At the first trial, defense lawyers argued that 14 members of the 21-member jury pool had links with local farmers, and three were related to one of the shooting victims.
5_14	0.092941732	``His trial did not meet international standards of impartiality.
5_15	0.095238926	If he is jailed under the same circumstances at his retrial we will consider him a prisoner of conscience,'' Macaulay said Tuesday.
6_0	0.15907846	ANKARA, June 24 (Xinhua) --Amnesty International's 1996 annual report on human rights is flawed and one-sided, a statement issued by Turkey's Foreign Ministry said here today.
6_1	0.22131949	The statement said that Turkey is surprised and disappointed to find itself again the target for unfair accusations by Amnesty International, adding that the Amnesty International's annual report gives a distorted and defective picture of the human rights situation in Turkey in 1995.
6_2	0.047237224	The report fails to take adequate account of changes in Turkey during 1995 and simply repeats allegations it made in previous years.
6_3	0.10213129	It makes no mention of the constitutional and all legal reforms that Turkey carried out last year in a bid to enhance human rights, the statement noted.
6_4	0.089534312	It added that Amnesty has again brushed aside the fact that Turkey has a functioning parliamentary democracy and terrorists are trying to undermine it by force.
6_5	0.088805043	Amnesty plays down terrorist violence but exaggerates alleged abuses by the forces of law and order, said the statement.
6_6	0.09604691	Amnesty fails to make it sufficiently clear that violence can never be a legitimate instrument in the pursuit of human rights.
6_7	0.089489992	Indeed, some people reading this report could get the impression that Amnesty believes violence can be a legitimate instrument, the statement said.
7_0	0.23370073	KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Amnesty International called on Rwanda Monday to reinstate the U.N. human rights mission it suspended in May because of a disagreement over the agency's operations in the country.
