0_1	0.10339487	He was speaking on Wednesday at both the Kenyan International Conference Center and the Kenya Science Teachers College during a workshop of the stakeholders in the small-scale enterprises.
0_2	0.10790242	The president wondered why government officers serving in the police force were never regarded as victims of human rights violation whenever they were murdered or injured during their course of duty.
0_3	0.099812281	The Kenyan Head of State pointed out that Amnesty International treated police officers as if they were not part of mankind.
0_4	0.095050794	He wondered what standards were used to define human rights in Africa as children carried guns in certain countries while mass killings occurred in others yet no human rights action appear to deter the trend.
0_5	0.12315379	President Moi pointed out that Kenya's human rights record was far much better than the grim picture the Amnesty International were trying to paint and urged the organization to be more serious in its work.
0_6	0.14133216	He said that Kenyans did not require people like Pierre Sane, Secretary General of the Amnesty International, to lecture them on how to conduct their affairs.
0_7	0.11584947	At a press conference held yesterday following a 12-day fact-finding mission in Kenya, Sane accused the Kenyan government of alleged human rights violations and police torture of suspects in the east African country.

1_2	0.12593053	Evans, deputy secretary general of the human rights group, said in a statement that torture of prisoners continues, the death penalty has not been abolished and there is still no alternative military service for conscientious objectors.
1_3	0.090258947	``Amnesty International remains seriously concerned at the deep gap emerging between the president's declared intentions and the practical measures being put in place,'' Evans said after meeting with Russian media.
1_4	0.08930998	Although Russia promised to abolish capital punishment when it joined the Council of Europe in 1996, Justice Minister Pavel Krashennikov said last week it would be premature to do away with the death penalty.
1_5	0.087429513	Evans said the Russian government was keeping the death penalty because it did not want the expense of providing for life imprisonment for about 1,000 people.
1_6	0.075876984	``In other words, it is cheaper to kill,'' he said.
1_7	0.12269067	Another concern for Amnesty International is conscientious objection to military service.

2_0	0.20724058	BONN, July 3 (Xinhua) --The human rights watchdog Amnesty International accused German police of racism in a report issued here today, repeating a similar charge in 1995.
2_1	0.081256175	According to Michael Butler, Amnesty's investigator responsible for Germany, evidence collected since 1995, which listed 40 cases involving police violence against non-Germans or German nationals of foreign extraction, showed that police racism was part of a pattern.
2_2	0.07864666	Butler also accused prosecutors of being dilatory over claims of police violence and the courts of being partial to police in dealing with such cases.
2_3	0.084614565	Amnesty demanded that the states establish independent complaints boards and compile annual statistics of such complaints.
2_4	0.089653045	The Amnesty report was immediately challenged by the interior ministers of Germany's 16 states, who denied the police were racist as a whole and noted that the misdeeds of individual policemen were objectively and thoroughly investigated by prosecutors and the courts.

3_0	0.12645225	ANKARA, June 24 (Xinhua) --Amnesty International's 1996 annual report on human rights is flawed and one-sided, a statement issued by Turkey's Foreign Ministry said here today.
3_1	0.16478311	The statement said that Turkey is surprised and disappointed to find itself again the target for unfair accusations by Amnesty International, adding that the Amnesty International's annual report gives a distorted and defective picture of the human rights situation in Turkey in 1995.
3_2	0.090036238	The report fails to take adequate account of changes in Turkey during 1995 and simply repeats allegations it made in previous years.

3_4	0.085106331	It added that Amnesty has again brushed aside the fact that Turkey has a functioning parliamentary democracy and terrorists are trying to undermine it by force.
3_5	0.093536142	Amnesty plays down terrorist violence but exaggerates alleged abuses by the forces of law and order, said the statement.
3_6	0.094796242	Amnesty fails to make it sufficiently clear that violence can never be a legitimate instrument in the pursuit of human rights.

4_4	0.10112088	He demanded that both Israel and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) ban policies that violate human rights.
4_5	0.08311062	Israel must ban the use of torture against all the detainees and revise open-fire guidelines established by the military, he said, adding that administrative detention must also be stopped and the Israeli authorities must ensure that the trials are fair.
4_6	0.091224139	Meanwhile, Sane demanded that the PNA halt methods of torture and put an end to arbitrary political arrests in the autonomous areas.
4_7	0.085263816	In addition, he made a request that the PNA stop unfair trials and abolish death penalty.

6_0	0.19306693	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Amnesty International denounced the human rights climate in Cambodia as campaigning for parliamentary elections drew to a close Friday and urged the international community to wake up to intimidation and violence against the opposition.
6_1	0.11196933	Demelza Stobbings of the London-based human rights group said that political killings and threats have soared since Cambodian strongman Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier in a coup a year ago, but that on an international level ``many people are not prepared to say what is happening here''.

6_4	0.10518525	``Much of the international community plays down the level of violence, sanitizes the trauma of victims and ignores the impact of human rights violence on freedom of association and expression,'' the statement said.
6_5	0.090690376	Hun Sen has called the elections to try to win back legitimacy and aid lost after his violent takeover, but has been accused by his critics of rigging the electoral machinery in his favor and using fear, murder and intimidation to ensure his Cambodian People's Party wins.

7_0	0.14176486	ISLAMABAD, October 3 (Xinhua) --The Afghan Taliban Militia today criticized Amnesty International for interfering in Afghanistan's internal affairs, said a report coming from Kabul.
7_1	0.081349702	The report quoted Amir Khan Muttaqi, minister of Information and Culture of the Taliban interim government in Kabul, as saying, "When the world says the Taliban shouldn't chop off hands of thieves, sentence murderers to death, and stone adulterers, it is interference in our internal affairs".
7_2	0.091637981	Muttaqi's comments followed a statement issued in London by Amnesty International that hundreds of Afghan people who sympathized with the ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani were at risk of torture, ill-treatment or worse.

9_1	0.23626733	The Rwandan government said that the London-based international human rights watchdog is siding with "genocidal" forces sowing terror in parts of the northwest of the country.
9_2	0.087536071	In issuing slanderous and baseless allegations that the Rwandan army has massacred hundreds of unarmed civilians, Amnesty International "is serving the interests of those who decimated up to one million people in 1994," the army spokesman Emmanuel Ndahiro told Rwanda News Agency (RNA) Saturday.

9_4	0.10846001	Reports published by Amnesty International since the Rwandan Patriotic Front took over power in 1994, have always been characterized by bias and tendentious allegations which throw doubt on its commitment to the defense of human rights.

20_0	0.1537968	(by Wang Jinyu) NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) --The Kenyan government last night criticized Amnesty International (AI) for its "presumptuous" report "calculated to incite Kenyans against their government".
20_1	0.13321941	In a press release issued here on Wednesday following a 12-day fact-finding mission in Kenya, the AI accused the government of violations of human rights and of dragging its feet on legal and constitutional reforms.
20_2	0.099280607	In a strongly worded rejoinder last evening to the AI statement, the Kenyan government told the visiting AI Secretary-General Pierre Sane that it would not tolerate prescriptions from AI on how to deal with alleged violations of human rights.

20_4	0.10073456	The rejoinder said that the AI obsession with the torture and human rights violations in Kenya were not genuine but were political in support of opposition political activities.
20_5	0.099369344	It pointed out that some cases of torture and human rights violations had always been individualized and the government had already taken actions against the perpetrators of such crimes.
20_6	0.091751075	"If Amnesty wanted to be fair and objective, it should have recognized the positive steps that the government has taken to deal with law enforcement officers who have gone overboard in the execution of their duties".
