3_3	0.08676837	Scott Mowbray, the managing editor of Joe, said that his editorial goal was to replicate the ideas and the conversation one encounters in a coffeehouse.

5_0	0.16305802	A recent deal between Starbucks and the urban delivery specialist Kozmo.com _in which Starbucks will essentially set aside space in its coffee shops for Kozmo _ may be the first example of an established retailer offering its floor space and personnel to an e-commerce company.
5_1	0.089742543	But it is unlikely to be the last.
5_2	0.10632668	Industry executives and analysts predict that such agreements will come rapidly in the next few months, as Internet retailers struggle to address two of their most glaring vulnerabilities _ customer acquisition costs and returns _while continuing to close the gap between virtual and traditional stores.
5_3	0.091370549	The agreements will take many forms.
5_4	0.098703802	The convenience-store chain 7-Eleven, for instance, plans to install Internet-ready ATMs, which might eventually let customers order goods from Web retailers and have them delivered to the store.
5_5	0.090922697	And in such arrangements, customers might also be able to return Internet goods to the stores.
5_6	0.05509828	Package handling companies like Mail Boxes Etc.
5_7	0.093538411	are already starting to handle returns and exchanges on behalf of Internet retailers.
5_8	0.076751872	Other national chains, like drugstores and gas station convenience marts, might also add such services as a side business.
5_9	0.062558634	Indeed, any retailer with a national presence and a strong distribution and warehousing system is a prime candidate to join with e-commerce sites, analysts predict.
5_10	0.069803059	Customers who enjoy the convenience of the Web might also prefer knowing that if anything goes wrong with a purchase, they can find a real person at a real store to make it better.
5_11	0.05452747	``The need for this is huge,'' said Tim Washer, director of interactive research with NFO Interactive, a market research company.
5_12	0.095361139	``What it's about is reducing the risk of shopping online.
5_13	0.09031412	Offering a retail presence will really facilitate that''.
5_14	0.09040067	Kozmo executives stressed those points in announcing the deal this month.
5_15	0.072514209	``We'll be able to ride on Starbucks' coattails, and give our customers an incredible sense of confidence,'' said Joseph Park, chief executive of Kozmo, which offers free one-hour delivery of goods purchased on its Internet site.
5_16	0.10045575	Kozmo, which operates only in Boston, New York, Washington, Seattle and San Francisco so far, specializes in delivering videos, books, food and convenience goods.
5_17	0.13342168	Under the deal, Kozmo will pay Starbucks $150 million over five years for the right to place return boxes in Starbucks stores.
5_18	0.03154902	The boxes will initially be used for rental videos, games and DVDs, but will eventually be available for other products, as well, like disposable cameras ready for processing or defective items being returned for a refund.
5_19	0.088879683	In addition, Starbucks will promote Kozmo and train its sales staff to answer questions about the Internet company.
5_20	0.08890219	Kozmo, in turn, will deliver Starbucks coffees and teas by the pound _ and eventually perhaps hot beverages, too.
5_21	0.046125684	The partnership, which is to include joint marketing, will immediately raise Kozmo's credibility with consumers, predicted Chris Vroom, e-commerce analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
5_22	0.091654025	And it will also give Kozmo an efficient way to reach new customers, he said.
5_23	0.067592782	Vroom said Internet retailers typically spent about $100 to acquire each customer _ an exorbitant amount, because the average customer will spend only about $200 at a given site in a lifetime.
5_24	0.11654768	A $30 million annual outlay to Starbucks will swell Kozmo's customer acquisition costs in the short term, he said, but in the long term it could pay off, given Starbucks' huge clientele.
5_25	0.069987275	``Starbucks can put a Kozmo logo on coffee cups that 10 million customers a week will buy,'' Vroom said.
5_26	0.099723528	``That's a powerful thing''.
5_27	0.063789309	Perhaps more powerful is the ability of such partnerships to provide e-commerce customers an easy way to return goods _ not simply rental items, but, more important, goods deemed unsatisfactory by the customers.
5_28	0.056116381	Internet merchants have been widely criticized for their failures in this regard, particularly as return rates have reached roughly 30 percent _ a rate slightly higher than in the catalog industry.
5_29	0.068776022	nn Retailers with stores online and offline, like Gap and Federated's Macy's, have had an edge at least in part because their customers can return goods to a store whether they were bought online or off.
5_30	0.10377173	And though e-commerce companies are loath to open up stores for this reason alone, they are clearly in the market for help from companies that can help streamline returns.
5_31	0.078438028	``As I speak, there are four or five people from e-commerce companies in this building talking to us about it,'' said James Amos, chief executive of Mail Boxes Etc.
5_32	0.093795598	, speaking from his office in San Diego.
5_33	0.085305642	Amos estimated that 300 other companies had asked Mail Boxes ``for access to our 4,000 stores'' in the last several months.

10_5	0.12210416	Instead, Seattle's Starbucks, a brick-and-mortar retailer, proposed buying Williams-Sonoma, a brick-and-mortar retailer, as an Internet play _ an opportunity for Starbucks to hitch a ride on Williams-Sonoma's e-commerce business.

10_18	0.077909516	At the center of his strategy is a lifestyle portal and cable television franchise that will feature information, entertainment and e-shopping for upscale women.
10_19	0.10001602	Two weeks ago, Starbucks agreed to partner with Oxygen Media of New York, which is designing such a portal.
10_20	0.13111954	Details are sketchy, but Schultz said in a statement, ``We'll be able to provide a seamless customer experience through our retail stores, cable and the Internet''.

10_42	0.088074424	One reason it was considered a desirable takeover candidate is that its stock is priced more like that of a modest store and catalog merchant than a hot e-commerce play.

13_5	0.10931695	In the suit, led by Pasqua co-founder Mark Zuckerman, eight shareholders argue that the company's market value was much higher.
13_6	0.067733463	The plaintiffs together owned less than 10 percent of Pasqua's stock.
13_7	0.061662753	They are accusing Bankers Trust, which owned 45 percent and, they say, effectively controlled the board, of breaching its fiduciary duty by not considering bids from Starbucks' rivals.

13_11	0.076014923	Ostroff noted that the court denied a request by the investor group earlier this year to stop the merger.
13_12	0.095115446	But the court allowed the plaintiffs to seek an outside appraisal to ensure that they received fair-market value for their shares.

21_2	0.14815183	The San Francisco kitchen and housewares merchant, which owns the Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn stores and catalogs, spurned a takeover offer in an emergency board meeting earlier this month, according to sources close to the retailer.
21_3	0.094242217	Company Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHoward Lester declined yesterday to discuss the situation, saying, ``Nothing is going on now.
21_4	0.093448165	From time to time, people have discussions, but we don't comment on those''.
21_5	0.095450347	Williams-Sonoma is considered a ripe takeover target.
21_6	0.096755374	It is a well-run company with a bright future on the Web and a relatively low valuation, said industry analysts.
21_7	0.088376935	With its stock trading at about $29, the company's current market capitalization is $1.62 billion.
21_8	0.068201552	Bonnie Kramer Tonneson, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, values it at closer to $3 billion, or $41 per share.
21_9	0.14689082	Surprisingly, several sources named Starbucks Corp.
21_10	0.096641889	, the Seattle coffee giant, as the likely suitor.
21_11	0.10149912	A Starbucks spokesman declined to comment.
21_12	0.070656559	Although Starbucks and Williams-Sonoma seem an odd match at first blush, it makes sense when their Internet strategies are factored in, said analysts and other observers.
21_13	0.081696271	Just last week, Starbucks announced a partnership with Oxygen Media to develop a lifestyle-oriented portal and cable television business targeting upscale women.
21_14	0.059665901	Williams-Sonoma, which has just begun rolling out a series of cyber gift registries and online stores, would be the perfect e-commerce addition, observers said.
21_15	0.076523462	``The Starbucks customer is 55 percent women, well educated, over $75,000 median income, and over 70 percent of them use the Net,'' said Tonneson.
21_16	0.079452225	``It's the same people who shop at Williams-Sonoma and the ideal demographic for patronizing cooking and epicureal type stuff on the Web,'' Tonneson said.
21_17	0.1333624	In addition, Williams-Sonoma's larger stores would be good locales for small Starbucks coffee bars, observers said.
21_18	0.082837121	Williams-Sonoma is a particularly attractive Web partner because of its strong stable of brand names, including Hold Everything and Chambers; its decades of direct-to-consumer experience; and its technological infrastructure, which includes a strong Web operation and a large, sophisticated distribution center.
21_19	0.081483274	In addition, Williams-Sonoma's valuable customer database of 20 million names, addresses and buying histories will be an even more powerful tool when the company is able to mesh the list with e-mail addresses, said an industry analyst who declined to be identified by name.

21_22	0.081211469	Last Wednesday, just three days after the weekend board meeting at which Williams-Sonoma's directors voted to remain independent, the retailer announced that it is talking to CondeNet, an affiliate of Conde Nast magazines, about joining a CondeNet-Time Warner cable and Web business targeting high-income women.
21_23	0.081920033	Williams-Sonoma has already arranged to start selling kitchen wares over CondeNet's Epicurious.com site.
