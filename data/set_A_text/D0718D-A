0_0	0.12080185	SEATTLE _ While maps looking like they came from a Pentagon situation room flashed on a huge screen behind him, Starbucks Corp.
0_1	0.17090949	Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz stood before a happy house of shareholders Tuesday and touted the progress in bringing the company's brand of coffeehouse culture to the rest of the planet.
0_2	0.075910329	``We are building a truly enduring global brand,'' said Schultz.
0_3	0.10255881	Starbucks' global juggernaut is on track with plans this year to open 500 stores around the world, Schultz said to an annual meeting filled with people rejoicing over Monday's announcement of a 2-for-1 split of its shares of common stock.
0_4	0.078989562	The split will be in the form of a stock dividend payable on March 19 for shareholders of record on March 5.
0_5	0.12666712	Starbucks closed yesterday at $52.375, up $2.50.
0_6	0.11616892	The company already has 100 stores in Pacific Rim countries such as Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and New Zealand, with plans to have 500 stores in the Pacific Rim by 2003.

0_9	0.12011072	The company's expansion program continues in the United States as well.
0_10	0.075473517	At year end, the company owned 1,688 stores in 32 states, the District of Columbia, four Canadian provinces and the U.K.
0_11	0.082042589	It is projected to have 2,336 stores by the end of 1999.
0_12	0.090038315	The aggressive expansion program is fueling the company's steady growth in revenues and earnings with about 84 percent of net revenues coming from the retail stores.
0_13	0.093697166	Net revenues rose from $975.4 million in fiscal 1997 to $1.3 billion in fiscal 1998, ``due primarily to the company's store expansion program and comparable store sales increases,'' according to the annual report.
0_14	0.12074976	The report goes on to note that the company ``has experienced a certain level of cannibalization of existing stores by new stores as the store concentration has increased''.
0_15	0.088255141	But operating margins have grown or maintained a steady pace since 1994 with the exception of 1996 when a South America freeze cause coffee prices to spike.
0_16	0.081653461	The margin for 1998 was unchanged from 1997 at 8.8 percent.
0_17	0.095737681	Schultz took a shot at those who might think that Starbucks can't sustain such growth over the long term.
0_18	0.13408066	``The cynics will say that Starbucks has 2,000 stores and we're nearing saturation,'' said Schultz.
0_19	-0.0046102546	``We are not''.

0_21	0.011366803	Davidson &AMP; Co.
0_22	0.074347781	in Portland, agreed.
0_23	0.083752507	``There are probably selected markets where you have an abundance of coffee vendors,'' he said.
0_24	0.074660278	``But overall, for most of the country, you are a probably quite a ways from saturation.
0_25	0.078255887	The evidence of that is the continued growth in same store sales (open at least a year).
0_26	0.085551619	Stores that have been there for a long time are still putting up very good numbers, they are still growing''.
0_27	0.11596811	Schultz noted that the company enjoys the highest degree of frequency of any retail store in America with the average customer coming in 18 times a month.
0_28	0.15554156	The company has big plans to continue leveraging that loyalty to its brand built so carefully at the retail coffee shops.
0_29	0.10905369	Starbucks has tapped the Pepsi-Cola Co.'s ``ubiquitous distribution power'' to sell its Frappuccino blended coffee beverage which leads the ready-to-drink coffee category, said Schultz.
0_30	0.09845507	The CEO's prediction for revenues from Frappuccino: ``We believe Frappuccino will be bigger than Starbucks is today''.
0_31	0.15945966	And at the end of the fourth quarter, Starbucks joined Kraft Foods, Inc.
0_32	0.088285214	in a licensing agreement to distribute, market and sell its beans at supermarkets around the nation.
0_33	0.16890436	``We have less than 5 percent of the overall coffee market in America,'' said Schultz.
0_34	0.13035889	``We are going to have much, much more than a 5 percent share of the coffee market in America, I promise you''.
0_35	0.12120592	Schultz, in paying tribute to Howard Behar, who has been overseeing the company's expansion overseas and plans to retire this year, said Behar has been at the heart of Starbucks corporate culture.
0_36	0.08781222	It is a culture, said Schultz, that puts a premium on nurturing relationships with both employees and the communities in which it operates.
0_37	0.11057629	Of the overseas expansion, Behar said: ``Starbucks set out to be a bridge among peoples and among cultures, not to sell more coffee.''

1_2	0.044011732	Don't look for that to change anytime soon.
1_3	0.13048323	That's because while Starbucks Coffee, maker of the big-named bean juices like those, is adding 500 stores this year, most are planned for big cities.
1_4	0.15164942	On Tuesday, Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz stood before a happy house of shareholders in Seattle and touted the company's progress in bringing its coffeehouse culture to the rest of the planet.
1_5	0.099984983	The company has 2,000 stores worldwide, including 106 stores in Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston.
1_6	0.068749035	Not even El Paso has made the cut.
1_7	0.095034386	In downtown Austin, where you can hardly hurl a stone without hitting a Starbucks or some other java joint _ in some circles the capital city has rapidly become the cappuccino city _ Starbucks is opening at least one new store this year in mid-March at 24th and Nueces streets just west of the University of Texas campus.
1_8	0.098925124	The Seattle-based company has opened nine Austin locations since coming to town four years ago.
1_9	0.12206414	When determining where to place a new Starbucks, the company looks at a number of demographic factors, including average age, average income and whether a city's residents have been ordering coffee from the company's catalog.
1_10	0.094069761	While Starbucks may never make it to the Panhandle or the small towns of East Texas, its presence still may be felt there.

2_1	0.15850923	has purchased Hear Music, an upscale music retailer that until recently was based in San Francisco, for under $10 million.
2_2	0.15524334	Starbucks has sold jazz CDs in its coffee shops for several years and considers music an important part of how customers experience its brand, said Bonnie Kramer Tonneson, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
2_3	0.094847378	``This is a minor acquisition (for Starbucks), but it is a first step toward fortifying the whole in-store and online experience,'' said Tonneson.
2_4	0.12264469	The deal closed in mid-October and Hear's staff has already moved to Starbucks' offices in Seattle, said Don MacKinnon, Hear's former chief executive, in a telephone interview yesterday.
2_5	0.10543706	MacKinnon's new title is vice president, music and entertainment, for Starbucks.
2_6	0.085636119	Hear Music stores are unusual in that they focus on educating shoppers about music and introducing them to new artists.

2_8	0.075303155	&UR; &LR; MacKinnon told The Chronicle in September that he intended to roll out 75 to 100 Hear Music stores across the country.
2_9	0.085584005	But yesterday, he said plans for new non-Starbucks locations are on hold, although the five existing locations _ in Berkeley, San Francisco, Palo Alto, Santa Monica and Chicago _ will remain open.
2_10	0.09370424	Partnering with Starbucks was Hear's best option for going national, MacKinnon said.
2_11	0.089887145	It's the best place to find Hear's upscale customer ``in the right mood, in great numbers and at a time when they sort of taking a pause in their day''.
2_12	0.10271023	Starbucks did not release terms of the deal other than to say that it spent less than $10 million.
2_13	0.14549438	In a conference call with analysts Thursday, Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz disclosed plans to install listening stations in some Starbucks cafes, according to Andrew Barish, an analyst with Robertson Stephens.
2_14	0.09140069	The kiosks will likely connect to a Hear Music Intranet that contains music reviews and recommendations.
2_15	0.127625	The Intranet is currently &LR; used in a new Hear prototype store in San Francisco's Metreon shopping center.
2_16	0.070109405	MacKinnon said no decision has been made about how many stores will include kiosks.
2_17	0.074145215	``There will be different solutions in different stores,'' he said.
2_18	0.10456199	Yesterday, 800 of Starbucks' 2,500 stores installed fixtures holding branded Starbucks CDs, plus other selections chosen by the Hear team, such as the popular Buena Vista Social Club.
2_19	0.10122266	In the future, MacKinnon and his staff will produce all of Starbucks' CDs.
2_20	0.11662022	Music accounts for less than 1 percent of total Starbucks sales, Tonneson said.

2_22	0.1062149	Starbucks is also promoting links with two other new Web partners, Cooking.com and Geerlings &AMP; Wade, a mail-order wine retailer.
2_23	0.13824576	This summer, Starbucks announced an ambitious strategy of creating a ``lifestyle portal'' of upscale brands on the Web.
2_24	0.085728031	It formed partnerships with several Web content providers and attempted to buy Williams-Sonoma Inc.
2_25	0.056445912	, which spurned the offer.
2_26	0.10754956	But investors frowned on that strategy, sending Starbucks' stock plummeting.
2_27	0.12105251	Since then, Starbucks has scaled back those plans.
2_28	0.090235581	``Instead of an all-consuming focus for Howard Schultz it's more of a sidebar,'' Tonneson said.
2_29	0.082495065	Hear Music, which was privately held, generated revenues of between $5 million and $10 million in 1998.

6_1	0.093943958	The sweet aroma of opportunity wafted through the tea business Tuesday as it absorbed the stunning news that Seattle's gigantic java retailer plans to purchase the highly respected, quirky tea maker Tazo, of Portland, Ore.
6_2	0.043840299	, for an undisclosed amount of cash.
6_3	0.11795409	``The significance of this marriage is gigantic for the world of specialty tea,'' said Joe Simerini, president of the Tea Association, a New York-based trade group.
6_4	0.15973233	``What it pretty much tells you is Starbucks has made up their mind that they want to be in the world of the specialty tea business, and they want to be in it in a big way''.
6_5	0.15238483	Starbucks remained largely mum on its plans this week, saying only that it planned to develop new products under the Tazo name and possibly create a new retail format around the brand.
6_6	0.058479795	In the universe of tea brewing, that's practically cause for celebration.
6_7	0.073960396	U.S. tea makers have spent most of the 1990s watching themselves get almost totally eclipsed by their highly caffeinated brethren.
6_8	0.073502979	While Americans slowly clued in to the joys of herbal infusions and the fine nuances of specialty tea blends, they embraced espresso drinks with an enthusiasm that left the quietly prospering tea market looking like an also-ran.
6_9	0.081357163	Tazo was born five years ago in the midst of America's blossoming love affair with lattes.
6_10	0.079901897	Founder Steven Smith, formerly of Portland-based Stash Teas, drew on years of experience in the industry to create a line of high-quality, high-priced products that stood out both for their funky marketing (names like Awake and Om) and distinct flavors.
6_11	0.083300873	``We initially thought we needed to change the way people perceived tea,'' Smith said in a telephone interview Monday afternoon.
6_12	0.0646087	``We bet on the fact that the tea category was not price sensitive.
6_13	0.078129997	We thought if we made better products, people would buy them''.
6_14	0.10017586	The brand quickly became one of the major players in the specialty tea market, which the Tea Association describes as one that emphasizes the quality and integrity of the ingredients.
6_15	0.10065331	Other specialty tea makers, according to the association, include Bigelow, Twinings and the Republic of Tea.
6_16	0.08347086	Of an overall annual tea market of $4.5 billion, specialty tea sales accounted for about $500 million last year, Simrany said.
6_17	0.064195238	That's double the figures of a decade ago, he said.
6_18	0.12893868	Starbucks alone reported $1.1 billion in retail sales for fiscal 1998.
6_19	0.1645685	Tea sales made up only 1 percent of that total, chief executive Howard Schultz said.
6_20	0.092527544	Tazo's impending sale to Starbucks - the deal is set to close at the end of this month - catapults the niche tea maker into the realms of such household names as Lipton and Celestial Seasonings, said Brian Keating, owner of the Teacup, a retail teahouse and shop on Queen Anne Hill and publisher of ``U.S.
6_21	0.08154249	Tea Is `Hot,''' an annual report on the tea industry.
6_22	0.1167868	The partnership also gives Starbucks the foothold it has sought for years in the specialty tea market, he said.
6_23	0.093127459	``Starbucks has been floundering,'' Keating said, testing out a slew of items from chai tea to the iced blended drink Tiazzi this summer to various takes on its in-house hot tea brand called Infusia, all to mixed results.
6_24	0.079719965	Tazo gives the company a proven brand with a built-in cache.
6_25	0.08884328	``From a business analysis standpoint, I couldn't think of a better marriage,'' Keating said of the Starbucks-Tazo deal.
6_26	0.078941352	``It was like two people you wanted to introduce and never thought about introducing them to each other''.
6_27	0.087358	Wendy Rasmussen, executive director of the Long Beach, Calif.-based American Premium Tea Institute, was a bit more skeptical.
6_28	0.084000436	``I look on this purchase and it's absolutely fabulous news for my industry or it's really sad news,'' she said.
6_29	0.067750105	``It's not one of those gray things.
6_30	0.10807217	``Starbucks is going to take a mover and a shaker in my industry and either really, finally do something with tea - or Tazo's going to become this dusty, back-of-the-shelf product in Starbucks stores, and that's going to be a shame''.
6_31	0.10584231	Still, the impetus for Starbucks to take the Tazo purchase seriously must be pretty strong, given recent trends in the specialty coffee business, Rasmussen said.
6_32	0.086413199	At last year's Specialty Coffee Association trade show, for instance, Rasmussen noted, at least 50 percent of the vendors devoted half their exhibit space to tea products.
6_33	0.08322817	``I think people have reached their limit with coffee in terms of their experience with it,'' she said.
6_34	0.059226989	``It's `What's the next thing'?

7_5	0.083972728	Starting this spring, the service also will deliver Starbucks by the pound.
7_6	0.062337191	For Kozmo, it gives the burgeoning company much-needed exposure.
7_7	0.069264574	So what does the seemingly ubiquitous coffee roaster get out of it?
7_8	0.090996116	How about $150 million over five years.
7_9	0.15476315	``This all speaks to what most Internet companies are facing, and that's the high cost of customer acquisition,'' said Howard Schultz, Starbucks' chairman and chief executive.
7_10	0.098604524	The Internet-to-door delivery service, which was started in 1997, operates in five markets but plans to expand to 20 by the end of this year.

7_12	0.21238515	The company plans to launch in Los Angeles in the coming weeks.
7_13	0.14742301	Schultz said he has been approached by other companies wanting to establish a partnership with Starbucks.

7_16	0.064100976	``It's very clear Kozmo has resonated with their customers''.
7_17	0.088459521	Internet watchers, however, have questioned the economics of spending the high cost of delivering primarily small ticket items.
7_18	0.084064121	Joseph Park, Kozmo's chief executive, said his business model hinges on ``order density,'' or getting a large number of customers to use the service regularly.
7_19	0.08992674	``We're a lifestyle brand and we're looking for other products or service our customers would want to use or purchase on a frequent basis,'' he said.

8_8	0.0829576	To many investors, the earnings disappointment and the Internet announcement both suggested that a phenomenally successful company was losing its focus.
8_9	0.10053463	``They are trying to stretch who they are as a company into an area where they really don't have any expertise,'' said John Ivankoe, an analyst at Schroder &AMP; Co.
8_10	0.10747524	The chairman and chief executive of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, who once defied skeptics who said that the country did not need more fancy coffee shops, promised to do the same with Internet strategy, with legions of customers like Siess following Starbucks into cyberspace.
8_11	0.12403557	Schultz told analysts and investors in a conference call late Wednesday that the company would create the ``premier lifestyle portal on the Internet,'' saying that the Starbucks Web site would offer ``a feeling of romance, of relaxation'' similar to what he said a customer might experience in a coffee shop.
8_12	0.091351311	He denied that Starbucks was losing its focus, telling the analysts that the coffee-shop business ``is and always will be the driver of what we do''.

8_15	0.084829088	Last year, the company earned 44 cents a share.
8_16	0.10410401	The problem, Starbucks said, is not that profit from coffee shops is falling.

8_25	0.11886557	Once viewers come to the home page of the site, they will be led to other pages selling not only Starbucks coffee but gourmet food, kitchenware, home furnishings and furniture.
8_26	0.080465686	Many of these sites would be managed by retailers that already sell such goods and would retain their brand names.
8_27	0.14618481	He also said the company would announce a major strategic partnership this summer to pursue the Web business.
8_28	0.14178219	Starbucks will also consider acquisitions and investments in other companies that provide some of the products to be sold on the Web site.

8_30	0.090516563	Schultz said the key to Starbucks' success would be its ability to attract Web customers through its shops by such measures as advertising the Web site on the 14 million paper cups it uses each week.
8_31	0.099838498	``Our customers have a relationship with Starbucks that is different from a traditional bricks-and-mortar store,'' he said.
8_32	0.07731586	But some of the customers at the Melrose Avenue shop were not that sure.

10_0	0.076804824	SEATTLE (AP) --Starbucks Corp.
10_1	0.14205374	warned Wednesday that annual profits would be lower than expected due to shortfalls in its non-core businesses and the cost of launching a new Internet portal.
10_2	0.11957722	Analysts had estimated the gourmet coffee retailer would earn 60 cents per share for fiscal 1999.
10_3	0.098541179	But Starbucks late Wednesday predicted earnings of 54 cents per share, with earnings over the next two quarters coming up 3 cents short of expectations.
10_4	0.051027848	The announcement was made after the markets closed.
10_5	0.090081283	Starbucks' shares fell $10, or nearly 27 percent, in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after closing the regular session at $37.56 1/4.

10_7	0.059630956	``I'm certain it won't hold there in the morning,'' Calabrese said.

10_9	0.15527847	Despite a strong core retail business, some of Starbucks' other businesses haven't grown as expected, CEO Howard Schultz said in a conference call.
10_10	0.12835207	He named the company's specialty food business and its North American partnership with Pepsi.
10_11	0.10270184	Schultz also cited $4 million in unbudgeted costs for developing the company's Internet strategy.
10_12	0.16898535	Company executives had expected that strong retail sales in Starbucks core coffee business would make up the difference, but that didn't happen, Schultz said.
10_13	0.057312612	``We raised our expectations too high,'' he said.
10_14	0.096762278	While the company's North American retail profit margin is up 1 percent in fiscal 1999 compared with fiscal 1998, Schultz said profits fell below internal estimates.
10_15	0.12981581	In retail sales alone, Schultz said, revenue was expected to be $16 million less than initial internal projections.
10_16	0.085283387	Nevertheless, Schultz said, ``We remain as optimistic as ever for the potential for significant profit growth''.
10_17	0.060994496	The Internet will play a role in that growth.
10_18	0.18153525	To direct the launch of the new Internet portal, Starbucks will form a new subsidiary named Starbucks X, led by senior vice president Debbi Gillotti, Schultz said.

10_20	0.17861618	He also said the company will announce a major strategic partnership for the Internet site later this summer.
10_21	0.14912167	By expanding Starbucks' online sales beyond coffee, Schultz said the company is taking a crack at potential revenues estimated at $100 billion.
10_22	0.20281406	According to Starbucks, more than 75 percent of the company's customers use the Internet, and they have an average income of more than $70,000.

13_3	0.1438042	Starbucks' acquisition offer, rebuffed by San Francisco's Williams-Sonoma earlier this month, was unexpected because it ignored the conventional rules of retail mergers.

13_5	0.11782256	Instead, Seattle's Starbucks, a brick-and-mortar retailer, proposed buying Williams-Sonoma, a brick-and-mortar retailer, as an Internet play _ an opportunity for Starbucks to hitch a ride on Williams-Sonoma's e-commerce business.
13_6	0.060777739	Four years ago, such a combination would have made no sense.
13_7	0.060973803	Even today it seems a bit wacky.

13_11	0.12035276	Starbucks declined to comment on the acquisition attempt, first reported in The Chronicle on Friday, and Williams-Sonoma will say only that it is not for sale.
13_12	0.099142651	Sources say that Williams-Sonoma's board voted to reject Starbucks' overture in an emergency meeting in mid-June.
13_13	0.072657293	Industry observers see the move as vintage Howard Schultz.
13_14	0.15320567	Schultz, Starbucks' chief executive, is proving as ambitious on the Web as he has been with physical stores.
13_15	0.093792866	This is a man who, a decade ago, looked at a country where coffee is available on every street corner and proceeded to roll out a national chain of coffee bars.
13_16	0.091271738	Now he heads a $1.3 billion company that sells coffee, tea, canned drinks, and ice cream in supermarkets and more than 2,000 coffee bars around the world.

13_18	0.084162078	At the center of his strategy is a lifestyle portal and cable television franchise that will feature information, entertainment and e-shopping for upscale women.
13_19	0.12494988	Two weeks ago, Starbucks agreed to partner with Oxygen Media of New York, which is designing such a portal.
13_20	0.12882486	Details are sketchy, but Schultz said in a statement, ``We'll be able to provide a seamless customer experience through our retail stores, cable and the Internet''.

15_4	0.13476387	Starbucks paid $7.1 million for the 56-cafe chain in a deal that became final March 1, according to the complaint.
15_5	0.11487568	In the suit, led by Pasqua co-founder Mark Zuckerman, eight shareholders argue that the company's market value was much higher.
15_6	0.092036665	The plaintiffs together owned less than 10 percent of Pasqua's stock.

15_11	0.082423123	Ostroff noted that the court denied a request by the investor group earlier this year to stop the merger.
15_12	0.082017942	But the court allowed the plaintiffs to seek an outside appraisal to ensure that they received fair-market value for their shares.

15_17	0.10645324	Specifically, Peet's Coffee &AMP; Tea of Emeryville offered $15 million for Pasqua in February, a month before the Starbucks deal closed.
15_18	0.089539547	Pasqua's board should have ``engaged in an auction to obtain the best price, that's certainly an opportunity they had,'' said Tabacco, a partner with Berman, DeValerio, Pease &AMP; Tabacco.

15_21	0.10210378	Although Pasqua had 1998 sales of $26.5 million and its Bay Area stores were mostly healthy, its operations in New York and Los Angeles were ``hemorrhaging money,'' this source said.

15_23	0.11575861	Because shareholders never gathered for the vote (which was conducted by mail), it was difficult to fight the Starbucks acquisition before the deal closed, he said in a telephone interview yesterday.

19_0	0.13983596	A recent deal between Starbucks and the urban delivery specialist Kozmo.com _in which Starbucks will essentially set aside space in its coffee shops for Kozmo _ may be the first example of an established retailer offering its floor space and personnel to an e-commerce company.
19_1	0.069196138	But it is unlikely to be the last.
19_2	0.10098135	Industry executives and analysts predict that such agreements will come rapidly in the next few months, as Internet retailers struggle to address two of their most glaring vulnerabilities _ customer acquisition costs and returns _while continuing to close the gap between virtual and traditional stores.
19_3	0.033570092	The agreements will take many forms.
19_4	0.10308441	The convenience-store chain 7-Eleven, for instance, plans to install Internet-ready ATMs, which might eventually let customers order goods from Web retailers and have them delivered to the store.
19_5	0.079742191	And in such arrangements, customers might also be able to return Internet goods to the stores.
19_6	0.092048191	Package handling companies like Mail Boxes Etc.

19_8	0.077107853	Other national chains, like drugstores and gas station convenience marts, might also add such services as a side business.
19_9	0.09399153	Indeed, any retailer with a national presence and a strong distribution and warehousing system is a prime candidate to join with e-commerce sites, analysts predict.
19_10	0.087694844	Customers who enjoy the convenience of the Web might also prefer knowing that if anything goes wrong with a purchase, they can find a real person at a real store to make it better.
19_11	0.079693884	``The need for this is huge,'' said Tim Washer, director of interactive research with NFO Interactive, a market research company.
19_12	0.064260325	``What it's about is reducing the risk of shopping online.
19_13	0.049887311	Offering a retail presence will really facilitate that''.
19_14	0.079386544	Kozmo executives stressed those points in announcing the deal this month.
19_15	0.089354288	``We'll be able to ride on Starbucks' coattails, and give our customers an incredible sense of confidence,'' said Joseph Park, chief executive of Kozmo, which offers free one-hour delivery of goods purchased on its Internet site.
19_16	0.091107647	Kozmo, which operates only in Boston, New York, Washington, Seattle and San Francisco so far, specializes in delivering videos, books, food and convenience goods.
19_17	0.14119704	Under the deal, Kozmo will pay Starbucks $150 million over five years for the right to place return boxes in Starbucks stores.
19_18	0.083420274	The boxes will initially be used for rental videos, games and DVDs, but will eventually be available for other products, as well, like disposable cameras ready for processing or defective items being returned for a refund.
19_19	0.10982991	In addition, Starbucks will promote Kozmo and train its sales staff to answer questions about the Internet company.
19_20	0.11428025	Kozmo, in turn, will deliver Starbucks coffees and teas by the pound _ and eventually perhaps hot beverages, too.
19_21	0.084602753	The partnership, which is to include joint marketing, will immediately raise Kozmo's credibility with consumers, predicted Chris Vroom, e-commerce analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
19_22	0.079890885	And it will also give Kozmo an efficient way to reach new customers, he said.
19_23	0.086290456	Vroom said Internet retailers typically spent about $100 to acquire each customer _ an exorbitant amount, because the average customer will spend only about $200 at a given site in a lifetime.
19_24	0.11416065	A $30 million annual outlay to Starbucks will swell Kozmo's customer acquisition costs in the short term, he said, but in the long term it could pay off, given Starbucks' huge clientele.
19_25	0.10165302	``Starbucks can put a Kozmo logo on coffee cups that 10 million customers a week will buy,'' Vroom said.
19_26	0.076267336	``That's a powerful thing''.
19_27	0.090308574	Perhaps more powerful is the ability of such partnerships to provide e-commerce customers an easy way to return goods _ not simply rental items, but, more important, goods deemed unsatisfactory by the customers.
19_28	0.090675693	Internet merchants have been widely criticized for their failures in this regard, particularly as return rates have reached roughly 30 percent _ a rate slightly higher than in the catalog industry.
19_29	0.087689195	nn Retailers with stores online and offline, like Gap and Federated's Macy's, have had an edge at least in part because their customers can return goods to a store whether they were bought online or off.
19_30	0.11572424	And though e-commerce companies are loath to open up stores for this reason alone, they are clearly in the market for help from companies that can help streamline returns.
19_31	0.08856856	``As I speak, there are four or five people from e-commerce companies in this building talking to us about it,'' said James Amos, chief executive of Mail Boxes Etc.
19_32	0.067105056	, speaking from his office in San Diego.

19_34	0.073942808	``We're in discussions with just about everyone that'd come to the top of your mind,'' he said.
19_35	0.088475881	Amos said the deluge began late last year when the company agreed to provide customers of eBay auctions with help in inspecting and returning items bought online.
19_36	0.091140999	Since then, Mail Boxes has begun installing satellite dishes in franchise stores, in hopes of connecting all of its business partners in a single network.
19_37	0.10680164	The satellites will not only provide high-speed Internet access, the company said, but will link the stores' cash registers directly to the corporate office and to the company's e-commerce partners.
19_38	0.088554194	That setup, in turn, will allow the company to plug into the back-office systems of Internet retailers _ so that if a customer of an Internet-only merchant wanted to exchange an item at a Mail Boxes store, the replacement item could be sent to a Mail Boxes location.
19_39	0.088107349	The customer could then simply drop off the old item, pick up the new one and not have to deal with packaging, postage or coordinating delivery times.
19_40	0.091212733	Noting that the first e-commerce partnerships will be announced after the satellite system is completed next month, Amos said, ``We're basically going to be a bridge between the virtual and the real world''.
19_41	0.073563072	Naturally, Mail Boxes will have plenty of company in that regard.
19_42	0.09019357	United Parcel Service, which recently announced plans to expand its network of drop-off centers by testing storefront locations in suburban areas, might use those stores to support e-commerce companies.
19_43	0.087765342	``We're definitely going to contemplate it,'' said Mark Rhoney, president of UPS eVentures, the business UPS set up to help e-commerce companies fill orders.
19_44	0.092707069	Kenny Kurtzman, chief executive of Ashford.com, an online jewelry and luxury goods retailer, would welcome a partnership with an offline company ``if that would help give customers an easier way to return products,'' he said.
19_45	0.074331294	``We'd look to partner with someone like FedEx or UPS to do that''.
19_46	0.087042922	In exploring its own partnerships with e-commerce companies, 7-Eleven has not been approached by online jewelers, ``but we have had some bizarre offers,'' said James Keyes, chief operating officer.
19_47	0.073523354	``I don't think someone will pick up their living room furniture at our store''.
19_48	0.078315937	Keyes said that by this summer, 7-Eleven would test ATMs with Internet access.
19_49	0.08760545	Besides getting cash, customers would be able to cash checks or obtain money orders or get directions from Web sites, for instance.
19_50	0.082391104	Initially, the ATMs would not include Internet retailers, he said, but that might change eventually.

21_13	0.10189263	Just last week, Starbucks announced a partnership with Oxygen Media to develop a lifestyle-oriented portal and cable television business targeting upscale women.
21_14	0.09126135	Williams-Sonoma, which has just begun rolling out a series of cyber gift registries and online stores, would be the perfect e-commerce addition, observers said.

21_18	0.088970964	Williams-Sonoma is a particularly attractive Web partner because of its strong stable of brand names, including Hold Everything and Chambers; its decades of direct-to-consumer experience; and its technological infrastructure, which includes a strong Web operation and a large, sophisticated distribution center.
21_19	0.090762635	In addition, Williams-Sonoma's valuable customer database of 20 million names, addresses and buying histories will be an even more powerful tool when the company is able to mesh the list with e-mail addresses, said an industry analyst who declined to be identified by name.
