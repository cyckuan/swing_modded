0_0	0.0	WASHINGTON _ Despite high-profile shootings at schools around the country in the past year, such violence has remained steady since 1992 and the world inside the classroom remains a relatively safe place, a report being released Wednesday concludes.

0_9	0.0	Although the number of school deaths jumped 60 percent last year over the year before, Zeidenberg called the increase ``statistically insignificant'' because of the numbers in 1992-1993 and 1993-1994.

19_1	0.15789473684210525	(AP) -- New software that helps highlight school trouble spots may help educators trying to avert violent episodes such as the Columbine High School shootings earlier this year.
19_2	0.21052631578947367	GBA Systems' School Safety Software, formally called SSP2000, is designed to give school administrators an accurate way to track incidents of school violence and other crimes.
19_3	0.0	``Schools need to know what is occurring on the campus,'' president Sylvia Stone said in an interview last month at the company's Greensboro headquarters.
19_4	0.0	``And they need to have information available to them quickly''.

19_8	0.2857142857142857	Bob Bateman, school safety administrator for the Guilford County school district, used the software when a Greensboro middle school principal asked him to help identify places in the school where crime was a problem.

19_12	0.625	While school safety measures such as metal detectors or additional security officers can be expensive, Stone estimated the cost of the software to be less than $2 per student.
19_13	0.0	So far, nearly 300 schools from North Carolina to California are using the software as part of their security programs, according to GBA Systems.
19_14	0.4166666666666667	And others, including the New York City school district, are considering it as a means to get a handle on the problem of school violence.

21_1	0.058823529411764705	Education Secretary Richard Riley offered this reassurance Tuesday: Parents and students should not fear repeats of deadly gun rampages such as the one last April in Littleton, Colo.
21_2	0.0	Riley said school efforts to counter violence are paying off and students are getting the message that guns have no place in school.
21_3	0.0	He cited a new Education Department report showing that a total of 3,390 students were expelled for bringing firearms to school during the 1997-1998 school year, the most recent year available.

21_9	0.0	Less than one percent of all homicides among school-age children occur in or around schools, Riley said.
21_10	0.125	Nevertheless, surveys have shown a level of anxiety among parents and students over school violence.
21_11	0.05555555555555555	One such survey of high-school age students released Tuesday by the Horatio Alger Association showed 37 percent feel safe in school, down from 44 percent last year.
21_12	0.25925925925925924	But local school security officials meeting with Riley said they believed schools generally are safe places, and that incidents such as the one at Columbine High School are ``an aberration,'' as Wesley Mitchell, police chief of the Los Angeles Unified School District, put it.

24_0	0.034482758620689655	ATLANTA _ It's a shocking statistic: Six thousand students were caught bringing guns to U.S. schools during the past two years, but a mere 13 cases were prosecuted under a federal law the Clinton administration promoted to keep guns away from schools.
24_1	0.038461538461538464	In response to the call for additional gun control after a wave of school shootings, the purported gap between arrests and prosecutions has been cited and recited by political figures and others who say existing laws should be better enforced before new gun restrictions are imposed.
24_2	0.0	It will be a central theme of a House hearing Thursday into new gun-control proposals.
24_3	0.0	There's just one problem: While plenty shocking, this statistic isn't entirely accurate.
24_4	0.06666666666666667	It is true that about 6,000 students were cited in 1997 and 1998 under the federal Gun-Free Schools Act for bringing firearms to school.
24_5	0.08333333333333333	But, as the law requires, those students were suspended from school and charged as juvenile delinquents in state and local courts.
24_6	0.0	And it is true that the U.S.
24_7	0.0	Justice Department prosecuted just 13 people the past two years under the federal Gun-Free School Zone Act, a separate law that prohibits the possession of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school.
24_8	0.05555555555555555	But thousands of other defendants who allegedly violated the federal law, including the 15-year-old accused of shooting six classmates at Heritage High School in Rockdale County, Ga.
24_9	0.25	, have been charged or prosecuted under state laws.
24_10	0.0	Federal prosecutions, authorities say, are reserved for particularly flagrant cases.
24_11	0.18181818181818182	The 13 prosecutions have nothing to do with the 6,000 instances of children bringing guns to school, said U.S.
24_12	0.045454545454545456	Justice Department and White House officials, who complained that gun-control opponents have drawn a misleading, if salient, link between the two numbers to divert attention from the emotional issues of school violence and firearms restrictions.
24_13	0.0	``If you look at any number in a vacuum, you can find a problem with it,'' said Brian Steel, a spokesman for the Justice Department.
24_14	0.0	``This is a total smokescreen''.
24_15	0.07692307692307693	In 1997, the latest year for which statistics are available, the federal government prosecuted 6,078 gun offenses, the Justice Department said.
24_16	0.0	State and local prosecutors handled the rest of the year's 218,900 arrests in which a weapons offense was the most serious charge.
24_17	0.0	With political opponents citing such figures, the Clinton administration's enforcement of existing gun laws is becoming a focal point in the debate over new regulations.
24_18	0.09523809523809523	In a speech to the Georgia Republican Party last Saturday, Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association's executive vice president, deplored ``a collapse of federal firearms law enforcement''.

24_20	0.0	``In 1997,'' he said, ``they prosecuted a total of five.
24_21	0.0	Last year, they prosecuted eight.
24_22	0.0	And you can hear the White House spin now: From five to eight, that's a 60 percent increase''.
24_23	0.0	The House Judiciary Committee is ready to consider a bill supported by the president, similar to one the Senate passed last week, that would mandate background checks on people who buy weapons at gun shows and would require trigger locks on all firearms.
24_24	0.0	But at a hearing on Thursday, the House panel first will ask why Clinton's Justice Department isn't prosecuting more cases.
24_25	0.0	``We've taken it upon ourselves to federalize a lot of crimes, and it's the Department of Justice's responsibility to see to it that those laws are executed and followed,'' said Michael Connolly, a spokesman for Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.).
24_26	0.0	``What's the point of passing new laws?
24_27	0.0	.. . We want to look at how and why these (new proposals) would be prosecuted differently than the current record the administration has put together''.

24_29	0.0	Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a Judiciary member, described the low prosecution figures as ``a major problem for the administration''.
24_30	0.0	``All this president is interested in is a sound bite, a photo op with a bunch of cardboard cops behind him to show that he's tough on crime,'' Barr said.
24_31	0.0	``They are more interested in limiting access to firearms by citizens than they are in tackling the misuse of firearms by criminals''.
24_32	0.0	But a White House spokeswoman said focusing on how many cases are prosecuted is irrelevant.
24_33	0.0	More important, said Julie Goldberg, a deputy press secretary, is the fact that the number of reported violent crimes involving firearms decreased by 29 percent from 1993 to 1997.
24_34	0.0	``Enforcement alone is not enough,'' Goldberg said.
24_35	0.0	``There are other issues that Congress also needs to look at.
24_36	0.0	That's what the president is hoping to have Congress act on _ his proposals to prevent crimes and prevent guns from getting into the hands of children''.
