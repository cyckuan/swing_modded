21_25	0.1232773	Enderson said Rudolph, who as a teenager moved with his mother and brothers to Nantahala and recently lived in nearby Murphy, is believed to have altered his appearance slightly by growing a beard and longer hair pulled back in a ponytail.

22_0	0.26064626	ATLANTA _ Federal officials said on Monday that there was no evidence linking Eric Robert Rudolph, the North Carolina fugitive charged in four Southern bombings, to an explosion outside an abortion clinic in Asheville, N.C., on Saturday morning.
22_1	0.22308788	Questions about Rudolph arose immediately after the explosion because he is accused of bombing two abortion clinics, one in Birmingham, Ala.
22_2	0.20366278	, and one in the Atlanta area, and because he was last seen near Andrews, N.C., about 75 miles west of Asheville.
22_3	0.19071366	At a news conference in Asheville, federal investigators were careful to say that they had not definitively excluded Rudolph as a suspect.
22_4	0.14570695	But in that news conference and in subsequent interviews on Monday, the authorities suggested strongly that the bomb probably was not Rudolph's handiwork.
22_5	0.16696588	``We're saying at this time that we have no evidence that this is the work of Eric Rudolph,'' said Mark Calloway, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of North Carolina.
22_6	0.097494201	``But it's early in the investigation, and we're not drawing any conclusions at this time''.
22_7	0.20585693	Woody Enderson, the FBI agent directing the task force that is searching for Rudolph, said in a statement that ``there is no reason to believe'' that Rudolph has any connection to the Asheville attack.
22_8	0.074848525	Another federal investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was even more explicit.
22_9	0.068543376	``We see no linkage,'' the law-enforcement official said.
22_10	0.12937467	``This device is much different than the devices associated with Rudolph.
22_11	0.1224903	In a world where anything is possible, I can't slam any doors because we don't have Rudolph in custody and we don't know who did it in Asheville.
22_12	0.04942557	But there are a lot of differences''.
22_13	0.14493639	Investigators have painstakingly analyzed the components of the bombs Rudolph is accused of building, and have found numerous similarities between their parts and their design.
22_14	0.06621031	The bomb in Asheville exploded shortly after 7 a.m.
22_15	0.14532883	Saturday outside the Femcare Clinic, the only abortion provider in western North Carolina.
22_16	0.10570959	The clinic was scheduled to open at 8 a.m.
22_17	0.11184033	No one was injured, and the bomb caused little damage because it did not fully detonate.
22_18	0.080331309	There were no warnings before the blast, and no person or group has claimed responsibility.
22_19	0.09093766	The Femcare Clinic has never been hit by a violent attack, but it has been the site of regular protests by anti-abortion demonstrators.
22_20	0.098669364	It also received a hoax letter that purported to contain anthrax last month and a threatening telephone call last July, Calloway said.
22_21	0.16883418	If the bomb had fully detonated, the damage would have been severe, said Richard Fox, special agent in charge of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in North Carolina.
22_22	0.082011325	``It would have devastated that entire end of the building and penetrated into the building some approximately 40 feet or so to 60 feet, with fairly complete destruction,'' Fox said.
22_23	0.098962065	Because the bomb did not explode completely, investigators have gathered far more information about its components than is usually possible.
22_24	0.3078337	Rudolph, 32, a resident of western North Carolina, has been a fugitive since Jan.
22_25	0.19916437	30, 1998, the day after he allegedly bombed the New Woman All Women Health Care Center in Birmingham.
22_26	0.25332434	Rudolph has also been charged with the July 27, 1996, bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta; the Jan.

22_29	0.11541899	The attacks killed two people, including an off-duty police officer in Birmingham, and injured 124.
22_30	0.26216065	Rudolph remains on the FBI's list of the 10 most-wanted fugitives.

23_1	0.23562143	(AP) --The task force that has hunted serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph for two years will dismantle its command post in the rugged Southern Appalachians by the end of June.
23_2	0.35911442	''Eric Rudolph has not escaped justice, he has just delayed it,'' Steven McCraw, head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force, said Monday.
23_3	0.098065524	''The trail is cold, yet all evidence suggests he's here, he's alone and he's alive''.
23_4	0.35130648	Rudolph, 33, is charged in three Atlanta-area bombings, including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing in which a woman died.
23_5	0.2693786	Investigators also suspect he was involved in the 1998, explosion that killed a policeman and maimed a nurse at a clinic that performs abortions in Birmingham, Ala.
23_6	0.241844	Hours after the Birmingham bombing, a truck seen near the explosion site was traced to Rudolph.
23_7	0.14948589	Rudolph rented a video in Murphy, N.C., that night, bought a large cache of food and supplies and vanished.
23_8	0.25041819	His truck was found near here several days later.
23_9	0.14151998	But dogs, searchers and infrared-equipped helicopters have failed to find Rudolph, an Army veteran and survivalist, in the dense mountain forests.
23_10	0.1246023	Agents stopped actively searching in the woods in August, after McCraw took the job, he said.
23_11	0.11530176	McCraw said in his first public appearance since then that he's leaving North Carolina next month to return to Washington, D.C.
23_12	0.12019005	Agents will remain in Andrews, and a local coordinator will report to FBI officials in Atlanta, McCraw said.
23_13	0.18398578	There has been just one confirmed sighting of Rudolph since his disappearance, in July 1998.
23_14	0.14655578	McCraw said Rudolph may have been involved in a February 1999 break-in at a restaurant, but the perpetrator did not leave any fingerprints or other forensic evidence.
23_15	0.28798146	A $1 million reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest, but some people in the area have said they believe Rudolph may have gotten help from sympathetic locals.
23_16	0.069634788	Others say he might have left the region.
24_0	0.22838647	ATLANTA _ After five and a half months in hiding, the man wanted for the fatal bombing of an Alabama abortion clinic emerged from the woods of western North Carolina last week, took a large amount of food and a pickup truck from a residence, then abandoned the truck and vanished once more, federal authorities said on Tuesday.
24_1	0.22751291	At a news conference in Andrews, N.C., Tuesday afternoon, federal investigators said that the team of agents pursuing Eric Robert Rudolph would be more than doubled from its previous size of 35.
24_2	0.038873712	Bloodhounds also were tracking the fugitive.
24_3	0.18735227	``We think we have the resources that we will find him,'' said Woody Enderson, the FBI agent who directs the multiagency Southeast Bombing Task Force.
24_4	0.11164399	The sighting last Thursday was clearly the most encouraging lead in a frustrating search that has taken investigators across hundreds of miles of mountainous terrain since Jan.
24_5	0.2676775	29, when a bomb exploded outside the New Woman All Women Health Care Center, in Birmingham, Ala.
24_6	0.27930813	The bombing killed an off-duty policeman who was working as a security guard at the clinic and seriously injured a nurse.
24_7	0.19680002	Witnesses saw a man acting suspiciously shortly after the explosion, and the North Carolina license plate on the man's truck was traced to Rudolph.
24_8	0.10045125	``This is a pretty significant step forward because we now know for sure that he's in this area and that we are able to focus in on a much smaller area than we have before,'' said Enderson.
24_9	0.17077677	Rudolph, a 31-year-old carpenter with ties to extremist religious groups, also is wanted for questioning in three bombings in the Atlanta area in 1996 and 1997, including the July 27, 1996, explosion at Centennial Olympic Park.
24_10	0.06455344	That explosion killed one woman and injured 111 people.
24_11	0.06530668	Seven people were injured in a pair of explosions on Jan.

24_14	0.27860443	Although Rudolph has only been formally charged in the Birmingham bombing, forensic evidence suggests that he may have been responsible for the Atlanta bombings as well, investigators have said.
24_15	0.2182936	In early May, the FBI placed Rudolph on its list of the 10 most wanted fugitives and offered a $1 million reward for information leading to his arrest.
24_16	0.16341692	Enderson said that the man identified as Rudolph had appeared on Thursday evening at a residence near Nantahala Lake, not far from where Rudolph once lived.
24_17	0.13792976	He said the fugitive took a blue 1977 Nissan pickup truck from the occupant of the residence, whom he did not identify.
24_18	0.14279214	He said Rudolph also took a large amount of food from the resident, possibly enough to sustain him for five or six months.
24_19	0.12313717	The authorities said the resident provided a description that enabled them to produce a new sketch of the previously clean-shaven Rudolph, showing him thinner, bearded and sporting a ponytail.
24_20	0.080822092	He was last seen wearing camouflage fatigues, a camouflage jacket and gloves, they said.
24_21	0.14991561	Enderson declined to say specifically whether the resident knew Rudolph.
24_22	0.083477746	``Keep in mind that pretty much in this whole area, people know each other,'' he said.
24_23	0.067916575	``The extent of the association I'm not going to discuss''.
24_24	0.14195578	A law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the resident, who was described as the owner of a health food store, did not report the truck as stolen until several days later.
24_25	0.11932644	It was found, broken down and abandoned, at about noon on Monday at the Bob Allison Campground, a picnic area in the Nantahala National Forest, the official said.
24_26	0.12994438	The official also said that authorities found a note inside the truck explaining who it belonged to, and they identified the handwriting as Rudolph's.
24_27	0.31331352	``We are confident that we are dealing with Eric Robert Rudolph,'' Enderson said.
24_28	0.17347977	The law enforcement official said the truck apparently was not at the picnic area 18 hours before it was found, meaning that Rudolph has less than a day's head start on his pursuers.
24_29	0.14498702	Enderson said that his troops had been energized by the sighting of Rudolph.
24_30	0.17517423	And he sounded reassured by the discovery that Rudolph apparently spent the last five months in the hills of western North Carolina.
24_31	0.1795831	Federal officials had long said they assumed that Rudolph, an avid outdoorsman who has been described as a survivalist, was hiding in the familiar woods near his home.
24_32	0.16662021	``We've said all along that we had strong reason to believe that Eric Rudolph was in this area, had not left this area, that he was alive, that he was acting alone,'' Enderson said.
24_33	0.020714967	``We still believe that.''
