12_4	0.096520565	But in that news conference and in subsequent interviews on Monday, the authorities suggested strongly that the bomb probably was not Rudolph's handiwork.

20_1	0.41117298	_ An old pickup truck federal investigators believe was stolen almost two weeks ago by Birmingham bomb suspect Eric Robert Rudolph was driven a ''few dozen miles'' over four days before it was abandoned in a remote Nantahala camp site, the head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force said Wednesday.
20_2	0.14231467	Experts examined the engine and other parts trying to determine a radius for the search for the fugitive, who may have used the 1977 Datsun truck to transport food and provisions to a hideout, investigators said.
20_3	0.13222607	The FBI's Woody Enderson appealed again Wednesday for help from anyone who may have seen the blue truck between the night of July 9 and about noon July 13 when it was discovered.
20_4	0.17010119	A note, believed to have been written by Rudolph, was found inside with instructions to return the truck to its owner, George Nordmann, 71, a health food store owner who is an acquaintance of Rudolph's.
20_5	0.14087317	''We already have some information from witnesses that during the time it was being driven by Eric Rudolph, the truck made a lot of noise,'' Enderson said at a news conference.
20_6	0.10508116	''It is possible that the truck may have been driven some distance out of the forest area, and later back in again to where it was found.

21_1	0.28441079	(AP) --The FBI is paying outdoorsmen familiar with the remote mountains of western North Carolina to watch for signs of serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph, who has eluded a manhunt for more than two years.

21_3	0.080633127	However, since the FBI began paying the fees months ago, the scouts haven't been any more successful in finding Rudolph than anything else the agents have tried.

21_15	0.16413634	In 1998, at the height of the search, the Southeast Bomb Task Force allowed hunters into the same woods agents were searching, in hopes the hunters or their dogs might find Rudolph.

23_1	0.32598287	About 100 investigative officers from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local sheriffs departments are hunting for fugitive Eric Robert Rudolph in the 530,000-acre Nantahala National Forest, a rugged area at the state's western tip.
