13_3	0.08333333333333333	Carter, 75, was haunted by the image of a 2-year-old boy he had seen last weekend in the poor West African nation of Mali.
13_4	0.7142857142857143	The boy suffered from the early stages of a disease called trachoma, which has blinded 6 million people and infects millions more.

13_6	0.42857142857142855	But the boy, the former president said, still ``has a chance'' of keeping his eyesight.
13_7	1.0	The youngster from Mali and others like him will have more of a chance, thanks to new programs the Carter Center is announcing today.
13_8	0.14285714285714285	Grants from the Lions Clubs International Foundation and the Conrad N.

13_12	1.1875	The Carter Center has been combating another eye disease, river blindness, since 1987 and will expand those programs to additional countries with help from the new grants.
13_13	0.0	Both ailments have symptoms that can make your stomach churn.

13_28	0.5	River blindness is ``treated quite simply with one tablet a year that Merck &AMP; Co.
13_29	0.0	gives us,'' Carter said.
13_30	0.3333333333333333	The center has distributed 17 million of those annual doses so far and expects to give out more than 6 million in the coming year.
13_31	0.5	``For a person with river blindness, they would rather have that one pill a year than to have a diamond the same size,'' Carter said.

13_43	0.0	He confessed to ``very strange'' feelings as he saw people suffering from ailments so easily preventable.

14_0	1.0	JAKARTA &UR; &LR; _ Jimmy Carter has monitored more than 20 elections in 16 countries since he left the White House, and not all of them were showcases of democracy.
14_1	0.0	In Panama in 1989, he went on national television to denounce ballot tampering by General Manuel Noriega.
14_2	0.0	In 1992 in Guyana, thugs who had been menacing voters threatened his life.
14_3	0.07142857142857142	But Indonesia, where voters went to the polls two days ago for their first free election in 44 years, seems to have defied the cynics.
14_4	0.0	A year after bloody riots forced President Suharto from power, more than 100 million Indonesians exercised their democratic rights in a process that, so far, seems to have been largely fair and peaceful, Carter said Tuesday night.
14_5	0.7857142857142857	``The grades we've given. . . are very good,'' Carter said, after reviewing preliminary reports from 50 teams sent out by his Atlanta-based Carter Center.
14_6	0.0	The observers visited up to 1,000 sites across Indonesia's vast archipelago.
14_7	0.25	The balloting he observed was ``very meticulous, almost excruciatingly so,'' the former US president said.
14_8	0.0	He described poll workers reciting the oath of honesty, reading the election commissioner's speech aloud, shaking out ballot boxes publicly to demonstrate they were empty before the voting, and counting unused ballots to make sure the numbers were right.
14_9	0.0	Relaxing in a traditional Indonesian batik shirt, Carter told a small group of reporters that it is too early to tell if the election as a whole will be fair, since votes are still being tabulated.
14_10	0.0	But citing widespread reports of vigilant voters crowding poll stations to watch the counting, Carter said he was optimistic that ``that part will be so highly scrutinized by the public that improprieties will be revealed and corrected''.
14_11	0.0	That is a marked contrast with Panama 10 years ago, when President Noriega deployed armed soldiers dressed in civilian clothes to seize voting sheets at night and replace them with new ballots the next day.
14_12	0.0	``I don't speak much Spanish,'' Carter said, but he went on national television that day to denounce the vote-fixing.
14_13	0.0	``I'm still not sure what I said,'' he added with a laugh, but ``I used the word fraudulent''.
14_14	0.0	Akbar Tandjung, chairman of Indonesia's ruling Golkar party, said Tuesday he would respect the election result, whatever the outcome.
14_15	0.0	Carter said he was confident all rival parties would do the same, but he observed that, counting aside, he has ``never seen so complicated a process to choose a president''.
14_16	0.0	Under the system that debuted Monday, citizens voted for 462 national parliamentarians and 135 regional councilors.
14_17	0.0	Another 65 representatives from underrepresented groups will be appointed later, probably by parliament, and the military will appoint 38 representatives of its own.
14_18	0.0	That national assembly of 700 people will choose a president in November.
14_19	0.0	The process, Carter warned, leaves the door open for efforts to buy assembly members' votes.
14_20	0.0	He urged that the constitution be amended to allow direct presidential elections in 2004.

14_24	0.18181818181818182	Carter's assessment of the voting echoed the relief and guarded praise voiced by other foreign observers.
14_25	0.0	Domestic groups were more cautious, pointing out several isolated violations and calling for fresh voting in the province of Aceh, where 15,000 people were reportedly prevented from voting because of threats by separatists or the military.
14_26	0.0	Another challenge will be in the counting.
14_27	0.0	Only 2 percent of more than 100 million ballots had been counted.
14_28	0.0	Officials said the final tally may not be known until June 21.
14_29	0.047619047619047616	Smita Notosusanto, executive director of the University Network for Free and Fair Election, said part of the delay is because ballots are tabulated at polling stations and then recounted at village, subdistrict, district, and provincial levels.
14_30	0.0	What is more, she added, ``The computer system is a total mess ...
14_31	0.0	and in some areas they have to carry votes by horseback or canoe''.
14_32	0.0	Notosusanto warned that ``most of the cheating comes after the voting''.
14_33	0.0	Investors were apparently heartened by the vote.

15_8	0.0	8 regional elections _ a major setback for the country's two traditional political parties.
