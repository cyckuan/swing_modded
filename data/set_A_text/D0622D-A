6_52	0.0	It was his 42d sick animal since June 1.
6_53	0.0	His eight-person crew peeled back the dead crow's scalp and extracted brain tissue.
6_54	0.0	They treated the sample with different enzymes, chemicals, and dyes to read its genetic fingerprint.
6_55	3.2857142857142856	They had a CDC sample of West Nile virus to compare with it.
6_56	0.0	The mixture formed a gel and an electric current was run through it.
6_57	0.0	Then it was injected with an ethidium bromide stain.
6_58	0.0	The team of researchers watched the stained crow brain sample form into white bands on the black sample of gel.
6_59	0.0	When they saw the results, the researchers ran downstairs to their boss's office.
6_60	0.0	``I ran up to the lab to take a look at the photo they'd taken of the sample,'' said Timperi.
6_61	0.0	He saw the tell-tale white stripes on the gel dish and turned to his staff: ``Let's get moving''.
6_62	1.0833333333333333	There were more tests to be done to confirm West Nile but Timperi was sure _ even though the CDC would soon dispute him _ that he had found the virus.
6_63	0.0	He started a chain of phone calls on Tuesday that ended at the residence of Boston Mayor Thomas M.
6_64	0.0	Menino. But the series of events that brought the virus here is far murkier.
6_65	0.125	Scientists agree that the Queens outbreak was the virus's entry into the United States but are unsure how it got from Queens to Boston and from the Eastern to the Western Hemisphere.
6_66	2.5	The West Nile virus found in Queens is genetically very similar to the strain that turned up in Israel.
6_67	0.0	There it killed an elderly couple from Moscow who had immigrated to Tel Aviv.
6_68	0.0	Also, a 34-year-old woman from England was sickened, but not fatally, in the southern part of the country.
6_69	0.0	The Israelis had not even noticed the outbreak until the publicity around the Queens case spread.
6_70	0.0	In fact, the virus has surfaced several times in Israel since 1957.
6_71	0.25	This will be the case in the United States for years to come, scientists suggest.
6_72	0.2	Scientists have four theories on how the virus traveled.
6_73	0.0	The theories illustrate the ways a virus can nation-hop.
6_74	0.2	The first, and most likely, said scientists, is that the virus boarded a commercial airline flight to the United States.
6_75	1.1428571428571428	``An infected mosquito bit a guy in the Middle East, he hops on a plane and lands in New York, where he is bitten by another mosquito.
6_76	0.0	That mosquito spreads it,'' said Spielman of Harvard.
6_77	0.0	``And the guy may have never known he was sick''.
6_78	0.0	Heavy air traffic has allowed viruses to spread much more quickly, said scientists.
6_79	0.0	They can now go to any country where they can find warm temperatures and hosts to infect.
6_80	0.0	``Air travel has decreased the size of the world effectively,'' said Richard Pollack, a public health entomologist at Harvard.
6_81	0.5	The second theory is that an infected bird from western Africa was blown here.
6_82	0.0	Most birds could not make the flight on their own, but a cyclone or heavy winds could have dropped them here.
6_83	0.0	In 1998, researchers found that several million locusts had been blown from West Africa to the Caribbean.
6_84	0.4444444444444444	Thirdly, scientists theorize that an infected bird was brought, perhaps illegally, to John F.
6_85	3.5	Kennedy Airport in New York.
6_86	0.16666666666666666	According to the US Customs Service, 2,770 birds entered the United States that way in 1999.
6_87	0.0	The final theory returns to mosquitoes: a bunch of infected insects somehow got transported here via airplane.
6_88	0.0	This, too, is possible.
6_89	0.0	Researchers recently transported live mosquitoes across the Atlantic Ocean by placing them in the wheel carriage of a 747 jet.
6_90	2.8461538461538463	Most scientists agree the West Nile virus's journey from New York to Boston occurred in birds.
6_91	1.4	Infected mosquitoes bite New York birds, then the birds migrate to different parts of the East Coast, where more mosquitoes bite them and spread the virus.
6_92	0.625	Corvus brachyrhynchos, or American crow, has a migratory pattern that takes it from New England, New York, and Canada in the summer to Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Florida in the winter, according to a recent study by researchers at the National Zoo in Washington.
6_93	2.111111111111111	Almost all of the New England routes pass near New York City.
6_94	1.8125	Public health officials were expecting West Nile to show up in a city south of New York because birds are headed that way in late summer.
6_95	0.14285714285714285	Last year one dead crow infected with the virus turned up in Baltimore.
6_96	1.5833333333333333	But crows roam widely, and it is possible that an infected crow simply flew here this summer from New York City.

6_99	1.1818181818181819	The CDC was disputing Timperi's West Nile diagnosis but it was decided the public should be warned anyway.
6_100	0.0	``I think the most important thing we wanted to do is get accurate information out to people that the risk of getting the virus is quite low and that you can make it even lower by taking some precautions,'' said Barry.

6_103	0.0	And in what became almost an afterthought, hours after Menino's speech, the CDC called to tell Timperi he was right.
6_104	0.0	The drill was handy in one sense: Officials say they will probably have to do it many times again.

10_3	1.6666666666666667	A case in point is the encephalitis outbreak that is blamed for at least three deaths in New York City.
10_4	1.4	Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the New York City Health Department said the cause was the mosquito-borne St.

10_15	0.0	Gubler, the head of CDC's arbovirus field station in Fort Collins, Colo.

10_17	0.0	The change in diagnosis, though not important in terms of the spraying and other public health measures taken to combat the outbreak, was scientifically embarrassing to the CDC, the premier federal agency that is responsible for tracking infectious diseases in this country.
10_18	0.041666666666666664	In recent years, CDC and other health officials have led a campaign against the threat of new and emerging infections, warning doctors to expect more infectious disease ``zebras,'' like the sudden appearance of old microbes in new areas.
10_19	0.09090909090909091	In fact, health officials thought they had scored a coup when they diagnosed the mysterious illness as the St.
10_20	0.0	Louis virus.
10_21	0.2222222222222222	The disease is usually found in the Southeastern states, and humans are usually bystanders in such infections.
10_22	0.0	Birds are the principal reservoir for the arboviruses, but they do not become sick.
10_23	0.0	Instead, mosquitoes transmit the viruses to people who may become ill.
10_24	0.0	In hindsight, the concurrent deaths of an unusual number of birds in the city has turned out to be an important but underestimated clue.
10_25	0.9285714285714286	Federal and local medical sleuths did not immediately relate the bird die-off to the human outbreak because West Nile, St.
10_26	0.0	Louis and similar encephalitis viruses generally do not kill birds.
10_27	0.07692307692307693	Now the CDC is retesting blood and spinal fluid from patients who had symptoms of encephalitis and who did not show evidence of St.
10_28	0.0	Louis virus.
10_29	0.0	The new findings mean that health workers need to investigate a number of other possibilities, Gubler said.
10_30	1.4705882352941178	A critical one is that the CDC can no longer be certain that the West Nile virus has never been present in the United States, because federal scientists never specifically checked for it in earlier outbreaks and individual cases.
10_31	0.058823529411764705	In testing mosquitoes and specimens from humans with encephalitis, CDC routinely checks all types of viral encephalitis known to have caused infection in the Western Hemisphere, Gubler said.
10_32	0.0	There can be considerable overlap in findings from the laboratory tests unless extra steps are taken to distinguish between the many types of encephalitis-causing arboviruses.
10_33	0.0	In a sense they are all one virus, but with many variations that can be detected in the laboratory.
10_34	0.0	The encephalitis they cause is the same disease, although there can be subtle differences in the type of brain damage they produce.
10_35	0.0	The viruses occur in different geographic areas, and by scientific custom they are named for the area where they were discovered.
10_36	0.0	They include Murray Valley encephalitis in Australia, Japanese encephalitis, and Rocio virus in Brazil and Argentina.
10_37	0.0	They are distinguished in the laboratory by small differences in the proteins in the covering of the virus known as its envelope.
10_38	1.6875	``We don't include West Nile, Japanese and other encephalitis viruses because they have never been known to be here,'' Gubler said, adding that in the New York outbreak, ``we had tunnel vision on St.
10_39	0.0	Louis virus, because all the clinical, epidemiological, laboratory and geographic features pointed to St.
10_40	0.0	Louis''. ``We've learned a lesson here,'' Gubler continued.
10_41	0.0	``We've got to be more open-minded.
10_42	0.0	``Once we get past this crisis, we are going to have to go back and check specimens from CDC and state health departments to see if it has been here, and if so, for how long''.
10_43	4.0	The West Nile virus was discovered in 1937 in Uganda.
10_44	0.0	Since then ``it has rarely reared its head,'' Gubler said, though outbreaks and occasional cases have been reported from Israel, France, Romania and elsewhere in Europe.
10_45	0.0	Presumably the virus was carried northward by birds migrating from Africa.
10_46	2.0	After a nearly two-decade silence, West Nile virus caused a large outbreak in Romania in 1996.
10_47	1.3529411764705883	This year West Nile virus apparently caused illness among humans in Volgograd, Russia, though Gubler said he had received no reply to an inquiry he has made to Russian scientists about the outbreak.
10_48	0.125	Lack of communication among scientists thwarts efforts to learn why a virus is spreading.
10_49	0.21739130434782608	When birds began dying in and near the Bronx Zoo, McNamara, the pathologist there, initially thought they might be due to viruses that cause avian influenza, Newcastle disease, fowl cholera or Eastern equine encephalitis, Gubler said.
10_50	0.0	McNamara sent the specimens to the Department of Agriculture Laboratory at Ames, Iowa, where scientists eliminated those candidates as the cause.
10_51	0.0	Because the Ames laboratory lacked the material to test for the pertinent arboviruses, they forwarded the specimens to CDC, Gubler said.
10_52	2.090909090909091	Gubler said scientists also needed to investigate whether the deaths of the birds indicated that West Nile virus had become more virulent.
10_53	0.38461538461538464	The virus has been shown to stay in the blood of humans longer than other types of encephalitis virus, so that mosquitoes are more likely to pick up and transmit it to other humans.
10_54	0.0	But whether such transmissions occur on a regular basis is not known, Gubler said.
10_55	1.5555555555555556	A main focus will be to prevent a recurrence of the outbreak in New York next summer.
10_56	0.2222222222222222	Scientists do not know whether the virus can persist in infected mosquitoes while they hibernate over the winter, Gubler said.
10_57	0.16666666666666666	In the absence of definitive information, health officials will consider the need to begin control of storm drains to decrease the probability of infected mosquitoes' surviving the winter.

11_4	0.0	The infection is endemic to Africa, Asia and Europe, where it resides harmlessly in many bird species but kills others, according to Bob McLean, head of the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis.
11_5	0.38461538461538464	Humans usually get the disease from mosquito bites when the population of infected city birds is sufficiently large to infect enough mosquitoes.
11_6	2.090909090909091	In 1997, 527 people in Bucharest were ill with West Nile virus, and 50 died.
11_7	0.0	There is no specific treatment for the infection.
11_8	2.111111111111111	The virus may have reached New York last summer in a bird imported from Israel.
11_9	1.2	However, West Nile expert Zdanek Hubalek of the Czech Academy of Sciences, suggests it may have originally escaped from the Sloan-Kettering Institute in New York, where in the 1950s, a strain of the virus was given to 95 terminal cancer patients as an experimental treatment.
11_10	0.8888888888888888	But there is evidence that the New York outbreak last summer which killed thousands of crows, and caused encephalitis in 61 New Yorkers, seven of whom died, resulted from a different strain.
11_11	1.3333333333333333	But what is certain, McLean says, is that as early as last summer the virus had already spread to an alarming extent in the New York area.
11_12	0.0	``It had already infected more than half the local geese and sparrows.
