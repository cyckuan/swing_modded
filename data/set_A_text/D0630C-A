23_4	0.0	But then, this is a national convention where the main commodity these days is irony.
23_5	0.0	Major publishers mounted massive displays that filled two halls of the mammoth Los Angeles Convention Center, but found themselves hawking wares to an ever-diminishing sector of the marketplace.
23_6	0.8928571428571429	Independent booksellers have been assaulted first by chain superstores, then Internet purveyors led by Seattle's Amazon.com, so the ``indies'' have seen their portion of the book market cut in half (to 16.6 percent) during this decade and membership in their trade organization drop from 5,200 to 3,500.
23_7	0.11764705882352941	The convention's first day also included the distressing announcement of a national study that found that, despite a booming economy, sales of books sold to adults dropped 3 percent last year.
23_8	0.11764705882352941	Chain stores claimed 25 percent of sales, while Internet purveyors (measured for the first time) claimed 2 percent, as indie share continued its decline.
23_9	0.34615384615384615	Things have gotten so grim for independents that they come to the annual confab of the American Booksellers Association wondering about the latest book stores killed in action and, as bookseller John Barrigner of Charlotte, N.C., put it, ``which of our good friends we won't see this year''.
23_10	0.0	Worries about their fate have reached such a state that booksellers in their official annual meeting portion of the convention found themselves debating whether to censure McCourt, winner of the Pulitzer Prize and one of the country's best-selling authors.
23_11	0.0	The phenomenal success of ``Angela's Ashes'' had paid many bookseller bills since publication, and it had been given an annual prize (the ABBY award) as the book that independents most enjoyed selling.
23_12	0.0	But McCourt had gone on to commit what some independents considered a traitorous act.
23_13	0.09090909090909091	He had appeared in a TV commercial extolling the virtues of the Web site of Barnes &AMP; Noble.
23_14	0.0	So a handful of upstart independents urged a censure of McCourt and a request that he return his ABBY.
23_15	0.0	The motion failed handily Saturday afternoon, but only after a spirited and sometimes heated debate.
23_16	0.0	``I'm not political, I don't know the details of the bookseller war,'' McCourt said the next morning.
23_17	0.0	``If I had known, I might have thought twice about appearing in that ad.

23_19	0.0	A writer's real job is to write books.
23_20	0.0	But if you look at the stores where I appeared on behalf of `Angela's Ashes,' it was probably 15 to 1 in favor of independents.
23_21	0.0	My conscience is clear''.
23_22	0.0	The McCourt imbroglio was one of the few contentious moments at a convention repeatedly described as ``businesslike''.
23_23	0.0	It may have been held in the city that defines glitz, but the three-day proceedings had a workmanlike air, perhaps in part because the weather outside the hall was chilly and gray and offered little temptation.
23_24	0.0	Even a cocktail party at the Playboy Mansion to celebrate Grove/Atlantic's upcoming publication of ``The Century of Sex'' _ undoubtedly the weekend's hottest ticket _ seemed deflated by the weather.
23_25	0.0	At poolside, chairman Hugh Hefner looked distinctly chilly in his trademark smoking jacket and silk pajama pants, and the two statuesque Playboy Bunnies in their skimpy costumes seemed in real danger of contracting chest colds.
23_26	0.125	The convention's estimated 29,000 visitors were encouraged by some marketplace moves by the ABA, highlighted by the unveiling of the new Web site BookSense.com, which will allow individual independent stores to have their own customized presence on the Internet.
23_27	0.0	It will draw upon the strength of bookseller numbers and process orders from customers.
23_28	0.0	This may not terrify Amazon.com, but it did excite independents.
23_29	0.05	Throughout the weekend, they crowded around demos of the Web site, expected to be running within six months, and a poster was often updated with the number of BookSense enrollees, up to a robust 865 booksellers by Sunday afternoon.
23_30	0.0	Avin Domnitz, ABA executive director, was ecstatic.
23_31	0.0	``When we started introducing BookSense at regional meetings, we hoped to come to this convention with 300 stores enrolled so that it would be a legitimate program,'' Domnitz said.

24_10	0.0	Many owners now admit that the Internet may mean the salvation, and not the destruction, of their brick-and-mortar book nooks after all.
24_11	0.0	At the same time, however, these famously disorganized capitalists are finding out how tough it is to balance the digital and the down-to-earth.
24_12	0.05555555555555555	Successful Internet ventures have begun to distract owners from the business of selling books to walk-in customers, eroding the character and charm that made independents unique, many proprietors fear.
24_13	0.0	``I don't want my bookstore to be the Wal-Mart of the Web,'' said Frank Kramer, owner of the esteemed Harvard Book Store in Cambridge.
24_14	0.0	``We want the Web to drive people to our store, that's the goal.
24_15	0.0	The fact is, we have tremendous potential on the Internet and could increase our sales tremendously, but we enjoy physical retailing''.
24_16	0.0	Ken Gloss, owner of the historic Brattle Book Shop, in downtown Boston, takes great pains to ensure that walk-in customers get treated as well as his on-line patrons, whose mounting orders take more and more time to process.
24_17	0.1	``Any books we put on the Web site we make sure to make available in the store first,'' Gloss said.
24_18	0.0	``We don't want our in-store customers to feel like they're left out''.
24_19	0.04	What many proprietors are finding out is that loyal customers were waiting for their chance to enjoy the convenience of on-line shopping without having to buy books from the massive corporate Web sellers like Barnes &AMP; Noble's on-line store bn.com.
24_20	0.0	``I shop on line because it's convenient, because I have to,'' said Frances Burke, a professor emeritus at Suffolk University, as she bought a book at Avenue Victor Hugo Bookshop.
24_21	0.0	``But whenever I get the chance, I come to the bookstore.
24_22	0.0	I need to touch and smell the books''.
24_23	0.0	As a cradle of the high-tech economy, the Boston area was perhaps destined for the vanguard of on-line book selling.
24_24	0.08333333333333333	Wordsworth.com, created in 1993, was the world's second on-line bookstore, followed closely by Harvard.com, BrooklineBooksmith.com, and a few others.
24_25	0.07142857142857142	But the movement was slow to take off, as shopkeepers either could not afford to create a Web site or saw the creation of one as a violation of their store's identity.
24_26	0.15384615384615385	In January 1996, only 10 shops in the region had Web sites, and two years later, 10 more had joined them.
24_27	0.7222222222222222	Today, however, nearly 150 of the region's 470 independent booksellers, many teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, have Web sites, according to the New England Booksellers Association (NEBA).
24_28	0.9375	That compares with 65 of the 325 stores in the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association, the nation's other storied association of bookstore proprietors.
24_29	0.0	``We've seen a six-fold increase in the past two years,'' said Wayne ``Rusty'' Drugan, the NEBA's executive director.
24_30	0.0	``It's a groundswell''.
24_31	0.0	For some shops, the high-tech effort consists of little more than a few pretty photographs, directions to the store, a telephone number, and some staff recommendations of good reads.
24_32	0.06666666666666667	``I'd have to have a crew of 20 people working constantly to get all my books on the Web site,'' said Gloss, whose site holds just a smattering of his collection.
24_33	0.07692307692307693	Lacking the resources to offer millions of titles like Amazon.com, some owners have instead focused on recreating the intangible qualities of their shops on-line.
24_34	0.0	McCaffrey has a page devoted to Blue, for instance.
24_35	0.0	Gloss offers photos of handsome, leatherbound tomes.
24_36	0.0	The virtual bookstores, they admit, are pathetic by comparison with the real thing.
24_37	0.0	On ``the computer screen, there's no texture, no depth,'' Kramer said.
24_38	0.0	``I don't care how many graphics you have, it doesn't compare to the table, the shelves, the overstock area, the books at the front counter.
24_39	0.0	That has a dimension computer screens cannot accomplish''.
24_40	0.06666666666666667	To make up for the physical shortcomings of the Internet, many storeowners have invested in Web sites that offer depth of stock, on-line ordering, and other conveniences.
24_41	0.0	Most now offer search engines that allow surfers to comb entire store inventories, or even to tap into databases of every book in print.
24_42	0.11764705882352941	In effect, many tiny shops on the corner now have the capability of offerring the same number of books as the massive retail chains like Barnes &AMP; Noble, Borders, or Amazon.com.
24_43	0.1111111111111111	Wordsworth's general manager, Sanj Kharbanda, said his store's Web site now holds about 1.2 million titles, enough variety to bring in about 125 on-line sales a day.
24_44	0.0	That converts to roughly 9 percent of total sales on a given day, he said.
24_45	0.08333333333333333	``In this day and age, the minimum expectation is that we would have a Web site, and being a bookstore, a search function has become a necessary convenience,'' Kharbanda said.
24_46	0.0	And at the Boston Book Company, which occupies a less-than-glamorous second-floor stie in the city's Jamaica Plain neighborhood, Internet sales now account for half the shop's sales, co-owner Helen Kelly said.
24_47	0.1111111111111111	The reason, she said, is the plentiful title list on the store's Web site.
24_48	0.0	Even the slickest home pages, however, seem hopelessly grounded in the physical world, no matter how virtual the shopping experience.
24_49	0.3684210526315789	Few independent booksellers take the time to create customer profiles, or track shoppers' habits, and even fewer have employees dedicated solely to working with on-line customers.
24_50	0.6	As Richard Howorth, president of the American Booksellers Association and owner of a small bookstore in Mississippi, said, ``I have no idea how many hits I get''.
24_51	0.0	Such apparent disdain for mimicking the widely imitated strategies of Amazon.com is apparent in other ways.
24_52	0.18181818181818182	Anirvan Chatterjee, founder of Bookfinder.com, where on-line book buyers browse inventories of thousands of independent bookshops around the world, said on-line book indexes like his have helped independents offer books that appear nowhere on their shelves.
24_53	0.0	With such resources available to booksellers who go on-line, there's plenty of financial sense in shuttering storefronts and doing business solely in cyberspace, Chatterjee said.
24_54	0.0	But so far, most have kept a foot in the physical world.
24_55	0.0	``A lot of sellers are finding that their on-line presence subsidizes their storefront; that just warms my heart,'' Chatterjee said.
24_56	0.0	``Book-selling is a great, historic tradition.
24_57	0.0	Amazon.com is not going to come along and change all that.''
