5_1	0.13247442	In reviewing 188 studies over the past 50 years, Harvard researchers found some evidence that playing and listening to music improves spatial thinking, but little proof that music and art classes help students read better or score higher on tests.

5_4	0.10128961	But Don Campbell, a Colorado musician and journalist who has written two books on the so-called ``Mozart effect'' _ the idea that listening to classical music sharpens the brain _ said the connection between music and thinking defies measurement.
5_5	0.11953565	``The rhythm, harmony and melodies of the music all create different perceptions and sensations within different regions of the brain,'' Campbell said.
5_6	0.058502301	``The Mozart effect is far more than any one study can measure''.
5_7	0.091385154	The idea has sparked widespread interest ever since University of Wisconsin researchers linked music to IQ six years ago.
5_8	0.086432791	In that study, a small group of college students did better on certain spatial-reasoning tests _ such as mentally cutting and folding a piece of paper _ after listening to 10 minutes of Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major.

5_12	0.14171904	Given the national obsession with high-stakes tests, they reasoned, it made sense to promote art and music classes as a way to boost test scores.
5_13	0.063561172	The Harvard study suggests they should take a different tack.

6_27	0.10525745	``We still need to teach the basic skills, but students today need an education that recognizes a much wider range of intellectual abilities and ways of communicating,'' said Ken Robinson, co-chairman of the conference and a professor of arts education at the University of Warwick in England.
6_28	0.095065304	Most arts organizations charge schools a fee for their expertise, ranging from a few dollars per student for a single lecture or performance to upward of $50,000 for ongoing classroom visits and teacher training by several teaching artists.
6_29	0.13470451	``It takes so much extra work to start something like this,'' said Verano LaRue, the arts education specialist at Lotus Music and Dance Studios, which Public School 156 is paying about $40,000 this year to incorporate dance into the school's curriculum.
6_30	0.095907648	At Public School 156 last week, the principal, Martha Rodriguez-Torres, nodded approvingly at a teacher and an aide who were learning steps with the young flamenco dancers, then walked down the hall to offer encouragement to fifth graders writing poems about things that comfort them _ part of a project on Native Americans that uses the help of another cultural group, Teachers and Writers Collaborative.

6_33	0.11139552	Ms. Rodriguez-Torres said that reading and math scores at Public School 156, while still relatively low, have improved since the school won an Annenberg grant two years ago.

6_35	0.10230228	Rodriguez-Torres said.
6_36	0.12619938	But even schools whose principals and teachers highly value the arts may have to work hard to convince parents and even students that they are as important an academic subject as math, reading and science.
6_37	0.090226216	After ebulliently whirling to the flamenco music last week, Katherine Nevarez, a third grader, solemnly said that while the rhythms lingered in her mind all day, dancing was not her favorite subject.

6_39	0.082887493	``But my uncle told me that if I study math I'll get a college degree''.
6_40	0.09658541	(MORE) nn One way of getting families to value the arts as much as they value math is to measure student progress with traditional assessment tools, and New York State has started doing so by introducing standards that outline what students should learn through arts instruction.
6_41	0.094245324	But Terry L.
6_42	0.10145908	Baker, an education consultant who is trying to measure the effectiveness of the Annenberg programs, said educators still are not sure how to assess a student's grasp of such ``abstract, emotional and spiritual'' subjects as music and painting.
6_43	0.1268613	``If the arts are going to be taken seriously, they have to be held accountable in the same way that other disciplines are,'' he said.
6_44	0.074184385	``But we are still some distance from figuring out the best way to do that.''

9_9	0.097289121	Reflecting a growing appreciation for steel drums in the Caribbean and around the world, the drum has even taken a place next to the trumpet and clarinet as a musical option for students at some city schools.
9_10	0.076761424	Its popularity has been increased immeasurably by the annual West Indian American Day Carnival, the sprawling pageant that showcases the artistry of the steel drum.
9_11	0.082371443	This is all a bit of a passage for the pan, which was once burdened by its image as an instrument of rabble-rousers _ an image promoted earlier this century by Trinidad's British rulers, who saw the music as a magnet for subversive gatherings.

11_16	0.084341213	At least one intriguing program is already under development at MIT: the composer Tod Machover is creating a Toy Symphony that will allow children to perform on newly designed electronic instruments such as the ``squeeze tuba'' and the ``musical bug jar''.
11_17	0.091232205	The MIT children's center is scheduled to open in 2003, but two other high-tech learning centers devoted to the arts have already opened their doors.

11_19	0.079659655	31 in San Francisco, has an airy gallery for interactive art.
11_20	0.087445195	Those who ascend the 34,000-square-foot structure's Guggenheim-inspired spiral ramp --a skateboarder's dream -- will discover a digital production studio that gives a crew of children 30 minutes to assemble a short video, using visuals, sounds and graphics of their own devising.
11_21	0.081696531	Ultimately, the videos will be sent out over the Web; at the moment, an archive of recent creations can be accessed.
11_22	0.088796749	The idea of making a video might seem a bit dated, but Sheila Bergman, Zeum director, said, ``We're planting a seed here,'' and indicated that future programs will be more digitally focused.
11_23	0.093164125	Already, the arts center is leading Web-authoring sessions for teens.
11_24	0.07421222	In September, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra unveiled ECHO, an interactive music-learning center nestled in the ensemble's extensively renovated performance complex.

11_30	0.091263986	Hearing them produces a magic moment akin to watching a page of photographic paper bloom into an image in the darkroom.
11_31	0.084040598	The disk's graphic design is dorky, but this and other quibbles are quickly overcome by the sonic results, which mostly sound pretty good, even when a string of random marks is drawn on the score.
11_32	0.080753376	The Web is also acting as a canvas for several noteworthy arts-education ventures.
11_33	0.090858375	ArtsConnectEd, a joint project of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and its neighbor, the ever-progressive Walker Arts Center, was quietly launched last month and is still in its early stages in terms of supplying teachers with lesson plans and other valuable tools.
11_34	0.058929115	But there is already much fun to be had.
11_35	0.081074609	The student-activities section of the ``For Your Classroom'' area has a toy chest's worth of interactive, art-themed games that range from the rudimentary (``Color Your Cabin'') to the highly sophisticated (``Private/Public Space,'' a tutorial in contemporary sculpture).
11_36	0.097002073	``People don't always know they're interested in the (art) object,'' said Kathy Halbreich, the Walker's director.
11_37	0.084506636	``One of the things that ArtsConnectEd begins to do is tie the object into a variety of life experiences.
11_38	0.076455109	There's so many stories there, there's so many opportunities to be charmed by discovery''.
11_39	0.17198399	The Museum of Modern Art in New York has a smaller-scale but similar program in the works.
11_40	0.089089598	``Art Safari,'' scheduled to be launched Dec.
11_41	0.07570972	12, will provide interactive exercises like a Java-enabled area for making collages.
11_42	0.081975756	However, a recent addition to the ``Exhibitions'' area of the MOMA site is likely to appeal mostly to adults: an animated how-to that supplements the museum's display of Joan Miro's ``Black and Red Series'' etchings.
11_43	0.067460583	Behind each of these high-tech teaching tools, there is an educational vision.

13_0	0.16973583	SEATTLE _ Mayor Paul Schell rode into office as the arts mayor, heavily backed by the city's arts groups.
13_1	0.1249786	In a press conference Tuesday morning he plans to earn the title, unveiling a series of proposals to revitalize the city's now creaky commitment to the arts.
13_2	0.11013915	Among his proposals will be a new director for the Seattle Arts Commission.
13_3	0.10118336	Present director Wendy Ceccherelli is moving to a newly created job of chief arts strategist for the Seattle Parks Department, focusing on the arts uses for the 151-acres of Sandpoint Park, now being developed as an addition to Magnuson Park on Sandpoint Way N.E.
13_4	0.10040412	The new space could house low-cost artist studios as well as performing arts spaces.
13_5	0.10114427	Schell will ask the city council for an additional $250,000 for arts from the general fund of next year's budget and increase the One Percent for Art attached to city construction projects to 1.5 Percent for Art.
13_6	0.10765472	In effect, he said, he's doubling the Percent for Arts Program, because he's going to extend the Percent for Arts Program to utilities such as the water and drainage systems located outside but owned by the city.
13_7	0.068739786	The additional money will go not just to visual artists' projects but to projects in a range of disciplines.
13_8	0.10377776	The $250,000 will help implement the mayor's small, concrete proposals to help bring the arts to the city's citizens.
13_9	0.088029002	He has a new slogan he'll try out Tuesday: ``Arts Every Day for Everybody''.
13_10	0.09473445	These ideas include making Sandpoint available for smaller performance arts groups for specific dates, renovating the 600-seat theater on the site.
13_11	0.085695494	On the fourth floor of Seattle Center's Center House will be what the major calls a ``black box'' room or theater space also available to arts groups seeking performance venues.
13_12	0.091032539	Such groups will also be able to book dates at the Museum of History and Industry and the Langston Hughes Cultural Arts Center.
13_13	0.10336733	The Bathhouse Theater at Green Lake will reopen for multiple arts uses, and an study will identity the economic gain provided to the city by individual artists and small arts groups, similar to the one the Allen Foundation funded last year through the Corporate Council for the Arts to study the economic impact of larger arts groups.
13_14	0.10678783	Schell also has big ideas for high tech arts access, hiring a so-called web-master to link arts groups with the schools and empower neighborhoods to continue to create their own arts identities.
13_15	0.106802	The Seattle Public Library system will serve as focal point for information about the city's arts programs.
13_16	0.11285471	Schell's proposals come in response to the recommendations of the Seattle Arts Task Force Report delivered to the mayor in June.
13_17	0.090842195	The 21 artists, arts administrators and community activists who made up the the task force were chosen by Schell and City Council member Nick Licata nine months ago.
13_18	0.08840085	Although Schell's proposals fall short financially of the task force's recommendations, task force members contacted Monday were pleased by the mayor's annoucements.
13_19	0.087880155	Licata, who was out of town, issued a statement saying he was heartened by the mayor's proposals and he views them as a crucial first step.
13_20	0.1014134	Last June, saying that without adequate funding, the arts can't flourish, the task force asked the city to establish a $200 million public endowment for the arts, raising roughly $15.5 million per year for 10 years, eventually going to fund the Seattle Arts Commission.
13_21	0.13149606	In the meantime, the task force recommended that the city set side 1 percent of the general fund to support the arts commission, and that the commission become a city department: the city's centralized art source.
13_22	0.10276702	Schell plans to study and refine the $200 million idea but nixed the other two suggestions, saying the general fund's support for the arts is already more than 1 percent, closer to 1.5 percent, but it's spread over a variety of city agencies instead of centralized in the arts commission.
13_23	0.090844731	He's against centralization, as it turns out, preferring to continue to distribute arts funding not only through the commission but through community parks, libraries, community centers and the Neighborhood Matching Funds.
13_24	0.090600656	Centralizing information about the arts is another matter.
13_25	0.092631981	Schell wants the libraries to eliminate all red tape and give citizens specifics about the arts in a clean and direct fashion.
13_26	0.098784377	Jodee Fenton, library coordinator for fine and performing arts, says the library is already providing art access information, but not enough people know about it.
13_27	0.081941783	``We can do the best job on face of the earth, if nobody knows about it, what difference does it make''? she said.
13_28	0.09683084	Currently, the library provides music listening stations, a piano for practice, and a large collection of scores and recordings for public use, as well as an arts information line, 206-386-4612.
13_29	0.070660802	Arts information is also available through the library online: spl.org.
13_30	0.095753231	In the future, the mayor wants the library to provide exhibition spaces in neighborhood libraries for neighborhood artists; a music ensemble/theater arts room to try out new work, with video equipment available as needed.
13_31	0.11304125	Another information source will be a revitalized ``Seattle Arts'' program on TVSEA, showcasing the Seattle Arts Commission-funded artists and arts organizations.
13_32	0.096841791	Besides the possibility of studios for artists at Sandpoint, Schell is hosting a live/work forum for artists on Oct.
13_33	0.083054982	29. (For more information, call Amy Painter at the Seattle Arts Commision, 206-684-7306).
13_34	0.093326782	On Monday, artist and task force member Barbara Thomas said that however modest people may think the mayor's prospals are, they are specific.
13_35	0.069552277	``They give us a map of what he's thinking,'' she said.
13_36	0.087659676	``The city's commitment to arts was stalled.
13_37	0.072225755	The mayor is laying out where he plans to make his mark.
13_38	0.077990945	Some of his ideas are quite bold, like the increasing the One Percent for Arts.''
14_0	0.10761041	There is a national consensus that students need more competency in reading, math, science and history.
14_1	0.093193203	But Americans also want schools to teach citizenship, healthful lifestyles and creativity.
14_2	0.10769452	When people rely mostly on test scores to assess school quality, do they unwittingly sacrifice these other goals?
14_3	0.10987554	When schools are accountable only for higher scores, teachers inevitably emphasize more easily testable skills.
14_4	0.05089539	Less easily tested ones get shorter shrift.
14_5	0.072792345	For example, it is simpler to test vocabulary than creative writing, so test-driven curriculums may dilute literacy, not enhance it.
14_6	0.057802132	Just as important, tests do not assess important nonacademic competencies.
14_7	0.10793012	The public once trusted teachers and administrators to find a good balance between math, reading, arts, health and other activities.
14_8	0.073914625	They may not always have gotten it right, but today's data-driven accountability systems may not achieve a good balance either.
14_9	0.062799113	If basic skills were undervalued before, they are probably overemphasized now.
14_10	0.032420327	Curriculum planning requires weighing alternatives.
14_11	0.083490029	Teachers must decide whether to devote time to mock elections that develop citizenship habits, or to arithmetic and vocabulary practice.
14_12	0.078543107	Teachers evaluated only by student test scores are less likely to schedule the elections.
14_13	0.044356242	Schools increasingly confront such dilemmas.
14_14	0.084805222	Consider the Academy of Communications and Technology in Chicago, with mostly poor and minority students.
14_15	0.072742287	It may be closed if scores do not improve, so it now requires extra drills in basics.
14_16	0.083715606	To find time, teachers eliminated student discussions and debates of social issues.
14_17	0.064837307	Charlestown High in Boston also enrolls disadvantaged youth.
14_18	0.078710709	It has doubled math and English requirements for half its ninth-graders because they cannot graduate without passing state exams.
14_19	0.093518958	To schedule this extra drill, students must drop an elective, like fine arts or gym.

14_21	0.064677454	, an elementary school has cut back music assemblies and dropped plans for environmental studies because these cannot increase passing rates on statewide exams.
14_22	0.072813836	Certainly, the current math and science focus is working.
14_23	0.071565155	More high schoolers now study precalculus, biology, chemistry and physics.
14_24	0.084445037	Test scores are rising.
14_25	0.074980956	But more teenagers have fatty diets; physical education enrollment has plummeted.

14_27	0.08799764	Neither children nor our economy will prosper if graduates have higher scores, but are overweight, with poor exercise habits or irresponsible sexual behavior.
14_28	0.085544681	Should Charlestown High do less algebra, and increase health education instead?
14_29	0.087918276	Employers today seek workers with problem-solving skills.
14_30	0.091341335	But pressure to raise scores tells schools to de-emphasize cooperative, project-based learning because teamwork is not measured on standardized exams.
14_31	0.079659276	People want schools to teach conflict resolution by negotiation, not violence.
14_32	0.053358847	But there is no standardized test for tolerance.
14_33	0.10031503	It is curious that while Americans hold schools increasingly accountable only for test scores, they also insist that schools do more.
14_34	0.061171255	A recent Gallup poll found that 46 percent of the public wanted schools' main emphasis to be training students to ``take responsibility''.
14_35	0.074264985	Only 39 percent say it should be academics.
14_36	0.074417167	The rest think teaching cooperation should have priority.
14_37	0.06833705	In 1994, Congress set national education goals _ being ``first'' in math and science was one, but others included preparing youth for responsible citizenship (with opportunities for community service), ensuring that students ``are healthy and fit'' and having them ``appreciate the nation's diverse heritage''.
14_38	0.077075831	Academics may be schools' most important activity, but perhaps Americans should sacrifice a few points in seniors' math scores if that is what it takes to inspire more of them to register to vote.
14_39	0.029591277	Perhaps not.
14_40	0.084733081	The public cannot debate these choices if schools are accountable only for basic skills results.
14_41	0.16403878	Standardized tests have improved many American schools.
14_42	0.073453357	Nonetheless, society pays a price for this progress.
14_43	0.092091878	If Americans do not equally demand accountability for less easily measured outcomes, they risk the balanced program they seek from public education.
15_0	0.19355783	ZHENGZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) --Every weekend, students in Zhengzhou can take in a free concert, a traditional Chinese opera or a stage play in the city's Youth and Children's Palace, as part of a project to improve the younger generation's education in the arts.

24_4	0.10415856	For one thing, she says, when the music's on in the car, her kids begin to notice the outside world.

24_9	0.098421869	The theory is that although classical music has a calming effect on anyone, it is especially important to young children, whose minds are quickly developing and who need positive stimuli.
24_10	0.086528556	Based on studies in 1993 and 1995 at the University of California-Irvine, the Mozart effect has become the latest craze in child development, bringing with it several popular parenting books and an onslaught of CDs _ all aimed at directing American parents toward the music and at giving them one more factor in the formula for effective parenting.
24_11	0.07195	But is cranking up the notes of dead European composers hype or helpful?
24_12	0.068378709	This summer, some researchers stepped forward to rebut the theory behind the Mozart effect.

24_17	0.082338424	9 by Free Press (hardcover, $25), Bruer makes a case that too much emphasis has been placed on brain development in the first three years of life.
24_18	0.092134474	He writes that ``... there is no evidence at all for the claims that listening to classical CDs improves children's spatial reasoning skills''.
24_19	0.075352177	Kenneth Steele agrees.
24_20	0.082150126	A psychology professor at North Carolina's Appalachian State University, Steele says the Mozart effect does not exist, that the original conclusions of the California studies don't hold up.
24_21	0.099056556	Remember, says Steele, that the original studies didn't even include young children _ they were performed on college students, who were played classical music and then asked to immediately do a specific spatial-reasoning task having to do with folding and cutting a piece of paper.
24_22	0.075646796	This is, he says, hardly a measure of any sort of long-term brain developmental abilities.
24_23	0.082761459	Steele says he replicated the test exactly and found that there was virtually no difference in performance levels among subjects who listened to nothing, a Mozart sonata and a work of modern composer Philip Glass.
24_24	0.091904637	``We got no effect,'' Steele says; the results of his study were published in July in ``Psychological Science''.
24_25	0.069031924	``These students were equivalent across the board; their performance was the same''.
24_26	0.078424075	However, Bruer and other naysayers are still clearly in the minority, as the signs of Mozart madness proliferate.
24_27	0.10019257	Numerous stores offer display racks of baby-themed classical CDs, such as ``Baby Needs Mozart''.
24_28	0.090249071	Three of the 15 top-selling classical albums in the country are credited to Don Campbell, the author whose bestselling 1997 book ``The Mozart Effect'' (Avon hardcover, $24), has become the standard text for those who believe in the effect.

24_31	0.065516691	For many Mozart-effect aficionados, the theory makes sense.
24_32	0.082934954	Californian Heidi Brende, who teaches piano, says that classical music helps calm her 2 1/2-year-old, Carter, and her newborn, Emma.
24_33	0.087853683	``Classical music stimulates the same neural pathways used for complex reasoning tasks,'' says Brende, who has recorded two CDs of classical pieces, ``SmartPlay With Classical'' and ``SmartSleep With Classical,'' that are sold in stores nationwide.

24_36	0.086678532	But critics like Steele say it may be something as simple as people's need to believe that actually gives the theory its power.
24_37	0.076454357	The whole Mozart-effect craze hinges greatly on people's desire to do something good for their children.
24_38	0.092317147	Parents who play their kids the music of Mozart feel some peace of mind from their belief that they're helping their child's development.
24_39	0.085253258	But there's something else fueling the rush to Mozart, too, Steele says with a laugh.
24_40	0.047980222	It all comes down to the money.
