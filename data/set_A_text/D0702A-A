7_2	0.1117566	Kapell's support for classical music comes not just from his belief in the value of the arts but also from his personal history.
7_3	0.093557861	He is the son of the pianist William Kapell, who died in a plane crash in 1953 when he was just 31 and at the peak of acclaim.
7_4	0.086573269	At the time, David Kapell was 4.
7_5	0.074847821	Kapell's mission has been aided by another Greenport resident, John Serkin, also the son of a famous pianist.
7_6	0.083867595	Serkin, the third of Rudolf Serkin's six children and a onetime French horn player, is now a piano technician and tuner and serves on the village's Arts and Culture Committee.
7_7	0.16640933	He was instrumental in working out the details of the new arts program, which will bring students from the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia to classrooms in Greenport, where they will discuss and perform music.
7_8	0.083395735	Rudolf Serkin, who died in 1991, was a longtime director of the Curtis Institute.
7_9	0.10584702	To raise money for the program, Serkin has solicited the help of his younger brother, the pianist Peter Serkin, who is to play a benefit recital on Sunday at 2 p.m. in the Greenport School Auditorium.
7_10	0.063324218	Serkin will perform on a grand piano provided by Steinway &AMP; Sons in Manhattan.
7_11	0.062030632	With this gesture, the company is both supporting the educational initiative and honoring the memory of two major pianists who were exclusive Steinway artists.
7_12	0.077455954	The piano, valued at $50,000, is essentially being lent to the school, though the term the company prefers is ``long-term placement''.
7_13	0.092866443	It will be moved to the auditorium for Serkin's recital but will be kept permanently in a new wing of the village's Floyd Memorial Library, where the Curtis students will present concerts in conjunction with their work in the classrooms.
7_14	0.090077856	``We couldn't be more grateful,'' Kapell said recently, speaking of the contributions from the Steinway company and Peter Serkin.
7_15	0.1382571	``The arts program in Greenport has been minimal, if anything.
7_16	0.090567234	Our kids were missing cultural expansion, which is a shame''.
7_17	0.096617625	The benefit recital should generate enough money to support the music program for a full three years, John Serkin said.
7_18	0.11817522	The program has two goals: nurturing aspiring musicians and developing appreciation and audiences for the arts.
7_19	0.071754108	The response, Kapell said, is ``really surprising'' and ``very encouraging''.
7_20	0.075257265	The hall, which seats more than 700, is sold out for Sunday's concert, and the waiting list for tickets is approaching 100.
7_21	0.081338778	``It's overwhelmingly local people who are coming, people who live within 10 miles of the village,'' Kapell said.
7_22	0.067502063	And, thanks to benefactors who contributed $500 each, at least 150 seats will be occupied free by students from nearby school districts.
7_23	0.08205695	The mayor described Greenport as a ``true blue-collar town, fundamentally,'' though this ``belies the broader demographics'' of the area and its small, stable and diverse economy.
7_24	0.077915911	Local industries include fishing, wineries, retail and tourism.

8_0	0.10937903	Thanks in part to programs like this, attitudes toward arts education have begun to change.
8_1	0.081297048	Buoyed by a revived economy, California politicians have, like their national counterparts, put education on the front burner.
8_2	0.10082287	And arts education has crept back onto the agenda in part because of lobbying from the entertainment industry.
8_3	0.054209231	``There's great demand for talented visual artists, but unfortunately we have to get people from outside California and the U.S.,'' said Scott Ross, a co-founder, with the director James Cameron, of Digital Domain, a visual effects studio in Los Angeles.
8_4	0.19151031	Delaine Easton, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, has called for the restoration of arts education in California public schools.
8_5	0.10253536	And last March the Los Angeles school district passed stringent graduation requirements citywide in visual arts, music, theater and dance, for kindergarten through grade 12.
8_6	0.084486162	``The hard part now is the implementation,'' said Don Dustin, the district's director of visual and performing arts.
8_7	0.097402848	``We do not have the resources, the background, the personnel''.
8_8	0.08501489	Inner City Arts, only nine years ago a modest alternative, does.
8_9	0.11992685	After the construction of Inner City Arts, Maltzan designed a new arts complex, completed in March, at Harvard/Westlake School, a private, affluent junior-senior high school in North Hollywood.
8_10	0.09762153	It is an equally forceful architectural composition of art rooms and art gallery.
8_11	0.093958153	Perhaps most important, the buildings surround a much-used communal plaza.
8_12	0.10467951	Enrollment in art classes has increased since the recent opening.
8_13	0.095277688	While Inner City Arts may be a curricular model, it is less likely to be an architectural one.
8_14	0.10683814	Because many public schools are struggling simply to keep roofs from leaking and bathrooms cleaned, concern for the surroundings as an educational asset is not a priority.
8_15	0.097476961	Even at Inner City Arts and Harvard-Westlake, Maltzan initially faced resistance to lavishing effort on the architecture.
8_16	0.10231287	At Inner City Arts, he said, ``they were used to living off donated paper''.
8_17	0.094951216	At Harvard-Westlake, the school deemed teachers and computers paramount and architecture as enclosure.
8_18	0.081898838	``In lay people's minds and the minds of most trustees,'' said Thomas Hudnut, Harvard-Westlake's headmaster, ``architecture implies added expense.

9_0	0.12003627	In findings that will dismay some arts advocates, a Harvard study released Wednesday casts doubt on the link between the arts and academic achievement.
9_1	0.15414539	In reviewing 188 studies over the past 50 years, Harvard researchers found some evidence that playing and listening to music improves spatial thinking, but little proof that music and art classes help students read better or score higher on tests.
9_2	0.13294019	``We're not saying don't use the arts in presenting other topics,'' said study co-author Lois Hetland, a psychologist affiliated with Harvard's Graduate School of Education.
9_3	0.081731354	``We're saying don't risk putting all your eggs in the basket that art will raise math scores, because the evidence is not strong enough to support that argument''.
9_4	0.10908196	But Don Campbell, a Colorado musician and journalist who has written two books on the so-called ``Mozart effect'' _ the idea that listening to classical music sharpens the brain _ said the connection between music and thinking defies measurement.
9_5	0.10202114	``The rhythm, harmony and melodies of the music all create different perceptions and sensations within different regions of the brain,'' Campbell said.
9_6	0.089082036	``The Mozart effect is far more than any one study can measure''.
9_7	0.064342664	The idea has sparked widespread interest ever since University of Wisconsin researchers linked music to IQ six years ago.
9_8	0.072076817	In that study, a small group of college students did better on certain spatial-reasoning tests _ such as mentally cutting and folding a piece of paper _ after listening to 10 minutes of Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major.
9_9	0.066515099	Despite warnings from the Wisconsin researchers not to read too much into the results, the study spawned a cottage industry of classical music videotapes and CD's designed to help infants, or even fetuses, think better.
9_10	0.086299373	Georgia and a handful of other states even began handing out classical music CD's to new mothers.
9_11	0.1303797	Meanwhile, advocates for school art and music classes, trying to reverse decades of budget cuts by cost-conscious school boards, began pointing to the Wisconsin study and others like it to bolster their arguments.
9_12	0.14303361	Given the national obsession with high-stakes tests, they reasoned, it made sense to promote art and music classes as a way to boost test scores.
9_13	0.088944945	The Harvard study suggests they should take a different tack.
9_14	0.059398569	Hetland and co-author, Ellen Winner, discovered a connection between music and spatial thinking and between drama and verbal skills such as reading, writing, and oral understanding.
9_15	0.19416765	But they didn't find any solid evidence that music, art and dance improve reading, or that classes in the arts improve test scores.
9_16	0.12589568	Hetland says she's a strong supporter of art and music classes, but that they deserve a place in the curriculum on their own merits.
9_17	0.093005799	``We don't ask history to justify itself on the basis of whether it raises English scores.
9_18	0.09485442	It's valuable on its own,'' she said.
9_19	0.1291016	Holly Rose of the Creative Movement and Arts Center near Boston, has been introducing children to music and dance for 20 years.
9_20	0.0963906	She said music has a developmental impact, if not a direct academic one.
9_21	0.077759987	``Music really enhances the learning experience, even if it doesn't necessarily spawn geniuses or people who excel in particular areas,'' Rose said.
9_22	0.132092	Still, some arts educators insist that music and art classes can affect overall student achievement.
9_23	0.13175155	Arnold Aprill of the Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education said expanding the arts in Chicago schools has improved students' attitudes toward other subjects, spurred parents to get more involved, and even raised test scores.
9_24	0.13447214	``When the arts become integrated into the curriculum they are an important part of whole school improvement that shouldn't be ignored,'' Aprill said.
10_0	0.098736105	There is a national consensus that students need more competency in reading, math, science and history.
10_1	0.096124063	But Americans also want schools to teach citizenship, healthful lifestyles and creativity.
10_2	0.088680054	When people rely mostly on test scores to assess school quality, do they unwittingly sacrifice these other goals?
10_3	0.10706053	When schools are accountable only for higher scores, teachers inevitably emphasize more easily testable skills.
10_4	0.095845544	Less easily tested ones get shorter shrift.
10_5	0.097438708	For example, it is simpler to test vocabulary than creative writing, so test-driven curriculums may dilute literacy, not enhance it.
10_6	0.091122949	Just as important, tests do not assess important nonacademic competencies.
10_7	0.086675343	The public once trusted teachers and administrators to find a good balance between math, reading, arts, health and other activities.
10_8	0.090000479	They may not always have gotten it right, but today's data-driven accountability systems may not achieve a good balance either.
10_9	0.090623977	If basic skills were undervalued before, they are probably overemphasized now.
10_10	0.081705418	Curriculum planning requires weighing alternatives.
10_11	0.086378486	Teachers must decide whether to devote time to mock elections that develop citizenship habits, or to arithmetic and vocabulary practice.
10_12	0.091044619	Teachers evaluated only by student test scores are less likely to schedule the elections.
10_13	0.090086262	Schools increasingly confront such dilemmas.

10_16	0.067933563	To find time, teachers eliminated student discussions and debates of social issues.
10_17	0.076685115	Charlestown High in Boston also enrolls disadvantaged youth.

10_19	0.087725541	To schedule this extra drill, students must drop an elective, like fine arts or gym.

10_29	0.094307167	Employers today seek workers with problem-solving skills.
10_30	0.083285367	But pressure to raise scores tells schools to de-emphasize cooperative, project-based learning because teamwork is not measured on standardized exams.
10_31	0.091287516	People want schools to teach conflict resolution by negotiation, not violence.
10_32	0.087199738	But there is no standardized test for tolerance.
10_33	0.097811273	It is curious that while Americans hold schools increasingly accountable only for test scores, they also insist that schools do more.
10_34	0.10343906	A recent Gallup poll found that 46 percent of the public wanted schools' main emphasis to be training students to ``take responsibility''.
10_35	0.092812186	Only 39 percent say it should be academics.
10_36	0.093194111	The rest think teaching cooperation should have priority.
10_37	0.095864868	In 1994, Congress set national education goals _ being ``first'' in math and science was one, but others included preparing youth for responsible citizenship (with opportunities for community service), ensuring that students ``are healthy and fit'' and having them ``appreciate the nation's diverse heritage''.
10_38	0.087024291	Academics may be schools' most important activity, but perhaps Americans should sacrifice a few points in seniors' math scores if that is what it takes to inspire more of them to register to vote.
10_39	0.10083019	Perhaps not.
10_40	0.093330277	The public cannot debate these choices if schools are accountable only for basic skills results.

12_20	0.075195899	A psychology professor at North Carolina's Appalachian State University, Steele says the Mozart effect does not exist, that the original conclusions of the California studies don't hold up.
12_21	0.10259047	Remember, says Steele, that the original studies didn't even include young children _ they were performed on college students, who were played classical music and then asked to immediately do a specific spatial-reasoning task having to do with folding and cutting a piece of paper.
12_22	0.092691343	This is, he says, hardly a measure of any sort of long-term brain developmental abilities.
12_23	0.068976851	Steele says he replicated the test exactly and found that there was virtually no difference in performance levels among subjects who listened to nothing, a Mozart sonata and a work of modern composer Philip Glass.

17_6	0.12277606	In effect, he said, he's doubling the Percent for Arts Program, because he's going to extend the Percent for Arts Program to utilities such as the water and drainage systems located outside but owned by the city.

21_64	0.11872726	``I don't need proof,'' said Lisha Papert Lercari, director of the Music and the Brain Project of the 42nd Street Development Fund in Manhattan, which has developed a keyboard program that is now being taught in 23 schools ``The kids are discovering form and patterns, and noticing things we never saw''.
21_65	0.080768557	She said the keyboard training, which involves reading music, also helped immigrant Hispanic children in Queens pick up English unusually fast, a language effect she expects to document in a nearly completed study.
21_66	0.096707348	Educators like Lercari regard Rauscher, one of the original Mozart-effect researchers, as their spokeswoman.
21_67	0.090861978	Not surprisingly, Rauscher was elated by the advance news of Hetland's report.
21_68	0.090127643	``I think that to ignore these findings is really to do a disservice to the children who can benefit most from them, especially disadvantaged children,'' Rauscher said.
21_69	0.093793362	``These are kids whose parents can't afford the time or the money to take them to piano lessons.
21_70	0.10252292	They really rely on the public schools for this, and a prekindergarten program would be the ideal place to start''.
21_71	0.095606146	Rauscher, a former concert cellist who is now an assistant professor of cognitive development at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh, has conducted her own research since 1993 and consistently found higher spatial-reasoning scores correlating with keyboard and xylophone instruction for elementary school children.
21_72	0.091800053	Singing also has its place in the new emphasis on musicmaking.
21_73	0.16564564	In White Plains, N.Y., which was recently named one of the top 10 communities in the country for music education in a survey conducted by the American Music Conference, the National Association for Music Education, the Music Teachers National Association and the National School Boards Association, singing is being integrated into prekindergarten and kindergarten classrooms.
21_74	0.12609014	Teresa Niss, coordinator of fine arts programs in the White Plains schools, said that if kindergarten children are learning about the letter ``S,'' for example, they may sing songs about snakes and starfish.
21_75	0.069949071	Musical counts help illustrate groups of numbers, while songs sung in connection with pictures facilitate reading.
21_76	0.09395527	``We have seen changes in children's language development faster than we normally would,'' she said.
21_77	0.1058349	The district is 35 percent Hispanic, and like Lercari, Niss said that Hispanic children arriving in school without knowledge of English ``are acquiring the language more quickly'' after their exposure to the music program.

21_83	0.14099046	The class illustrated Neelly's view that music should flow naturally throughout the school day, much as the arts are taught ``through the curriculum'' in some middle and high schools.
21_84	0.092957737	For this to happen, classroom teachers must also become musicmakers, and part of Neelly's job was to show them how.
21_85	0.092470823	For example, one technique was to ask the teachers to sing in a higher key than normal so that children could replicate the sound.
21_86	0.091300725	``Children will sing in tune if they sing higher,'' Niss said.
21_87	0.084174484	All the musical failures critics portray seemed to fall on the small shoulders of Aifa, who was silent when it was her turn to sing her name in a White Plains classroom.

21_89	0.077818595	Neelly moved on to the next child, but when the group sang together later, Aifa joined in.
21_90	0.081897	No longer in the spotlight, she found her natural voice, which, music advocates say, is like finding herself.
