5_0	0.0	A highly respected neuroscientist has developed a provocative new theory of how the brain is organized which, if confirmed, would explain how and why the mind produces symptoms found in several seemingly unrelated disorders.
5_1	0.7428571428571429	According to the theory, the deep sadness in severe depression, the hand wringing in obsessive compulsive disorder, the ringing in the ears of tinnitus, the unrelenting discomfort of chronic pain and the shaking and immobility seen Parkinson's disease all stem from the same basic brain defect _ a decoupling of two brain regions that normally fire their cells in synchrony.
5_2	0.3333333333333333	If the theory is correct, it would explain why a experimental surgical techniques involving implanting electrodes in the brain to treat Parkinson's disease and depression seem to work so well, and it would expand their application to other brain diseases.

5_12	0.0	Because these new insights into brain organization, if confirmed, would almost certainly promote the use of surgery to treat psychiatric and neurological diseases, other scientists urged caution in applying the theory.
5_13	0.0	They are concerned because psychosurgeries that were tried 30 to 40 years ago in these same regions of the brain made many people mentally incompetent.
5_14	0.2	The theory involves two brain areas _ the cerebral cortex and the thalamus _ and how they communicate.
5_15	0.0	The cortex is a thickly folded band of tissue that carries out higher mental capacities in humans and other mammals.
5_16	0.0	It is composed of six layers of cells that are highly interconnected and organized into specialized regions that allow people to move their bodies, plan for the future, talk, listen, sense touch, respond to emotions and carry out other functions.
5_17	0.0	The sixth layer of these cells is also directly connected through nerve fibers to cells in the thalamus, an older brain structure that is just under the cortex.
5_18	0.0	The thalamus is usually thought of as a relay station.
5_19	0.2	Virtually all information flowing from the outside world and lower brain regions must go through the thalamus before being passed on to the cortex.
5_20	0.0	But according to Llinas, the thalamus does much more than simply pass information.
5_21	0.0	The way that it coordinates its activity with the cortex, he says, gives rise not only to the symptoms seen in many neurological and psychiatric diseases, but to consciousness itself.
5_22	0.0	It does so through what Llinas calls thalamo-cortical oscillations.
5_23	0.0	The thalamus contains special cells that pass tiny electrical currents across their membranes in a highly coordinated manner, Llinas said in a telephone interview.
5_24	0.08333333333333333	Rather than firing sporadically and singly, like other nerve cells, the cells in the thalamus oscillate, firing in groups together at various frequencies.
5_25	0.0	By virtue of their connections, these thalamic cel cause cells in layer six _ the layer of the cortex closest to them _ to oscillate at the same frequency.
5_26	0.0	This coordination between these oscillating cells in the cortex and thalamus, which are constantly flipping signals back and forth, binds information from different regions of the brain into complete actions, perceptions, movements and into consciousness itself, he said.
5_27	0.0	When the cells oscillate at a high frequency, the brain is awake and alert.
5_28	0.0	When they fall into low frequencies, the brain becomes disconnected, unconscious and falls asleep.
5_29	0.0	In studying patients with various brain diseases, Llinas and his colleagues noticed that particular regions of their thalamuses oscillated at abnormally low frequencies, as if those regions were asleep.
5_30	0.0	When this happens, Llinas said, key parts of the cortex are decoupled from the thalamus.
5_31	0.0	Those parts of the cortex then become overly excited because they are no longer under proper control, he said, and symptoms of dysfunction emerge.
5_32	0.07142857142857142	For example, a defect in one tiny part of the thalamus that projects to one of the higher areas controlling movements can cause those movements to become uncoordinated.
5_33	0.8333333333333334	The result is the tremors seen in Parkinson's disease.
5_34	0.0	If the defect is a fraction of an inch away, a different part of the region controlling movement is affected, resulting in the rigidity seen in many patients.
5_35	0.0	Chronic-pain sufferers also have sluggish regions of the thalamus, Llinas said.
5_36	0.1	Areas of the cortex that deal with pain become overexcited, producing intense discomfort that does not respond to drugs.
5_37	0.2	Llinas speculates that the same underlying defect causes some types of depression, most tinnitus and obsessive compulsive disease.
5_38	0.11764705882352941	In each case, according to his theory, a part of the thalamus is out of phase with the cortex which, unregulated, produces symptoms of profound sadness, ringing in the ears or endless hand washing.
5_39	0.9090909090909091	All these disorders might be treated by implanting electrodes into the thalamus to break the abnormal oscillation patterns, Llinas said.
5_40	0.35714285714285715	The most effective treatment for Parkinson's patients who do not respond to drug therapy involves putting electrodes directly into the thalamus.
5_41	0.1111111111111111	``This breaks the abnormal disconnection and the person immediately gets better,'' Llinas said.

6_11	0.0	"An exaggerated sense that something doesn't look right" seems to have origins in brain chemistry, Hollander said.
6_12	0.25	He and his colleagues reported in Archives of General Psychiatry on the effects of the drug clomipramine on the brain chemical serotonin.
6_13	0.0	One of serotonin's normal roles seems to be in turning off brain processes that signal when "things don't fit our conceived notions," Hollander said.
6_14	0.0	If serotonin levels are abnormally low, however, it can't turn off the mental alarm bell that rings when things don't seem right, and the bell keeps on ringing even when things are right, he said.
6_15	0.0	Clomipramine helps the brain raise serotonin levels by interfering with the body's ability to destroy the chemical, he said.
6_16	0.4	Hollander and his colleagues wanted to be sure clomipramine was producing improvements in the behavior of people with body dysmorphic disorder, and that the patients were not improving simply because they knew they were getting treatment and therefore expected themselves to improve.
6_17	0.2727272727272727	So the researchers compared clomipramine with another drug, desipramine, which had similar side effects but does not affect serotonin.

6_23	0.0	Although this study did not focus on muscle dysmorphia, treatment for body dysmorphia has been shown to work on muscle dysmorphia, Hollander said.
6_24	0.2	And a clinician who was not involved in the study said she found the drug to work, especially in combination with psychological therapy.
6_25	0.0	"I don't feel behavior therapy is sufficient, and certainly medications are not efficacious alone either," said Fugen Neziroglu, senior clinical director of the Bio-Behavioral Institute in Great Neck, N.Y.

6_28	0.0	"You look at him and you know he has no flab".
6_29	0.0	Medications help to stabilize patients with muscle dysmorphia, but therapy is needed to retrain habits and thought patterns needed to make the improvements last, Neziroglu said.
6_30	0.0	Clomipramine is one of the better drugs, she said.
6_31	0.0	And therapy alone may be adequate treatment, said James Rosen, a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Vermont.
6_32	0.0	The cognitive-behavioral approach teaches patients to realize when their thoughts are unrealistic, recast their self-image into more neutral terms, and adapt to situations that could set off the compulsion, he said.
6_33	0.0	For muscle dysmorphia, this could include easing away from the idea that the exercisers would lose control of themselves if they skip a workout, Rosen said.
6_34	0.0	However, one bodybuilding promoter said he couldn't tell whether bodybuilders have this condition.
6_35	0.0	High-level bodybuilders are like other athletes in paying extremely close attention to what they eat, how much they exercise and where they fall short of their own goals, said James Lorimer of the Arnold Schwarzenegger Fitness Weekend, Feb.

8_4	0.0	Parr's pager had been beeping constantly as news outlets around the world read an Associated Press story quoting Stone extensively about the massacre at Columbine last week.
8_5	0.0	Much of what the sheriff said about the the existence of evidence and fresh suspects conflicted with what his officers had announced to the world hours earlier.
8_6	0.0	It looked bad.
8_7	0.0	``I'm not going to go on global television and say my boss has made a mistake,'' Parr, a 20-year veteran of police work who has been pulled off patrol to help handle the media swarm since the massacre, said on Wednesday.
8_8	0.0	``I'll slit my wrists, but I'm not going to do that''.
8_9	0.0	Ever so delicately, Parr and Steve Davis, a sheriff's deputy who serves as the department spokesman, spent most of Wednesday clarifying their boss' comments amid growing criticism of the police response to the massacre, in which 2 seniors killed a teacher and 12 classmates last Tuesday before turning their guns on themselves.
8_10	0.0	The department is also being questioned about its handling of complaints a year ago that one of the gunmen, Eric Harris, had threatened a classmate over the Internet, a matter that is now under investigation.
8_11	0.0	Among the corrections of the sheriff's statements: Three students in black trench coats who were detained at Columbine last Tuesday and then released are not targets of the investigation, but in fact have been cleared.
8_12	0.0	The videotape showing the carnage in the cafeteria is still being analyzed, and may not show the gunmen firing at the students.
8_13	0.07692307692307693	There is no evidence that Harris and his friend Dylan Klebold, the other gunman, tried to escape and were stopped by sheriff's deputies.
8_14	0.0	Investigators are eager to make arrests, but there is no indication they will come as soon as Friday.

8_22	0.2	A Defense Department source also confirmed on Wednesday that Harris, 18, was rejected from the United States Marine Corps because he had been taking the drug Luvox, an antidepressant often used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder.

8_31	0.0	The authorities said on Wednesday that they still think that others might have helped Harris and Klebold carry out their deadly mission and have ``high hopes'' for future arrests.
8_32	0.0	But so far, no suspects have been identified.

20_20	0.0	According to Rushton, heightened awareness among clinicians stems in part from mental health research conducted during the 1990s, which provided evidence that identifiable, biologically-based mental illnesses, such as depression, can occur in children as young as 2 or 3 years old.
20_21	0.7692307692307693	Another factor underlying the rise in prescriptions, says Rushton, is the emergence of a new class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil, which have fewer, less serious side effects than the previous generation of antidepressants.

20_35	0.0	Many insurance companies restrict access to psychiatric specialists, limit the number of visits for psychotherapy and encourage primary care physicians to prescribe medications rather than to try longer-term psychosocial interventions.

23_0	0.06666666666666667	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The widely used antidepressant Zoloft also should be approved for treating posttraumatic stress syndrome, a federal advisory panel said Friday.
23_1	0.3888888888888889	But panelists cautioned the drug so far seems to help only women, not men, with the anxiety disorder, which can result after a life-threatening or otherwise traumatic experience such as combat, rape, assault or a natural disaster.
23_2	0.07692307692307693	Symptoms of posttraumatic stress include flashbacks, nightmares, persistently avoiding reminders of the event, survivor guilt, insomnia and depression.
23_3	0.0	Many psychiatrists have long prescribed antidepressants along with psychological therapy to treat posttraumatic stress.
23_4	0.0	But if the Food and Drug Administration specifically approves Zoloft's use, manufacturer Pfizer Inc.
23_5	0.14285714285714285	will be allowed to advertise the drug for such treatment, potentially widening sales.
23_6	1.0	Zoloft already treats depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder.
23_7	0.0	Pfizer conducted four clinical trials of Zoloft to treat posttraumatic stress.
23_8	0.0	In two of the studies, Zoloft failed to work any better than the placebo, while it alleviated symptoms better than the placebo in another two studies.
23_9	0.0	Consequently, FDA's scientific advisory panel voted 6-2, with one abstention, that Zoloft's new use should be approved.
23_10	0.0	The FDA is not bound by its advisers' recommendations but typically follows them.
23_11	0.0	However, the drug's effectiveness was almost exclusively found in women, the FDA said.
23_12	0.0	One study in which Zoloft failed, in fact, was a study of male combat veterans.
23_13	0.0	The FDA's advisers said this gender effect must be noted on Zoloft's label if the drug is sold for posttraumatic stress.
