0_10	0.14438647	In London, British Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd said the success in ratifying the treaty ``reflects the international community's determination to rid the world of anti-personnel mines, and sends a clear signal to those who have not signed.

2_1	0.1817467	When meeting with Axworthy, Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz said if Israel signs the treaty, it will become easier for Lebanon to sign it.

2_3	0.087838795	Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berry expressed the same idea at the meeting.
2_4	0.10674401	Lebanon rejected the signing to the ban because the Islamic resistance in the south uses anti-personnel weapons in its fight against Israeli occupation.

8_2	0.046614881	But what kind of legacy is it?
8_3	0.23447609	Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use, production and stockpiling, anti-personnel land mines appear to be as popular as ever in fighting wars these days.
8_4	0.068693666	Yugoslav troops planted thousands of them during 18 months of civil war in Kosovo.

8_8	0.18951075	In a survey completed last April, the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, reported that governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines in the 15 months after the treaty was signed, though before it officially went into force.

8_14	0.10324423	On the contrary, they point to progress that has been made, especially in reducing the worldwide production of mines and their availability in the international arms market, according to arms control monitors.
8_15	0.12383366	Mary Fowler, the deputy chief of the U.N.'s Mine Action Service in New York, noted that the countries that have signed on to a ban have destroyed 14 million mines that had been stockpiled when the treaty was written two years ago.
8_16	0.17357394	Even countries that have so far refused to sign the treaty _ including the United States and Russia _ have pledged to stop exporting mines and to stop making certain kinds altogether.
8_17	0.085029033	Perhaps the treaty's greatest impact has been on public perception.
8_18	0.081263531	Reports of mines now evoke images of legless veterans, of maimed children, of Diana in protective gear walking near a minefield in Angola.

8_23	0.077450228	Still, as events have shown, a standard is one thing, the eradication of mines another.
8_24	0.057381018	Mines are cheap and durable and deadly.
8_25	0.088487258	In Yugoslavia, which has not signed the treaty, Serbian troops heavily mined the routes along the mountainous borders with Albania and Macedonia that the Kosovo Liberation Army used to get in and out of the province; that forced the guerrillas into areas that exposed them to Yugoslav fire.

8_30	0.086706913	There is no governing organization to oversee it and no mechanism to punish those who violate it.

8_35	0.11037168	There is universal agreement among the treaty's supporters that the biggest obstacle to that is the fact that the United States won't sign it.

8_37	0.1288786	They insist they need the most common type of land mines _ those left buried in the ground _ to protect South Korea from North Korea.
8_38	0.092577937	They also want to keep using ``smart'' anti-personnel mines, sophisticated devices that self-destruct after a time, to shield larger anti-tank mines, which are not prohibited by the treaty since the weight of a human is not enough to trigger them.
8_39	0.14975801	The administration has pledged to sign the treaty in the future _ but only after the Pentagon develops alternatives to mines, a process critics say has moved slowly.
