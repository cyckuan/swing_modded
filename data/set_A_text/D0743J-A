17_0	0.13157202	SAN FRANCISCO _ Earthquake forecasters apparently predicted the devastating quake in Turkey in an article published in a scientific journal in 1997.
17_1	0.042392113	It might have been just a lucky guess.
17_2	0.063359421	Still, if it was a guess, it was a remarkably good one.
17_3	0.047332382	In the scientific article, two U.S.
17_4	0.098495723	Geological Survey researchers from Menlo Park and a Turkish colleague forecast a small possibility of ``a large event south of the major western port city of Izmit,'' probably centered on the Sapanca Fault, within the next 30 years.
17_5	0.12806377	Early Tuesday morning, a magnitude 7.4 quake struck a few miles south of Izmit.
17_6	0.10811359	Early indications are that the epicenter was on the Sapanca Fault, which stems from the larger North Anatolian Fault system.
17_7	0.07914913	The article, published in Geophysical Research International and titled ``Progressive Failure on the North Anatolian Fault Since 1939 by Earthquake Stress Triggering,'' was written by veteran USGS researchers Ross S.

17_10	0.10135857	Barka of the department of geology at Istanbul Technical University.
17_11	0.094921564	``The earthquake occurred right in this area that we described,'' Dieterich said in an interview Wednesday.
17_12	0.071482218	``This earthquake does fit what we had roughly described in this paper''.
17_13	0.090049886	At the same time, he said, ``I'm a little bit reluctant to claim that we forecast the earthquake,'' mainly because they assigned only a 12 percent probability to it.
17_14	0.098203071	Stein, Dieterich and Barka based their forecast partly on their study of a remarkable long-term trend in Turkish earthquakes.
17_15	0.089039356	Since 1939, 11 quakes have occurred at sites along the North Anatolian Fault that are almost always progressively farther to the west with each occurrence, ``like falling dominoes,'' as the scientists described it.
17_16	0.095202637	The quake sequence along the North Anatolian Fault zone is unusual in that no other fault zones on Earth show such a neat, domino-style pattern of occurrence.
17_17	0.11202848	According to geological theory, a quake changes crustal stress in a region and might increase the possibility of a future quake in that region.
17_18	0.14456342	According to the calculations by the scientists, a 1967 quake immediately to the east of Izmit increased stress in that region.
17_19	0.10897253	In the paper, they forecast that the increased stress could eventually cause a major quake on the Sapanca Fault.
17_20	0.091605029	On this basis, the three scientists proposed in their article that over the next 30 years, there was a 12 percent probability for a large event south of Izmit, which lies farther west than the 1967 quake.
17_21	0.11206182	They also forecast a 15 percent probability of a quake measuring at least 6.7 magnitude east of the eastern center of Ercinzan.
17_22	0.11984217	The Ercinzan region is far from the site of the Tuesday quake.
17_23	0.093404645	Whether their forecast was a true prediction or just a lucky guess, it reinforces Dieterich's confidence in an emerging paradigm of earthquake science: the importance of crustal stress changes in triggering or inhibiting future quakes.
17_24	0.10822802	In recent years, quake specialists have developed computer models to understand how quakes change the stress on Earth's crust.
17_25	0.10076226	Some research suggests that past California quakes have been either triggered or inhibited by stress changes induced by quakes elsewhere.
17_26	0.099628318	The most dramatic example might be the great San Francisco quake of 1906, USGS geophysicist Bob Simpson said.
17_27	0.10226447	``The 1906 earthquake was such a big earthquake that it pretty much relaxed every fault in the Bay Area,'' Simpson said Wednesday.
17_28	0.090366886	As a result, for most of the 20th century California was relatively quiet, quake-wise, compared with the shaky 19th century.

18_10	0.10285571	Engineering experts warn that before construction starts, Turkey must put together stronger rules to ensure that buildings can withstand quakes in this temblor-prone region.
18_11	0.095104379	Many engineers say that lax building codes, and unscrupulous contractors and politicians, contributed to the disaster by allowing substandard buildings on fault lines.
18_12	0.086795032	``We've learned a lesson from this earthquake about how things should be built, and now the issue is that we want to ensure that standards are met and that the government institutes necessary laws for this,'' said Murat Celik, chairman of the Modern Lawyer's Association.

18_14	0.075057199	The lawsuits also might help survivors to get compensation.
18_15	0.093213293	Because home insurance is rare, and contractors are not required to carry insurance, few of those who lost their homes can count on being recompensed for their losses.
18_16	0.11540716	Estimated costs to Turkey from the earthquake range from $4.5 billion, for the loss in production, to about $17 billion for the added damage to apartment buildings and the infrastructure.
18_17	0.086361327	This is expected to push Turkey's economy this year into a gross domestic product loss, or ``negative growth''.
18_18	0.11162884	But business groups say the economy should start bouncing back by the year 2001, partly because of the construction boom that the earthquake has necessitated.

18_23	0.11052599	A team of US engineering experts was in the region surveying the damage to make recommendations on how Turkey can house people, given constraints of time and money.
18_24	0.093920712	One issue is how many of the damaged buildings _ some of which were built by people who put in all their savings as an investment _ need to be torn down and which ones can be reinforced.

18_27	0.097902141	But some groups are not waiting for help from the government, which was accused by many of being slow to react after the earthquake.
18_28	0.093750316	Along with volunteers who flocked to the region to distribute food, water, and clothing, many factories in the Izmit area have started caring for their displaced workers, setting up their own tent camps.
18_29	0.088754387	This makes sense for businesses eager to get back to work and worried that their workers will go elsewhere in the search for temporary shelter, but it also reflects the way in which nongovernmental groups have jumped in to help survivors while governmental efforts are still somewhat disorganized.

23_0	0.20416274	ISTANBUL (Turkey), August 21 (Xinhua) --Blaze in a refinery in western Turkey has been under control after the strong efforts made by foreign rescue experts, a Turkish official said on Saturday.
23_1	0.17148188	Turkish private NTV quoted Ismail Alakoc, the chairman of the boarding committee of Turkish Petrol Refineries Company as saying that the strong fire of the Izmit Refinery in Kocaeli province caused by Tuesday's monster earthquake has been under control with the help of foreign countries.
23_2	0.084708076	Germany, Azerbaijan, Greece, France, the Netherlands, Kazakistan, Ukraine and Russia have been participating in the fight against the blaze that threatened to engulf the entire field of 30 storage tanks containing 1 million tons of crude oil.
23_3	0.13459953	The fire fighting aircraft dropped special chemical foam to control the flames in the Izmit Refinery, about 110 kilometers southeast of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey.
23_4	0.16551202	Alakoc added that the fire has burnt 250,000 tons of the crude oil in the Turkey's largest oil refinery.
23_5	0.13903316	Turkish experts are expected to make research for the pollution caused by the burning, which has spread to large areas around the Izmit Refinery, he said.
23_6	0.11647654	Due to the devastating fire, the Turkish government has made an urgent appeal for delivering crude oil to Turkey.
23_7	0.11342651	Many taxi drivers in Istanbul have been lining up for filling LPG as the Izmit Refinery stopped supplying petrol to the city.
24_0	0.10584872	IZMIT, Turkey (AP) --It has been a year since Ayse Karatas grabbed her 3-year-old granddaughter, wrenched open a window and jumped out of her apartment building to escape a shattering earthquake.
24_1	0.1084813	Since surviving the quake, Karatas and her family have been living in a tent donated by the U.S. government and using a nearby garden hose to fill jugs with water for drinking and washing.
24_2	0.039219767	They are not alone.
24_3	0.0833422	Some 26,000 survivors of the Aug.
24_4	0.16550924	17, 1999, quake that devastated Turkey's industrial heartland are living in tent cities.
24_5	0.082478281	An additional 150,000 people live in cramped prefabricated homes that are oppressively hot in summer and bitterly cold in winter.
24_6	0.078360649	''We have nothing,'' said Karatas, as she sat outside her green tent sucking on an ice cube in the stifling heat.
24_7	0.077015424	''The state doesn't care about us''.
24_8	0.090194227	It's a bitterness that was widely felt after the 7.4-magnitude earthquake destroyed poorly built apartment houses, crushing some 17,000 people as they slept.
24_9	0.21627424	The quake virtually leveled parts of Izmit, 60 miles east of Istanbul, and other towns in western Turkey.
24_10	0.081596769	But anger is fading toward a government that at first appeared ineffective and slow to react.
24_11	0.065916741	People no longer question whether the state is still there to help them.
24_12	0.082197655	Criticism of rescue efforts led by the military, the most respected Turkish institution, is dissipating and the Turkish press rarely mentions the thousands of people like Karatas, the wife of a retired baker, who are too poor to find their own homes.
24_13	0.086205634	''It's sad, but it seems that they are an afterthought,'' said Alan Makovsky, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
24_14	0.085843174	Initially, the Turkish response to the disaster was so disorganized that foreign rescue teams had to ask civilians for advice on where to go.
24_15	0.070626774	But Turks feel their government has handled the post-quake cleanup well.
24_16	0.13934464	The number of people in tent cities has fallen from some 120,000 after the quake to 26,000 today and the government expects that number to decline sharply in the coming months.
24_17	0.085049583	The cash-strapped state gives some 56,000 families $155 a month in rent subsidies and has provided free meals to some 195,000 survivors for most of the past year.
24_18	0.09599725	When a second, much smaller quake struck in November, the government and the military reacted quickly.
24_19	0.10057489	Relief teams were dispatched and, although almost 1,000 people died in that quake, the rescue efforts appeared to be well coordinated.
24_20	0.082473283	''It seemed to be a statement that the government has learned its lesson,'' Makovsky said.
24_21	0.079432374	''I think that the government has recouped its honor''.
24_22	0.084589512	The government also received a boost when the European Union in December agreed to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership, bringing the country one step closer to its long cherished goal of integration with the West.
24_23	0.11894658	The government has taken extensive measures to prepare for a new quake, which seismologists warn could happen at any time.
24_24	0.095402655	In Izmit, the hard-hit town where Karatas lives, mobile rescue teams are prepared for deployment within four hours of a disaster.
24_25	0.10060948	A quake coordination headquarters has been built in a field, far from any tall buildings.
24_26	0.081668409	Government officials have walkie-talkies in their offices so that they can be reached if phone lines are cut.
24_27	0.073562964	For new buildings, inspections and insurance will be required, officials said.
24_28	0.070721124	''We are ready,'' says Muhammet Uygun, deputy disaster area coordinator.
24_29	0.078320957	But that news is of little help to Karatas.
24_30	0.090698929	Although the state gives rent credits to people whose apartments were destroyed, Karatas had no lease and was unable to prove that she had been renting an apartment in the quake zone.
24_31	0.083857729	Although her husband receives a pension of $155 a month, rents have skyrocketed since the earthquake, which damaged more than 100,000 homes in her home province of Kocaeli alone.
24_32	0.10022213	A small apartment would cost the family's entire monthly income.
24_33	0.093098115	''The state doesn't care about us,'' Karatas said as her eyes turned red and swelled with tears.
24_34	0.049799087	''They would rather we die''.
24_35	0.089847604	It's an anger that newly confident officials dismiss with disdain.
24_36	0.081699752	''Our citizens are a bit ungrateful,'' Uygun said.
24_37	0.085015876	''They always want something else no matter what you give them.''
