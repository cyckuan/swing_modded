11_0	0.12290318	Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said the fault line that ruptured in Turkey Tuesday, producing a devastating earthquake, had been identified more than two years ago as a particularly dangerous one.
11_1	0.099834443	A team of MIT scientists has been studying the region for a decade, but said new equipment now being installed to monitor the fault's motion, which might have provided enough warning to save some of the estimated 2,000 people who died, was not yet in place.
11_2	0.12432142	The quake's center near the town of Izmit was on a stretch of the North Anatolian fault where the MIT team, working with scientists from Turkish universities and the nation's science foundation, ``marked it two years ago as an area to be watched closely,'' said M.
11_3	0.10767667	Nafi Toksoz, a Turkish-born MIT professor of geophysics and seismology who has been studying earthquakes in Turkey since 1971.
11_4	0.075692406	``I have walked just about every foot of that fault zone,'' he said.
11_5	0.13350379	So far, in addition to the thousands killed and injured, the quake did extensive damage to residential and industrial buildings in Izmit and nearby towns in a major industrial center, and left more than 100,000 homeless.
11_6	0.077500941	The damage is expected to run to billions of dollars.
11_7	0.081517164	For the last decade, the MIT-Turkish team has been monitoring the motion of the ground along both sides of the fault line using one of the world's most advanced networks of GPS (Global Positioning System) satellite receivers, which can pinpoint locations to within one-tenth of an inch.
11_8	0.091527114	It was readings from these instruments that showed that ``this was the region where most of the stresses were accumulating,'' Toksoz said.
11_9	0.07824721	But these GPS readings have only been taken once a year; a new system, using GPS receivers that continuously send position information, is being installed to replace the decade-old stations.
11_10	0.084379207	But only one station is operational.
11_11	0.093470695	If a network of the new monitors had been in place, Toksoz said, ``we might have been able to predict the quake and provide some warning''.
11_12	0.0768592	That warning might have been anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours before the shaking began, he said, providing enough time for people to leave vulnerable buildings, and perhaps even to store water and supplies.
11_13	0.084577995	A real-time warning based on GPS data has never been issued, Toksoz said.
11_14	0.082268692	But the only similar networks of monitoring stations in the world, one in Japan and one in southern California, have shown distinct signs of some impending earthquakes when scientists have looked back at the records after a quake occurred.

11_17	0.090836155	He said earthquakes have been gradually migrating westward along the North Anatolian fault, as stress builds up in the rock and is then released.
11_18	0.098805936	The largest earthquake ever recorded on the fault was a magnitude 8.2 quake in 1939, which killed 20,000 people, and there have been six other quakes greater than magnitude 7 since then, each spanning a 60- to 100-mile segment of the fault.

11_24	0.07912947	``There is the potential for a major earthquake''.
11_25	0.10439447	There is an earthquake building code in place in the city, he said, ``but unfortunately, implementation is lax''.
11_26	0.094717086	As a result, he said, a major quake striking the city ``could be an economic disaster as well as a human disaster''.
11_27	0.094565584	Even this week's quake, though centered 65 miles away, did some property damage and caused a few deaths in Istanbul.

11_35	0.089392807	It is not yet clear what this unusual disparity might mean, he said.
11_36	0.090231223	Toksoz added that readings based on measurements farther from the site usually give a more accurate representation, because instruments close to the quake can be ``saturated'' by the intensity of the shaking and get a lower reading.

22_24	0.08804489	One issue is how many of the damaged buildings _ some of which were built by people who put in all their savings as an investment _ need to be torn down and which ones can be reinforced.

22_28	0.088173283	Along with volunteers who flocked to the region to distribute food, water, and clothing, many factories in the Izmit area have started caring for their displaced workers, setting up their own tent camps.
22_29	0.085171445	This makes sense for businesses eager to get back to work and worried that their workers will go elsewhere in the search for temporary shelter, but it also reflects the way in which nongovernmental groups have jumped in to help survivors while governmental efforts are still somewhat disorganized.

23_0	0.13902279	SAN FRANCISCO _ Earthquake forecasters apparently predicted the devastating quake in Turkey in an article published in a scientific journal in 1997.
23_1	0.080282005	It might have been just a lucky guess.
23_2	0.092172817	Still, if it was a guess, it was a remarkably good one.
23_3	0.079105957	In the scientific article, two U.S.
23_4	0.096019944	Geological Survey researchers from Menlo Park and a Turkish colleague forecast a small possibility of ``a large event south of the major western port city of Izmit,'' probably centered on the Sapanca Fault, within the next 30 years.
23_5	0.14422106	Early Tuesday morning, a magnitude 7.4 quake struck a few miles south of Izmit.
23_6	0.098703475	Early indications are that the epicenter was on the Sapanca Fault, which stems from the larger North Anatolian Fault system.
23_7	0.075779576	The article, published in Geophysical Research International and titled ``Progressive Failure on the North Anatolian Fault Since 1939 by Earthquake Stress Triggering,'' was written by veteran USGS researchers Ross S.

23_11	0.088000833	``The earthquake occurred right in this area that we described,'' Dieterich said in an interview Wednesday.
23_12	0.085729841	``This earthquake does fit what we had roughly described in this paper''.
23_13	0.085211623	At the same time, he said, ``I'm a little bit reluctant to claim that we forecast the earthquake,'' mainly because they assigned only a 12 percent probability to it.
23_14	0.090880444	Stein, Dieterich and Barka based their forecast partly on their study of a remarkable long-term trend in Turkish earthquakes.
23_15	0.089875765	Since 1939, 11 quakes have occurred at sites along the North Anatolian Fault that are almost always progressively farther to the west with each occurrence, ``like falling dominoes,'' as the scientists described it.
23_16	0.092361217	The quake sequence along the North Anatolian Fault zone is unusual in that no other fault zones on Earth show such a neat, domino-style pattern of occurrence.
23_17	0.099500428	According to geological theory, a quake changes crustal stress in a region and might increase the possibility of a future quake in that region.
23_18	0.1287701	According to the calculations by the scientists, a 1967 quake immediately to the east of Izmit increased stress in that region.
23_19	0.11107764	In the paper, they forecast that the increased stress could eventually cause a major quake on the Sapanca Fault.
23_20	0.091983316	On this basis, the three scientists proposed in their article that over the next 30 years, there was a 12 percent probability for a large event south of Izmit, which lies farther west than the 1967 quake.
23_21	0.11133968	They also forecast a 15 percent probability of a quake measuring at least 6.7 magnitude east of the eastern center of Ercinzan.
23_22	0.13951244	The Ercinzan region is far from the site of the Tuesday quake.
23_23	0.094705192	Whether their forecast was a true prediction or just a lucky guess, it reinforces Dieterich's confidence in an emerging paradigm of earthquake science: the importance of crustal stress changes in triggering or inhibiting future quakes.
23_24	0.098310978	In recent years, quake specialists have developed computer models to understand how quakes change the stress on Earth's crust.
23_25	0.093966372	Some research suggests that past California quakes have been either triggered or inhibited by stress changes induced by quakes elsewhere.
23_26	0.096937211	The most dramatic example might be the great San Francisco quake of 1906, USGS geophysicist Bob Simpson said.
23_27	0.092253542	``The 1906 earthquake was such a big earthquake that it pretty much relaxed every fault in the Bay Area,'' Simpson said Wednesday.
23_28	0.087223303	As a result, for most of the 20th century California was relatively quiet, quake-wise, compared with the shaky 19th century.
