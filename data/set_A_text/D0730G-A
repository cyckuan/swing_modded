2_13	0.125229	Less than two months after our decision in that case, the President exercised his authority to cancel one provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 . . . and two provisions in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 . . .

(EXCERPTS FROM DISSENTS FOLLOW IN 2nd TAKE) nn FROM THE DISSENT By Justice Scalia Insofar as the degree of political, ``law-making'' power conferred upon the Executive is concerned, there is not a dime's worth of difference between Congress' authorizing the President to CANCEL a spending item, and Congress' authorizing money to be spent on a particular item at the President's discretion.
2_45	0.1126483	And the latter has been done since the founding of the nation.
2_46	0.090805311	From 1789-1791, the First Congress made lump-sum appropriations for the entire government ``sum(s) not exceeding'' specified amounts for broad purposes.

2_48	0.17398478	. . . Examples of appropriations committed to the discretion of the President abound in our history.
2_49	0.21884672	. . . Had the Line Item Veto Act authorized the President to ``decline to spend'' any item of spending contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, there is not the slightest doubt that authorization would have been constitutional.
2_50	0.35597093	What the Line Item Veto Act does instead authorizing the President to ``cancel'' an item of spending is technically different.
2_51	0.08950441	But the technical difference does NOT relate to the technicalities of the Presentment Clause, which have been fully complied with; and the doctrine of unconstitutional delegation, which IS at issue here, is pre-eminently NOT a doctrine of technicalities.
2_52	0.16356434	The title of the Line Item Veto Act, which was perhaps designed to simplify for public comprehension, or perhaps merely to comply with the terms of a campaign pledge, has succeeded in faking out the Supreme Court.
2_53	0.16096463	The President's action it authorizes in fact is not a line item veto and thus does not offend Art.
2_54	0.097426467	I, 7; and insofar as the substance of that action is concerned, it is no different from what Congress has permitted the President to do since the formation of the Union.
2_55	0.096128799	FROM THE DISSENT By Justice Breyer In sum, I recognize that the act before us is novel.
2_56	0.076534589	In a sense, it skirts a constitutional edge.
2_57	0.091619994	But that edge has to do with means, not ends.
2_58	0.11532977	The means chosen do not amount literally to the enactment, repeal or amendment of a law.
2_59	0.17232409	Nor, for that matter, do they amount literally to the ``line item veto'' that the act's title announces.
2_60	0.13263887	Those means do not violate any basic separation of powers principle.
2_61	0.21268899	They do not improperly shift the constitutionally foreseen balance of power from Congress to the President.
2_62	0.11098573	Nor, since they comply with Separation of Powers principles, do they threaten the liberties of individual citizens.
2_63	0.084855214	They represent an experiment that may, or may not, help representative government work better.
2_64	0.17021637	The Constitution, in my view, authorizes Congress and the President to try novel methods in this way.

3_4	0.087093856	It cuts off funding for U.S. combat troops in Bosnia after June 30, unless the president certifies that a continued U.S. presence there is necessary, says the bill in a cautious language.
3_5	0.089313225	The bill also provides for a 331 million dollars down payment for the purchase of new B-2 Stealth bombers, but leaves it up to Clinton to decide whether to procure more of the planes.
3_6	0.24938559	The spending in the new fiscal year was budgeted higher than the Clinton administration requested, and the president expressed "concern" over that, hinting that he may use the line-item veto authority to shrink the bill.

5_0	0.48015653	WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, in a historic ruling affecting the constitutional balance of power at the heart of the American political system, struck down legislation Thursday that permits the president to veto specific provisions of spending and tax bills.
5_1	0.29156495	The court's 6-3 decision against the practice, known as the ``line-item veto,'' restores the historic balance between the legislative and executive branches, removing from the president's political arsenal a weapon that Congress provided in 1996 and that President Clinton used 82 times last year.
5_2	0.17269855	The Supreme Court, especially sensitive to the separation of powers because of its own institutional role, took the unusual step of noting it did ``not lightly'' reach its conclusion.
5_3	0.37056745	Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the majority, said the issue was of ``profound importance''.
5_4	0.4035405	The court, Stevens wrote, ``has concluded that its duty is clear,'' and the line-item veto is ``not authorized by the Constitution''.
5_5	0.2032711	Though the line-item veto was provided to a Democratic president by a Republican Congress, the ability to strike out individual provisions of bills is a prerogative given to 43 of the nation's governors, sought 130 years ago by President Ulysses S.
5_6	0.084584466	Grant and desired by every modern president since Harry Truman.
5_7	0.24282881	In a statement released by the White House, President Clinton said he was ``deeply disappointed'' by the ruling, which he characterized as ``a defeat for all Americans''.
5_8	0.1692917	The decision, however, was hailed by constitutional traditionalists, especially those on Capitol Hill who guard congressional prerogatives, who argued that the line-item veto represented an erosion of legislative powers by permitting a president to pick and choose among congressional spending decisions.
5_9	0.21346459	``This is a great day, a great day for the United States of America, a great day for the Constitution of the United States,'' said Senator Robert C.

5_11	0.094074391	Many Supreme Court decisions set off ripples that disturb the pond of politics, but this ruling will shape the political environment in Washington intimately for years to come.
5_12	0.10166132	Thursday's ruling, coming on the next-to-last day of the high court's term, will affect not only legislative strategy but also legislative content, making it even more tempting for lawmakers to add special or local-interest provisions into spending bills.
5_13	0.10494379	Its influence will be felt immediately this summer, as the 13 appropriations bills make their slow passage from subcommittee all the way to the president's desk.
5_14	0.10803267	The ruling, moreover, provides a window into the high court's view of the relationship between the other two branches of government.
5_15	0.1672934	It affirms the very first word of the first sentence of the first section of the first article of the Constitution, where the framers wrote: ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.

6_3	0.10387964	Clinton said, "The projects in this bill would not substantially improve the quality of life of military service members and their families".

7_19	0.44126066	Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens cited the ``profound importance'' of the issue and said that ``the procedures authorized by the line-item veto act are not authorized by the Constitution''.

8_0	0.6338143	WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by vetoing single items of spending or specific tax breaks approved by Congress.
8_1	0.32651424	In a 6-3 decision, the court rejected a decades-old effort to strengthen the hand of the president in struggles with Congress.
8_2	0.22253067	The court quoted George Washington, who presided over the Constitutional Convention and later wrote that a president must ``approve all the parts of a bill, or reject it in toto,'' but cannot modify the text of legislation presented to him by Congress.
8_3	0.1369676	The court's reasoning Thursday was exceptionally simple.
8_4	0.40310034	``The President has amended two acts of Congress by repealing a portion of each,'' said the majority opinion, by Justice John Paul Stevens.
8_5	0.18992639	``Repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Article I'' of the Constitution, which established ``a single finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure'' for enacting laws.
8_6	0.30480728	In 1996, Congress tried to change that procedure, and reduce the budget deficit, by allowing the president to cancel individual items of federal spending and tax breaks.
8_7	0.51761686	But the court said Thursday that such line-item vetoes were unconstitutional.
8_8	0.36489945	``The Line Item Veto Act authorizes the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing the procedures set out in Article I,'' Stevens said.
8_9	0.25536619	President Clinton, traveling in China, said he was ``deeply disappointed'' with the ruling.
8_10	0.17140147	``The decision is a defeat for all Americans,'' Clinton said.
8_11	0.15881968	``It deprives the president of a valuable tool for eliminating waste in the federal budget and for enlivening the public debate over how to make the best use of public funds''.
8_12	0.39273733	Clinton has used the line-item veto to rewrite 11 laws, eliminating 82 items, including money for New York City hospitals and a tax break for Idaho potato growers.
8_13	0.119783	Thursday's decision came in lawsuits filed by New York City, the Greater New York Hospital Association, two unions of health-care workers, the Snake River Potato Growers and one of its officers.
8_14	0.28035704	In an opinion concurring with Stevens, Justice Anthony Kennedy chided Congress for surrendering power to the president.
8_15	0.10188524	``Failure of political will does not justify unconstitutional remedies,'' Kennedy declared.

8_19	0.21502688	Presidents since Ulysses Grant have sought the line-item veto, and Ronald Reagan popularized the idea.
8_20	0.23235542	Kennedy said that the device ``compromises the political liberty of our citizens'' by concentrating power in the hands of the president.
8_21	0.11517067	``Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the branches seek to transgress the separation of powers,'' he said.
8_22	0.37522306	The dissenters _ Justices Antonin Scalia, Stephen Breyer and Sandra Day O'Connor _ would have upheld the line-item veto.
8_23	0.27333287	Scalia said that ``there is not a dime's worth of difference'' between allowing the president to cancel a particular project, through the line-item veto, and allowing him to spend money on a particular item at his discretion.

8_43	0.10682103	Byrd, who has served in the Senate for nearly 40 years, disagreed.
8_44	0.095447548	Byrd quoted Sir William Blackstone, the 18th century English jurist, who wrote: ``In all tyrannical governments, the supreme magistracy, or the right of both making and enforcing the laws, is vested in one and the same man, or one and the same body of men.

8_46	0.37716909	Byrd led six members of Congress in challenging the constitutionality of the line-item veto last year, before Clinton had used the device.
8_47	0.15541264	In June 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no genuine ``case or controversy'' because the lawmakers had not suffered any ``personal, concrete injury''.
8_48	0.22839002	On Thursday, by contrast, the court said that the New York hospitals and the Idaho potato growers had suffered an ``actual injury''.
8_49	0.21898505	Stevens said that the line-item veto, by creating a potential liability of at least $2.6 billion for New York, could harm the city's financial strength and borrowing power.

10_0	0.3339198	WASHINGTON _ Government and hospital officials in New York state praised the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the president's line-item veto power Thursday, saying that it would preserve a set of state hospital taxes that help finance health care for the poor.
10_1	0.099122422	The decision settles in New York's favor a longstanding disagreement between the state and federal government over the legality of some of those taxes, which raised $2.6 billion for health care programs from 1992 to 1996.
10_2	0.083083482	State and city officials had been concerned that if they lost the dispute, the Clinton administration would require the state, city and many hospitals to reimburse some of that money, with potentially devastating consequences for patient care and government budgets.

12_1	0.47435094	In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress.
12_2	0.32322145	The court also said the 1996 measure authorized the president to issue what were, in practical terms, partial vetoes.
12_3	0.54309288	In passing the law, Congress said the president could cancel individual items in tax and spending bills within five days of signing them into law.
12_4	0.21245476	Congress, however, was allowed to try to reinstate the items by having both houses pass them in separate bills.

12_9	0.15115808	A year ago, the justices heard a challenge to the act brought by six members of Congress, but it dismissed their suit, saying they had no standing to sue because they had not suffered any injury because of the veto, which at that point Clinton had not exercised.

12_17	0.14163484	In their arguments before the court, lawyers for the challengers said that no matter when a president changes the spending bill or for what reasons, the bottom line is that what takes effect was not passed by both chambers of Congress, as required by the Constitution.

16_1	0.66813943	Supreme Court after a federal judge struck down the line-item veto Thursday as unconstitutional.
16_2	0.48701794	President Bill Clinton said he was "disappointed" by the ruling, but expressed confidence the line-item law eventually will be upheld by the Supreme Court.
16_3	0.18396021	Under the law, which took effect in January 1997, the president has five days after signing a bill to cancel some of its appropriations, or cancel special tax breaks seen as applying to small numbers of people.

16_5	0.092110515	In his Thursday ruling, U.S.
16_6	0.27386227	Judge Thomas Hogan struck down the law as unconstitutional on the basis of the separation of powers among the three branches of government.
16_7	0.18695774	New York, among others, had brought this latest challenge to the law when a line-item veto by Clinton last year deprived the state of extra federal funds for Medicaid --the federal health insurance program covering poor, elderly and disabled Americans.

16_9	0.17843123	The state was joined in its challenge by Idaho potato farmers, who also lost out on funding because of a line-item veto.
16_10	0.15477481	Clinton joined congressional Republicans in campaigning for the line-item veto authority, but he used it relatively sparingly in its first full year.
16_11	0.36732952	In a brief written statement Thursday, Clinton said, "The line-item veto provides an important tool for the president to strike unnecessary spending and tax items from legislation."
17_0	0.36250542	UNDATED: Many of the tears being shed on Capitol Hill after the Supreme Court's rejection of the presidential line-item veto may be crocodile tears.
17_1	0.081381096	As fiscal experiments go, it may have cost even its staunchest supporters more in political capital than it saved in tax money.
17_2	0.12006693	Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies for the Cato Institute, estimates the savings from presidential line-item vetoes at $2 billion over five years.
17_3	0.07884316	Given that federal spending will be about $9 trillion during this time, $2 billion hardly amounts to a rounding error in Washington's grand fiscal scheme of things.
17_4	0.083168564	It wouldn't, for that matter, amount to more than a small percentage of the net worth of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.
17_5	0.076323212	To be sure, most Americans consider $2 billion a lot of money.
17_6	0.073332763	Most, however, don't think about such a huge sum in the context of how many taxpayer-hours must be worked to generate $2 billion in tax revenues.
17_7	0.081675884	The magnitude of federal spending is so large that average folks can't relate to the size of its expenditures in a practical way.
17_8	0.077490149	Moreover, as Moore points out, the savings achieved so far has been mostly from pork appropriations.
17_9	0.44173557	This makes the political calculus of the line-item veto a tricky proposition.
17_10	0.079942614	On the one hand, pork-barrel spending is traditionally reviled as the most cynically deployed and least utilitarian form of largess.
17_11	0.087048425	On the other hand, it's immensely popular with those who get it.
17_12	0.086136616	This is why legislators on both sides of the aisle use it to buy votes and reward allies.
17_13	0.21668314	Moore laments the fact that the president won't get to wield the item veto on this year's highway bill, which he sees as a monument to both pork and the need it creates for the line-item veto.
17_14	0.086656246	The bill contains a record 1,500 pork projects, Moore says, or about ``three slabs of bacon'' for each congressional district.
17_15	0.090708603	One person's pork, however, is another's economic sustenance, which is why so many Americans enthusiastically embrace this particular form of wealth redistribution, even though they profess contempt for it.
17_16	0.15436188	Although the line-item veto was a priority in the GOP's ``Contract With America,'' enthusiasm for it probably has waned even among its hard-core Republican supporters.
17_17	0.10767414	The degree of residual support will become more evident when congressional champions of the concept begin their push to try to change the law in a way the courts will find constitutional.
17_18	0.092101562	The response will be a good gauge of how many in Congress think it's a luxury they can afford and still get re-elected.
17_19	0.10643964	Have you ever wondered what forms the more egregious examples of pork take?
17_20	0.085850111	Moore lists a few worth pondering.
17_21	0.088190025	This year's budget, for instance, contained nearly $300,000 for research on how to enhance the flavor of roasted peanuts and $150,000 for the National Center for Peanut Competitiveness.
17_22	0.073551658	Some $250,000 was appropriated for research on pickles.
17_23	0.089938092	New Orleans got $2 million to refurbish a streetcar named Desire.
17_24	0.08594183	Some may find this outrageous, but remember: The areas where such money will be spent hail the winning of such largess as a boon to the local economy.
17_25	0.08911082	Business, civic and political leaders in Kansas City and elsewhere put a high premium on their legislators bringing home the bacon.

21_0	0.31270757	WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Thursday dealt a blow to the power of U.S. presidents, striking down as unconstitutional a law that enabled chief executives to delete individual funding items from massive budget legislation.
21_1	0.57456514	In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act violated the constitution's separation of powers between Congress, which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it into law or vetoes it.

22_0	0.59032604	WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Congress violated the principle of separation of powers when it gave the president the power to cut individual projects from tax and spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation.
22_1	0.44792426	In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress.
22_2	0.28581519	The court also said the 1996 measure authorized the president to issue what were, in practical terms, partial vetoes.
22_3	0.15430441	The only way such vetoes can be authorized is through a constitutional amendment, the justices said.
22_4	0.47933535	In passing the law, Congress said the president could cancel individual items in tax and spending bills within five days of signing them into law.
22_5	0.18017793	Congress, however, was allowed to try to reinstate the items by having both houses pass them in separate bills.
22_6	0.34277002	Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, an authority sought by nearly every chief executive this century as a tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
22_7	0.38252299	But Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said the law ``authorized the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing Article 1 procedures''.

23_0	0.30154378	The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 26: In a sound and much-needed decision, the Supreme Court has rejected the line-item veto as a departure from the basic constitutional requirement that presidents accept or reject bills in their entirety.
23_1	0.25280108	The 6-3 decision, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, firmly cast aside government arguments that in canceling specific lines of the budget the president was merely exercising authority delegated to him by Congress.
23_2	0.46127745	Instead the court found that the line-item veto violates the ```presentment clause'' of Article I.
23_3	0.14113715	That clause establishes the process by which a bill becomes law.
23_4	0.098030067	It is unfortunate that the majority opinion rests solely on the procedural problem, never reaching the more profound constitutional defect.
23_5	0.42522298	The line-item veto is an affront to the separation of powers and an abrogation of responsibility by Congress.
23_6	0.086949363	That issue, however, did get addressed eloquently in Justice Anthony Kennedy's concurring opinion.
23_7	0.15277383	``By increasing the power of the president beyond what the Framers envisioned,'' Kennedy wrote, ``the statute compromises the political liberty of our citizens, liberty which the separation of powers seeks to secure''.
23_8	0.094741975	In contrast to this solid constitutional reasoning, the court veered off course with a dangerous 8-1 ruling that found no First Amendment violation in congressional efforts to control the National Endowment for the Arts.
23_9	0.089210038	The law in question ordered the NEA to consider ``general standards of decency'' when making grants.
23_10	0.096836549	Conveniently misinterpreting the statue, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor deemed its restrictive instructions to be merely ``an advisory opinion''.
23_11	0.087172938	In a powerful dissent, Justice David Souter scorched that unrealistically benign view of what he aptly called ``a statutory mandate to deny recognition to virtually any expression capable of causing offense in any quarter''.
23_12	0.092956888	Some of the justices who joined the majority may have been motivated by a desire to help protect the NEA from further congressional attacks.
