0_1	0.53768337	Justice Department Friday appealed the Supreme Court a federal judge's decision striking down the presidential line-item veto.
0_2	0.25511683	The Supreme Court is expected to accept the appeal, hear argument and rule on the line-item veto's constitutionality before the end of the term in late June or early July.
0_3	0.65307804	The line-item veto law, which took effect in January 1997, allows the president to veto selected budget items five days after signing a bill.
0_4	0.39729592	Congress may override a line-item veto by a simple majority vote.
0_5	0.13535722	But if the president vetoes the simple majority override, a two-thirds majority is needed to override after that.
0_6	0.25697666	The law was challenged last year by a group of mostly Democratic senators, but the Supreme Court dismissed the challenge, saying President Bill Clinton had not yet used the selective veto and therefore the group had no standing to bring suit.
0_7	0.35924378	But another group of challengers, led by New York State, filed suit, contending that the line-item veto is unconstitutional.
0_8	0.33301604	New York had standing because one of Clinton's line-item vetoes struck out extra Medicare funding for the state.
0_9	0.031392451	Earlier this month, U.S.
0_10	0.23493618	District Judge Thomas Hogan struck down the line-item veto law, saying it "impermissibly upsets the balance of powers so carefully prescribed by (the Constitution's) framers".
0_11	0.19594224	In its appeal, the Justice Department argues that the new challengers also do not have standing to challenge the law, and that in any case the law is in line with the historic relationship between Congress and the president.

1_1	0.66271772	Supreme Court after a federal judge struck down the line-item veto Thursday as unconstitutional.
1_2	0.50928375	President Bill Clinton said he was "disappointed" by the ruling, but expressed confidence the line-item law eventually will be upheld by the Supreme Court.
1_3	0.18960102	Under the law, which took effect in January 1997, the president has five days after signing a bill to cancel some of its appropriations, or cancel special tax breaks seen as applying to small numbers of people.
1_4	0.31432398	Congress could overturn all or some of the line-item vetoes on a majority vote in a "disapproval bill," but if the president then vetoes that bill, it would require a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and Senate to override.
1_5	0.064653701	In his Thursday ruling, U.S.
1_6	0.29427992	Judge Thomas Hogan struck down the law as unconstitutional on the basis of the separation of powers among the three branches of government.
1_7	0.19768486	New York, among others, had brought this latest challenge to the law when a line-item veto by Clinton last year deprived the state of extra federal funds for Medicaid --the federal health insurance program covering poor, elderly and disabled Americans.
1_8	0.14076351	The White House later worked out an agreement giving New York much of the money.
1_9	0.19661678	The state was joined in its challenge by Idaho potato farmers, who also lost out on funding because of a line-item veto.
1_10	0.17522366	Clinton joined congressional Republicans in campaigning for the line-item veto authority, but he used it relatively sparingly in its first full year.
1_11	0.39169007	In a brief written statement Thursday, Clinton said, "The line-item veto provides an important tool for the president to strike unnecessary spending and tax items from legislation."
2_0	0.11387558	WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) --U.S.
2_1	0.42394524	President Bill Clinton today used his line-item veto authority to have trimmed 144 million U.S. dollars from a 248 billion dollars defense spending bill.
2_2	0.21828982	Clinton vetoed 13 relatively obscure research and spending programs, almost all the military spending increases approved by Congress.
2_3	0.20227028	The new vetoes came weeks after he vetoed 287 million dollars from a separate 9.2 billion dollars military construction bill.
2_4	0.081569114	The cuts included 39 million dollars that would have kept the remaining three SR-71 Blackbird spy planes flying.
2_5	0.093904568	Pentagon said that the SR-71 was no longer needed because of the capabilities of spy satellites, improved U-2 reconnaissance aircraft and unmanned robot planes.
2_6	0.087634237	Other cuts included 30 million dollars that would have financed research on tracking and intercepting asteroids before they collide with earth, 3 million dollars for microsurgery research and 3 million dollars for an underwater noisemaking device.

3_1	0.63104046	Supreme Court Thursday struck down as unconstitutional the line-item veto law that lets the U.S.
3_2	0.48683206	President strike out specific items in tax and spending measures.
3_3	0.67542214	The high court's 6-3 decision said the law violates that part of the Constitution requiring every bill to be presented to the president for his approval or veto.
3_4	0.33034466	The court said that type of line-item veto can be authorized only through a constitutional amendment.
3_5	0.69441853	The line-item veto law was challenged by New York City and an Idaho potato growers' group after provisions they sought were vetoed by President Bill Clinton.
3_6	0.43813791	Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, the authority sought by nearly every president this century as a tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
3_7	0.34437977	Congress voted in 1996 to give the president such authority, and Clinton used the veto 82 times last year.
3_8	0.46344041	A federal judge ruled the line-item veto unconstitutional in February, saying Congress could not delegate such authority to the president.
3_9	0.42467156	The line-item veto law let the president sign a bill and within five days go back to reject specific spending items or tax breaks in it.
3_10	0.18805039	Congress then could reinstate the item by passing a separate bill.
3_11	0.35060148	Opponents of the line-item veto argued that once a law is signed by the president, it can be changed only in the way prescribed by the Constitution for enacting a law --a congressional vote followed by the president's signature.
3_12	0.3573577	Once the president has exercised a line-item veto, the final law would not be the same as the measure approved by Congress.
3_13	0.29586557	The Clinton administration contended a line-item veto would not actually repeal part of a law, but would be a presidential exercise of spending authority delegated by Congress.
3_14	0.4180823	The Supreme Court said the administration and the veto law's backers in Congress were wrong.
3_15	0.67146474	Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens concluded that "the procedures authorized by the line-item veto act are not authorized by the Constitution".

4_1	0.61805077	President Bill Clinton said Friday he will appeal a federal judge's ruling that struck down a law giving the president the power to veto specific items in bills passed by Congress.
4_2	0.24700267	Clinton said that he was "disappointed".
4_3	0.13255606	"I intend to appeal it," Clinton said of the ruling.

4_6	0.24649545	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his decision late Thursday overturning the Line-Item Veto Act, a new and still-unused law that carried enormous significance for federal spending and the balance of power in government.
4_7	0.48022343	The law, passed by Congress last year, allowed the president for the first time to veto particular items in spending bills and certain limited tax provisions passed by Congress.

5_1	0.64889214	President Bill Clinton today vetoed a congressional rejection of his line-item veto on 38 military construction projects.
5_2	0.27875681	Last month Clinton for the firs time used the line-item authority, a power that the president can use to veto individual spending items in bills, to delete 38 projects in 24 states worth 287 million U.S. dollars from the fiscal 1998 military construction spending bill.
5_3	0.10889833	Clinton said, "The projects in this bill would not substantially improve the quality of life of military service members and their families".
5_4	0.2339453	Then the Senate voted to disapprove of Clinton's veto of 36 of the projects and the House voted to restore all the 38.
5_5	0.15250522	As a congressional version to kick the ball back to the president, the Senate then agreed with the House to fully restore the projects.

6_5	0.1680727	Clinton's use of the line-item veto is likely to generate an angry reaction from some in Congress, where military construction projects have long been designed to benefit the home districts of specific congressmen and senators.

7_3	0.089473966	The case is scheduled to be argued before the justices on April 27.
7_4	0.19829627	In 1996, the Republican-led Congress voted to provide the president with the unprecedented power of canceling specific items in spending and tax legislation, considered a key to fighting wasteful "pork-barrel" projects.

7_6	0.1303928	U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan said the 1996 law wrongly "crosses the line between acceptable delegations of rule-making authority and unauthorized surrender to the president of an inherently legislative function; namely, the authority to permanently shape laws and package legislation".

8_0	0.6643534	WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by vetoing single items of spending or tax breaks approved by Congress.
8_1	0.28618829	In a 6-3 decision, the court rejected a decades-old attempt mostly by Congressional Republican leaders to strengthen the hand of the president in struggles with Congress.

8_5	0.19337987	``Repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Article I'' of the Constitution, which established ``a single finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure'' for enacting laws.
8_6	0.2029658	In 1996, Congress tried to improve on that procedure by allowing the president to cancel individual items of federal spending and tax breaks, arguing that such power, held by governors in many states, would help eliminate the budget deficit.
8_7	0.45736314	But the court said Thursday that such ``line-item vetoes'' were unconstitutional.
8_8	0.42134281	``The Line-Item Veto Act authorizes the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing the procedures set out in Article I,'' Stevens said.

12_2	0.50180921	Clinton said the funding that Congress has added to the bill is excessive and threatened to veto some items by using the line-item veto power.
12_3	0.10945586	The bill contains about 3.2 billion dollars more in funding than was approved for the previous year.
12_4	0.098977403	It cuts off funding for U.S. combat troops in Bosnia after June 30, unless the president certifies that a continued U.S. presence there is necessary, says the bill in a cautious language.
12_5	0.099881239	The bill also provides for a 331 million dollars down payment for the purchase of new B-2 Stealth bombers, but leaves it up to Clinton to decide whether to procure more of the planes.
12_6	0.27780151	The spending in the new fiscal year was budgeted higher than the Clinton administration requested, and the president expressed "concern" over that, hinting that he may use the line-item veto authority to shrink the bill.

12_8	0.12019899	Clinton's emphasis on the 1.2 billion dollars by which the measure exceeds the bipartisan budget agreement may be a hint as to how much Clinton would target in a veto.

13_0	0.44825704	WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) --A U.S. district judge Thursday declared the president's line-item veto authority unconstitutional.
13_1	0.42087952	Judge Thomas Hogan ruled that the law --which gives the president the power to strike items from tax and spending measures without vetoing the entire bill -- violates the traditional balance of powers between the various branches of government "The Line-Item Veto Act is unconstitutional because it impermissibly disrupts the balance of powers among the three branches of government," said Thomas Hogan.

13_3	0.20147671	The issue is likely to be decided ultimately by the Supreme Court.
13_4	0.22943865	The line item veto, strongly supported by President Bill Clinton and a number of his predecessors, was passed in 1996 under the Republican Party's "Contract with America" policy document.
13_5	0.23354316	Clinton became the first president to use the power by vetoing a series of small items last August, exercising the veto power 82 times last year, striking 1.9 billion dollars in spending projected over five years.

13_8	0.33067237	The case was initiated by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, challenging the president's unprecedented authority to reject specific sections of spending bills without vetoing the entire measure.
13_9	0.091392398	Hogan ruled that Congress may not "delegate its inherent lawmaking authority".
13_10	0.17884063	New York City maintains it was unfairly targeted by Clinton when he canceled a section of the federal budget bill that would have let the city and state raise taxes on hospitals and pass those charges along to the federal government in the form of Medicaid billings.
14_0	0.35109784	WASHINGTON _ Government and hospital officials in New York state praised the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the president's line-item veto power Thursday, saying that it would preserve a set of state hospital taxes that help finance health care for the poor.
14_1	0.10799176	The decision settles in New York's favor a longstanding disagreement between the state and federal government over the legality of some of those taxes, which raised $2.6 billion for health care programs from 1992 to 1996.
14_2	0.093450407	State and city officials had been concerned that if they lost the dispute, the Clinton administration would require the state, city and many hospitals to reimburse some of that money, with potentially devastating consequences for patient care and government budgets.
14_3	0.080671733	``I'm very gratified we won this because I realized the impact this would have had, not only on the city, but in particular on the ability of hospitals to care for those people who are the weakest and in the most vulnerable positions, people without medical insurance,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
14_4	0.22275863	The city, where most of the state's Medicaid recipients live, was a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the line-item veto, along with hospital groups and unions for health care workers.
14_5	0.089426818	At issue were taxes New York state has levied on hospitals for many years to finance health care programs for the poor, including health insurance for children in low-income families, AIDS services and poison control centers.
14_6	0.10351662	Under Medicaid, the federal health care program for the poor, Washington matched much of the revenue raised by those taxes.
14_7	0.102326	But in 1995, the Clinton administration raised concerns about whether some of the taxes were legal under a 1991 federal law intended to prevent Medicaid abuses by states.
14_8	0.09625068	New York requested a waiver from the 1991 law, but after much haggling, the administration declined to grant one.
14_9	0.12296969	Frustrated with the stalemate and concerned that the administration would eventually demand repayment of some of the federal matching funds, New York state officials and city hospital officials asked New York's senators, Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, to insert language in a 1997 budget bill declaring the taxes legal and absolving the state of responsibility for repaying any of the Medicaid matching funds.
14_10	0.26599786	The senators complied and the measure was approved by Congress.
14_11	0.24187836	At the same time, White House officials were searching for budget provisions that would be appropriate for Clinton's inaugural use of the line-item veto.
14_12	0.12265222	Last August, the president selected three, one of which was the Moynihan-D'Amato amendment, contending that the measure would set a damaging precedent.
14_13	0.15093057	The veto almost immediately became a political headache for the administration, as New York Democrats joined labor unions, hospital officials, advocates for the poor and Republicans in assailing the president for jeopardizing programs for the indigent.
14_14	0.09636594	Yet it was never really clear that the administration was on the verge of declaring the state's hospital taxes illegal.
14_15	0.097687862	And even had it done that, many federal officials said, it would have been unlikely for the administration to demand that the state, with its large pool of Democratic voters, or its hospitals reimburse any of the Medicaid funds.
14_16	0.19564175	Still, hospital officials declared Thursday that the Supreme Court had rescued New York's hospital system from a potential disaster.

15_0	0.33299357	WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Thursday dealt a blow to the power of U.S. presidents, striking down as unconstitutional a law that enabled chief executives to delete individual funding items from massive budget legislation.
15_1	0.6014257	In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act violated the constitution's separation of powers between Congress, which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it into law or vetoes it.
15_2	0.22089235	The president, however, has no authority to erase individual provisions in legislation, the justices said.
15_3	0.25709903	``Although the Constitution expressly authorizes the president to play a role in the process of enacting statutes, it is silent on the subject of unilateral presidential action that either repeals or amends parts of duly enacted statutes,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the majority.
15_4	0.10953765	``There are powerful reasons for construing constitutional silence on this profoundly important issue as equivalent to an express prohibition''.
15_5	0.30955598	President Clinton issued a statement saying he was ``deeply disappointed'' by the Supreme Court's ruling, which he called ``a defeat for all Americans.
15_6	0.18422774	``It deprives the president of a valuable tool for eliminating waste in the federal budget and for enlivening the public debate over how to make the best use of public funds,'' Clinton added.

15_9	0.16611307	, who joined House and Senate colleagues in waging an unsuccessful challenge to the law last year, said he feels vindicated.
15_10	0.20267579	``Thank goodness the Supreme Court has saved Congress from itself,'' Skaggs said.
15_11	0.15161598	``The court has restored an absolutely central provision to our constitutional balance: that Congress writes the laws and can't give that power and responsibility away''.

15_13	0.17951773	Congress could create a separate bill to restore the deleted provisions with a majority vote of both the House and Senate.
15_14	0.35855737	However, the high court said the law violates the Constitution's ``single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure'' for the enactment of laws.
15_15	0.26714543	That process requires the president to approve or reject legislation in full, whereas the Line Item Veto Act impermissibly allowed him to strike legislation piecemeal, the justices added.

18_1	0.25003011	The 6-3 decision, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, firmly cast aside government arguments that in canceling specific lines of the budget the president was merely exercising authority delegated to him by Congress.

20_0	0.50440913	WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, in a historic ruling affecting the constitutional balance of power at the heart of the American political system, struck down legislation Thursday that permits the president to veto specific provisions of spending and tax bills.
20_1	0.31061385	The court's 6-3 decision against the practice, known as the ``line-item veto,'' restores the historic balance between the legislative and executive branches, removing from the president's political arsenal a weapon that Congress provided in 1996 and that President Clinton used 82 times last year.
20_2	0.18936753	The Supreme Court, especially sensitive to the separation of powers because of its own institutional role, took the unusual step of noting it did ``not lightly'' reach its conclusion.

20_4	0.43149569	The court, Stevens wrote, ``has concluded that its duty is clear,'' and the line-item veto is ``not authorized by the Constitution''.
20_5	0.21486608	Though the line-item veto was provided to a Democratic president by a Republican Congress, the ability to strike out individual provisions of bills is a prerogative given to 43 of the nation's governors, sought 130 years ago by President Ulysses S.

20_8	0.18041577	The decision, however, was hailed by constitutional traditionalists, especially those on Capitol Hill who guard congressional prerogatives, who argued that the line-item veto represented an erosion of legislative powers by permitting a president to pick and choose among congressional spending decisions.

20_17	0.2248057	The court found that the line-item veto violated this ``Presentment Clause,'' and the historical record provides ``abundant support'' for the notion that there should be no deviation from the process.

20_28	0.13043674	The court, however, found that the ``Presentment Clause'' was crafted in a deliberate fashion.

20_32	0.16378969	Congress, in adopting the legislation, tried to get around the ``Presentment Clause'' by saying the president actually signed bills into law and, then, separately, went back and canceled specific budget and tax items.

(EXCERPTS FROM DISSENTS FOLLOW IN 2nd TAKE) nn FROM THE DISSENT By Justice Scalia Insofar as the degree of political, ``law-making'' power conferred upon the Executive is concerned, there is not a dime's worth of difference between Congress' authorizing the President to CANCEL a spending item, and Congress' authorizing money to be spent on a particular item at the President's discretion.
21_45	0.087156474	And the latter has been done since the founding of the nation.
21_46	0.09692089	From 1789-1791, the First Congress made lump-sum appropriations for the entire government ``sum(s) not exceeding'' specified amounts for broad purposes.
21_47	0.13906416	From a very early date Congress also made permissive individual appropriations, leaving the decision whether to spend the money to the President's unfettered discretion.
21_48	0.18339	. . . Examples of appropriations committed to the discretion of the President abound in our history.
21_49	0.23709879	. . . Had the Line Item Veto Act authorized the President to ``decline to spend'' any item of spending contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, there is not the slightest doubt that authorization would have been constitutional.
21_50	0.38500411	What the Line Item Veto Act does instead authorizing the President to ``cancel'' an item of spending is technically different.
21_51	0.087716576	But the technical difference does NOT relate to the technicalities of the Presentment Clause, which have been fully complied with; and the doctrine of unconstitutional delegation, which IS at issue here, is pre-eminently NOT a doctrine of technicalities.
21_52	0.17984931	The title of the Line Item Veto Act, which was perhaps designed to simplify for public comprehension, or perhaps merely to comply with the terms of a campaign pledge, has succeeded in faking out the Supreme Court.

21_55	0.091106889	FROM THE DISSENT By Justice Breyer In sum, I recognize that the act before us is novel.
21_56	0.059804544	In a sense, it skirts a constitutional edge.
21_57	0.071857742	But that edge has to do with means, not ends.

21_60	0.10250062	Those means do not violate any basic separation of powers principle.
21_61	0.20112309	They do not improperly shift the constitutionally foreseen balance of power from Congress to the President.

22_1	0.29672827	President Bill Clinton said today he has not yet decided whether to strike out individual items in the comprehensive tax and budget bills awaiting his signature, noting that his new line-item veto authority ought to be used "somewhat sparingly".
22_2	0.10768352	Clinton is expected to sign the budget and tax-cut bills on Tuesday.
22_3	0.11665245	After signing them, he has five days to decide whether to cut out individual items.
22_4	0.16375157	Voicing his support for the line-item veto, Clinton told reporters during a photo session, "I think if we have it, it ought to be used.
22_5	0.064027481	I believe that it ought to be used somewhat sparingly".
22_6	0.35543039	Before the new law was passed last year, the only way presidents could reject spending laws was to veto whole budget bills.
22_7	0.50418734	Clinton is the first president to have line-item veto authority.
22_8	0.1723109	He said his aides were still reviewing the tax and budget bills to determine which items were open to the line-item veto, or whether any of them should be stricken.
22_9	0.13564335	Last week, House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said he doubted Clinton would veto specific items, saying that to do so would violate the spirit of the bipartisan negotiations between the White House and the Congress.
23_0	0.61135976	WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Congress violated the principle of separation of powers when it gave the president the power to cut individual projects from tax and spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation.
23_1	0.49912946	In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress.
23_2	0.34403153	The court also said the 1996 measure authorized the president to issue what were, in practical terms, partial vetoes.
23_3	0.5661043	In passing the law, Congress said the president could cancel individual items in tax and spending bills within five days of signing them into law.
23_4	0.20668522	Congress, however, was allowed to try to reinstate the items by having both houses pass them in separate bills.
23_5	0.42329206	Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, an authority sought by nearly every chief executive this century as a tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
23_6	0.44843366	But Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said the law ``authorized the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing Article 1 procedures''.
23_7	0.27053401	Article 1 of the Constitution established the principle of separation of powers among the three branches of government.
23_8	0.12785239	Stevens concluded that the 1996 act ``may or may not be desirable, but it is surely not a document'' that is constitutional.
23_9	0.16170797	A year ago, the justices heard a challenge to the act brought by six members of Congress, but it dismissed their suit, saying they had no standing to sue because they had not suffered any injury because of the veto, which at that point Clinton had not exercised.
23_10	0.38630855	Since then, the president has canceled 82 items in 11 laws.
23_11	0.33328687	One was a Medicaid tax benefit to New York City, which challenged the law, claiming it was injured by the veto.
23_12	0.11194293	The Snake River Potato Growers and an officer of the Idaho group also sued, saying they were injured by Clinton's veto of a tax measure that would have allowed agricultural processors to defer capital-gains taxes when they sell their plants to farmers' cooperatives.
23_13	0.04713007	In February, a U.S.
23_14	0.58222575	District Court here ruled the line-item veto unconstitutional, saying Congress violated the Constitution's separation of powers clause by delegating such authority to the president.
23_15	0.11622432	On Thursday, the high court agreed.
23_16	0.2402177	Stevens acknowledged the ``profound importance'' of the case, saying, ``The court expresses no opinion about the wisdom of the act's procedures and does not lightly conclude that the actions of the Congress that passed it, and the president who signed it into law, were unconstitutional''.
23_17	0.15319098	In their arguments before the court, lawyers for the challengers said that no matter when a president changes the spending bill or for what reasons, the bottom line is that what takes effect was not passed by both chambers of Congress, as required by the Constitution.
23_18	0.13928787	In his argument for the Clinton administration, U.S.
23_19	0.23639463	Solicitor General Seth Waxman contended that a line-item veto would not actually repeal part of a law but would be a presidential exercise of spending authority delegated by Congress.

24_0	0.38218042	UNDATED: Many of the tears being shed on Capitol Hill after the Supreme Court's rejection of the presidential line-item veto may be crocodile tears.
24_1	0.07871133	As fiscal experiments go, it may have cost even its staunchest supporters more in political capital than it saved in tax money.
24_2	0.092405419	Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies for the Cato Institute, estimates the savings from presidential line-item vetoes at $2 billion over five years.
24_3	0.072248719	Given that federal spending will be about $9 trillion during this time, $2 billion hardly amounts to a rounding error in Washington's grand fiscal scheme of things.
24_4	0.090812725	It wouldn't, for that matter, amount to more than a small percentage of the net worth of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.
24_5	0.063312726	To be sure, most Americans consider $2 billion a lot of money.
24_6	0.077192361	Most, however, don't think about such a huge sum in the context of how many taxpayer-hours must be worked to generate $2 billion in tax revenues.
24_7	0.082146706	The magnitude of federal spending is so large that average folks can't relate to the size of its expenditures in a practical way.
24_8	0.071782135	Moreover, as Moore points out, the savings achieved so far has been mostly from pork appropriations.
24_9	0.40095963	This makes the political calculus of the line-item veto a tricky proposition.
24_10	0.075647741	On the one hand, pork-barrel spending is traditionally reviled as the most cynically deployed and least utilitarian form of largess.
24_11	0.072283981	On the other hand, it's immensely popular with those who get it.
24_12	0.076424155	This is why legislators on both sides of the aisle use it to buy votes and reward allies.
24_13	0.21092677	Moore laments the fact that the president won't get to wield the item veto on this year's highway bill, which he sees as a monument to both pork and the need it creates for the line-item veto.
24_14	0.081193504	The bill contains a record 1,500 pork projects, Moore says, or about ``three slabs of bacon'' for each congressional district.
24_15	0.079779385	One person's pork, however, is another's economic sustenance, which is why so many Americans enthusiastically embrace this particular form of wealth redistribution, even though they profess contempt for it.
24_16	0.17809468	Although the line-item veto was a priority in the GOP's ``Contract With America,'' enthusiasm for it probably has waned even among its hard-core Republican supporters.
24_17	0.12051561	The degree of residual support will become more evident when congressional champions of the concept begin their push to try to change the law in a way the courts will find constitutional.
24_18	0.080304989	The response will be a good gauge of how many in Congress think it's a luxury they can afford and still get re-elected.
24_19	0.090911379	Have you ever wondered what forms the more egregious examples of pork take?
24_20	0.076009068	Moore lists a few worth pondering.
24_21	0.076492605	This year's budget, for instance, contained nearly $300,000 for research on how to enhance the flavor of roasted peanuts and $150,000 for the National Center for Peanut Competitiveness.
24_22	0.055253226	Some $250,000 was appropriated for research on pickles.
24_23	0.07814013	New Orleans got $2 million to refurbish a streetcar named Desire.
24_24	0.085979189	Some may find this outrageous, but remember: The areas where such money will be spent hail the winning of such largess as a boon to the local economy.
24_25	0.084334753	Business, civic and political leaders in Kansas City and elsewhere put a high premium on their legislators bringing home the bacon.
24_26	0.077364992	This is why some fiscal conservatives may be secretly breathing a sigh of relief and thanking the Supremes.
