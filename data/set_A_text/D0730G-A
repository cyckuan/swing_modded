2_13	0.17933478	Less than two months after our decision in that case, the President exercised his authority to cancel one provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 . . . and two provisions in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 . . .

(EXCERPTS FROM DISSENTS FOLLOW IN 2nd TAKE) nn FROM THE DISSENT By Justice Scalia Insofar as the degree of political, ``law-making'' power conferred upon the Executive is concerned, there is not a dime's worth of difference between Congress' authorizing the President to CANCEL a spending item, and Congress' authorizing money to be spent on a particular item at the President's discretion.
2_45	0.089228272	And the latter has been done since the founding of the nation.
2_46	0.0983144	From 1789-1791, the First Congress made lump-sum appropriations for the entire government ``sum(s) not exceeding'' specified amounts for broad purposes.
2_47	0.13362497	From a very early date Congress also made permissive individual appropriations, leaving the decision whether to spend the money to the President's unfettered discretion.
2_48	0.14665153	. . . Examples of appropriations committed to the discretion of the President abound in our history.
2_49	0.2443637	. . . Had the Line Item Veto Act authorized the President to ``decline to spend'' any item of spending contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, there is not the slightest doubt that authorization would have been constitutional.
2_50	0.24198975	What the Line Item Veto Act does instead authorizing the President to ``cancel'' an item of spending is technically different.
2_51	0.10088584	But the technical difference does NOT relate to the technicalities of the Presentment Clause, which have been fully complied with; and the doctrine of unconstitutional delegation, which IS at issue here, is pre-eminently NOT a doctrine of technicalities.
2_52	0.19630939	The title of the Line Item Veto Act, which was perhaps designed to simplify for public comprehension, or perhaps merely to comply with the terms of a campaign pledge, has succeeded in faking out the Supreme Court.
2_53	0.11439491	The President's action it authorizes in fact is not a line item veto and thus does not offend Art.
2_54	0.10533304	I, 7; and insofar as the substance of that action is concerned, it is no different from what Congress has permitted the President to do since the formation of the Union.
2_55	0.098763371	FROM THE DISSENT By Justice Breyer In sum, I recognize that the act before us is novel.
2_56	0.088465613	In a sense, it skirts a constitutional edge.
2_57	0.091193299	But that edge has to do with means, not ends.
2_58	0.095485832	The means chosen do not amount literally to the enactment, repeal or amendment of a law.
2_59	0.13606781	Nor, for that matter, do they amount literally to the ``line item veto'' that the act's title announces.
2_60	0.09685649	Those means do not violate any basic separation of powers principle.
2_61	0.12467451	They do not improperly shift the constitutionally foreseen balance of power from Congress to the President.

2_63	0.092211979	They represent an experiment that may, or may not, help representative government work better.
2_64	0.12539832	The Constitution, in my view, authorizes Congress and the President to try novel methods in this way.

3_2	0.23615687	Clinton said the funding that Congress has added to the bill is excessive and threatened to veto some items by using the line-item veto power.
3_3	0.12333111	The bill contains about 3.2 billion dollars more in funding than was approved for the previous year.
3_4	0.1581512	It cuts off funding for U.S. combat troops in Bosnia after June 30, unless the president certifies that a continued U.S. presence there is necessary, says the bill in a cautious language.
3_5	0.16859802	The bill also provides for a 331 million dollars down payment for the purchase of new B-2 Stealth bombers, but leaves it up to Clinton to decide whether to procure more of the planes.
3_6	0.42291297	The spending in the new fiscal year was budgeted higher than the Clinton administration requested, and the president expressed "concern" over that, hinting that he may use the line-item veto authority to shrink the bill.
3_7	0.19296199	"The bill provides 4.2 billion dollars more than I requested in my 1998 budget, and 1.2 billion dollars more than the levels that my administration believes were agreed to in the bipartisan budget agreement" between Congress and the White House, Clinton said.
3_8	0.19792541	Clinton's emphasis on the 1.2 billion dollars by which the measure exceeds the bipartisan budget agreement may be a hint as to how much Clinton would target in a veto.

3_10	0.16959675	The "could-be" vetoed spending items include half a billion dollars in congressionally added spending on eight C-130J military transport aircraft not in either the Pentagon's budget request or in the request Clinton sent to Capitol Hill.

4_5	0.22307168	``Repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Article I'' of the Constitution, which established ``a single finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure'' for enacting laws.
4_6	0.25256222	In 1996, Congress tried to improve on that procedure by allowing the president to cancel individual items of federal spending and tax breaks, arguing that such power, held by governors in many states, would help eliminate the budget deficit.
4_7	0.15640113	But the court said Thursday that such ``line-item vetoes'' were unconstitutional.
4_8	0.45645101	``The Line-Item Veto Act authorizes the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing the procedures set out in Article I,'' Stevens said.

4_27	0.1174589	Under this arrangement, the president would receive thousands of bills each year.
4_28	0.44685769	Stevens said the Line-Item Veto Act ``gives the president the unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted statutes''.
4_29	0.18145056	In exercising the power, President Clinton has infuriated members of Congress, including many who supported the device in principle.

4_43	0.16035783	In June 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no genuine ``case or controversy'' because the lawmakers had not suffered any ``personal, concrete injury''.
4_44	0.22927829	On Thursday, by contrast, the court said that the New York hospitals and the Idaho potato growers had suffered an ``actual injury''.
4_45	0.23354004	Justice Stevens said that the line-item veto, by creating a potential liability of at least $2.6 billion for New York, could harm the city's financial strength and borrowing power.

5_0	0.57166492	WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, in a historic ruling affecting the constitutional balance of power at the heart of the American political system, struck down legislation Thursday that permits the president to veto specific provisions of spending and tax bills.
5_1	0.39263292	The court's 6-3 decision against the practice, known as the ``line-item veto,'' restores the historic balance between the legislative and executive branches, removing from the president's political arsenal a weapon that Congress provided in 1996 and that President Clinton used 82 times last year.
5_2	0.14428242	The Supreme Court, especially sensitive to the separation of powers because of its own institutional role, took the unusual step of noting it did ``not lightly'' reach its conclusion.
5_3	0.17162347	Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the majority, said the issue was of ``profound importance''.
5_4	0.27381904	The court, Stevens wrote, ``has concluded that its duty is clear,'' and the line-item veto is ``not authorized by the Constitution''.
5_5	0.29603192	Though the line-item veto was provided to a Democratic president by a Republican Congress, the ability to strike out individual provisions of bills is a prerogative given to 43 of the nation's governors, sought 130 years ago by President Ulysses S.
5_6	0.095069521	Grant and desired by every modern president since Harry Truman.
5_7	0.28522024	In a statement released by the White House, President Clinton said he was ``deeply disappointed'' by the ruling, which he characterized as ``a defeat for all Americans''.
5_8	0.25561965	The decision, however, was hailed by constitutional traditionalists, especially those on Capitol Hill who guard congressional prerogatives, who argued that the line-item veto represented an erosion of legislative powers by permitting a president to pick and choose among congressional spending decisions.
5_9	0.26371817	``This is a great day, a great day for the United States of America, a great day for the Constitution of the United States,'' said Senator Robert C.
5_10	0.16573493	Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who has opposed the line-item veto for decades.
5_11	0.10130403	Many Supreme Court decisions set off ripples that disturb the pond of politics, but this ruling will shape the political environment in Washington intimately for years to come.
5_12	0.14129146	Thursday's ruling, coming on the next-to-last day of the high court's term, will affect not only legislative strategy but also legislative content, making it even more tempting for lawmakers to add special or local-interest provisions into spending bills.
5_13	0.10875167	Its influence will be felt immediately this summer, as the 13 appropriations bills make their slow passage from subcommittee all the way to the president's desk.
5_14	0.10616142	The ruling, moreover, provides a window into the high court's view of the relationship between the other two branches of government.
5_15	0.24570825	It affirms the very first word of the first sentence of the first section of the first article of the Constitution, where the framers wrote: ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.

6_3	0.099260888	Clinton said, "The projects in this bill would not substantially improve the quality of life of military service members and their families".

8_0	0.6609395	WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by vetoing single items of spending or specific tax breaks approved by Congress.
8_1	0.17847367	In a 6-3 decision, the court rejected a decades-old effort to strengthen the hand of the president in struggles with Congress.
8_2	0.28255177	The court quoted George Washington, who presided over the Constitutional Convention and later wrote that a president must ``approve all the parts of a bill, or reject it in toto,'' but cannot modify the text of legislation presented to him by Congress.
8_3	0.12205411	The court's reasoning Thursday was exceptionally simple.
8_4	0.41596231	``The President has amended two acts of Congress by repealing a portion of each,'' said the majority opinion, by Justice John Paul Stevens.
8_5	0.22855855	``Repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Article I'' of the Constitution, which established ``a single finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure'' for enacting laws.
8_6	0.31943184	In 1996, Congress tried to change that procedure, and reduce the budget deficit, by allowing the president to cancel individual items of federal spending and tax breaks.
8_7	0.15812859	But the court said Thursday that such line-item vetoes were unconstitutional.
8_8	0.41780114	``The Line Item Veto Act authorizes the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing the procedures set out in Article I,'' Stevens said.
8_9	0.17447566	President Clinton, traveling in China, said he was ``deeply disappointed'' with the ruling.
8_10	0.10865662	``The decision is a defeat for all Americans,'' Clinton said.
8_11	0.1660685	``It deprives the president of a valuable tool for eliminating waste in the federal budget and for enlivening the public debate over how to make the best use of public funds''.
8_12	0.4649318	Clinton has used the line-item veto to rewrite 11 laws, eliminating 82 items, including money for New York City hospitals and a tax break for Idaho potato growers.
8_13	0.15648004	Thursday's decision came in lawsuits filed by New York City, the Greater New York Hospital Association, two unions of health-care workers, the Snake River Potato Growers and one of its officers.
8_14	0.28266291	In an opinion concurring with Stevens, Justice Anthony Kennedy chided Congress for surrendering power to the president.
8_15	0.092559812	``Failure of political will does not justify unconstitutional remedies,'' Kennedy declared.

8_21	0.10357923	``Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the branches seek to transgress the separation of powers,'' he said.
8_22	0.42252024	The dissenters _ Justices Antonin Scalia, Stephen Breyer and Sandra Day O'Connor _ would have upheld the line-item veto.
8_23	0.32482494	Scalia said that ``there is not a dime's worth of difference'' between allowing the president to cancel a particular project, through the line-item veto, and allowing him to spend money on a particular item at his discretion.

8_46	0.355821	Byrd led six members of Congress in challenging the constitutionality of the line-item veto last year, before Clinton had used the device.
8_47	0.16359732	In June 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no genuine ``case or controversy'' because the lawmakers had not suffered any ``personal, concrete injury''.
8_48	0.24218238	On Thursday, by contrast, the court said that the New York hospitals and the Idaho potato growers had suffered an ``actual injury''.
8_49	0.24225188	Stevens said that the line-item veto, by creating a potential liability of at least $2.6 billion for New York, could harm the city's financial strength and borrowing power.

10_0	0.43779386	WASHINGTON _ Government and hospital officials in New York state praised the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the president's line-item veto power Thursday, saying that it would preserve a set of state hospital taxes that help finance health care for the poor.
10_1	0.12952543	The decision settles in New York's favor a longstanding disagreement between the state and federal government over the legality of some of those taxes, which raised $2.6 billion for health care programs from 1992 to 1996.
10_2	0.090944428	State and city officials had been concerned that if they lost the dispute, the Clinton administration would require the state, city and many hospitals to reimburse some of that money, with potentially devastating consequences for patient care and government budgets.

12_1	0.55386275	In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress.
12_2	0.23695103	The court also said the 1996 measure authorized the president to issue what were, in practical terms, partial vetoes.
12_3	0.53034502	In passing the law, Congress said the president could cancel individual items in tax and spending bills within five days of signing them into law.
12_4	0.13534739	Congress, however, was allowed to try to reinstate the items by having both houses pass them in separate bills.
12_5	0.37656166	Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, an authority sought by nearly every chief executive this century as a tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
12_6	0.52014854	But Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said the law ``authorized the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing Article 1 procedures''.

12_8	0.1122994	Stevens concluded that the 1996 act ``may or may not be desirable, but it is surely not a document'' that is constitutional.
12_9	0.22182653	A year ago, the justices heard a challenge to the act brought by six members of Congress, but it dismissed their suit, saying they had no standing to sue because they had not suffered any injury because of the veto, which at that point Clinton had not exercised.

12_17	0.19096762	In their arguments before the court, lawyers for the challengers said that no matter when a president changes the spending bill or for what reasons, the bottom line is that what takes effect was not passed by both chambers of Congress, as required by the Constitution.

16_1	0.28686627	Supreme Court after a federal judge struck down the line-item veto Thursday as unconstitutional.
16_2	0.31518704	President Bill Clinton said he was "disappointed" by the ruling, but expressed confidence the line-item law eventually will be upheld by the Supreme Court.
16_3	0.2404815	Under the law, which took effect in January 1997, the president has five days after signing a bill to cancel some of its appropriations, or cancel special tax breaks seen as applying to small numbers of people.
16_4	0.37026899	Congress could overturn all or some of the line-item vetoes on a majority vote in a "disapproval bill," but if the president then vetoes that bill, it would require a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and Senate to override.
16_5	0.11294998	In his Thursday ruling, U.S.
16_6	0.21307967	Judge Thomas Hogan struck down the law as unconstitutional on the basis of the separation of powers among the three branches of government.
16_7	0.22693156	New York, among others, had brought this latest challenge to the law when a line-item veto by Clinton last year deprived the state of extra federal funds for Medicaid --the federal health insurance program covering poor, elderly and disabled Americans.

16_9	0.16240773	The state was joined in its challenge by Idaho potato farmers, who also lost out on funding because of a line-item veto.
16_10	0.16714319	Clinton joined congressional Republicans in campaigning for the line-item veto authority, but he used it relatively sparingly in its first full year.
16_11	0.37122291	In a brief written statement Thursday, Clinton said, "The line-item veto provides an important tool for the president to strike unnecessary spending and tax items from legislation."
17_0	0.2794531	UNDATED: Many of the tears being shed on Capitol Hill after the Supreme Court's rejection of the presidential line-item veto may be crocodile tears.
17_1	0.095991681	As fiscal experiments go, it may have cost even its staunchest supporters more in political capital than it saved in tax money.
17_2	0.13184835	Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies for the Cato Institute, estimates the savings from presidential line-item vetoes at $2 billion over five years.
17_3	0.051972142	Given that federal spending will be about $9 trillion during this time, $2 billion hardly amounts to a rounding error in Washington's grand fiscal scheme of things.
17_4	0.091617459	It wouldn't, for that matter, amount to more than a small percentage of the net worth of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.
17_5	0.09041852	To be sure, most Americans consider $2 billion a lot of money.
17_6	0.080467361	Most, however, don't think about such a huge sum in the context of how many taxpayer-hours must be worked to generate $2 billion in tax revenues.
17_7	0.088448585	The magnitude of federal spending is so large that average folks can't relate to the size of its expenditures in a practical way.
17_8	0.089470947	Moreover, as Moore points out, the savings achieved so far has been mostly from pork appropriations.
17_9	0.16963258	This makes the political calculus of the line-item veto a tricky proposition.
17_10	0.08850483	On the one hand, pork-barrel spending is traditionally reviled as the most cynically deployed and least utilitarian form of largess.
17_11	0.093830601	On the other hand, it's immensely popular with those who get it.
17_12	0.091820182	This is why legislators on both sides of the aisle use it to buy votes and reward allies.
17_13	0.20461382	Moore laments the fact that the president won't get to wield the item veto on this year's highway bill, which he sees as a monument to both pork and the need it creates for the line-item veto.
17_14	0.087274414	The bill contains a record 1,500 pork projects, Moore says, or about ``three slabs of bacon'' for each congressional district.
17_15	0.081020851	One person's pork, however, is another's economic sustenance, which is why so many Americans enthusiastically embrace this particular form of wealth redistribution, even though they profess contempt for it.
17_16	0.13815148	Although the line-item veto was a priority in the GOP's ``Contract With America,'' enthusiasm for it probably has waned even among its hard-core Republican supporters.
17_17	0.10420566	The degree of residual support will become more evident when congressional champions of the concept begin their push to try to change the law in a way the courts will find constitutional.
17_18	0.092419394	The response will be a good gauge of how many in Congress think it's a luxury they can afford and still get re-elected.
17_19	0.097345479	Have you ever wondered what forms the more egregious examples of pork take?
17_20	0.097199371	Moore lists a few worth pondering.
17_21	0.073171108	This year's budget, for instance, contained nearly $300,000 for research on how to enhance the flavor of roasted peanuts and $150,000 for the National Center for Peanut Competitiveness.

17_23	0.081888166	New Orleans got $2 million to refurbish a streetcar named Desire.
17_24	0.084899607	Some may find this outrageous, but remember: The areas where such money will be spent hail the winning of such largess as a boon to the local economy.
17_25	0.080402187	Business, civic and political leaders in Kansas City and elsewhere put a high premium on their legislators bringing home the bacon.

21_0	0.40836298	WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Thursday dealt a blow to the power of U.S. presidents, striking down as unconstitutional a law that enabled chief executives to delete individual funding items from massive budget legislation.
21_1	0.66317298	In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act violated the constitution's separation of powers between Congress, which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it into law or vetoes it.

22_0	0.65332406	WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Congress violated the principle of separation of powers when it gave the president the power to cut individual projects from tax and spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation.
22_1	0.53234917	In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house of Congress.
22_2	0.23568014	The court also said the 1996 measure authorized the president to issue what were, in practical terms, partial vetoes.
22_3	0.098723874	The only way such vetoes can be authorized is through a constitutional amendment, the justices said.
22_4	0.5116117	In passing the law, Congress said the president could cancel individual items in tax and spending bills within five days of signing them into law.
22_5	0.13762391	Congress, however, was allowed to try to reinstate the items by having both houses pass them in separate bills.
22_6	0.3733032	Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, an authority sought by nearly every chief executive this century as a tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
22_7	0.43178985	But Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said the law ``authorized the president himself to effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing Article 1 procedures''.

23_0	0.35672114	The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 26: In a sound and much-needed decision, the Supreme Court has rejected the line-item veto as a departure from the basic constitutional requirement that presidents accept or reject bills in their entirety.
23_1	0.29605815	The 6-3 decision, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, firmly cast aside government arguments that in canceling specific lines of the budget the president was merely exercising authority delegated to him by Congress.
23_2	0.19247743	Instead the court found that the line-item veto violates the ```presentment clause'' of Article I.
23_3	0.097058948	That clause establishes the process by which a bill becomes law.
23_4	0.095693262	It is unfortunate that the majority opinion rests solely on the procedural problem, never reaching the more profound constitutional defect.
23_5	0.17319991	The line-item veto is an affront to the separation of powers and an abrogation of responsibility by Congress.
23_6	0.098446344	That issue, however, did get addressed eloquently in Justice Anthony Kennedy's concurring opinion.
23_7	0.173727	``By increasing the power of the president beyond what the Framers envisioned,'' Kennedy wrote, ``the statute compromises the political liberty of our citizens, liberty which the separation of powers seeks to secure''.
23_8	0.098272442	In contrast to this solid constitutional reasoning, the court veered off course with a dangerous 8-1 ruling that found no First Amendment violation in congressional efforts to control the National Endowment for the Arts.
23_9	0.090537397	The law in question ordered the NEA to consider ``general standards of decency'' when making grants.
23_10	0.11235161	Conveniently misinterpreting the statue, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor deemed its restrictive instructions to be merely ``an advisory opinion''.
23_11	0.089637344	In a powerful dissent, Justice David Souter scorched that unrealistically benign view of what he aptly called ``a statutory mandate to deny recognition to virtually any expression capable of causing offense in any quarter''.
23_12	0.093269633	Some of the justices who joined the majority may have been motivated by a desire to help protect the NEA from further congressional attacks.
