2_1	0.23076923076923078	It's literally a weed in Italy, and it would grow just as easily in anybody's garden if not for one tiny problem: the flea beetle.
2_2	0.1875	Flea beetles are minuscule black insects that appear early in the spring and spend the rest of the season leaping among the plants, chewing holes in leaves.
2_3	0.0	They hop like fleas, hence the common name.

2_9	0.25	If I don't, the flea beetles will chomp the seedlings into oblivion the moment the first leaves peek above the surface.
2_10	0.6	Even so, the flea beetles know the arugula is there.
2_11	0.0	They alight on the protective cover, patiently waiting for me to lift it to snag a bunch of arugula, so they can sneak in and start munching.
2_12	0.0	I imagine saliva dripping from their little jaws.
2_13	0.3076923076923077	It is no comfort to know that this pest is an accidental import, like the European corn borer, the Japanese beetle and the gypsy moth.
2_14	0.2727272727272727	Flea beetles are thought to have arrived in North America in the early 1900s, probably from Europe or Asia.
2_15	0.0	They got off the boat in British Columbia and made their way steadily eastward.

2_18	0.3333333333333333	Several mild winters in a row have made the problem even worse by allowing more flea beetles to survive.
2_19	0.0	What's a gardener to do?
2_20	0.47368421052631576	At a conference in New Haven this winter, research scientists and organic farmers pondered the perplexing problem of Phyllotreta cruciferae, the cabbage-crunching flea beetle, as well as its nightshade-noshing cousins.

2_25	0.0	They also bound away at the slightest disturbance.
2_26	0.07692307692307693	Those characteristics put them out of reach of most botanical pesticides and even the chemicals commonly available for home use, because the pesticide has to touch the insects to kill them.
2_27	0.3548387096774194	Aside from keeping the beetles' favorite foods under cover, farmers reported trying _ with limited success _ to repel them with garlic and hot pepper sprays, planting cabbage family crops among aromatic herbs and vacuuming the insects off their crops with leaf blowers adapted to work in reverse.
2_28	0.2	Some tried to snare the flea beetles on sticky traps: pieces of white or yellow poster board taped to bamboo sticks and coated with a gooey product called Tangle-Trap.
2_29	0.375	Flea beetles are attracted to white and yellow, and they paste themselves to the traps in numbers.
2_30	0.16	Kimberly Stoner, an entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, tried baiting sticky traps with mustard oil, the substance that cabbage-loving flea beetles home in on when they're looking for their favorite snack plants.
2_31	0.0	The baited traps worked, perhaps too well.
2_32	0.0	``I suspect that they attract many more beetles than they trap,'' she said.
2_33	0.0	Those tempted to try this at home should be warned that concentrated mustard oil can make eyes water and burn skin.
2_34	0.21428571428571427	Repellent sprays, traps and covers are usually enough to keep flea beetles from doing fatal damage to crops like broccoli, turnips and rutabagas, but nothing can keep them from making unattractive holes in leafy greens like arugula and mizuna, a mild Japanese mustard that's also splendid in salads.
2_35	0.4444444444444444	For now, there is only one solution to the flea beetle problem: grow the most vulnerable crops in the fall.
2_36	0.15789473684210525	Flea beetles run roughshod over the garden until autumn, when they stop reproducing and start looking for a cozy place to spend the winter _ in the soil, fallen leaves or a grassy spot.

2_38	0.6	What do Italians do about flea beetles in the arugula?
2_39	0.11764705882352941	Nothing. The beetles aren't considered a big problem in Europe, suggesting that they made it to North America unaccompanied by the natural predators that keep them in check in their native lands.

5_4	0.0	If native shrubs are supposed to be more pest resistant, why are they being attacked?
5_5	0.0	Is there something I can do about it?
5_6	0.0	A. Native shrubs and trees are normally better adapted to the resident pests as well as to the climate, but the viburnum leaf beetle (Pyrrhalta viburni) is a stranger who has come to dinner.
5_7	0.0	Originally European, the beetle was first discovered in Ontario in 1947, and has now migrated to 27 Western and Central counties of New York, as well as Maine.
5_8	0.0	The larvae skeletonize leaves in May and June, starting from the bottom of the plant and working their way up, and the adults finish up any leftovers from July to October.
5_9	0.0	Eggs are laid in slits on the underside of the tips of young branches in nice, straight lines that appear as dark brown bumps.

6_0	0.0	VALLEY VILLAGE, Calif.
6_1	0.0	--Shaken like salt from their paper cartons, ladybugs tumbled into the trees Tuesday above suburban Valley Village Park in the San Fernando Valley to do battle with a menacing pest.
6_2	0.0	Workers with the Los Angeles parks department carefully dropped 2 million ladybugs into the park's eucalyptus trees in hope the red-shelled beetles will eat strange Australian plant lice attacking the trees.
6_3	0.0	Park officials and entomologists don't know whether the plan will work.
6_4	0.0	The invading red gum lerp psyllid, which drains the juice from eucalyptus trees, is a newcomer to America, and experts don't yet know the best way to fight it.
6_5	0.0	But Kevin Regan, chief arborist for the parks department, said the ladybugs are worth a try.
6_6	0.0	They already have been seen eating psyllids in the park, and Regan would rather give them a shot at beating back the infestation than immediately resort to pesticides.
6_7	0.0	``If this doesn't work, we've lost nothing,'' said Regan, as helmeted workers atop cherry pickers shook $1,700 worth of ladybugs into the trees.
6_8	0.0	``We got to try using some kind of biological control first''.
6_9	0.0	If they gobble up the invaders, Regan will start dropping ladybugs into more city recreation areas, probably starting with heavily infested Griffith Park.
6_10	0.0	``Really, just about everywhere you go, you'll find them,'' he said.
6_11	0.0	The tiny psyllid first appeared in America last year and already has spread through much of California.
6_12	0.0	Los Angeles County agriculture officials spotted three infested trees just across Interstate 10 from their El Monte office in June.
6_13	0.0	The pest showed up in the Bay Area at virtually the same time and has now hit the San Gabriel Valley and Orange County, said Rosser Garrison, an entomologist for the Los Angeles County agricultural agency.
6_14	0.0	The city's worst infestation is in a stand of 70-year-old eucalyptus surrounding a picnic area in Valley Village Park.
6_15	0.0	Young psyllids have covered the trees' sickle-shape leaves with sticky white cones, called lerps, that protect the insects as they grow.
6_16	0.07142857142857142	While entomologists say the psyllids by themselves probably can't kill the trees, they can put them under stress so they are more susceptible to attack by other insects.
6_17	0.0	The thought of losing Valley Village Park's eucalyptus trees worries those who live nearby.
6_18	0.0	In late afternoons, the park is filled with couples playing with their children and residents walking their dogs.

6_20	0.0	``If the trees died, that would ruin the place''.
6_21	0.0	The question is whether the ladybugs, which usually feast on aphids, will eat enough of the psyllids to make a difference.
6_22	0.0	``They're nice to have, and they may eat some of the psyllids, but I don't think you'll see a serious drop in the population,'' said Garrison.
6_23	0.0	He said further studies must be done to find out what insects attack the psyllids in their Australian home.
6_24	0.0	Steve Hazzard, president of the company that supplied the ladybugs released Tuesday, said a gardening Web site lists the specific breed of ladybugs he used as a predator of the invading psyllids.
6_25	0.0	Since ladybugs tend to fly during daylight, workers waited until late afternoon to begin placing them in the trees.
6_26	0.0	Shipped in cartons that look like pint-size ice cream containers, the red bugs had been stored in a refrigerator to simulate winter hibernation and, Hazzard hoped, make them emerge ravenous.
6_27	0.0	``They've gone from November until now without anything to eat, so now is the time,'' said Hazzard, of Organic Control, Inc.
6_28	0.0	Parks officials will monitor the bug war for the next 30 to 40 days, Regan said.

8_31	0.0	While organic growing methods are still in their infancy nationwide and account for a relatively small percentage of fruit grown in the Salinas Valley, the idea is catching on.
8_32	0.0	For growers like Jones, the popularity of organic produce means higher prices, which in turn means that field workers receive a better wage _ typically $9.80 an hour rather than the $9.35 working in conventionally cultivated fields _ guaranteeing their commitment to these environment-friendly methods.

8_45	0.0	1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL; &LR; &UR; &QL; &LR; &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR; Here are some ways to use the best of the local crop of fresh strawberries now in our markets.
8_46	0.0	&LR; &QL; &UR; Strawberry and Rhubarb Puff Pastry Tart.
8_47	0.0	&LR; Thaw frozen puff pastry.
8_48	0.0	Slice about 6 rhubarb stalks into 1/2-inch-thick slices and cook them in enough water to cover, along with some brown sugar, a little lemon juice and a split vanilla bean, until they are soft but still hold their shape.

9_0	0.29411764705882354	TECATE, Mexico _ Enrique Ceballos is showing two visitors through the organic gardens at Rancho La Puerta, a spa here on the Baja peninsula just across the border from California.
9_1	0.0	As he talks, he picks his supper.
9_2	0.0	``See the holes in the Swiss chard''? he asked.
9_3	0.0	``People don't normally buy it because of the holes.
9_4	0.0	I prefer to eat the holes than the chemicals''.
9_5	0.0	Then he makes a little joke: ``If you are lucky, you get extra protein from the bugs''.
9_6	0.0	In fact, there are very few blemishes on the rows of chard and lettuce, spinach and cabbage, even though chemicals are never sprayed in this three-acre garden.
9_7	0.0	Ceballos' work is guided by one principle: ``In nature, all is in balance, and if you kill part of that balance it damages the environment''.
9_8	0.0	He also applies that belief in cultivating the olive and fruit trees at the resort, and in tending its beehives.
9_9	0.0	In summer, 90 percent to 95 percent of the fruits and vegetables served to Rancho La Puerta's 150 guests have been grown by Ceballos and his staff; in the winter, the proportion drops to 50 percent.
9_10	0.0	Ceballos, 44, a biologist from Tecate with a master's degree in ecology from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, intended to be a wildlife manager.
9_11	0.0	But 14 years ago he was persuaded to work at the ranch by Sarah Livia Brightwood, the daughter of its founders.
9_12	0.5	She wanted to restore the organic garden her father had planted 50 years earlier.
9_13	0.0	``If you talk about healthy living at the ranch, you should be eating healthy food,'' she said.
9_14	0.0	The garden had lain fallow for 25 years, abandoned when a nematode problem overwhelmed the crops.
9_15	0.0	The worms were still there when work began, but new strategies have been developed for dealing with them.
9_16	0.0	For example, a crop of a species of marigold that is a nematode suppressor was planted.
9_17	0.42857142857142855	The marigolds did their job so well that other crops could be planted near them.
9_18	0.0	The area of heaviest nematode infestation is now planted with fruit trees that are resistant to them, and with herbs and flowers the pests aren't interested in.
9_19	0.35294117647058826	Being an organic farmer requires sensitivity, creativity and observation to decide what is planted, and when, where and how; to know such things as which weeds should be left and which pulled, and what companion planting accomplishes.
9_20	0.0	Following are some lessons learned from a stroll in Ceballos' garden.
9_21	1.0833333333333333	_ Flowers are essential in a vegetable garden because they attract beneficial insects like praying mantises and ladybugs, which eat aphids.
9_22	0.25	_ Basil and tomatoes are planted together because the herb repels worms that love the fruit.
9_23	0.35714285714285715	_ Plants in the onion family, like chives or garlic, are planted with broccoli and cabbage because the alliums discourage aphids from feasting on the cruciferous vegetables.
9_24	0.0	_ Plants are placed close to one another, to conserve water.
9_25	0.0	Cabbage is planted with lettuce, which matures first; after the lettuce is picked the cabbage fills in the spaces.
9_26	0.2	_ Spinach that grows in the wild is transplanted to beds of cultivated spinach; the wild spinach is more resistant to bugs and gives the cultivated spinach more of a chance.
9_27	0.0	_ In a form of crop rotation, celery is planted after tomatoes because tomatoes take a lot of nitrogen from the soil and celery needs very little.
9_28	0.0	_ Weeds that are not too aggressive are allowed because their roots help retain moisture in the soil.
9_29	0.0	Ceballos plans to make herbal teas from the new herb garden, and soon there will be eggs from the organic chickens that have just arrived.
9_30	0.0	He also makes about 300 gallons of cold-pressed, unfiltered olive oil from trees in the garden.
9_31	0.0	``This farming is a low-tech activity,'' he said.
9_32	0.0	``It depends so much on the senses, knowing the cycles of the moon, the soil''.
9_33	0.0	Many spa guests spend part of their stay weeding and planting.
9_34	0.0	``Some people who live in apartments never have had the opportunity to feel soil,'' Ceballos said.
9_35	0.0	``They ask me about the trees carrots grow on.''
10_0	0.0	Q: Something is chewing small holes in the leaves of my vegetables.
10_1	0.0	I have looked closely to try to find an insect, and something appears to hop away when I move the leaves.
10_2	0.0	Any clue as to what this is?
10_3	0.15	A: Flea beetles are minuscule insects _ adults are about 1/16 inch long and black or greenish-black _ that appear in spring and leap among plants and chew numerous, small holes in leaves.
10_4	0.0	They hop like fleas, therefore their common name.
10_5	0.0	If there are enough of them, they can do considerable damage.
10_6	0.0	Leaves may wilt and turn brown, and the plant may die.
10_7	0.5714285714285714	There are several species of flea beetles that damage vegetables and ornamentals.
10_8	0.1875	Among those that visit here are the tobacco flea beetle, the potato flea beetle and the eggplant flea beetle, which prefer nightshade-family plants such as eggplant and tomatoes.
10_9	0.42857142857142855	You may find flea beetles in your arugula, broccoli and corn, as well.
10_10	0.0	This pest is an accidental import, thought to have arrived in North America in the early 1900s, probably from Europe or Asia.
10_11	0.4	Adult flea beetles hibernate in the soil, then lay eggs in the soil or around the base of a plant.
10_12	0.0	In a week or so, larvae are feeding on plant roots before pupating and emerging as adults.
10_13	0.17647058823529413	Seemingly overnight, flea beetles recently visited our garden, peppering the leaves of two fuchsias with so many small holes that they left mere outlines of the foliage.
10_14	0.35714285714285715	If you are an organic gardener, you need quick hands to catch and squish these agile pests, as they bound away with the slightest hint of your approach.
10_15	0.0	They can slip underneath a leaf before you bat an eye.
10_16	0.0	Like other beetles, they are hard-bodied, and this, coupled with their acrobatic ability, makes it tough to easily nab them with a pesticide.
10_17	0.0	The pesticide needs to make good contact with the beetles, so you may be looking at more than one application.
10_18	0.0	Some of the chemicals commonly used around the garden target the pests.
10_19	0.16666666666666666	So do products that contain neem, a botanical pesticide.
10_20	0.25	Rotenone and pyrethrum products can work, too.
10_21	0.5555555555555556	In addition to eliminating as many of the enemy as possible with speedy fingers, the organic gardener has additional options: Use row covers to keep the pests off spring vegetables; repel them with garlic and hot pepper sprays; or capture them on white or yellow sticky traps.
10_22	0.0	Q: Could you give me some advice on the care of my bearded iris?
10_23	0.0	I have four different beds with different varieties and differing amounts of sunlight.
10_24	0.0	All bloom poorly.
10_25	0.0	What fertilizer should I use?
10_26	0.0	When and how often?
10_27	0.0	Do these irises require an acid or alkaline soil?
10_28	0.0	I water them regularly from early spring to late summer.
10_29	0.0	Then they get only rainwater until next spring.
10_30	0.0	When I separate them and give them to friends, these irises bloom quite well.
10_31	0.0	A: I am not sure which bearded iris you have, but I have found the easiest to be the large-flowered, fragrant ``early purples,'' believed to be a form of ``Iris x germanica,'' or German irises.
10_32	0.0	``Iris x albicans,'' the cemetery whites, are another group of more easily grown bearded iris.
10_33	0.0	I have learned from growing these that they prefer to be planted shallowly, demand good drainage and like sun.
10_34	0.0	And, as you've found, division encourages better flowering.
10_35	0.0	This is often necessary every three years.
10_36	0.0	A well-prepared, raised bed of soil enriched with compost or well-rotted manure is important, as well.
10_37	0.0	These irises tolerate a soil pH between 6 and 9, preferring a soil that is slightly alkaline.
10_38	0.0	I understand a low-nitrogen formula, such as a 6-10-6, is best, as too much nitrogen can lead to rhizome rot.
10_39	0.0	Apply such a fertilizer in the fall and after flowering.
10_40	0.0	An application of a superphosphate in late February, before flowering, can be beneficial.
10_41	0.0	I also have found these bearded irises to be surprisingly drought-tolerant once established.
10_42	0.0	Give them adequate moisture, but don't overdo it, especially if the soil is slow to drain.
10_43	0.0	Q: My magnolia is dropping leaves.
10_44	0.0	What's the problem?
10_45	0.0	A: Magnolias, although called ``evergreen,'' must drop old leaves to make room for new.
10_46	0.0	Those in our neighborhood are shedding like crazy.
10_47	0.0	By late winter, magnolia leaves, having been on the tree for a growing season, often look weary.
10_48	0.0	They may be scorched, and even have fungal spots.
10_49	0.0	Then, in late April and May, the tree drops these leaves.
10_50	0.0	If your tree is replacing these with fresh, healthy leaves, don't worry.
10_51	0.0	Magnolias may also drop leaves at other times during the year.
10_52	0.0	Keep trees watered well.
10_53	0.0	The roots are especially shallow, and long, hot summers are tough.
10_54	0.0	A layer of organic mulch beneath the canopy is a good idea as it helps preserve soil moisture and keeps soil temperature down.
10_55	0.0	It also boosts the soil when it breaks down.
10_56	0.0	&QL; &QL; Mail garden questions to Kathy Huber, garden editor, Houston Chronicle, P.O.

11_1	0.0	_ Sunrise at Sunnyside Farms is greeted by a ritual that startles the uninitiated.
11_2	0.19047619047619047	Workers advance upon windowless structures on wheels that are scattered around the 539 acres and lower the sides, releasing thousands of clucking chickens eager for a good day's work at what they do best: eating bugs.
11_3	0.3157894736842105	David Cole, venture capitalist, philanthropist and organic farmer, uses these coops on wheels _ chicken mobile units, they're called _ to move his chickens where the pecking is needed most.
11_4	0.05263157894736842	The mobile units are just one of many labor-savers he employs on the organic farm he started in 1995 in the middle of Rappahannock County, home to the very rich who have made their money elsewhere and to farmers who barely make a living.
11_5	0.09090909090909091	Like the cattle, sheep and goats that keep the pasture trimmed, the chickens take care of fertilizing it.
11_6	0.0	Like every aspect of his $11.5 million farm, the mobile units are state-of-the-art equipment intended to ensure the success of his experimental farm.
11_7	0.0	Money is no object, and money is not the only objective.
11_8	0.0	The farm is not a rich man's hobby.
11_9	0.0	It is a rich man's business, and Cole, who made his name as president of Internet services at America Online (and his money in a variety of other computer technology businesses), predicts confidently that Sunnyside will turn a profit by 2004.
11_10	0.0	In addition to its wagonloads of chickens, the farm has 424 head of Wagyu cattle (close relatives of the famous Japanese Kobe beef); 60 to 70 varieties of vegetables, herbs and flowers; and 8 to 10 varieties of berries, as well as pear, apple and cherry trees.
11_11	0.0	It is experimenting with more than 200 kinds of fruits and vegetables.
11_12	0.09090909090909091	But even more important to Cole is Sunnyside's role in promoting organic farming as economic savior.
11_13	0.0	By helping local growers profit in an era when independent farms are struggling, he hopes to create a model for reviving depressed agricultural areas around the country.
11_14	0.125	The idea of saving a region through organic farming might once have sounded outlandish.
11_15	0.0	But the demand for organic food nationwide is greater than the supply, and sales have increased by at least 20 percent annually for several years.
11_16	0.06666666666666667	Buyers looking for such food _ independently certified to be free of chemical pesticides, genetically engineered ingredients and antibiotics _ willingly pay a premium for it.
11_17	0.0	Cole, 47, calls his system network farming: a large central farm is the hub, with smaller nearby farms the spokes, their production marketed through the hub.
11_18	0.047619047619047616	Sunnyside's system is designed to show that diversified organic farming, with a mix of vegetables, fruits and animals, can be profitable while protecting the environment, not only from tract housing but also from the damage done to it by traditional farming methods.
11_19	0.6666666666666666	Such a system would be particularly useful in helping small organic farmers compete.
11_20	0.0	The concept is not new.

11_28	0.05555555555555555	The farm pays to educate them in converting to organic techniques and gaining organic certification and gives them access to the expensive equipment needed to run an organic farm.
11_29	0.0	It also pays them 20 to 30 percent more than they would get if they were selling conventional food and, more important, gets their products to consumers.
11_30	0.0	``A weakness of a lot of farmers is marketing,'' said Brian Cramer, the gardener and orchard production manager at Sunnyside.
11_31	0.0	Selling at farmers' markets or farm stands, with no middlemen, ``is always preferable,'' he said, ``but some farmers don't want to do it''.
11_32	0.0	``Some don't have time to do it,'' he said, ``so they leave it to someone else, and they get taken advantage of''.

11_35	0.0	Its farmers' products will be sold there, at a farmers' market in Washington, D.C., and to restaurants, the Fresh Fields natural supermarket chain and an organic wholesaler who sells up and down the East Coast.
11_36	0.0	There will be more than 30 varieties of tomatoes, 15 different peppers and three dozen kinds of greens.
11_37	0.0	``Eventually we could have 8 or 10 spoke farms, and that could have a tremendous economic impact on the community,'' said Cole, who has restored the 1720 house on the farm, one of several places he lives with his wife of 30 years and the youngest of their four children.

11_41	0.07142857142857142	It took two years of intensive working and enriching the soil for the first earthworms to return, and Sunnyside was certified organic in 1999.
11_42	0.058823529411764705	DiMatteo, of the Organic Trade Association, said she doubts that aylne has ever started an organic farm from scratch on so grand a scale, and while she greatly admires what Cole is trying to do, she is not certain it will succeed.
11_43	0.1111111111111111	``People either go into organic farming gradually or specialize in one crop while they figure out crop rotations,'' she said.

11_52	0.0	Cole, though, maintains that with enough money and his successful business experience he can help nature along.

11_55	0.0	To assure a steady supply of loyal farmworkers, who are recruited from two villages in Mexico, Cole provides benefits including trips home for two or three months at a time and 401(k) plans, matching the workers' contributions.
11_56	0.0	Cole has also planted several varieties of dwarf fruit stock to see which grow best.
11_57	0.5	These varieties, Cramer said, bear more fruit more quickly, and are easier to pick and to spray with organic pest controls.
11_58	0.0	Many are heirloom varieties like Roxbury Russet and Grimes Golden apples and newer varieties like Liberty that are immune to a serious apple disease called scab.

20_1	0.0	I love fragrant plants, but I don't like bees!
20_2	0.14285714285714285	Is there anything I can grow that will perfume the garden without attracting insects?
20_3	0.0	A. Perfume that doesn't attract insects would be a horticultural oxymoron: putting out the come hither for pollinating bugs is a flower's raison d'etre, and perfume is a large part of the mating dance.
20_4	0.09090909090909091	But you can have a fragrant garden low on bees by planting flowers and shrubs that open their blossoms at night.
20_5	0.0	Choices range from the small, inconspicuous, but mighty perfumed annual known as night-blooming stock (Matthiola bicornis) to the many cultivated varieties of Brugmansia, a tropical tree that can grow to 10 feet and has been showing up in nurseries under the name angels' trumpets.
20_6	0.0	All parts of Brugmansia are highly poisonous, but there's no denying the plant's appeal.
20_7	0.0	Its huge flowers blare tropical sweetness from dusk until almost sunup.
20_8	0.0	White is the most common color, and usually the most fragrant, but Brugmansia also comes in yellow, orange, peaches and pinks.
20_9	0.0	You'd never know it from the modern cultivars, which have been bred to stay open during the day, but old fashioned flowering tobacco (Nicotiana alata) has a very strong night perfume, and so does its much taller, more architecturally splendid cousin, N.
20_10	0.0	sylvestris. Other candidates include moonflower vines, night-blooming jasmine, evening primrose and the oddball Pardon Me, a day lily that doesn't get going until the sun goes down.
20_11	0.0	Brugmansia and matthiola are widely sold.
20_12	0.0	Pardon me (and other fragrant night bloomers) can be mail ordered from Snow Creek Daylily Gardens, P.O.

20_17	0.4	The Potato Beetle Wars Q.
20_18	0.5714285714285714	Help! Colorado potato beetles are destroying my potato plants.
20_19	0.0	I've been trying to go the organic route, handpicking them every day.
20_20	0.0	It's not working.
20_21	0.0	If I don't do something soon, I'm afraid the plants will die.
20_22	0.0	&QL; A.
20_23	0.4166666666666667	Leptinotarsa decemlineata, to give the miserable creature its proper name, is among the most difficult garden pests to control, organically or otherwise.
20_24	0.0	Don't panic.
20_25	0.0	Potato plants can take a lot of defoliation and still produce a decent crop.
20_26	0.0	But do take action, employing multiple strategies for best results.
20_27	0.8	Start by applying a dose of the organic gardener's friend, Bacillus thuringiensis var.
20_28	0.6666666666666666	san diego (or var.
20_29	0.0	tenebrionis). It is effective at killing small larvae, though only after they've consumed some of it.
20_30	0.0	This means spraying thoroughly (and repeatedly) according to the directions that come with the stuff.
20_31	0.0	It also means you're still stuck with larger larvae and adults.
20_32	0.7	Those can be killed with rotenone, a comparatively mild botanical poison permitted for use by organic gardeners.
20_33	0.0	Neem extract (Azadirachtin) is also on the organic list.
20_34	0.0	Well-stocked garden centers and farm supply stores will usually have these products.
20_35	0.0	Handpicking is still very useful, if it includes crushing the clusters of bright orange-yellow eggs that hide under the leaves.
20_36	0.0	It costs nothing, it doesn't pollute or kill any other creatures.
20_37	0.2	It keeps populations down and soothes gardeners, who if they have potato beetles, also have frustrations and aggressions that need release.
20_38	0.0	Unfortunately, it's not perfect.
20_39	0.0	No matter how thorough you are, you always miss a few, and you don't have to miss many to lose the war.
20_40	0.0	A single female can have 10,000 decendants by the end of summer.
20_41	0.0	One advantage (for the beetles) of numbers like these is the chance at resistant mutations.
20_42	0.0	No matter which controls you use, a few will be resistant, and those few will be multitudes ere long.
20_43	0.0	That's why it's important to attack on several fronts.
20_44	0.36363636363636365	To add insult to infestation, Colorado potato beetles can live a full two years.
20_45	0.0	But they won't stay around where there's nothing to eat, so the final, or first, line of defense is late planting.
20_46	0.0	If they don't find any potato, eggplant or nicotiana leaves when they emerge from the ground in spring, they'll leave.
20_47	0.0	More will appear, but if you can thwart that first wave, subsequent ones will be much smaller.

20_51	0.0	Unpublished questions cannot be answered individually. &QL;
21_0	0.0	Adjectivally speaking, the most coveted garden flowers tend to be choice, delicate, exquisite or elegant, and preferably also fragrant.
21_1	0.0	Roses, in other words, or lilies or lilacs or masses of sky-blue flax on gracefully nodding stems, but definitely not marigolds.
21_2	0.0	Not many would describe the fat, heavy flower of a marigold, jammed so full of petals that it looks more like a Koosh ball than a blossom, as delicate or elegant.
21_3	0.0	Odoriferous comes to mind, but not fragrant.
21_4	0.0	Still, there are other attributes worth considering in a garden flower.
21_5	0.0	Colorful, easy, reliable and pest-free are not bad adjectives, and if the marigold is more often thought of as common than as choice, those qualities may explain why.
21_6	0.0	There is much good to say about a flower with a sunny disposition and a desire to please.
21_7	0.0	In August, when most perennials are in their summer sulk and the annual flower garden looks a bit ratty, marigolds can be counted on to look presentable.
21_8	0.0	The season is long, and fidelity in a flower is as praiseworthy as flamboyance.
21_9	0.0	They don't look any different than they did in late June _ mounds of roly-poly flowers in shades of orange, yellow and sort-of red _ but marigolds look good when their neighbors are starting to fade.
21_10	0.0	Indeed, it would be nice to be an iris in one's youth and a marigold in middle age.
21_11	0.0	It's true that a large bed of one variety of marigold can be a bit boring.
21_12	0.0	The plants are so uniform that a mass looks stiff and soldierly.
21_13	0.0	They look better planted in clumps among other annuals or in drifts in front of evergreens or shrubs.
21_14	0.07142857142857142	But there are so many varieties of marigold that it would be fun to plant a marigold library, the way some botanical gardens plant libraries of daffodils and roses.
21_15	0.21428571428571427	There could be tall African marigolds, rising to three feet or more, and sprightly dwarf French marigolds, some only six inches tall.
21_16	0.0	Giant-flowered hybrid marigolds, with their impossibly huge, puffy flowers, could contrast with signet marigolds and their dime-size blooms.
21_17	0.0	There could be quite an array of flower shapes, too.
21_18	0.0	Not all marigolds have the carnation form, which is the term used to describe those petal-jammed flowers.
21_19	0.0	There are many varieties of single-flowered marigolds, which have a single rim of petals and look like gaily colored daisies.
21_20	0.0	A particularly interesting one is Striped Marvel, which has a single tier of thin petals, red on one half and yellow on the other.
21_21	0.0	It makes a bushy two-foot plant, but most single-flowered marigolds are dwarf or semi-dwarf varieties that grow no more than a foot tall.
21_22	0.0	Disco is one of the best, and it comes in a mixture that includes a delightful array of yellow, orange and bicolored flowers.
21_23	0.0	Marigolds in the Sophia class fall somewhere between the single-flowered and carnation-flowered types _ they have a double rim of petals, russet-red or orange edged with gold.
21_24	0.0	The marigold color range is limited to oranges, yellows, near-reds and combinations of those colors, although breeders have come up with several varieties so pale yellow that they appear ivory or white.
21_25	0.0	White marigolds have less of the characteristic scent, making them nice for gardeners who don't grow marigolds because they object to the smell.
21_26	0.0	To my nose, the scent of marigolds is much nicer than that of some salvias, which smell like a used litter box, but olfactory preferences vary.
21_27	0.0	The scent is probably why marigolds, which make fine cut flowers, do not get used in floral arrangements more often.
21_28	0.0	Most of the smell, however, is concentrated in the foliage.
21_29	0.0	The flowers themselves are almost odorless.
21_30	0.0	If you strip off the foliage, the scent of marigolds won't permeate the house.
21_31	0.0	You can also grow marigolds that don't have the characteristic scent.
21_32	0.0	Signet marigolds (Tagetes tenuifolia), also called gem marigolds, have citrus-scented foliage that is lacier than standard marigold foliage and a lighter shade of green.
21_33	0.0	The blossoms are small and dainty, with a single rim of petals.
21_34	0.0	Mexican mint marigold (T.
21_35	0.0	lucida), also called Mexican tarragon marigold, has the scent of anise and can be used in cooking as a substitute for tarragon.
21_36	0.09090909090909091	Some gardeners plant marigolds as a companion to vegetable crops, assuming the scent is a pest repellent.
21_37	0.10526315789473684	It's true that some marigolds can help control certain species of destructive nematodes, tiny soil-dwelling worms, but it's a chemical in the marigold roots, not the odor of the foliage, that does the trick.
21_38	0.75	Only French marigolds (T.
21_39	0.75	patula) are effective in controlling nematodes.
21_40	0.0	African marigolds (T.
21_41	0.0	erecta) and other varieties, including hybrids, won't work.
21_42	0.0	You also won't see any benefits until the year after the marigolds are grown, because the chemical is released from the roots as they break down in the soil.
21_43	0.2727272727272727	If nematodes are a problem in your garden, rotating the vegetable patch with a bed of French marigolds may help.
21_44	0.09090909090909091	Simply planting marigolds among the tomatoes and peppers probably won't do much, although it will certainly look nice.
21_45	0.0	Marigolds like full sun and soil that is decent but not too rich.
21_46	0.0	To keep them blooming steadily, snap off the spent flower heads occasionally.
21_47	0.0	There are some sterile varieties, called triploids, that do not set seed and will keep blooming even if the dead flowers are not removed, but even those will look better if they're cleaned up periodically.
21_48	0.0	If marigolds can't be elegant or exquisite, they can at least be immaculate.

22_0	0.0	LONDON _ Exchanging their confines for a temporary stay in the open country air, seven prisoners from Her Majesty's Prison Leyhill in the Cotswolds won their second gold medal last week at the Hampton Court Palace Flower Show, the Royal Horticultural Society's summer extravaganza.
22_1	0.0	Their show garden, ``Take a Walk on the Wild Side,'' included a woodland garden of wildflowers and grasses under linden and beech trees, with a stream flowing under a stone bridge.
22_2	0.0	``It is one thing to make a garden, and another to mimic nature,'' Adrian Foulkes, a prisoner, said of the difficulty of forcing bluebells and wild garlic into bloom.

22_5	0.0	The show, which attracts horticultural groups and garden designers, uses displays that are designed so that visitors can walk through them.
22_6	0.0	The prisoners' exhibit, situated on the banks of a long canal with spouting fountains, seemed like a real woodland in which one could rest on a willow seat under linden trees.
22_7	0.03333333333333333	The Hampton Court prize also honored the prisoners' vegetable garden display: a kitchen garden (carrots, onions, parsnips and runner beans) enclosed by cordoned apple and pear trees and a rusty fence overgrown with blackberry bushes from the prison's grounds.
22_8	0.0	The kitchen and woodland gardens were designed by Gareth Goundrill _ not a prisoner, but the 18-year-old son of Jeff Goundrill, who oversees business enterprises at Leyhill.
22_9	0.08695652173913043	The younger Goundrill made the designs as his final exam for a high school technology course, and the prisoners dug the grounds and planted the flowers, vegetables and trees with the help of the prison farm foreman, Martin Brookes.

22_26	0.0	``If a prison serves a bad meal, it sours the whole atmosphere,'' said Colin Lennox, the farm manager.
22_27	0.0	And the prison takes the word ``organic'' seriously.

23_0	0.0	BUFFALO, N.Y.
23_1	0.0	(AP) --The city plans to make a party out of hunting for grubs by hand as its phase-out of pesticide use begins in earnest.
23_2	0.0	Hundreds of volunteers will be enlisted for an August get-together, at which they will comb a municipal golf course for signs of the grass-destroying pests that have wreaked havoc in the past.
23_3	0.0	The goals are early detection and organic solutions.
23_4	0.0	Buffalo last year joined Albany, San Francisco and a handful of other municipalities that have committed to stopping virtually all pesticide use on city property.
23_5	0.0	Buffalo's Pesticide Sunset Ordinance took effect in September.
23_6	0.0	''This is brand new for us,'' said Gary Carrel of the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy, which is making plans for the first grub-scouting party at the Delaware Park golf course.
23_7	0.0	Rather than spray the entire course with dangerous chemicals, volunteers will target problem areas in an organized effort.
23_8	0.0	The hunters will line up five-to-10 feet apart and walk forward in tandem along the fairways, stopping at intervals to pull up small sections of ground and examine them for grubs before replacing them.
23_9	0.0	''These efforts are more environmentally friendly,'' but, he said, ''they also take a large volunteer force''.
23_10	0.0	So came the idea for the grub-scouting party.
23_11	0.0	The hope is there will be no sign of the pests, which staged a major infestation in 1995.
23_12	0.09090909090909091	If they are detected, however, there are several non-chemical solutions being considered, including the use of parasitic nematodes which feed on the larvae but don't harm the ground.
23_13	0.0	Chemical spraying would be a last resort.
23_14	0.0	''It's just moving to a whole environmentally friendly way,'' Carrel said.
23_15	0.0	''Golf courses are traditionally very chemical dependent''.
23_16	0.0	Under the city's Pesticide Sunset Ordinance, the most dangerous chemicals will be eliminated first, followed by the less hazardous pesticides.
23_17	0.0	Exemptions will be allowed for nontoxic and low-level pesticides and city departments can get waivers in emergencies.
23_18	0.0	Delaware Park has become a sort of testing ground for environmentally friendly groundskeeping.
23_19	0.0	The park's rose garden is being tended with organic compound and soon will be watered with a drip-irrigation system, rather than sprinklers, which soak the whole plant and encourage fungus growth, and in turn, pesticide use.
23_20	0.0	City officials hope residents will follow suit and stop using harmful chemicals on their own lawns.
23_21	0.05555555555555555	''Part of our mission is to increase public awareness,'' said Nancy Smith, co-chairwoman of the Pest Management Board, which was formed to help guide the city away from its chemical dependency.

24_0	0.0	SANTA ROSA, Calif.
24_1	0.0	_ In the quest for great grapes, some growers along the northern California coast, including the wine industry leaders Michael Topolos and Michael Benziger, are embracing age-old peasant farming methods and performing rituals such as burying cow horns and spreading crystals in their vineyards.
24_2	0.0	``I did this on a leap of faith.
24_3	0.0	I don't even pretend to understand all this stuff, but I'm committed because I've seen the results in my vineyards,'' said Topolos, co-owner of Topolos at Russian River Vineyards near Forestville.
24_4	0.0	He said yields have increased and grape quality has improved.
24_5	0.0	Topolos and Benziger, both practical businessmen prominent in the wine industry, are among the practitioners of biodynamic agriculture, a system of raising crops that uses methods as old as farming itself along with some New Age spirituality.
24_6	0.08333333333333333	Simply stated, biodynamics is an organic farming system that doesn't employ pesticides, herbicides or synthetic fertilizers.
24_7	0.29411764705882354	Instead, it relies on manure, crop rotations, biological pest control and cosmic forces to put life back into soils and the ecology surrounding the vineyard.
24_8	0.0	It works with nature and involves astronomy and homeopathy.
24_9	0.0	``If nothing else, biodynamic farming is helping to clean up the chemical disaster caused by pesticides and fertilizers that came with the industrialization of agriculture following World War II,'' Topolos said.
24_10	0.0	``We can't continue to poison our way through''.
24_11	0.0	Some scientists dismiss biodynamic farming as junk science and question its impact on grape quality.
24_12	0.0	``This kind of thing is used more as a marketing tool to sell wine,'' said Dr.
24_13	0.0	Roland Meyer, a soil science specialist with the University of California, Davis.
24_14	0.0	``Chances are biodynamic farming would have little or no effect on the flavor of the grape or the quality of wine''.
24_15	0.0	Biodynamics is so mystical and far-fetched, he said, that it's not even considered for further research at UC Davis.
24_16	0.0	It's estimated that biodynamic farming methods are used on 1,000 of the 100,000 acres of vineyards on the northern California coast.
24_17	0.0	The percentage is small but with names like Topolos, Benziger and Fetzer involved, this kind of farming is considered more than a fringe movement.
24_18	0.0	``The North Coast is the hot spot for biodynamic farming in California,'' said Chuck Beedy, executive director of the San Francisco-based Biodynamic Farming and Gardening Association.
24_19	0.0	The approach also is gaining momentum in France, he said, where dozens of wine estates have adopted biodynamic farming methods.
24_20	0.0	Thirty vineyards, orchards and vegetable farms are certified biodynamic in Northern California, Beedy said.
24_21	0.0	Nationwide, he said, 50 growers have earned biodynamic certification.
24_22	0.0	Biodynamic farming was developed in the 1920s by Austrian-born philosopher and spiritual leader Rudolph Steiner, who came up with a system of composting and special preparations that remains the foundation of the biodynamic farming movement.
24_23	0.0	Benziger, president of Benziger Family Winery in Glen Ellen, said he was drawn to biodynamics because of the promise that wine grapes will attain superior flavors _ flavors that reflect the vineyard site, a term the French call terroir.
24_24	0.0	Pesticides and herbicides kill natural organisms that give grapes an originality specific to the site, he said, an individuality that cannot be copied anywhere else in the world.
24_25	0.0	Before adopting biodynamics two years ago, Benziger had weaned his vineyards from toxic chemicals.
24_26	0.0	``The goal is to produce a wine that is one of a kind, a wine that has sense of place and a uniqueness that cannot be duplicated,'' Benziger said.
24_27	0.0	Other winemakers believe great wines can be made without using biodynamic principles.
24_28	0.0	``Biodynamics may be good for the soil and environment, but is it going to make a better wine''? asked Mike Gulyash, winegrower at Glen Ellen's B.R.
24_29	0.0	Cohn Winery, which has won accolades and awards for its ultra-premium wines.
24_30	0.0	``Biodynamics is not a bare-bones requirement to make a great wine''.
24_31	0.0	(STORY CAN END HERE.
24_32	0.0	OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS).
24_33	0.05	Biodynamics remains very much an alternative approach to grape growing because it rejects so much of what mainstream viticulture encourages _ chemical pesticides, synthetic fertilizers and routine disking, which disrupts the ecosystem on the vineyard floor.
24_34	0.0	``Biodynamics is giving up control over the vines.
24_35	0.0	The hardest thing with biodynamic farming is not jumping on the tractor and spraying when you see a problem,'' Benziger said.
24_36	0.0	What raises eyebrows among scientists and conventional growers is biodynamics' strange practices, such as applying herbal potions by the phases of the moon, spraying microscopic crystals and burying cow dung in a female cow horn.
24_37	0.0	Greg Willis, the biodynamics consultant at Topolos vineyards, said the buried horns, crystals and moon calendar that are part and parcel of biodynamic farming make the approach difficult for some growers to embrace.
24_38	0.0	He suggests that farmers get out of their boxes and try something new.
24_39	0.0	``We can argue all day about putting a horn in the ground, but we know it works,'' said Willis, owner of a Napa-based consulting business called Agri-Synthesis.
24_40	0.0	Interest in biodynamics is growing, Beedy said.
24_41	0.1111111111111111	``We are hearing from people that organic farming didn't answer all the questions they had.
24_42	0.0	They had questions about the unseen quality of life and how to work with the forces of nature,'' he said.
24_43	0.0	Alan York, a biodynamics expert, manages the vineyards at Jim Fetzer's Ceago Vinegarden.
24_44	0.0	He is also advising the Benziger Family Winery as it makes the transition to biodynamics.
24_45	0.0	Topolos, who before adopting biodynamic farming principles three years ago had farmed his vineyards organically for the 10 years, said biodynamics heals the negative effects of farm chemicals by helping the soil to regenerate its original energy so the vines can fend off insects and diseases.
24_46	0.0	Believing in the tenets of biodynamics and natural forces _ ``some that we understand and some that we don't'' _ is key to its success, he said.
24_47	0.0	The most mystical preparation is made by packing a cow horn with manure and then burying it a foot deep during the fall solstice.
24_48	0.0	It's dug up in the spring.
24_49	0.0	The manure ferments into a sweet-smelling humus-like material _ Topolos calls it black magic _ that is mixed in water and sprayed onto the land.
24_50	0.0	Topolos agrees that biodynamics requires growers to forget almost everything they have learned and to adopt a new way of thinking.
