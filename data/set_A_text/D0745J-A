13_1	0.090111986	Simpson wants to stop an upcoming television miniseries about the defense in his murder case, saying its purported revelations are the product of a lawyer's breach of legal confidentiality and an author's breach of promise.
13_2	0.16177722	Simpson filed suit Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court against his former friend and lawyer, Robert Kardashian, and author Lawrence Schiller, whose 1996 book ``American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story of the Simpson Defense'' is the basis of the series now being filmed for CBS Television for airing in November.

13_6	0.080193423	The suit also seeks return of any profits Schiller and Kardashian made by violating Simpson's rights.
13_7	0.056519309	``This action is about the avaricious disregard of the attorney-client relationship, and of promises of confidentiality, by an attorney and a writer who value the fame and fortune to be derived from publishing information about a sensational trial more than adhering to their ethical obligations and contractual agreements,'' Terry Gross, a lawyer representing Simpson, said in court papers.
13_8	0.1249545	Gross alleged that Schiller had gained the cooperation of Simpson and eight of his lawyers for the book project by promising, falsely, that Simpson would be allowed to review the manuscript before publication and remove any confidential material.
13_9	0.047368375	The lawsuit also accused Kardashian, a member of Simpson's defense team, of divulging conversations and defense secrets to Schiller in violation of a lawyer's legal duty to keep confidential all information learned during the attorney-client relationship.

13_13	0.11565192	In reply to the lawsuit, Schiller and Kardashian denied making any promises to Simpson about the book or miniseries and also said Simpson should have sued before the book was published in 1996.
13_14	0.10486181	Gross said Simpson had not sued then because he was tied up in a civil damage suit.
13_15	0.090200706	Gross also said the miniseries had large amounts of confidential information that was not in the book.

18_1	0.53836082	Simpson's appeal of the $33.5 million judgment against him provoked bitter, angry reactions from the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.
18_2	0.1943187	Denise Brown, Nicole's sister, said Friday the family responded to news of the appeal by stripping the name ``Simpson'' from the Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation, which helps victims of domestic violence.
18_3	0.093244227	``This foundation is not about Mr.
18_4	0.12266539	Simpson,'' she said.
18_5	0.11452383	Fred Goldman, the father of Ronald Goldman, called the appeal ``further proof positive that this monster doesn't want to be held responsible for his actions''.
18_6	0.10360227	Golfing in Louisiana, Simpson said the appeal was his fundamental right.
18_7	0.056866887	``I think in America, justice is supposed to be fair and it's supposed to be blind,'' Simpson told reporters, ``and public opinion or certain prejudices are not supposed to count.
18_8	0.080273546	You're supposed to go by the law and I don't think any person involved in the law who looked at that trial and looked at some of the rulings would say it was legal''.
18_9	0.14672776	Goldman contends that Simpson has become adept at shielding his income from the Goldman family as they try to collect on the huge judgment.
18_10	0.085348926	For instance, Goldman said Simpson recently granted a paid interview to a German television station and asked the station to pay the money to a third party.

18_15	0.10521447	Simpson's attorneys filed the 96-page appeal last week with the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, labeling the civil trial ``fundamentally tainted by several erroneous evidentiary rulings''.

18_17	0.10816431	They also said the judge's rulings thwarted their efforts to prove then-Officer Mark Fuhrman of the Los Angeles Police Department planted a bloody glove at Simpson's estate.
