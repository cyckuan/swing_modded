13_1	0.098196694	Simpson wants to stop an upcoming television miniseries about the defense in his murder case, saying its purported revelations are the product of a lawyer's breach of legal confidentiality and an author's breach of promise.
13_2	0.11689339	Simpson filed suit Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court against his former friend and lawyer, Robert Kardashian, and author Lawrence Schiller, whose 1996 book ``American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story of the Simpson Defense'' is the basis of the series now being filmed for CBS Television for airing in November.
13_3	0.072034862	Both men denied the wrongdoing alleged by Simpson.

13_6	0.078851804	The suit also seeks return of any profits Schiller and Kardashian made by violating Simpson's rights.
13_7	0.080047341	``This action is about the avaricious disregard of the attorney-client relationship, and of promises of confidentiality, by an attorney and a writer who value the fame and fortune to be derived from publishing information about a sensational trial more than adhering to their ethical obligations and contractual agreements,'' Terry Gross, a lawyer representing Simpson, said in court papers.
13_8	0.10123905	Gross alleged that Schiller had gained the cooperation of Simpson and eight of his lawyers for the book project by promising, falsely, that Simpson would be allowed to review the manuscript before publication and remove any confidential material.
13_9	0.08536984	The lawsuit also accused Kardashian, a member of Simpson's defense team, of divulging conversations and defense secrets to Schiller in violation of a lawyer's legal duty to keep confidential all information learned during the attorney-client relationship.
13_10	0.093244612	Schiller, who wrote the book with journalist James Willwerth, initially described Kardashian as co-author and wound up paying him a fee, the lawsuit said.

13_13	0.099080442	In reply to the lawsuit, Schiller and Kardashian denied making any promises to Simpson about the book or miniseries and also said Simpson should have sued before the book was published in 1996.
13_14	0.14414996	Gross said Simpson had not sued then because he was tied up in a civil damage suit.
13_15	0.09425825	Gross also said the miniseries had large amounts of confidential information that was not in the book.
13_16	0.087064564	Schiller, who is directing the TV production, said the content was virtually the same.

18_1	0.56176864	Simpson's appeal of the $33.5 million judgment against him provoked bitter, angry reactions from the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.
18_2	0.15710989	Denise Brown, Nicole's sister, said Friday the family responded to news of the appeal by stripping the name ``Simpson'' from the Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation, which helps victims of domestic violence.
18_3	0.079695081	``This foundation is not about Mr.
18_4	0.13892541	Simpson,'' she said.
18_5	0.10951176	Fred Goldman, the father of Ronald Goldman, called the appeal ``further proof positive that this monster doesn't want to be held responsible for his actions''.
18_6	0.14552162	Golfing in Louisiana, Simpson said the appeal was his fundamental right.
18_7	0.07688766	``I think in America, justice is supposed to be fair and it's supposed to be blind,'' Simpson told reporters, ``and public opinion or certain prejudices are not supposed to count.
18_8	0.085559404	You're supposed to go by the law and I don't think any person involved in the law who looked at that trial and looked at some of the rulings would say it was legal''.
18_9	0.1375286	Goldman contends that Simpson has become adept at shielding his income from the Goldman family as they try to collect on the huge judgment.
18_10	0.089438039	For instance, Goldman said Simpson recently granted a paid interview to a German television station and asked the station to pay the money to a third party.

18_15	0.10238432	Simpson's attorneys filed the 96-page appeal last week with the 2nd District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles, labeling the civil trial ``fundamentally tainted by several erroneous evidentiary rulings''.

18_17	0.10164151	They also said the judge's rulings thwarted their efforts to prove then-Officer Mark Fuhrman of the Los Angeles Police Department planted a bloody glove at Simpson's estate.
