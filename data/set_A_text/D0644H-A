3_0	0.375	WASHINGTON _ The heated battle over how to use projected federal budget surpluses has exposed deep rifts between the two parties, both in political and economic terms.
3_1	0.7777777777777778	It has divided Democrats and Republicans over such basic issues as whether there really is a federal budget surplus.
3_2	0.5625	It has forced the two parties to articulate their cases for and against tax cuts and government spending as ways of improving the country's long-term prospects.
3_3	0.26666666666666666	It has set the stage for a potential debate over an issue of real substance in next year's critical election for control of the White House and Congress.
3_4	0.08333333333333333	Finally, it has raised the prospect of actually reducing the national debt, a problem that Washington has not had the luxury of addressing for decades.
3_5	0.7058823529411765	Round one in the battle ended last week, when Republicans pushed their $792 billion tax cut plan through Congress in the face of President Clinton's veto threat.
3_6	0.0	Round two will start after Labor Day, when official Washington returns from its summer vacation and the two parties decide whether to seek compromise or to leave the issue for the campaign trail.
3_7	0.0	The starting point for any discussion is getting a handle on how much money is up for grabs.
3_8	1.3076923076923077	The Congressional Budget Office projects that the total federal budget surplus over the next 10 years will be $2.9 trillion.
3_9	1.5	Of that, $1.9 trillion is generated by payroll tax revenues that are earmarked for Social Security.
3_10	0.058823529411764705	The two parties have more or less agreed to take that $1.9 trillion off the table, allowing it to be used only to reduce the national debt or to help finance an overhaul of the retirement system.
3_11	0.0	Most of the fight is over the remaining portion of nearly $1 trillion, which represents the surplus generated by general tax revenues.
3_12	0.7142857142857143	Republicans say the figure is so big that the country can afford a $792 billion tax cut and still find plenty of money for needs like adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and increasing spending on the military.
3_13	0.041666666666666664	But Democrats point out that the surplus projections are based on a series of questionable premises: that the economy will avoid a protracted downturn; that unexplained surges in revenue will continue, and that the forecasting ability of budget analysts will prove far more accurate than it has in the past.
3_14	0.0	Further, the projections assume what many say is an unrealistically low level of increases in government spending.
3_15	0.21052631578947367	The Congressional Budget Office surplus estimate is based on Congress remaining within strict spending limits requiring cuts through 2002, and then increasing spending at no more than the rate of inflation.
3_16	0.0	Yet based on the appropriations bills moving through the House and Senate under the control of the Republican majority, Congress is on a path to shatter the spending caps next year, and indeed to use up all of next year's projected non-Social Security surplus of $14 billion.
3_17	0.75	If that pattern of rising spending were to continue, the non-Social Security portion of the surplus would all but disappear before it became available for tax cuts.
3_18	0.0	These surplus numbers give pie in the sky a good name,'' said Thomas S.
3_19	0.0	Kahn, the Democratic staff director of the House Budget Committee.
3_20	0.125	Kahn helped produce a recent report for House Democrats that looked at what would happen if spending were to increase in line with historical trends and political realities.
3_21	0.3076923076923077	If spending were to increase just enough to keep up with inflation from now through 2009, the report concluded, it would use $595 billion of the $996 billion surplus.
3_22	0.2	The Democrats then looked at emergency spending, money that Congress appropriates each year to deal with unanticipated needs ranging from hurricanes to aid for farmers.
3_23	0.0	From 1991 through 1998, emergency spending averaged $9 billion a year, not including the costs of the Gulf war.
3_24	0.11764705882352941	The committee then assumed that emergency spending would remain at that average level for the next decade, and subtracted an additional $90 billion from the surplus, leaving just $311 billion.
3_25	0.0	But there's more.
3_26	0.14285714285714285	The surplus estimate also assumed that all of the excess revenues would go to reducing the national debt, bringing down the government's interest costs.
3_27	0.9	To the degree that the surplus goes to spending _ or tax cuts _ those interest savings would not be realized.
3_28	0.0	The committee calculated that the increased interest costs from maintaining inflation-adjusted levels of spending and accounting for emergency spending would be $179 billion.
3_29	1.0952380952380953	After accounting for an additional $30 billion needed to pay for Social Security's operations over the next decade, the Democratic analysis concluded that the surplus over the next 10 years under its assumptions would be only $100 billion.
3_30	0.0	So far, however, that Democratic argument has not swayed Republicans.
3_31	0.2	And even the White House is still assuming that it has nearly $1 trillion to divide up, allocating a third of the non-Social Security surplus to additional spending.
3_32	0.7142857142857143	So for the most part the debate has not been over the availability of the surplus but over the relative merits of tax cuts, increasing spending and reducing the national debt.
3_33	0.6190476190476191	The Republican position is that tax cuts are the best way to ensure continued prosperity _ and that they have the added benefit of blocking Democrats from spending the money, a course that Republicans said would be wasteful and economically inefficient.
3_34	0.23076923076923078	nn Reducing income tax rates, Republicans say, would motivate taxpayers to work harder, since they would keep more of their pay.
3_35	0.1111111111111111	Reducing capital gains taxes and expanding the Individual Retirement Account program would encourage more savings and investment, helping the economy to retain its technological edge and become more productive.
3_36	0.0	Scaling back taxes on business would encourage the creation of new jobs.
3_37	0.375	``My preference is that the surpluses be returned as tax cuts so the government share of the economy will shrink and the private share of the economy will expand,'' said Lawrence Kudlow, a former Reagan administration economist who is now with American Skandia, an investment firm.
3_38	0.0	``The private sector is governed by market discipline and the profit motive.
3_39	0.125	Those two factors will generate more efficiency and more productivity, and hence more economic growth''.
3_40	1.9	Democrats say they are not against tax cuts, and have offered to go as high as $300 billion over 10 years.
3_41	0.4	That suggests that they are not overly worried about their worst-case scenario of a mere $100 billion surplus.
3_42	0.058823529411764705	But they say any tax reductions should go to people who need them most, lower and middle income families, and that they should be used for specific purposes like making college more affordable or encouraging more retirement savings.
3_43	0.0	The economy is doing just fine already, Democrats say.
3_44	1.1333333333333333	They warn that the additional stimulus of a tax cut could even lead the economy to overheat, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
3_45	1.0	The main Democratic argument against tax cuts, though, is that there are better things to do with whatever surpluses do materialize.
3_46	0.25	One is reducing the national debt.
3_47	0.13333333333333333	The two parties are actually not far apart on the benefits of paying down the debt incurred in the decades in which the federal government was running huge annual deficits.
3_48	0.7692307692307693	Democrats, Republicans and most economists agree that reducing the debt would leave interest rates lower, stimulating more economic growth, and would make it easier to address long-term problems like the solvency of Social Security by easing the financial burden on future generations.
3_49	0.045454545454545456	``The best thing we can do for the economy is to increase savings, and the best way the government has of increasing savings is paying down the debt,'' said Robert Bixby, the policy director of the Concord Coalition, a fiscal monitoring group.

3_51	1.3333333333333333	The main source of debt reduction is the anticipated $1.9 trillion surplus over the next decade from excess Social Security payroll taxes.
3_52	0.14285714285714285	That money is ultimately intended to help pay retirement benefits for today's workers, but the only way the government can ``save'' it is to reduce the amount of federal debt held by the public, now about $3.6 trillion.
3_53	0.7777777777777778	Republicans are generally committed to using the $1.9 trillion for debt reduction, although they have left open the option of using some of it to help transform Social Security into a system of private investment accounts.

3_55	0.2727272727272727	Republicans are talking about finding additional money for debt reduction by holding down spending increases after 2002.
3_56	0.45454545454545453	Clinton wants to take $374 billion over 10 years from the non-Social Security surplus for additional debt reduction, although his plan would in essence just leave the government owing the money to the Medicare system rather than to the public.
3_57	0.9090909090909091	Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, is one of the most influential advocates of debt reduction as the best use of the surplus.
3_58	0.47619047619047616	Despite his long record of advocating lower taxes _ he continues to press his case for elimination of the capital gains tax _ he bluntly warned Republicans last month that the time is not right for a tax cut.

3_60	0.047619047619047616	And he asserted that the benefits of consistent debt reduction, in the form of lower-cost capital and greater investment in productivity-enhancing technology and machinery, would be the best way of keeping the long economic expansion going.
3_61	0.6428571428571429	Greenspan offered one caveat that Republicans seized on _ that if the only choice is between tax cuts and additional spending, then his clear preference would be tax cuts.
3_62	0.5238095238095238	Indeed, despite the bipartisan commitments to improving the government's financial condition, some conservatives are uncomfortable with too much emphasis on debt reduction, saying it should not become a fixation that outweighs tax cuts as a priority for Republicans.
3_63	0.4375	Many liberals also bemoan the emphasis on the debt and what they see as a lack of focus on spending for critical areas like education, basic technology, medical research and transportation.
3_64	0.0	They say that the continual assault on government spending by Republicans has led voters to believe that all federal expenditures are wasteful, and to lose sight of the fact that there is a substantial return on many types of public investment, from the development of the Internet to new drugs and better-trained workers.

5_2	0.0	Nixon's 1968 campaign, and he had been a fixture among the party's economic policy makers ever since.
5_3	0.0	He had been appointed Fed chairman by Ronald Reagan and reappointed by Bush.
5_4	0.0	But in the eyes of Bush's supporters, Greenspan had committed an unforgivable sin: failing to bring the economy back to full strength quickly enough after the 1990-91 recession.
5_5	0.0	Clinton exploited the lingering economic angst masterfully in 1992, and ever since he has ridden an upturn that in hindsight was well under way by Election Day.
5_6	0.0	All of this is to suggest that Greenspan is by no means unfamiliar with the rough and tumble of election year politics, or with the many ways in which the Fed can become an issue.
5_7	0.0	And it is already clear, nearly 15 months before Election Day, that Greenspan will figure into this political cycle.
5_8	0.3333333333333333	The first salvos against him have again come not from Democrats but from Republicans.

5_11	0.16666666666666666	Bush of Texas for the party's presidential nomination have become increasingly desperate for attention, both Steve Forbes and Dan Quayle have attacked the Fed and Greenspan for raising interest rates when crop prices are plunging and farmers are hurting.
5_12	0.5263157894736842	``Interest rates are too high, and while Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve raise rates, commodity prices have plummeted,'' Forbes says in a 60-second radio spot being run in Iowa.
5_13	0.0	Forbes goes on to blame monetary policy together with ``bad economic advice from the Clinton-Gore administration'' for the troubles plaguing agriculture.
5_14	0.0	Populist rage from the farm belt at tight-money bankers is hardly new; what is a bit confounding is that the present attacks are coming from the conservative wing of the Republican Party, Greenspan's ideological home.
5_15	0.0	Then again, Greenspan is an easy target for politicians of all stripes because he never hits back, at least not publicly.
5_16	0.09090909090909091	Perhaps more to the point in this case, some Republicans view Greenspan as having sold out and become all but a member of the Clinton administration.
5_17	0.2857142857142857	They have watched with some unease over the past six and a half years as Greenspan became chummy first with former Treasury Secretary Robert E.
5_18	0.0	Rubin and now with his successor, Lawrence H.
5_19	0.0	Summers, as well as with Clinton himself.
5_20	0.3181818181818182	And the party's more ardent tax cutters were dismayed, if not aghast, when Greenspan told Congress last month that the nation would be better off using projected federal budget surpluses for debt reduction than for reducing taxes.
5_21	0.5263157894736842	Since Clinton has framed the fiscal policy choice just that way _ his prudent debt reduction plan versus irresponsible Republican tax cuts _ Greenspan was seen as siding with the Democrats.
5_22	0.47368421052631576	No one paid much attention to the Fed chairman's stated preference for tax cuts over additional government spending, which in the eyes of most Republicans in Washington is the real choice before the country.
5_23	0.125	If Congress and the White House fail to work out a deal in the next few months on splitting up the surplus, leaving the issue to be fought out on the campaign trail, Greenspan's name will no doubt be invoked repeatedly by both parties to bolster their positions.
5_24	0.0	While fiscal policy can make for powerful politics, it is just a sideline for Greenspan.
5_25	0.23529411764705882	The far more compelling issue for him could be how high to push interest rates over the next 6 or 12 months if the economy continues to roar along, setting off inflation alarm bells.
5_26	0.0	Politically, it will be a tough call; Greenspan would no doubt prefer to avoid raising rates during a presidential campaign.
5_27	0.0	Economically, it could prove even trickier, since Greenspan is still wrestling with the degree to which this technology-driven, financial-market-centric, globally oriented economy can hold off inflation.
5_28	0.0	Besides a dozen years' experience on the job and a tough skin, the Fed chairman has something else going for him.
5_29	0.0	If there were a Bush family grudge against him, it has been put aside, and Governor Bush has sent clear signals that he would support Greenspan's reappointment next year to a fourth four-year term.
5_30	0.3333333333333333	Vice President Al Gore has been equally supportive.
5_31	0.0	With that bipartisan support, Greenspan has considerable leeway in formulating policy, as well as an opportunity to push ahead with his slow but steady efforts to make the Fed more open in the way it considers and communicates its interest-rate decisions.
5_32	0.0	In the end, demystifying the institution and making clear that the rapidly changing economy is sometimes as difficult to read from within the Fed as from without could prove the best insulation against political attacks.
6_0	1.1176470588235294	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan emphatically cautioned lawmakers today against spending projected federal budget surpluses that he said may not occur.
6_1	0.0	"I would submit that irrevocable or almost irrevocable programs that are put in place now strike me as risking the possibility that we may be wrong on this surplus," said Greenspan.
6_2	0.0	"And all I say, all I'm asking in effect, is just to delay for a while until we have a better grip on what the true balance in the federal government accounts is".

6_5	0.23529411764705882	Greenspan also repeated sentiments today that put financial markets on notice last week to expect further interest rate increases if the economy continues to grow at a rapid clip.
6_6	0.05	Although the economy remains strong, and inflation is still largely at bay, Greenspan said tight labor markets and a continued consumer spending boom present potential price pressures too great to ignore.
6_7	0.0	If Fed policy-makers don't pay attention to those factors, "then we are like the boat heading towards the dock and instead of turning so we don't go slamming into the dock, we go straight into the dock and find out that we should have turned at least partially in order to come into...

6_9	0.0	Many private economists are looking for at least two more quarter-point rate increases from the central bank's next meetings in March and May.
6_10	0.0	Since June, the Fed has pushed up its target for the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, to 5.75 percent in four quarter-point moves, the last one occurring Feb.
6_11	0.0	2. Greenspan said the reasons behind recent "tax surprises" that have overstuffed government coffers during the economic boom in recent years are not entirely understood by economists yet.
6_12	0.0	Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether they will persist.
6_13	0.1	For that reason, he said he believes using surpluses to pay down the national debt is the best thing lawmakers can do for now.

6_15	0.0	reduce the debt outstanding".
6_16	0.6428571428571429	However, if political pressures on lawmakers to use surpluses are too great, the Fed chairman said, he would prefer a tax cut over new spending programs.

6_20	0.45	Separately today, Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer said wiping out the national debt would not harm the ability of the Federal Reserve to fight inflation through its management of short-term interest rates.
6_21	0.17391304347826086	In a speech to the National Association for Business Economics, Meyer said the central bank, which uses its holdings of Treasury securities to implement changes in interest rates, will be able to adapt to a world where the level of those securities is shrinking.
6_22	0.4	"Declining Treasury debt does not pose any insurmountable long-term problem for the Federal Reserve," Meyer said.
6_23	0.0	The Fed manages the nation's money supply by buying and selling Treasury securities.
6_24	0.19047619047619047	If it wants to increase the money supply and thus lower short-term interest rates, it buys Treasury securities held by banks, providing money that the banks can use to make more loans to businesses and consumers.
6_25	0.21052631578947367	If the Fed wants to shrink the money supply and raise interest rates, it sells Treasury securities to the banks in return for a portion of the banks' cash reserves.
6_26	0.5	The banks have less money available to make loans and interest rates increase.
6_27	0.0	Meyer said that while the central bank now only buys and sells Treasury securities to expand and shrink the money supply, it could easily shift to other types of bonds such as those sold by state and local governments or even debt sold by other nations.
6_28	0.0	"A decision about whether or not to hold on to the surpluses and ultimately retire the government debt should not be affected by any concern that this option might undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy," Meyer said .
7_0	0.2222222222222222	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robert Rubin spent much of his life speculating what the stock market would do.
7_1	0.0	He was good at it and made $100 million.
7_2	0.26666666666666666	When he came to Washington, Rubin did essentially the same thing, speculating that if President Clinton would balance the budget, he would be rewarded with a booming economy.
7_3	0.0	To the surprise of many, that argument caught Clinton's ear.
7_4	0.90625	And in the six years since, first as a top economic adviser and since 1995 as the Treasury secretary, Rubin has gained much credit -- in a close partnership with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan -- for the policies of spending restraint that kept interest rates low, Wall Street booming and many Americans raking in money.
7_5	0.0	That prosperity, in turn, helped smooth Clinton's presidency.
7_6	0.0	Most Americans wouldn't recognize the slight, silver-haired man in his investment banker pinstripes.
7_7	0.2222222222222222	But Clinton, many Republicans and especially Wall Street have always given Rubin considerable credit.
7_8	0.0	``He generally did his best to keep the more liberal elements of the Clinton-Gore administration in check,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
7_9	0.0	Or, as Clinton put it as he announced Rubin's departure Wednesday, ``Everybody always believed that as long as he was secretary of the Treasury, nothing bad could happen''.
7_10	0.16666666666666666	Indeed, for years reporters and Wall Street brokers joked how the market might sink the day Rubin finally left.
7_11	0.0	He had long ``pined for private life,'' Clinton noted.
7_12	0.15	The secretary's wife, Judith, never moved to Washington, and Rubin, 60, stayed in a hotel near the White House, flying home to New York City every weekend.
7_13	0.3684210526315789	The market did indeed drop more than 200 points on Wednesday morning but quickly recovered, largely perhaps because Greenspan, 73, still has another year as Federal Reserve chairman and may seek another four-year term after that.
7_14	0.0	In addition, Rubin has spent much of the past year grooming his deputy, former Harvard economist Lawrence Summers, sending him to Capitol Hill and around the world when Asia's economy crashed.
7_15	0.0	But it was Rubin's close relationship with Greenspan that mattered most.
7_16	0.09090909090909091	Rubin set an early and ironclad rule that no one in the Clinton administration could publicly criticize the Fed chairman.
7_17	0.3	As Greenspan and the Fed pursued policies that led to low inflation, even Republicans were pleased.
7_18	0.0	``Leaving Greenspan alone -- they do get credit for that,'' said GOP presidential hopeful Steve Forbes, who otherwise bitterly criticized Rubin and Summers' handling of the Asian crisis.
7_19	0.0	Republicans did fight with Rubin over the 1997 government shutdown and his handling of the Asian crisis.
7_20	0.1111111111111111	But most considered him ``a strong and sometimes solitary voice within the Clinton administration for open markets and fiscal discipline,'' said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas.
7_21	0.14285714285714285	Rubin also frustrated some Democrats, especially early on, when Labor Secretary Robert Reich and others complained the administration too heavily favored business.
7_22	0.0	But Rep.
7_23	0.0	Charles Rangel of New York, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Rubin often repaired frayed ties on Capitol Hill when Clinton appeared to bypass Democrats and negotiate directly with the GOP on taxes or welfare reform.
7_24	0.0	``Thank God during all these times we knew we had someone we could depend on,'' Rangel said.
7_25	0.0	Rubin also pushed often for more private investment in inner city neighborhoods, another position Clinton embraced.
7_26	0.0	Yet that work never gained him the attention that the economy's boom did.
7_27	0.0	It's unclear what he will do when he returns to private life.
7_28	0.0	He is viewed as a possible candidate for the Fed chairmanship if Greenspan should retire.
7_29	0.0	Rubin, who has two grown sons, put his own millions in a blind trust and became a retired partner at Goldman, Sachs during his government years.
7_30	0.0	He entered an arrangement where he could neither profit nor suffer from the firm's performance, Treasury officials say.

8_23	1.1111111111111112	That would be all of it, colliding with Republican plans for tax cuts of up to $800 billion over the next decade.

12_16	0.3333333333333333	Either way, Hale agreed that both risk ``a collision with monetary policy'' by the Federal Reserve, which wants to contain economic growth at a level that keeps inflation low.
12_17	0.46153846153846156	Fed chairman Alan Greenspan has repeatedly advised that the surplus be used to pay down the national debt, rather than to cut taxes or spend more.

12_24	0.17647058823529413	Gore claims his plan would leave a $300 billion cushion and eliminate the national debt by 2012, while Bush's would leave $2.8 trillion of debt.

12_26	0.7894736842105263	But the fight over arithmetic _ which both sides can easily manipulate _ is far less important than the two strikingly different paths that Bush and Gore recommend for the $2.2 trillion surplus left after Social Security.

12_36	0.5	Taxpayers who fail to meet any of these selected criteria would not see a tax cut, opening Gore to the charge from the Bush campaign that his plan would exclude half of all taxpayers and require the rest to hire an accountant.
12_37	0.037037037037037035	But Gore has also begun to clothe his populism in the softer fabric of ``fiscal responsibility,'' promising to ``underspend the surplus'' _ a direct response to polls showing voters prefer debt reduction, and an effort to counter Bush's charge that he is a big spender.
12_38	0.0	Bush offers a classic economic conservatism, draped in the softer cloth of social compassion.

12_47	0.47368421052631576	But the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice says that most of Bush's tax cut would go to households earning $92,500 or more, with an average tax cut of $6,410.

13_0	1.16	WASHINGTON _ The centerpiece of the Clinton administration's economic policy this year has been a demand that the Republican-controlled Congress forgo tax cuts and set aside the projected federal budget surplus until the nation shores up the Social Security system.
13_1	0.1111111111111111	It was a move that proved politically successful in blocking a key element of the Republican agenda, and it made economic sense against the backdrop of strong growth and incipient inflationary pressures.
13_2	0.0	But with the global financial crisis rapidly changing the economic outlook for the worse, there are growing questions from both the left and the right about the wisdom of putting fiscal rectitude ahead of the potentially more pressing need to sustain growth.
13_3	0.11538461538461539	Indeed, with the administration facing the possibility of a recession for the first time since taking office, the White House could face a number of tough choices about whether the market-friendly policies that defined its approach during economic boom times are the best way to approach a more difficult period.
13_4	0.29411764705882354	``Bill Clinton's most memorable legacy apart from his White House dalliance will be balancing the budget,'' said Robert Reich, who was labor secretary during Clinton's first term.
13_5	2.0	``Now that there's a budget surplus, the administration has committed itself to saving the surplus for Social Security rather than succumbing to Republican tax cuts,'' Reich said.
13_6	0.0	``But this has put fiscal policy into a veritable straitjacket.
13_7	0.8125	It's not possible for the White House to talk seriously about stimulating the economy through tax cuts or spending when it has bound itself so tightly to the idea of fiscal discipline''.
13_8	0.07142857142857142	Administration officials said it is premature to be talking about a recession and that whatever path the economy takes the United States will have more flexibility and strength now that the deficit has been eliminated.
13_9	0.36	In particular, they said, the Federal Reserve Board now has considerably more leeway to reduce interest rates to counter any downturn than it did the last two times the economy slid into recession, in 1990 and 1981, when the deficit was rising sharply, making inflation worse.
13_10	0.18181818181818182	``The basic momentum of economic expansion should continue,'' said Lawrence Summers, the deputy treasury secretary.
13_11	0.21428571428571427	``And with a budget in surplus and lower inflation expectations than anytime in more than three decades, the economy is well positioned to respond to any challenges that may arise''.
13_12	0.0	But just the possibility of a downturn is likely to unleash pressures on the administration to re-examine some of the principles behind its policies.
13_13	0.0	Clinton took office in 1993 planning to give a traditional Keynesian boost to a still-sluggish economy through a big deficit spending package.
13_14	0.19047619047619047	But he soon abandoned the effort under pressure from his own economic team, which convinced him there would be a considerable payoff in the form of lower interest rates if he could convince the financial markets that he was serious about reducing the budget deficit.
13_15	0.6666666666666666	Clinton also adopted a hands-off policy towards the Federal Reserve, showing considerable deference to its chairman, Alan Greenspan, and refraining from any public jawboning about official interest rates.
13_16	0.0	Again the intent was to win the confidence of the markets by establishing that the administration would support efforts to squelch inflation.
13_17	0.0	The administration's international economic policies have also been distinguished by a belief in the benefits of bringing down barriers to trade and investment.
13_18	0.3333333333333333	The approach, embodied most notably by Robert Rubin, the treasury secretary, has paid off, in the administration's view.

13_23	0.08333333333333333	So administration officials, while not ruling out a shift if the economy turns sharply down, say that for now they have no intention of changing course.
13_24	0.36363636363636365	``The recipe of fiscal discipline and low long-term interest rates fueling a sustainable pattern of investment-led growth has been enormously successful,'' said Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy adviser.

15_15	0.0	But some of the very factors underpinning the nation's remarkable economic performance _ falling joblessness, accelerating productivity, an improved outlook for corporate earnings _ ``are also engendering a set of imbalances that, unless contained, threaten our continuing prosperity,'' Greenspan said.

15_18	0.16	The Fed's policy-setting federal Open Market Committee ``will have to stay alert for signs that real interest rates have not yet risen enough to bring the growth of demand into line with that of potential supply, even should the acceleration of productivity continue,'' Greenspan said.

21_23	0.16666666666666666	In past years, Clinton has assumed about 2 percent growth while the economy actually grew by better than 3 percent, ``but we continue to use 2 percent to allow for ups and downs in the economy,'' a White House aide said.
21_24	0.05263157894736842	In taking a mainstream view of economic growth, at least, Clinton's forecast stands in contrast to Reagan's, which were criticized for predicting an outright economic boom.

22_0	1.0833333333333333	WASHINGTON _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday trashed President Clinton's plan to invest government funds in the stock market in order to produce more revenue for the Social Security retirement system.
22_1	0.0	Greenspan said the proposal could hurt the U.S. economy and it was risky to allow government money to be invested in the stock market because there was no way to insulate investment decisions from ``political forces,'' raising the prospect that specific investment decisions could be influenced by non-financial considerations.

22_13	0.9523809523809523	Greenspan said he supports using federal budget surpluses to strengthen Social Security, but suggested that the market for government securities is a more secure place to invest public funds because the government guarantees payment on its securities.
22_14	0.0	Historically, government securities have been less risky but slower growing.
22_15	0.0	He also voiced a philosophical objection to pouring federal money into the stock market, arguing such a move could hurt the economy by interfering with private market forces in deciding which companies to fund.
22_16	1.6666666666666667	The Federal Reserve chairman agreed that the Social Security System needed to be repaired but he offered few suggestions on how to do so.
22_17	0.7222222222222222	Greenspan chaired a federal task force in the early 1980s that recommended a series of changes to Social Security, which helped keep the system from going broke at the time.

22_22	0.21428571428571427	He said the best medicine to ensure the long-term health of the economy is to use the budget surplus to pay off a portion of the $5 trillion debt.
22_23	0.6923076923076923	But, he said, if Congress can't keep its hands off the surplus, the money should be used for tax cuts rather than new spending programs.
