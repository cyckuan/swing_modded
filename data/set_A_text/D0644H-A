0_0	0.16666666666666666	WASHINGTON _ Armed with new forecasts of a growing budget surplus, House Republican leaders unveiled a tax-cut package Thursday that would lower federal income rates across-the-board and give married couples a tax break.
0_1	0.16666666666666666	``We will use a major portion of the available surplus to reduce taxes on all Americans, whose income taxes have produced this surplus,'' said Rep.

0_3	0.5789473684210527	While Archer didn't provide specific details, he said the tax cut-package he and his staff are drafting will include: _ A broad-based tax cut that will benefit all federal income tax payers.
0_4	0.16666666666666666	One proposal includes lowering the 15 percent federal income tax bracket to 13.5 percent.

0_12	1.45	The Republican drum beat for tax cuts picked up tempo as the Congressional Budget Office projected the federal budget surplus would total $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years.
0_13	0.6363636363636364	Earlier this week the White House's Office of Management and Budget forecast similar budget surpluses.
0_14	0.47619047619047616	The goal of Archer and the House Republican leadership to enact a $1 trillion tax cut over 10-years met resistance from the party's moderates in both the House and Senate, not to mention Democrats.
0_15	0.47368421052631576	Many moderate House Republicans prefer to stick with the smaller $778 billion tax-cut plan over 10 years outlined in the budget plan passed by Congress earlier this year.
0_16	0.625	The smaller tax-cut plan was based on CBO's earlier forecast that the budget surplus over 10 years would come to $1.78 trillion.
0_17	0.23076923076923078	Budget surplus projections from the CBO and OMB have grown in recent months as the U.S. economy continues to outperform expectations.
0_18	0.0	Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del.
0_19	0.26666666666666666	, said the $778 billion package is large enough and that the rest of the surplus should go to other government programs like Medicare, veterans health benefits and elementary and secondary schools.
0_20	0.35294117647058826	Spending for most government programs like education and health care has been frozen or cut as part of a White House and congressional agreement in 1997 to balance the federal budget.
0_21	0.5	But now that the budget has been balanced, Democrats and many Republicans would like to see some federal spending increased.

0_23	0.0	Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
0_24	0.16666666666666666	, said so many House Republicans have balked at the $1 trillion tax proposal that the leadership may have to stick with the $778 billion plan.
0_25	0.2857142857142857	Many Democrats and President Clinton think both plans are too expensive.
0_26	0.0	House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
0_27	1.2857142857142858	, called the Republican tax cuts plans ``totally irresponsible''.
0_28	0.07142857142857142	``They have really left out important priorities that we ought to be dealing with,'' Gephardt said, referring to education and Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly.
0_29	1.0	Gephardt said Democrats favor a less expensive tax cut, similar to the one outlined earlier this year by Clinton.
0_30	0.7777777777777778	That proposal would cost about $300 billion over 10 years and include such targeted tax cuts as a $500 tax credit for parents who stay at home to care for infants and a $1,000 tax credit for people who care for a disabled child or parent.
0_31	0.9285714285714286	Gene Sperling, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said the Republicans' tax cut plan would take money that could be better used to bolster Social Security and Medicare when the large baby boom generation begins retiring in 2011.
0_32	0.9333333333333333	Under current projections, Medicare is projected to go broke in 2015 and if nothing is done to Social Security, it will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2034.
0_33	0.5625	Sperling said parts of the Republican plan such as the capital gains tax cut is skewed toward people with higher incomes who can afford to invest in the stock market.
0_34	1.125	``A tax cut that helps more moderate families is a higher priority,'' he said.
0_35	1.125	``We have no intention of supporting a new capital gains tax cut''.

1_2	0.6428571428571429	It was the GOP's turn Thursday, as the House and Senate passed a historic $792 billion 10-year tax cut.
1_3	0.3333333333333333	President Clinton, with his own plans for the money, promised a veto.
1_4	0.2	But Democrat or Republican, only a few have paused in their reveries to ask: What if the number crunchers are wrong?
1_5	0.0	It is no casual question, for if recent experience is a guide, the 10- and 15-year budget projections on which elected officials are relying could be elusive and ephemeral.

1_15	0.06666666666666667	Because of the difficulty of making long-term projections, the House traditionally forecasts spending and tax revenues for no more than five years, the Senate for 10.
1_16	0.7307692307692307	Part of the reason for the anticipated huge budget surpluses _ $5.9 trillion over the next 15 years by one administration measure _ is the failure of congressional and White House analysts to predict the feverish growth of the economy when compiling the federal budgets over the last six years.
1_17	0.13333333333333333	``The Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office have been wrong _ horrendously wrong,'' said Stephen Moore, an analyst with the Cato Institute.
1_18	0.15384615384615385	``Three years ago they were predicting $100- to $200 billion deficits, instead we got $100- to $200 billion surpluses''.
1_19	0.17647058823529413	The OMB at the White House and the CBO on Capitol Hill are the two agencies that most of official Washington relies upon when it comes to predicting budget deficits and surpluses.
1_20	0.0	In 1995 the CBO predicted that the nation would face a $400 billion budget deficit in 2005.
1_21	0.375	Within three years, as the economy continued to exceed expectations, the CBO changed that prediction to a $100 billion surplus: a swing of a half-trillion dollars.
1_22	0.0	A key reason was that the economy grew faster than most economists expected.
1_23	0.2	The list of variables that could eat up a projected surplus is long and multifarious: A recession.
1_24	0.0	A slump in the dollar.
1_25	0.2	A leap in health care costs.
1_26	0.0	A drag in productivity gains.
1_27	0.0	A failure by Congress to respect its current caps on discretionary spending.
1_28	0.0	The current projections are under suspicion for some reasons that are beyond the forecasters' control.
1_29	0.0	No one can claim to know how fast the economy, or the work force, or the cost of living will grow.
1_30	0.0	Moreover, government forecasters must assume that the spending caps will remain in law.
1_31	0.0	``No one is fiddling with the numbers,'' said Henry Aaron, an economist with the Brookings Institution who studies government spending policy.
1_32	0.0	CBO and OMB ``are using the methods they've used all along''.
1_33	0.0	The agencies have never built a deep recession into their forecasts and today's economy gives few reasons to do so, Aaron said.
1_34	0.0	And CBO and OMB ``are duty-bound'' to assume that the existing laws on spending will hold, even if many people believe Congress will change them.
1_35	0.0	Indeed, under the guise of emergency spending, the discretionary budget caps are already eroding.
1_36	0.0	``Just the other day the House of Representatives determined that the money to pay for the decennial census in the year 2000 required an emergency appropriaton outside of those limits,'' said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat from New York.
1_37	0.0	``All of a sudden, we have made it into an emergency''.
1_38	0.0	On Capitol Hill, ``because we have these big surplus projections, people are saying now we can go on another spending spree,'' said Moore.
1_39	0.0	Yet economic ``expansions don't always last forever.
1_40	0.0	Governments tend to go through boom and bust cycles,'' said Moore.
1_41	0.0	``When there is a boom cycle, like where we are now.
1_42	0.0	. . . The politicians say, `This is going to last forever and we can spend and spend and spend'.
1_43	0.0	And then when the expansion ends we go from 7 percent to 2 percent growth.
1_44	0.09090909090909091	``You can make the case these surpluses are a curse because they have been an excuse to break down all semblance of fiscal discipline,'' Moore said.
1_45	0.6666666666666666	Moore, a libertarian, sides with the House and Senate Republicans who Thursday gave final passage to the sweeping $792 billion tax cut.
1_46	0.5217391304347826	The GOP plan would be the largest tax cut since 1981, trimming the bottom 15 percent income tax rate to 14 percent in 2003 and reducing the other rates by 1 percentage point in 2005.
1_47	0.05555555555555555	It would also give two-income couples relief from the ``marriage penalty,'' gradually repeal the federal estate tax and trim the capital gains tax rate for most investors.
1_48	0.6428571428571429	But Byrd and others think that the inherently risky business of making economic projections is a reason to forestall such a large tax cut.
1_49	0.631578947368421	The Clinton administration, which has opposed the size of the tax cut, is exploring the idea of using the surpluses to buy back Treasury securities and thus reduce the $5.5 trillion national debt.
1_50	0.04	During the debate on the tax bill last week, Moynihan charged that the secret strategy of tax-cutting Republicans since the Reagan years has been to use robust budget projections as an excuse to cut taxes _ and thus starve the federal government when the projected revenues don't materialize.
1_51	0.05	A series of ``rosy scenarios,'' issued by OMB during the Reagan administration, resulted in annual deficits of $150 to $200 billion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Moynihan noted.
1_52	0.0	``Deficits _ that had presumably been the horror of conservative financial thought _ now became something attractive because they could be used to reduce the size of government itself,'' said Moynihan.
1_53	0.15384615384615385	``The secret solution was to let the federal budget deficits rise, thus leaving Congress no alternative but to cut domestic programs''.
1_54	0.0	The GOP is at it again, said Moynihan: ``We are proposing to spend a surplus, sir, that does not exist''.
1_55	0.7142857142857143	Tax-cutting Republicans and Democrats, however, argue that their tax cut is but a meager 25 percent of the expected surplus _ leaving plenty of room for error.
1_56	0.0	And Moore and others point out that the projections could just as well be too pessimistic as optimistic.
1_57	0.75	Senator Robert Kerrey, a Democrat from Nebraska, defended the CBO projections when explaining his support for the tax cut.
1_58	0.5555555555555556	``The congressional budget office, though they obviously will from time to time make mistakes, forecasts that there will be $3 trillion more coming in over the next 10 years than we have in obligated expenditures,'' said Kerrey.

11_0	0.47058823529411764	WASHINGTON _ After George Bush lost the presidency to Bill Clinton in 1992, some Republicans blamed one of their own: Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.

11_5	0.0	Clinton exploited the lingering economic angst masterfully in 1992, and ever since he has ridden an upturn that in hindsight was well under way by Election Day.
11_6	0.0	All of this is to suggest that Greenspan is by no means unfamiliar with the rough and tumble of election year politics, or with the many ways in which the Fed can become an issue.
11_7	0.0	And it is already clear, nearly 15 months before Election Day, that Greenspan will figure into this political cycle.
11_8	0.3333333333333333	The first salvos against him have again come not from Democrats but from Republicans.

11_14	0.0	Populist rage from the farm belt at tight-money bankers is hardly new; what is a bit confounding is that the present attacks are coming from the conservative wing of the Republican Party, Greenspan's ideological home.

11_16	0.09090909090909091	Perhaps more to the point in this case, some Republicans view Greenspan as having sold out and become all but a member of the Clinton administration.

11_21	0.5263157894736842	Since Clinton has framed the fiscal policy choice just that way _ his prudent debt reduction plan versus irresponsible Republican tax cuts _ Greenspan was seen as siding with the Democrats.
11_22	0.47368421052631576	No one paid much attention to the Fed chairman's stated preference for tax cuts over additional government spending, which in the eyes of most Republicans in Washington is the real choice before the country.

11_25	0.23529411764705882	The far more compelling issue for him could be how high to push interest rates over the next 6 or 12 months if the economy continues to roar along, setting off inflation alarm bells.
11_26	0.0	Politically, it will be a tough call; Greenspan would no doubt prefer to avoid raising rates during a presidential campaign.
11_27	0.0	Economically, it could prove even trickier, since Greenspan is still wrestling with the degree to which this technology-driven, financial-market-centric, globally oriented economy can hold off inflation.

11_29	0.0	If there were a Bush family grudge against him, it has been put aside, and Governor Bush has sent clear signals that he would support Greenspan's reappointment next year to a fourth four-year term.
11_30	0.3333333333333333	Vice President Al Gore has been equally supportive.
11_31	0.0	With that bipartisan support, Greenspan has considerable leeway in formulating policy, as well as an opportunity to push ahead with his slow but steady efforts to make the Fed more open in the way it considers and communicates its interest-rate decisions.
11_32	0.0	In the end, demystifying the institution and making clear that the rapidly changing economy is sometimes as difficult to read from within the Fed as from without could prove the best insulation against political attacks.

21_36	0.0	Mears, vice president and columnist for The Associated Press, has reported on Washington and national politics for more than 30 years.
22_0	1.16	WASHINGTON _ The centerpiece of the Clinton administration's economic policy this year has been a demand that the Republican-controlled Congress forgo tax cuts and set aside the projected federal budget surplus until the nation shores up the Social Security system.
22_1	0.1111111111111111	It was a move that proved politically successful in blocking a key element of the Republican agenda, and it made economic sense against the backdrop of strong growth and incipient inflationary pressures.
22_2	0.0	But with the global financial crisis rapidly changing the economic outlook for the worse, there are growing questions from both the left and the right about the wisdom of putting fiscal rectitude ahead of the potentially more pressing need to sustain growth.
22_3	0.11538461538461539	Indeed, with the administration facing the possibility of a recession for the first time since taking office, the White House could face a number of tough choices about whether the market-friendly policies that defined its approach during economic boom times are the best way to approach a more difficult period.
22_4	0.29411764705882354	``Bill Clinton's most memorable legacy apart from his White House dalliance will be balancing the budget,'' said Robert Reich, who was labor secretary during Clinton's first term.
22_5	2.0	``Now that there's a budget surplus, the administration has committed itself to saving the surplus for Social Security rather than succumbing to Republican tax cuts,'' Reich said.
22_6	0.0	``But this has put fiscal policy into a veritable straitjacket.
22_7	0.8125	It's not possible for the White House to talk seriously about stimulating the economy through tax cuts or spending when it has bound itself so tightly to the idea of fiscal discipline''.
22_8	0.07142857142857142	Administration officials said it is premature to be talking about a recession and that whatever path the economy takes the United States will have more flexibility and strength now that the deficit has been eliminated.
22_9	0.36	In particular, they said, the Federal Reserve Board now has considerably more leeway to reduce interest rates to counter any downturn than it did the last two times the economy slid into recession, in 1990 and 1981, when the deficit was rising sharply, making inflation worse.
22_10	0.18181818181818182	``The basic momentum of economic expansion should continue,'' said Lawrence Summers, the deputy treasury secretary.
22_11	0.21428571428571427	``And with a budget in surplus and lower inflation expectations than anytime in more than three decades, the economy is well positioned to respond to any challenges that may arise''.
22_12	0.0	But just the possibility of a downturn is likely to unleash pressures on the administration to re-examine some of the principles behind its policies.
22_13	0.0	Clinton took office in 1993 planning to give a traditional Keynesian boost to a still-sluggish economy through a big deficit spending package.
22_14	0.19047619047619047	But he soon abandoned the effort under pressure from his own economic team, which convinced him there would be a considerable payoff in the form of lower interest rates if he could convince the financial markets that he was serious about reducing the budget deficit.
22_15	0.6666666666666666	Clinton also adopted a hands-off policy towards the Federal Reserve, showing considerable deference to its chairman, Alan Greenspan, and refraining from any public jawboning about official interest rates.
22_16	0.0	Again the intent was to win the confidence of the markets by establishing that the administration would support efforts to squelch inflation.
22_17	0.0	The administration's international economic policies have also been distinguished by a belief in the benefits of bringing down barriers to trade and investment.
22_18	0.3333333333333333	The approach, embodied most notably by Robert Rubin, the treasury secretary, has paid off, in the administration's view.
22_19	1.3333333333333333	Interest rates have come down.
22_20	0.0	Inflation expectations have been dampened.
22_21	0.13333333333333333	Seeing a stable environment ahead, businesses have invested heavily in technology and equipment to increase productivity, helping to create new jobs.
22_22	0.0	In addition to helping the country, the strategy has built Clinton a base of political support, and the economy has remained his primary source of political sustenance as he has battled the threat of impeachment.
22_23	0.08333333333333333	So administration officials, while not ruling out a shift if the economy turns sharply down, say that for now they have no intention of changing course.
22_24	0.36363636363636365	``The recipe of fiscal discipline and low long-term interest rates fueling a sustainable pattern of investment-led growth has been enormously successful,'' said Gene Sperling, the White House economic policy adviser.
22_25	0.07142857142857142	``While one always has to be open-minded in the face of changing economic circumstances, the strong presumption should be to stay with the strategy that has worked over the past five years''.
22_26	0.0	But the turmoil in world markets has forced the administration to defend the merits of unfettered flows of money around the world and left it scrambling to keep the problems from derailing the domestic economy.
22_27	0.1111111111111111	And while still hypothetical, the specter of a recession in the United States already has both parties thinking about how to respond.
22_28	0.0	(STORY CAN END HERE.

22_31	0.0	Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.

22_33	0.21428571428571427	A downturn in the economy, they said, would only increase the pressure to use some of the surplus on job training, education and other programs to assist the unemployed and low-income people.
22_34	0.5714285714285714	There has also been growing criticism of the Federal Reserve for not moving more forcefully to head off the possibility of a downturn by cutting interest rates more deeply.
22_35	0.0	The criticism has come from the left and the right, but not from the administration.
22_36	0.0	If anything, the administration has been working more closely than ever with Greenspan in addressing the global crisis.
22_37	0.36363636363636365	To the extent that it sticks to fiscal austerity and deference to the Federal Reserve's current cautious approach to reducing interest rates, the administration would in a sense be taking the same advice it is giving to countries like Brazil.
22_38	0.038461538461538464	To those countries that are doing the right thing economically but are still being pounded by the financial turbulence that has swept around the world from Asia over the last year, the United States has had a consistent if not wholly reassuring message: Ride out the short-term disruptions and bank on the long-term benefits that will come from sound policies.
22_39	0.07692307692307693	The situations, of course, are not directly comparable; among other things, the United States is in far better fiscal condition than almost any country in the world.
22_40	0.0	But that does not mean that political pressures would not play a role in determining how long the principles of austerity and silence on monetary policy would continue to guide the administration if the economy stalls.

24_14	0.7272727272727273	After five years, the national debt under Clinton's plan, including the extra IOUs for Social Security, will grow to $6.8 trillion, compared to $5.9 trillion under the OMB forecast with no policy changes.
