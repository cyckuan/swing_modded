0_2	0.052576989	The lawsuit, filed in U.S.
0_3	0.11131603	District Court by Greenpeace International, the Center for Food Safety and the International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements charges the Environmental Protection Agency with ``wanton destruction'' of Bt, which it calls the ``world's most important biological pesticide''.
0_4	0.086137805	``This is just another short term fix that industry is willing to use up,'' said Jane Rissler, a senior scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists.
0_5	0.074323767	Added Kalee Kreider, a Greenpeace spokeswoman, ``These crops are an environmental disaster waiting to happen''.
0_6	0.098487606	The complainants are concerned that using the pesticide in genetically altered plants poses environmental risks that will change the ecological balance as well as hurt organic farmers who don't want to use genetically-altered products.
0_7	0.08654041	They complain that EPA has failed to address their concerns since approving the product.
0_8	0.085617056	EPA approved the use of Bt in potatoes in 1995 and has since agreed to its use in corn and cotton.
0_9	0.085644855	The lawsuit demands that EPA cancel registration of all genetically engineered Bt plants; cease approval of any new Bt plants and immediately perform an environmental impact assessment.
0_10	0.10979433	``We can no longer sit idly by,'' said Joseph Mendelson, legal director for the Center for Food Safety.
0_11	0.088989459	``EPA has shown a blatant disregard for federal law and its own regulations by approving Bt crops without fully assessing their environmental safety''.
0_12	0.087097	Bt is actually a soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, that produces toxins to kill insects.

0_15	0.087183781	Scientists are now able to develop plants that contain a gene for Bt toxin, giving the crops built-in protection.
0_16	0.091145222	The move has been controversial, however, as many groups have raised concerns that insects will become resistant to Bt, which would seriously hurt organic farmers who are permitted to use Bt insecticides as their only emergency pest control option.
0_17	0.092054448	An EPA spokesman defended the agency's decision.
0_18	0.090756849	``EPA carefully makes sure that the biotech products we review fully comply with all legal requirements designed to ensure that they are environmentally sound and environmentally beneficial,'' said spokesman Dave Cohen.
0_19	0.079296656	``We believe the actions we've taken with regard to Bt will be sustained against this legal challenge''.
0_20	0.13492202	Some organic farmers say an even bigger threat is pollination from the genetically-altered plant seeping from conventional farms to organic farms.

1_17	0.17519536	Organic farmers, marketers and consumers sent more than 280,000 protest letters, prompting Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to withdraw the proposal and try again.

2_0	0.30449869	When it comes to sales of organic food, the British are leaving the Americans in the dust.
2_1	0.12675685	After sputtering along for years, sales there are expected to be five times as much this year as in 1996, compared with a less than threefold increase in this country over the same period.
2_2	0.16345372	Organics are mainstream in Britain, in some part because of the introduction of genetically modified ingredients from America to which there has been widespread opposition.
2_3	0.099582707	Anger and fear over GM products reached a peak last summer and has since died down, but interest in organics is stronger than ever.
2_4	0.14926756	Ads for organic food are found in newspapers and in supermarket magazines, particularly those of Waitrose and Sainsbury, the two chains leading the organic charge.
2_5	0.16110795	Overhead signs in their stores direct customers to the organic sections, and the products themselves are clearly marked.
2_6	0.16605288	That these organic products are free of genetically modified ingredients is occasionally emblazoned on the packages as well.
2_7	0.1539382	And unlike the United States, where the bulk of organic sales are in natural food stores, 70 percent to 80 percent of the sales in England are in conventional supermarkets.
2_8	0.083843256	Sainsbury has about 440 stores, and Waitrose has more than 120.
2_9	0.08372066	Other supermarket chains are also making a point of stocking organic ingredients, but not with quite the same fervor.
2_10	0.063134017	A number of factors account for the differences between the two countries.
2_11	0.078679022	The simple answer is a series of food scares there that have made consumers uneasy.
2_12	0.082415788	``We have lived in a culture of food scares,'' said Alan Wilson, an agronomist and organic food consultant for Waitrose, citing organophosphates in carrots, salmonella in eggs and BSE in cattle.
2_13	0.095849533	The latter refers to mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, which destroys the brain.
2_14	0.072999592	For several years, the British government insisted that it could not be passed from cattle to humans.
2_15	0.066500922	Then, in 1997, the government acknowledged that BSE could be transmitted.
2_16	0.11808537	The admission was followed by the appearance of genetically modified foods, and for Britons that apparently was the last straw.
2_17	0.099834808	Wilson said the furor last year over genetically modified foods occurred because ``it threatened to take away choice from British consumers''.
2_18	0.10562527	He continued: ``Any science that comes to market has to benefit consumers, and the presentation of GM foods here was very, very poor.
2_19	0.08797198	So GM was just another gift to the organic movement,'' helping to speed up its popularity.
2_20	0.24871523	As in the United States, organic means free of genetically modified ingredients.
2_21	0.090709082	Despite food scares in the United States _ salmonella in chickens and eggs, listeria in ready-to-eat meats and E.
2_22	0.13904973	coli O157:H7 in a number of products _ Americans appear to trust government food safety agencies more than the British.
2_23	0.083246457	Craig Sams, an American who is founder and president of Whole Earth Foods in England and lives there but travels often to the United States, said there were three fundamental differences between attitudes here and there: regulations, the press and the English connectedness to the countryside.
2_24	0.072147584	He could have added vegetarianism.
2_25	0.092297264	For generations, meatless diets have had a much higher profile in England than in this country, where few even knew what vegetarians were until the 1960s.
2_26	0.10408731	The United States has no national organic standards, Sams said, which ``undermines the market and deters big companies from going in''.
2_27	0.098453587	When the European Union's organic rules took effect in 1993, it improved credibility, he said, ``because everyone knew what organic meant''.
2_28	0.10061829	In England, the press has been very supportive of organics, Sams said.
2_29	0.11785059	Food writers there are continually exposed to information from the Soil Association, which is a nationwide organic certifier and has as much clout as all of this country's organic institutions combined.
2_30	0.074410543	And, finally, Sams believes that the British are more connected to their environment.
2_31	0.074027432	``The English love to go for long rambling walks in the countryside,'' he said.
2_32	0.10287112	``You don't do that in the States, so you don't have the same sense of the country''.
2_33	0.18595095	Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade Association in Greenfield, Mass.
2_34	0.14045828	, the country's largest organic organization, agreed with Sams' assessment.
2_35	0.079306344	In addition, she said, supermarkets have not been around as long as they have in the United States, and so the ``British still feel the loss of neighborhood green grocer, the butcher, the baker,'' DiMatteo said.
2_36	0.10006319	``You can see how people would be very emotional about their food supply, and organic seems to answer these kinds of emotional concerns and issues,'' she added.
2_37	0.13029988	The deep involvement of Prince Charles in organics and genetic engineering issues has also not been lost on his subjects, she said, and he has developed a line of organic foods under the Duchy label.
2_38	0.08698925	Finally, because of Britain's size, trends spread more rapidly there.
2_39	0.082906437	``Even if you wanted to buy organic in many parts of this country,'' DiMatteo said, ``you wouldn't be able to except on the West and East Coasts, the upper Midwest and the Southeast''.
2_40	0.095870221	On my visit to London in May, I was coming out of the underground when I was confronted by a front-page headline in The Daily Mail.
2_41	0.089164332	It warned, ``Organic Mushrooms Were Contaminated With Deadly Bacteria''.
2_42	0.074271087	Not until the fifth paragraph did the reader learn that the headline was false, that the E.
2_43	0.070126472	coli found in the mushrooms was not E.
2_44	0.072644571	coli 0157:H7, which is deadly, but the generic variety, which is not.
2_45	0.049186927	No sources were cited for the findings.
2_46	0.079079972	Only one of Britain's many newspapers repeated any part of the story.
2_47	0.051684211	These weren't the first false charges.

13_0	0.11627053	NEW YORK _ Readers often send me questions that are of interest to more than an audience of one, and lately they have almost all involved fruits and vegetables.
13_1	0.084445393	One reader was anxious about the pesticides in strawberries, and whether cooking the fruit reduced any risk.
13_2	0.11845583	I checked the most recent ranking of produce by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research organization in Washington.
13_3	0.099738702	The rankings reflect the number of pesticides in various fruits and vegetables, and the percentage of each category that is cantaminated with pesticides.
13_4	0.048142538	Apples were at the top, followed by spinach, peaches, pears, strawberries, Chilean grapes, potatoes, red raspberries, celery and green beans.
13_5	0.080009288	As for whether cooking reduces the levels of pesticide in a fruit or vegetable, it depends on the type of fruit or vegetable and on how long it is cooked.
13_6	0.083547831	Turning apples into applesauce or tomatoes into tomato paste reduces levels significantly.
13_7	0.038631147	Freezing produce has virtually no impact.
13_8	0.082054288	Another reader wondered if peeling vegetables reduced the pesticide level.
13_9	0.08275518	Generally, peeling fruits and vegetables will reduce the level, but some pesticides are systemic and taken up through the roots.
13_10	0.092928444	Readers interested in more data on pesticides in food can log on to the Web site of the Environmental Working Group, which is at www.foodnews.org.
13_11	0.17531191	For those who are truly concerned about pesticides in conventional food, the safest alternative is organic food.
13_12	0.068648027	On another issue, a reader wondered about the nutritional value of vegetables in soup, explaining that her husband called soup ``dead vegetables'' because they are cooked so long.
13_13	0.088235209	Water-soluble vitamins B and C do leach out of vegetables when they are cooked in liquid, but in this case they go directly into the soup.
13_14	0.10027391	To keep the vegetables from looking dead, add the most tender ones just long enough to cook and contribute some flavor without turning to mush.
13_15	0.085544164	Still another reader wanted to know how pineapple juice and carrot juice can still have fiber in them after they have been processed.
13_16	0.096481043	The best source of that kind of information is Harold McGee, the author of ``On Food and Cooking'' (Scribner, 1984).
13_17	0.072427232	As he explains, there are two kinds of fiber, soluble and insoluble.
13_18	0.091225698	Pectin, which is used to gel jellies, is soluble fiber.
13_19	0.083525076	It doesn't appear to have any texture, but it does, so you might not be able to tell it was in the juice.
13_20	0.060274791	Cellulose and lignin are insoluble fibers.
13_21	0.087412641	The fiber in a glass of pineapple or carrot juice is soluble, and it cannot be seen because it is suspended in the liquid.
13_22	0.088412351	Insoluble fiber, if it is there, is the sediment, what eventually falls to the bottom of the glass.
13_23	0.093456641	Another reader had a more pressing question: Can you make a low-fat blue cheese dressing like the bottled kind at home?
13_24	0.062765103	Yes and no.
13_25	0.075228276	You can make a low-fat blue cheese dressing, but not like the one in the bottle.
13_26	0.076231241	In my version, which is given below, there is no guar gum, used as a thickener.
13_27	0.089395583	Because blue cheese has such a strong flavor, not much is needed, and that keeps the calories and fat down.
13_28	0.08841417	This dressing is delicious on ripe tomatoes or Belgian endive and as an alternative to the usual dressing for coleslaw or potato salad.
13_29	0.087966183	To make enough for four people, mash two ounces (four tablespoons) of blue cheese with six tablespoons of plain nonfat yogurt, two tablespoons of brandy and a couple of pinches of cayenne.
13_30	0.092042401	Mix well.
13_31	0.074175879	The dressing will keep for a week or two in the refrigerator, tightly covered.
14_0	0.17188412	WASHINGTON The Department of Agriculture announced Thursday that it would allow farmers who raise meat and poultry without pesticide-treated feed, growth hormones or antibiotics to label their meat ``certified organic''.
14_1	0.28809239	That meat will be the only organic food with a certification process approved by the federal government.
14_2	0.15142498	State regulations for years have allowed organic labels on many other foods, but meat and poultry have always been in a different category, subject to more stringent federal labeling regulations.
14_3	0.062115614	The federal rules go into effect immediately, and need no legislative approval.
14_4	0.12675525	They are welcomed by companies that grow organic meat, who have been frustrated in attempts to market a premium product.
14_5	0.12026337	Many foods labeled organic sell for 10 percent to 50 percent above the price of similar nonorganic foods.
14_6	0.25443496	For decades, the Agriculture Department treated the organic food industry as if it did not exist.
14_7	0.1749187	But as sales grew more than 20 percent a year through the 1990s, organic food came to account for $1 of every $100 spent on food, and in 1997 the agency took notice, proposing national organic standards for all food.
14_8	0.1051733	The proposal met with stiff resistance from more than 275,000 people who said they opposed the federal standards because they would lower the state standards already in place.
14_9	0.053420248	In an unusual move the agency withdrew the proposal.
14_10	0.098481085	An Agriculture Department spokesman described the new meat and poultry policy as ``an interim step,'' until national standards exist, which may come next year.
14_11	0.076456044	``This is a boon for small companies like us,'' said Allen Shainsky, owner of Petaluma Poultry Processors in Petaluma, Calif.
14_12	0.087260442	Shainsky's company sells around 120,000 birds per week, and he said he hoped to be selling 15,000 organic birds a week within a few months.

14_14	0.13415306	, which sells its products under the Organic Valley label, said: ``This means a lot to us.
14_15	0.074157147	We have not been able to get full value out of our beef cattle, our dairy cattle.
14_16	0.095448233	``In terms of going out with a national marketing program, it has been impossible, and we have not been able to realize the true value of our animal production,'' Moody said.
14_17	0.057307408	``It has held the livestock industry back''.
14_18	0.086546572	Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman said he hoped Thursday's announcement would also help the meat industry, particularly hog farmers who have seen prices for pork as low as 9 cents a pound.
14_19	0.088842702	The current price is 28 cents a pound for live hogs, compared with 35 cents last year.
14_20	0.095193249	Ultimately, Moody said, there is more profit in organic meat than in conventional meat.
14_21	0.087255959	He said he expected to sell organic pork for 60 to 70 cents a pound.
14_22	0.18567748	The Agriculture Department will rely on state and industry certifiers as it allows producers to use the organic label.
14_23	0.12419365	Those standards require third-party certification that the meat and poultry are raised on organic feed, without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones, that they have access to the outside and that there is a manure management plan.
14_24	0.083620235	If an animal becomes ill and must be given antibiotics it can no longer be sold as organic.
14_25	0.15618063	``I think this announcement is a sign that organic is one of the Secretary's top priorities,'' said Katherine DeMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade Association in Greenfield, Mass.
14_26	0.11788173	, ``that he is serious about working out details of the final rule for national organic standards.
14_27	0.074753313	The secretary has seen that this will create new opportunities to help small farmers''.
14_28	0.10041141	Glickman acted after a letter-writing campaign in the fall from small meat and poultry producers.
14_29	0.075742113	Opposition from the national beef industry was quite mild.
14_30	0.093120264	Alisa Harrison, a spokeswoman for the National Cattlemen's Association, said the association was ``generally supportive of niche marketing and giving consumers a choice''.
14_31	0.034267978	Our only concern, Ms.
14_32	0.17848507	Harrison said, ``is that consumers understand that products labeled organic are not safer than products that are not labeled organic.''
15_0	0.14039665	There have been virtually no corn exports from the United States because the genetically modified corn cannot be separated from the rest of the crop, costing American farmers about $200 million a year.
15_1	0.11351213	Some of the largest exporters, including Archer Daniels Midland, have said they will no longer accept altered corn for export and have let farmers know they want conventionally grown corn.
15_2	0.077789599	A consortium of major European retailers, including Sainsbury and Marks &AMP; Spencer from Britain, Migros from Switzerland, Carrefour from France and Esselunga from Italy, are shopping for sources of products that have not been genetically modified.
15_3	0.07168068	The impact of these actions on American farmers, who are already in deep financial trouble, can be devastating.
15_4	0.087238685	In trying to keep a dialogue going with America's European trading partners, Glickman sought to tone down the administration's rhetoric, which has included calling Europeans ``irrational'' because of their opposition to genetically modified foods.
15_5	0.076689822	Glickman said he had spoken to ``White House people'' before he made his remarks at the National Press Club in Washington, but one other administration official said the speech had taken them by surprise.
15_6	0.086211933	Genetic modification is the insertion of genes from one species of animal or plant or from microbes into another, permanently altering its genetic code.
15_7	0.074089454	It can confer resistance on plants to certain insects and diseases that would in some cases require the use of pesticides.
15_8	0.08645282	Soybeans have been genetically altered so that they can tolerate applications of an herbicide that kills the weeds in the same field.
15_9	0.11873445	Those who oppose genetic modification of food do so on two grounds: The safety of these foods has never been tested and they are harmful to the environment.
15_10	0.14220344	The Food and Drug Administration does not require testing, just assurances from the company that manufactures the genetically modified food that it is safe.
15_11	0.10471739	Glickman acknowledged that none of the agencies responsible for the safety of genetically modified foods _ USDA, FDA or Environmental Protection Agency had enough staff or resources to conduct such testing.
15_12	0.027371419	Environmental questions are more problematic.
15_13	0.08631648	The Environmental Defense Fund, a public interest lobbying group, filed a petition with the EPA Tuesday asking it to require farmers to plant conventional corn around the fields of the genetically modified corn to prevent the escape of toxic pollens into areas where butterflies feed.
15_14	0.087319344	There is also concern that the pesticide resistance engineered into plants could transfer to weeds and insects, producing superweeds and superbugs.
15_15	0.1016029	Even Americans who do not necessarily oppose genetic engineering believe that such products should be labeled.
15_16	0.11703042	In a survey conducted by the European company Novartis, more than 90 percent called for labeling.
15_17	0.11519845	In addition, more than 500,000 people signed a petition to the FDA demanding mandatory labeling of such foods.
15_18	0.10014744	The Center for Food Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group, has filed a lawsuit against the FDA to reclassify genetic modification as an additive that would require labeling.
15_19	0.26099763	When the Agriculture Department proposed organic food regulations, more than 280,000 people filed comments protesting the inclusion of genetically modified foods as organic.
15_20	0.11120409	Glickman, known as a strong supporter of biotechnology, said in his speech Tuesday that it was important to ``encourage the development of these new food production systems''.
15_21	0.095521297	But, he added, ``We cannot blindly embrace their benefits.
15_22	0.073272262	We have to ensure public confidence in general, consumer confidence in particular''.
15_23	0.13248934	In a speech earlier this year at Purdue University, he said, ``We also can't force these new genetically engineered food products down consumers' throats''.
15_24	0.08186931	And he compared biotechnology today to nuclear power 20 years ago.
15_25	0.088913807	``We have a way in this country of latching on to solutions, pursuing them to the exclusion of others, and then watching them sometimes backfire,'' he said.

19_1	0.30214792	Avery wants organic food to go away.
19_2	0.047364362	And he doesn't care what it takes.
19_3	0.16844727	Four years ago, he said that organic food could not feed the world without destroying the environment.
19_4	0.052552148	Now, he says it's lethal.
19_5	0.10491548	In an article in the fall issue of American Outlook magazine, published by his employer, the Hudson Institute, a conservative research group, Avery wrote, ``Organic foods have clearly become the deadliest food choice''.
19_6	0.10316391	This is the case, he said, because organic farms use animal manure and do not use chemicals or permit pasteurization.
19_7	0.058491418	The last assertion is untrue, as were several other statements in the article.
19_8	0.081088944	The accusation might have gone unnoticed, but excerpts from the article were published in The Wall Street Journal and continue to be picked up around the country, by The Associated Press, The Tampa Tribune and trade industry publications.
19_9	0.16346704	The simplest definition of ``organic'' is food grown without hormones, pesticides or synthetic fertilizers.
19_10	0.10074832	Avery, however, used the terms ``organic,'' ``free-range,'' ``natural'' and ``unpasteurized'' interchangeably.
19_11	0.086559348	``I grant you that I've mixed together natural and organic,'' Avery, the author of ``Saving the Planet With Pesticides and Plastic'' (Hudson Institute, 1995), said in an interview last week.
19_12	0.074322148	``But to me they are distinctions without significant difference in terms of public health''.
19_13	0.098317227	His most combative accusation is based, he said, on 1996 data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, showing that ``people who eat organic and `natural' foods are eight times as likely as the rest of the population to be attacked by a deadly new strain of E.
19_14	0.094618789	coli bacteria (O157:H7)''.
19_15	0.11695285	Yet some of the foods that caused the outbreak, which he called organic, were not, like unpasteurized Odwalla apple juice.
19_16	0.11305992	Avery's claim that ``consumers of organic food are also more likely to be attacked by a relatively new, more virulent strain of the infamous salmonella bacteria'' was based on a Consumers Union study in 1998 showing that ``premium'' chickens had higher levels of salmonella than regular supermarket chickens.
19_17	0.065609792	But the premium chickens were not organic.
19_18	0.12758321	In the article, Avery took the Food and Drug Administration to task for failing ``to issue any warnings to consumers about the higher levels of natural toxins their researchers regularly find in organic foods''.
19_19	0.077997852	In the interview, he said that that assertion was based on a statement by Dr.
19_20	0.16804187	Robert Lake, an official in the agency's Center for Food Safety and Nutrition.
19_21	0.10984066	Lake denied making such a statement, saying, ``We don't go out of our way to sample organic food, and hence I don't think we are in a position to say anything one way or another about it''.
19_22	0.14931772	Avery wrote that because ``organic farmers use animal manure as the major source of fertilizer,'' there are higher levels of harmful bacteria in organic food.
19_23	0.11096035	Katherine DiMatteo, the executive director of the Organic Trade Association, said that manure is not the major source of fertilizer on organic farms (it is also used in conventional farming) and that, when it is used, certain rules must be followed for safety.
19_24	0.1321156	Avery said he had never ``bothered that much about consumer safety aspects of organic food until O157:H7''.
19_25	0.08343593	His real goal, he said, is to prevent organic agriculture from becoming the norm.
19_26	0.0835735	``My big concern is that we do not have room on the planet to feed ourselves organically,'' he said.
19_27	0.20736445	The attack on organic food by a well-financed research organization suggests that, even though organic food accounts for only 1 percent of food sales in the country, the conventional food industry is worried.
20_0	0.24344781	WASHINGTON (AP) --Farmers doubled the nation's organic crop acreage in the 1990s, and production of organic eggs and milk increased even more to meet rising consumer demand, the government says.
20_1	0.11063974	The amount of certified organic cropland grew from 403,000 acres in 1992 to 850,000 in 1997.
20_2	0.11409983	The number of organic laying hens jumped from 43,981 to 537,826 during the same period, a time when public concern about bacterial contamination of eggs was on the rise.

20_4	0.14556439	''Organic farming became one of the fastest growing segments of U.S. agriculture during the 1990s and producers, exporters and retailers are still struggling to meet consumer demand,'' according to a study by the Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service.

20_8	0.16708838	Economists say organic production of meat and poultry lagged during the decade because they could not be labeled as organic until February 1999.
20_9	0.089863047	A summary of the USDA study was released Thursday.
20_10	0.17048613	Organic farming practices prohibit the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for crops or antibiotics or hormones in livestock.
20_11	0.27505234	New national standards for organic food that the department announced earlier this month are expected to stimulate growth in the industry by bolstering consumer confidence and making it easier to export the products.
20_12	0.10041944	But the study said it remains difficult for farmers to switch to organic practices for a number of reasons: the cost and risk involved in shifting to the new methods, insufficient numbers of processors and distributors, and limited access to capital.
20_13	0.12665478	While organic products can fetch significantly higher prices than conventional ones, farmers cannot sell their crops as organic during the three-year conversion period required to be certified.
20_14	0.10208728	Nationally, 2 percent of apple, grape, lettuce and carrot acreage was organic in 1997, along with 1 percent of oats, dry peas and tomatoes.

22_0	0.14039148	NEW YORK (AP) --It's a marriage aimed at putting fish on the table of the world's rich and poor for generations to come.
22_1	0.11455143	With research showing that global fish stocks are vanishing, business and industry are joining forces with environmental groups to back a new seal of approval --for fish caught from waters where they will be replenished.
