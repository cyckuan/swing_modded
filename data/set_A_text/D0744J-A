0_1	0.10949574	Products and processes are standardized and trademarked to protect consumers.
0_2	0.19418446	Organic food has become an area of vigorous development in China's agriculture and food production.
0_3	0.15872062	The total output of China 's organic food was up to 8.4 million tons by the end of 1998.
0_4	0.036553726	The sales volume of last year was about 28.5 billion yuan (about 3.3 billion US dollars).
0_5	0.15144216	The rapid development of China's organic food industry has attracted the international attention.
0_6	0.16738226	In 1998, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) of the United Nations emphasized China's experiences of development and management of organic food in the Asia-Pacific region.
0_7	0.31128353	Talking about the future of the organic food industry, Liu Lianfu said organic food has already become a rising market with great potential.
0_8	0.17493392	It is estimated that in the coming years, the scale of the world's organic food market will reach 100 billion US dollars and Europe, the United States and Japan will take the lead.
0_9	0.11158987	In China, the average consumption of fruit and vegetables is still far behind that of developed countries, thus it has a good opportunity to develop organic food, Liu said.
1_0	0.12488912	When it comes to sales of organic food, the British are leaving the Americans in the dust.
1_1	0.092909161	After sputtering along for years, sales there are expected to be five times as much this year as in 1996, compared with a less than threefold increase in this country over the same period.
1_2	0.10132581	Organics are mainstream in Britain, in some part because of the introduction of genetically modified ingredients from America to which there has been widespread opposition.
1_3	0.086541511	Anger and fear over GM products reached a peak last summer and has since died down, but interest in organics is stronger than ever.
1_4	0.13876176	Ads for organic food are found in newspapers and in supermarket magazines, particularly those of Waitrose and Sainsbury, the two chains leading the organic charge.
1_5	0.10699229	Overhead signs in their stores direct customers to the organic sections, and the products themselves are clearly marked.
1_6	0.11209784	That these organic products are free of genetically modified ingredients is occasionally emblazoned on the packages as well.
1_7	0.21847078	And unlike the United States, where the bulk of organic sales are in natural food stores, 70 percent to 80 percent of the sales in England are in conventional supermarkets.
1_8	0.093160652	Sainsbury has about 440 stores, and Waitrose has more than 120.
1_9	0.090763006	Other supermarket chains are also making a point of stocking organic ingredients, but not with quite the same fervor.
1_10	0.090532333	A number of factors account for the differences between the two countries.
1_11	0.092570025	The simple answer is a series of food scares there that have made consumers uneasy.
1_12	0.10252701	``We have lived in a culture of food scares,'' said Alan Wilson, an agronomist and organic food consultant for Waitrose, citing organophosphates in carrots, salmonella in eggs and BSE in cattle.
1_13	0.08396031	The latter refers to mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, which destroys the brain.
1_14	0.093002874	For several years, the British government insisted that it could not be passed from cattle to humans.
1_15	0.088059765	Then, in 1997, the government acknowledged that BSE could be transmitted.
1_16	0.099930478	The admission was followed by the appearance of genetically modified foods, and for Britons that apparently was the last straw.
1_17	0.080456809	Wilson said the furor last year over genetically modified foods occurred because ``it threatened to take away choice from British consumers''.
1_18	0.083299745	He continued: ``Any science that comes to market has to benefit consumers, and the presentation of GM foods here was very, very poor.
1_19	0.094664063	So GM was just another gift to the organic movement,'' helping to speed up its popularity.
1_20	0.16853955	As in the United States, organic means free of genetically modified ingredients.
1_21	0.098312016	Despite food scares in the United States _ salmonella in chickens and eggs, listeria in ready-to-eat meats and E.
1_22	0.10458463	coli O157:H7 in a number of products _ Americans appear to trust government food safety agencies more than the British.
1_23	0.06583339	Craig Sams, an American who is founder and president of Whole Earth Foods in England and lives there but travels often to the United States, said there were three fundamental differences between attitudes here and there: regulations, the press and the English connectedness to the countryside.
1_24	0.095876278	He could have added vegetarianism.
1_25	0.084237048	For generations, meatless diets have had a much higher profile in England than in this country, where few even knew what vegetarians were until the 1960s.
1_26	0.10265317	The United States has no national organic standards, Sams said, which ``undermines the market and deters big companies from going in''.
1_27	0.084017787	When the European Union's organic rules took effect in 1993, it improved credibility, he said, ``because everyone knew what organic meant''.
1_28	0.097991249	In England, the press has been very supportive of organics, Sams said.
1_29	0.10846715	Food writers there are continually exposed to information from the Soil Association, which is a nationwide organic certifier and has as much clout as all of this country's organic institutions combined.
1_30	0.092418053	And, finally, Sams believes that the British are more connected to their environment.
1_31	0.092593945	``The English love to go for long rambling walks in the countryside,'' he said.
1_32	0.094142158	``You don't do that in the States, so you don't have the same sense of the country''.
1_33	0.19354376	Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade Association in Greenfield, Mass.
1_34	0.096316767	, the country's largest organic organization, agreed with Sams' assessment.
1_35	0.078705388	In addition, she said, supermarkets have not been around as long as they have in the United States, and so the ``British still feel the loss of neighborhood green grocer, the butcher, the baker,'' DiMatteo said.
1_36	0.088970741	``You can see how people would be very emotional about their food supply, and organic seems to answer these kinds of emotional concerns and issues,'' she added.
1_37	0.12141842	The deep involvement of Prince Charles in organics and genetic engineering issues has also not been lost on his subjects, she said, and he has developed a line of organic foods under the Duchy label.
1_38	0.092170741	Finally, because of Britain's size, trends spread more rapidly there.
1_39	0.086024172	``Even if you wanted to buy organic in many parts of this country,'' DiMatteo said, ``you wouldn't be able to except on the West and East Coasts, the upper Midwest and the Southeast''.
1_40	0.092803308	On my visit to London in May, I was coming out of the underground when I was confronted by a front-page headline in The Daily Mail.
1_41	0.08188303	It warned, ``Organic Mushrooms Were Contaminated With Deadly Bacteria''.
1_42	0.090434893	Not until the fifth paragraph did the reader learn that the headline was false, that the E.
1_43	0.09269194	coli found in the mushrooms was not E.
1_44	0.092809043	coli 0157:H7, which is deadly, but the generic variety, which is not.
1_45	0.087952647	No sources were cited for the findings.
1_46	0.091995965	Only one of Britain's many newspapers repeated any part of the story.
1_47	0.090112956	These weren't the first false charges.
1_48	0.097726669	Last year, according to The Guardian, the ``agri-industrial food establishment'' mounted ``an ill-informed and unjustified smear campaign'' that tried to link organic food to the hazardous form of E.

2_0	0.29983309	&UR; &QL; &LR; &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR; Like much of the rest of the world, the United States continues to lurch toward a national standard for organic food.
2_1	0.15280553	The Department of Agriculture gathered the last of some 41,000 public comments on the proposed national organic standard in June.
2_2	0.090377159	By fall, a final version of the regulations should be ready for adoption.
2_3	0.069275432	It will take another 18 months, USDA officials estimate, to actually put the standards into practice.
2_4	0.26320983	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has said that the pending national organic program will be ``the most comprehensive and strongest organic standard in the world''.
2_5	0.10515063	Meanwhile, the U.S. organic industry continues to see unprecedented growth.
2_6	0.12092358	Average organic-food sales are expected to grow by almost 25 percent a year for the next decade, according to USDA estimates.
2_7	0.12369197	The United States is not alone in the organic revolution.
2_8	0.25890075	An estimated 130 countries are producing significant amounts of certified organic food, according to Organic Perspectives magazine.

2_10	0.092422059	&LR; A new organic certification and production system is set to take effect in April.
2_11	0.10649163	But because only a limited amount of food meets the new standards, many producers are likely to use alternative labels like ``reduced chemical''.
2_12	0.017121145	&UR; _ Australia.
2_13	0.16081382	&LR; The sale of organics rose by about 30 percent last year, driven by concerns over food safety, the environment and a fear of genetically engineered food.
2_14	0.085343832	But the Australian organic market is still relatively small, with about $150 million in sales a year.

2_21	0.062987599	French officials expect that figure to rise to 40 million gallons this year.
2_22	0.13995696	Back in the United States, the proposed regulations offer a national definition of the term ``organic''.
2_23	0.13683081	Currently, organic food is certified by various private and state organizations that each use their own standards for the term.
2_24	0.10499395	The national standard will establish clear labeling criteria so consumers know exactly what they are buying.
2_25	0.26765016	Among other rules, the regulations will prohibit the use of genetic engineering, sewage sludge and irradiation in the production of food products labeled ``organic''.
2_26	0.099597947	Antibiotics in organic livestock production and feed will also be banned.
2_27	0.10644638	The regulations, first introduced in 1997, will make it easier for organic farmers to export their products because international trade officials prefer to deal with one national standard rather than multiple state and private standards.

4_12	0.088750636	But the study said it remains difficult for farmers to switch to organic practices for a number of reasons: the cost and risk involved in shifting to the new methods, insufficient numbers of processors and distributors, and limited access to capital.

9_0	0.27896285	WASHINGTON _ More than two years after the federal government's first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win public approval, the Department of Agriculture is announcing much tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified ingredients in products carrying the organic label.
9_1	0.11788141	The rules also prohibit the use of irradiation to decontaminate the products and the application of sewage sludge as fertilizer.
9_2	0.096349514	The rules, to be announced next week, could take effect by the end of the year.
9_3	0.13986505	Of the more than 275,000 comments received in response to the original proposal in 1997, virtually all of them opposed those three processes, which the Agriculture Department had considered allowing.
9_4	0.12371901	The new rules indicate an about-face in the department's attitude toward organic farming and represent one of several steps it is taking to help the small- and medium-sized farmers who have mainly been ignored or even discriminated against by the agency for decades.
9_5	0.2108589	The national standards could help U.S. producers sell organic food abroad, where there has been substantial opposition to the use of genetically modified crops and other new food technologies.
9_6	0.082111697	``This could turn out to be the most important rule USDA has issued in 20 years,'' said Dr.

9_10	0.090387558	It is also a turning point in its relationship to consumers.
9_11	0.090579664	The agency has never before been responsive to consumers' desires or demands''.
9_12	0.10092994	In an interview, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said that if the public thought the standards were too strict they should let the department know during the 90-day comment period before the agency enacts the final rules.
9_13	0.095938279	``I'd rather go from too strict standards and ease them than going the other way,'' Glickman said.
9_14	0.10883117	The agency is clearly moving towards stricter definitions of what constitutes organic food.
9_15	0.15603555	After initially ignoring many of the recommendations of the National Organic Standards Board, which had been set up to help the agency formulate the regulations, the Agriculture Department has now taken all of the board's advice, including total prohibition of antibiotics in animals raised as organic; the use of 100 percent organic feed; and the requirement of outdoor access for animals.
9_16	0.3680269	Sales of organic food have been increasing about 20 percent a year.
9_17	0.28110696	When Congress passed the Organic Foods Production Act in 1990, sales of organic food had reached $1 billion: projected sales for 1999 are $6.46 billion.
9_18	0.18232867	Under the new rules, raw products could carry the federal agency's organic seal on the front of packaging if they were 100 percent organic, meaning that they are grown and manufactured without the use of added hormones, pesticides or synthetic fertilizer.
9_19	0.11400629	Processed food that is made from at least 95 percent organic ingredients could also carry the seal.
9_20	0.12591062	And processed food containing at least 50 percent organic ingredients could be labeled ``made with organic ingredients'' and list up to three of them.
9_21	0.22696243	Irradiation, genetic modification and the use of sludge would be prohibited not only in the organic ingredients but in the conventional ingredients in foods made partly with organic ingredients.
9_22	0.11942097	Products made with less than 50 percent organic ingredients may use the word organic only in the list of ingredients on the side panel; in this case, the prohibition against those three processes would not apply.
9_23	0.15195317	Several advocates of organic farming who have seen the revised rules say that the standards are stricter than those developed in any other country and have set the bar very high for organic farmers in the United States, possibly discouraging rather than encouraging them to grow organic crops.
9_24	0.11266614	``The document is certainly much closer to meeting industry expectations than the first one but the pendulum may have swung too far,'' said Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade Association.

9_26	0.089299435	I am afraid that some people are not going to bother to be organic anymore''.
9_27	0.16197528	One of the areas of concern that has been left vague in the new rules is how to treat organic crops that have been contaminated with drift from nearby genetically engineered crops.
9_28	0.092337686	An Agriculture Department official said that no level for drift had been set but a farmer would not be penalized if some low level of contamination occurred as long as he had followed all of the organic procedures required.
9_29	0.10156598	As part of a larger effort to help the more than 12,000 organic farmers, the administration's budget for the first time includes a $5.5 million request for organic research.
