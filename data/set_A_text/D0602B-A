0_0	0.08333333333333333	SEATTLE _ The national dairy industry is using Mark McGwire to promote the health benefits of drinking milk.
0_1	0.0	Meanwhile, a rebel sneaker company called And1 has signed Latrell Sprewell to promote the misguided notion that it is OK to do whatever you want, including choke your coach, and you'll still be glorified.
0_2	0.0	The sports images in advertising are certainly eye-opening these days, even with Dennis Rodman out of the picture.
0_3	0.0	Let's start with McGwire.
0_4	0.0	The other day while driving on Aurora Avenue through Seattle, I was twice stopped at a red light long enough to realize how crazy it was to have McGwire towering over the road, his image plastered on a billboard _ bat in hand, sleeveless shirt revealing his sapling-sized biceps _ a veritable poster-boy for the health benefits of drinking milk.
0_5	0.0	Milk mustache in full view, McGwire's pitch (which you can find on the Web at www.whymilk.com) is simple: ``Going, going, gone.
0_6	0.0	Time for milk.
0_7	0.0	It's got stuff leading sports drinks don't _ like protein, potassium and calcium.
0_8	0.0	That's why I always have an ice cold glass...
0_9	0.0	as soon as I get home''.
0_10	0.0	Which prompts any rational sports fan to pose the next logical question: Does McGwire drink the milk before or after he pops the steroid-producing substance androstenedione?
0_11	0.0	He may have clobbered Maris and Ruth and ignited an entire summer, but McGwire stands for something else, too.
0_12	0.0	Ever since McGwire's andro use became public knowledge during last season's great home-run chase, McGwire has been generally unabashed in admitting his andro use.
0_13	0.0	He says it ensures better workouts in order for him to pump up his massive body, which in turn probably allowed McGwire to have one of his most injury-free seasons in the dramatic 1998.
0_14	0.0	Despite all the incredibly generous things McGwire has done for abused kids and for the game of baseball, his blind spot and failing on this issue is significant.
0_15	0.0	In Washington, D.C., earlier this month, President Bill Clinton's drug policy advisor, Gen.
0_16	0.0	Barry R.
0_17	0.125	McCaffrey, called for the federal government to study the health effects of androstenedione.
0_18	0.0	The over-the-counter supplement's popularity soared last year, even among school-aged children, soon after McGwire acknowledged using the substance for at least one year as part of his training regimen.
0_19	0.05555555555555555	In an article he wrote for The New York Times last Sunday, former Olympic hurdler Edwin Moses said he supports McCaffrey's leadership on this issue.
0_20	0.0	And Moses was not afraid to point the finger at McGwire.
0_21	0.0	``Androstenedione, better known as andro, is a steroid.
0_22	0.0	Despite all the misinformation to the contrary, it is neither merely a food supplement nor is it innocuous,'' Moses said.
0_23	0.0	A long-standing anti-doping crusader, Moses is alarmed at the influence athletes like McGwire have over the behavior of children.
0_24	0.6363636363636364	``The National Institute of Drug Abuse estimates that 175,000 teenage girls and 325,000 teen-age boys _ that's 500,000 children _ have reported using steroids during the past year,'' Moses said.
0_25	0.0	``The alarming numbers are not the only story.
0_26	0.0	Drug use in sport is also a fraud on the public, which is promised a product _ clean competition _ that is not ultimately delivered ...
0_27	0.0	``The problem of drug use by elite athletes must continue to be addressed on the federal level by General McCaffrey and others who are responsible for children and public welfare,'' Moses said.
0_28	0.0	Milk mustaches are one thing, but the taint of andro use still lingers with McGwire, whose bat speed and ability made him a natural anyway to set a new standard for home runs.
0_29	0.0	What might have been unnatural were McGwire's workouts, aided by the quick-recovery time andro allowed his muscles.
0_30	0.0	That is what makes you look up at McGwire's billboard and his innocent milk mustache and wish like heck the guy had simply depended on the natural goodness of milk, not the controversial substance now under serious scrutiny.
0_31	0.0	On a different front, a similar sort of head-scratching took place this NBA playoff season.
0_32	0.0	It happened when I looked into Latrell Sprewell's eyes during his ill-advised sneaker ad _ the one that is set to air 200 times before the NBA Finals.
0_33	0.0	Sprewell, who was suspended by the NBA for most of the 1997-98 season and who later sued everyone from the league to his agent to Converse sneakers because of his physical assault of Golden State coach P.J.
0_34	0.0	Carlesimo, was certainly aware that his new ad was made to shock.
0_35	0.0	``People say I'm what's wrong with sports.
0_36	0.0	I say I'm a three-time NBA All-Star.
0_37	0.0	People say I'm America's worst nightmare.
0_38	0.0	I say I'm the American dream,'' the sneering Spree says into the camera close-up.
0_39	0.0	The new ad was predicted by the national trade magazine Brandweek to be the most controversial sneaker endorsement since Nike made Charles Barkley say he was no role model.
0_40	0.0	Well, turns out Spree's ad isn't controversial.
0_41	0.0	It's just pathetic, which is what happens when you don't know any better than to go ahead and send the wrong message.

1_0	0.0	NEW YORK _ In 1970, two years into the open-tennis era and two years before Title IX, a pair of relatively obscure female players walked around the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills with a questionnaire.
1_1	0.0	Their objective: to determine tennis trends and, in particular, whether spectators attending the U.S.
1_2	0.0	Open would pay to watch a tournament with only female players.
1_3	0.3333333333333333	The remarkably positive response of that informal survey by Ceci Martinez and Esme Emanuel was a declaration of independence for women's sports.
1_4	0.46153846153846156	And if Title IX became the bill of rights for female athletes, this summer has emerged as the exclamation point for any equal-rights amendment.

1_6	0.125	Open tennis, from the world track and field championships to the Pan-Pacific swimming meet, the message has been unmistakably clear: Women can hold their own on any stage, with or without men.
1_7	0.15	Teresa Weatherspoon's game-winning shot in the Women's National Basketball Association finals last week was as mind-boggling and riveting as was Jerry West's dramatic heave decades earlier.
1_8	0.0	And the Houston Comets' three-peat earned them a legacy alongside other basketball dynasties.
1_9	0.0	But the women have also stolen the show.
1_10	0.0	Even minus Steffi Graf's majestic presence and Anna Kournikova's photogenic tease, Martina Hingis, Monica Seles, Venus and Serena Williams, Lindsay Davenport, Jennifer Capriati and others have created enough competitive subplots to justify an equal-pay mantra.
1_11	0.0	Davenport's bold backhand winner against Mary Pierce from match point down in their compelling quarterfinal three-setter was the gutsy shot of the tournament.
1_12	0.0	The notion that the women must play best-of-five sets to earn singles parity at Grand Slam events (not so at the U.S.
1_13	0.0	Open, which is the only equal-opportunity employer) is as outmoded as trying to equate the price of a Broadway show ticket to the length of a performance.
1_14	0.0	Substance always prevails over style (as Andre Agassi has learned), even if you need personalities for box-office bait.
1_15	0.0	Thirty years ago, only Billie Jean King, Arthur Ashe and a handful of others understood what really mattered.
1_16	0.08333333333333333	Now the Williams sisters have rewritten the rules of the road for junior tennis, and Jong Song Ok's victory for North Korea in the women's marathon at the world track championships may have opened yet another door into a closed society just as Tegla Loroupe brought African women out of obscurity with her New York City Marathon victories.
1_17	0.17647058823529413	Even Brandi Chastain's celebrated stripdown at the Women's World Cup final will be analyzed by the Associated Press Sports Editors in a newsletter.
1_18	0.75	Ceci Martinez says she is fascinated by the current crop of female athletes.
1_19	0.0	``We players were unhappy with the status quo,'' she said the other day by phone from her home in San Mateo, Calif.
1_20	0.0	, where she works in real estate.
1_21	0.0	``And like all reformers, we were considered radical in our time, chided for our feminist views simply because we wanted equal opportunity in all its ramifications''.
1_22	0.2	The positive results of that study, coupled with an early sponsorship commitment from Philip Morris, gave women's tennis its first financial cushion.
1_23	0.0	Now sponsors are using today's pros and even a former great, Althea Gibson, to sell themselves and this year's Open.
1_24	0.5	But the bright lights have also brought murkier, less romantic overtones to women's sports.
1_25	0.08333333333333333	At the world track championships in Spain, Merlene Ottey of Jamaica, a 39-year-old sprinter who had won 14 medals during a venerable career, was forced to withdraw from the meet after traces of the banned steroid nandrolone were found in one of her urine samples.
1_26	0.0	And lost amid the flurry of world swim records set by South African Penny Heyns at the Pan-Pacifics in Sydney's Olympic pool was her disclosure that creatine was an integral part of her training regimen.
1_27	0.07142857142857142	Although legal as a nutritional supplement, creatine has been associated with bulking up male bodies for football, baseball and the beach more than female swimmers.
1_28	0.0	``I'd be swimming pretty well whether I was on it or not,'' said Heyns, who set an astonishing seven world records in her last 10 races.
1_29	0.0	``But I have the attitude that I don't want to get on the blocks during my career and know that I`ve trained and swum as hard as I could but that there was a nutritional side that I didn't do the best I could in.
1_30	0.0	I want to cover all the bases''.
1_31	0.0	These words are a far cry from the days when pasta, carbo-loading and electrolyte solutions were considered new-age nutritional training tools.
1_32	0.0	But Heyns' times will almost certainly resonate around the world on the road to Sydney next September just as many coaches have finally moved beyond East Germany's systematic steroid scandal of the '70s.
1_33	0.07692307692307693	Free from current doping control procedures, nutritional supplements and doping may replace equality as the next battle ground for women.
1_34	0.0	``Title IX has certainly helped,'' Martinez said, of what awaits women, ``but looking beyond the sports arena, women are still struggling to break through the glass ceiling in all facets of life, especially in business, politics and the mass media.''
2_0	0.0	SYDNEY, September 28 (Xinhua) --Russian 400-meter runner Svetlana Pospelova tested positive for banned drugs in an out-of- competition test, International Olympic Committee officials said Saturday.
2_1	0.0	Pospelova was found to have steroid stanozolol in her system, according to Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC's medical commission.
2_2	0.0	Pospelova, who won the European Cup at Gateshead, England, on July 15, was not a medalist in Sydney.
2_3	0.0	The IOC Executive Board meets on Sunday.
2_4	0.0	However since she has left the country and is not expected to compete again, the matter is expected to be turned over to the international federation to consider the case and possible sanctions.
2_5	0.0	Pospelova would be the seventh athlete to test positive at the Games, which have been enveloped in doping cases since well before the start two weeks ago.
2_6	0.0	She had already returned to Russia when the medical commission received the drug test result, de Merode said.
2_7	0.0	Full details will be available after the IOC executive board meeting.
3_0	0.0	BOSTON _ Since the day she sailed her way into this city's heart by finishing a sparkling second in the 1990 Boston Marathon, her US debut after leaving East Germany, marathoning brought Uta Pippig little but joy and success.
3_1	0.0	Even the setbacks _ the worst being forced to drop out of the 1996 Olympics with a leg injury _ seemed temporary, a brief chop on life's ocean that soon would calm again as Pippig resumed her voyage toward immortality in the sport.
3_2	0.0	After all, how could anything swamp an athlete who earned her third straight Boston Marathon victory, as she did at the 100th running in 1996, by coming from nowhere in the last miles while suffering from stomach cramps and relentless diarrhea?
3_3	0.0	Then, last October, the 33-year-old Pippig was suspended by the German athletic federation for failing a routine out-of-competition drug test.
3_4	0.0	Unable to compete during the suspension and facing a two-year ban if found guilty, Pippig suddenly finds herself looking for a lifeline to save her career.
3_5	0.0	``I don't wish any person on earth this,'' said Pippig last fall, shortly after the suspension.
3_6	0.0	``I know I didn't do anything.
3_7	0.0	It's hard.
3_8	0.0	It's just not fair''.
3_9	0.0	But Pippig's forced exile from the roads hasn't kept the longtime Boston favorite out of town this weekend.
3_10	0.0	On Saturday, looking fit and relaxed, she smiled for photos at the Boston Athletic Association's annual breakfast for past champions.
3_11	0.0	Monday, as she did last year while taking what she thought would be a short break from marathoning, she will be doing television commentary for Channel 4.
3_12	0.0	Despite her uncertain situation, Pippig said recently that she was looking forward to race day.
3_13	0.0	``I can't miss it, you know,'' she said.
3_14	0.0	``It's too special''.
3_15	0.0	The same goes for the city: ``You should go where you feel supported''.
3_16	0.0	Still, she sighed, ``I wish I could run''.
3_17	0.0	Meanwhile, Pippig's contract with Nike expired in December and has not been renewed.
3_18	0.0	(``Given that she's not racing and not able to actually compete, there is no reason to sit down and discuss a contract at this point,'' said Dave Mingey, a company spokesman, who nonetheless added, ``We of course stand by Uta until her appeal process has been exhausted'').
3_19	0.0	She is paying her own legal fees, and already has lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in appearance fees and likely prize money.
3_20	0.0	And, there is no immediate end in sight.
3_21	0.0	Six months after the suspension was handed down, the commission in Germany that is investigating her case still has not set a hearing date.
3_22	0.18181818181818182	If found guilty, the three-time Boston champion and two-time Olympian could be banned from competition for up to two years.
3_23	0.0	``I am very often asking my people what is going on,'' said Helmut Digel, president of the German federation, the Deutscher Leichtathletik Verband, ``because this situation is for both parties not a good one.
3_24	0.0	It is very important the period of suspension shouldn't last too long''.
3_25	0.0	The delays may be due to questions about both science and procedure.
3_26	0.0	As in the nearly three-year-old Mary Slaney case, it is unclear whether the test is even valid in women.
3_27	0.04	(Slaney was cleared by a USA Track &AMP; Field panel of a similar doping violation, and filed a lawsuit last Tuesday against the United States Olympic Committee and the International Amateur Athletic Federation, charging negligence in handling the case).
3_28	0.0	In Pippig's case, matters have been complicated by an unexplained switch in her two urine samples.
3_29	0.15384615384615385	For years, rumors have swirled inside the running community about Pippig's high training mileage and rapid recovery after races; a training routine some fellow runners in Boulder, where she now lives, viewed as excessively private; and her East German background.
3_30	0.0	But until last fall, Pippig never had failed any of the dozens of drug tests in her career.
3_31	0.0	(She does acknowledge that, while still living in East Germany in 1984, she briefly took ``some kind of drug'' that her trainer told her was vitamins, but stopped within a few weeks after her parents, both physicians, investigated and told her to stop).
3_32	0.0	``I think it's kind of a sad thing,'' Pippig said of the accusations.
3_33	0.0	``But I feel sorry for them.
3_34	0.0	People who say this can be jealous''.
3_35	0.0	The test Pippig did fail, which showed an abnormal ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone in her urine, is by no means universally trusted.
3_36	0.3888888888888889	The accepted ratio of testosterone, the male sex hormone, to epitestosterone, an inactive metabolite that is used as a marker, is 6 to 1; anything above that is considered to indicate the possible use of testosterone as a performance-enhancing anabolic steroid.
3_37	0.0	But because the test cannot distinguish naturally produced testosterone from ingested testosterone, even a high ratio is no guarantee an athlete has taken testosterone or androstenedione, the latter used by Mark McGwire and legal in baseball but banned by the IAAF.
3_38	0.0	At the same time, a ratio up to 10 to 1 still is considered to be in a gray area.
3_39	0.0	According to Pippig, not only was her ratio 9.2 to 1, but the abnormality was not due to high testosterone but rather to low epitestosterone, perhaps resulting from a number of conditions specific to gender and health issues that she has been battling since her epic run in 1996.
3_40	0.0	``I'm skeptical about the validity of the test, especially in women,'' said Dr.
3_41	0.2	Robert Barbieri, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who has sent a letter to the German federation on Pippig's behalf.
3_42	0.1111111111111111	``This test has been most widely used in male athletes, and then it's been applied to females kind of by analogy.
3_43	0.0	In my mind, when we finally work out the details we will abandon it as a test for women''.
3_44	0.0	Especially in question, Barbieri believes, are the effects on the t/e ratio of oral contraceptives _ which Pippig was taking at the time _ and medical conditions involving the bowel, through which the hormones are cycled.
3_45	0.0	Pippig was hospitalized for tests after the episode during the 1996 Marathon, and said that intestinal problems, including diarrhea, and a severe hormone imbalance persisted even up to the time of the drug test last April.
3_46	0.0	``It's obvious I had a lot of problems with my intestinal tract during the last years,'' she said.
3_47	0.0	In Pippig's case, questions of procedure also have arisen.
3_48	0.0	When urine is collected for testing, samples are placed in two bottles, marked ``A'' and ``B,'' and then placed into containers also marked ``A'' and ``B''.
3_49	0.0	After her test last April 23, said Pippig, she placed the correct bottles into the matching containers herself, and then she, her coach and companion Dieter Hogen, and the test controller all signed to confirm the protocol was done correctly.
3_50	0.0	But when the ``A'' container was opened April 29 in a German laboratory, said Pippig, the ``B'' sample was found inside, leaking.
3_51	0.0	``The federation said, `It must have been you,' '' said Pippig.
3_52	0.0	``But. . . when a controller comes you do everything very clear and slow.
3_53	0.0	Six eyes who look to the same bottle, the same container, the same paper . . . '' ``There was no mistake in our home,'' insisted Hogen.
3_54	0.0	And none by the federation, insisted Digel.
3_55	0.0	``We got the information that the test was positive, and that is why we made our decision to suspend,'' he said.
3_56	0.0	``We are not responsible for the collection of the sample, not responsible for the containers, not responsible for the transportation''.
3_57	0.0	If mistakes were made in the lab, Digel said, it is the lab's responsibility, not the federation's.
3_58	0.0	Where does this leave Pippig?
3_59	0.0	``If this (the reversal of the samples and the subsequent testing of them in the wrong order, according to international rules) is fact, it would be very hard to prosecute this case,'' said Dr.
3_60	0.0	Gary I.
3_61	0.0	Wadler, an associate professor of medicine at New York University School of Medicine and lead author of the textbook ``Drugs and the Athlete''.
3_62	0.0	``If all these things can be proved, case closed''.
3_63	0.0	Yet the case is not yet closed, and so at noon Monday Pippig will be on TV rather than the starting line.
3_64	0.0	Still, she remains optimistic.
3_65	0.0	``The evidence shows I'm not guilty,'' she said.
3_66	0.0	``I will run again.
3_67	0.0	Nothing will change for me.''
4_0	0.0	WINNIPEG, Canada, August 7 (Xinhua) --The human aspect should be taken into account when dealing with the doping incident, Jose Joaquin Puello, president of the 14th Pan Am Games Organization Committee said Saturday.
4_1	0.07894736842105263	At a press conference which was meant to showcase Santo Domingo of the Dominican Republic, the city to host the next Pan American Games in four years, Puello went out of his way to comment on the doping incident invovling a Dominican athlete who had won the women's high jump gold medal before testing positive at the Winnipeg Pan Am Games.
4_2	0.11764705882352941	The 20-year-old high jumper Juana Rosario Arrendel was stripped of the Pan Am gold medal four days ago after she tested positive for steroid.
4_3	0.0	"Athletes are not machines.
4_4	0.0	They are human beings, and every human makes mistake, " Puello said.
4_5	0.0	"The importance is not to avoid making mistakes, but to acknowledge that you made mistakes".
4_6	0.0	Puello went on emotionally appealing the world athletics governing body, International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF), to be merciful when considering sanctioning Arrendel, who was called by him as "an athlete who yet to reach her summit".
4_7	0.0	"Juana should be allowed to continue her athletic life, " he said".
4_8	0.0	She is a great athlete, a great woman, completely clean in every aspect of her life".
4_9	0.0	The media also has an important role to play, he said, they should protect her instead of crucifying her.
4_10	0.0	Arrendel took what was called "Ben substance" to post a personal best jump of 1.93 meters to grab the country's sole gold medal since the beginning of the Games.
4_11	0.0	"It is painful to see such a young athlete make such a big mistake," Dr.

5_6	0.0	``I gave up thinking anything might happen''.
5_7	0.0	Hope was restored last year when Gottschalt received a call from Michael Lehner, a German lawyer who specializes in doping-related lawsuits.
5_8	0.0	Lehner brought the criminal case against Kipke, and with the public prosecutor helped try it.
5_9	0.3	Lehner represented Gottschalt in this trial, along with eight other female swimmers who, he said, also had children with birth defects.
5_10	0.0	Having read files kept by the swimming federation, Lehner learned that Gottschalt was a member of the B group of swimmers, young hopefuls who, according to the Stasi files, were to receive ``supporting means'' to improve their performance.
5_11	0.4	``Supporting means'' was code for the drug Oral-Turinabol, an anabolic steroid manufactured in East Germany.
5_12	0.0	Lehner embarked on a search for other former swimmers who had also been administered the little blue pills and who would be willing to testify.
5_13	0.0	Court cases involving doping to that point had involved only swimmers from programs in the former East Berlin.
5_14	0.0	Lehner widened the scope and found former members of teams in Magdeburg, Erfurt, Potsdam, Chemnitz, Halle, Rostock, Leipzig and Dresden who had been similarly doped.
5_15	0.0	Lehner spoke to Ute Krause, also a product of the Magdeburg program, and found that her experiences were nearly identical to Gottschalt's.
5_16	0.0	After Krause left the swimming school in 1981, her voice was deeper, she had liver problems and she battled depression.
5_17	0.0	Years later, as the administrator of a nursing home in Magdeburg, Krause learned more about Oral-Turinabol.

14_1	0.0	Favored to become the host city for the 2008 Summer Games, Beijing is apparently being extremely careful to avoid another doping scandal like those that tarnished the accomplishments of its swimmers in recent years.
14_2	0.0	There has also been skepticism about the stunning achievements of China's distance runners in the early 1990s.
14_3	0.0	It was not known whether the other 33 withdrawals were related to drugs, Sydney Olympic officials stressed.
14_4	0.0	Milton Cockburn, a spokesman for the Sydney Olympic Organizing Committee, said the withdrawals came after a request that countries pare down their teams or find other housing because the 10,400 available beds could not accommodate every athlete in the Olympic village.
14_5	0.0	The withdrawal of the seven rowers appears to indicate that the implementation of blood-testing procedures for the first time at these Sydney Games is having some deterrent effect on athletes in endurance sports who may look to cheat by illicitly trying to increase their oxygen-carrying capacity.
14_6	0.04	The International Olympic Committee last week approved testing for erythropoietin, or EPO, a synthetic version of a naturally-occurring hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells and is believed to be widely used in such endurance sports as distance running, cycling, swimming and rowing.

14_16	0.0	Privately, IOC scientists say they are concerned about whether the tests will withstand legal scrutiny.

14_19	0.0	Liu Jianyong, secretary general of the Chinese rowing federation, said the rowers had withdrawn to ``protect their health'' _ a euphemism used in drug cases _ and to ``uphold the fairness of the Olympics''.

16_0	0.0	LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ When the International Olympic Committee gathers today, the debate will shift from bribery and graft to the spreading scourge of performance-enhancing drugs.
16_1	0.0	The three-day world summit on doping, a bid to squash yet another scandal that threatens to turn off corporate sponsors, follows a string of headlines since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
16_2	0.3157894736842105	The most damaging came from the Berlin trials of former East German doctors and coaches who harrowingly detailed administering male hormones to young female athletes _ none of whom tested positive in subsequent Olympic competitions _ and from French authorities raiding two cycling teams participating in the Tour de France race last summer and confiscating hundreds of doses of drugs.
16_3	0.0	The IOC's ethical standards have been questioned because of mounting evidence that some members might have accepted gifts in exchange for votes on Olympic bid cities.
16_4	0.0	And there is some doubt whether the doping conference is a legitimate avenue for reform or a desperate public relations stunt to cover past failings.
16_5	0.4375	``You would have to be pretty rah-rah about the IOC to believe drug-testing is working,'' said Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor and author of ``Anabolic Steroids in Sport and Exercise''.

16_16	0.26666666666666666	He had to be reminded by Prince Alexandre de Merode, head of the IOC Medical Commission, that all of the drugs listed had harmful side effects.
16_17	0.0	Just before the 1998 Winter Olympics, Samaranch pledged $50 million for an IOC anti-doping campaign that never got off the ground.
16_18	0.0	This week, he is expected to produce plans to establish an international doping agency and to commit $25 million to anti-doping research, while attempting to bring the various sports federations together on a uniform penalty system for doping offenders.

16_20	0.0	``(The conference) is basically to cover up, to divert attention,'' Helmick said.
16_21	0.0	Samaranch suggested that de Merode, who oversees the IOC's flawed system, head the new effort, raising doubts about the independence of the agency.
16_22	0.0	On Monday, such powerful sports federations as soccer (FIFA) and swimming (FINA) opposed an IOC proposal that athletes face life bans and fines of as much as up to $1 million in serious cases of ``intentional doping,'' along with selective bans for some first-time offenders.

20_1	0.0	One reason is the possible long-term benefits for the patients.
20_2	0.0	But the other is that the trials may serve as a reminder of whom the drugs were not intended for: healthy people who use them in ways that can destroy their health.
20_3	0.2222222222222222	The trials, reported last week, found that taking anabolic steroids helped kidney dialysis patients and people with HIV regain some of the weight they had been losing uncontrollably as a result of their illnesses.
20_4	0.0	Dr. Gary Wadler, an anabolic-steroid authority at New York University Medical Center, points out that the first widespread use of the drug came after World War II for people who were wasting away from illnesses or injuries suffered in the war or in concentration camps.
20_5	0.0	It was for these people, the very sick, that steroids were developed, he said, not for healthy athletes seeking to build bigger muscles to improve their athletic performance.
20_6	0.0	The latter include baseball's new home-run king, Mark McGwire, who says he regularly takes androstenedione, a precursor steroid that quickly becomes anabolic once taken into the body.
20_7	0.0	Professional baseball, unlike other sports, has not banned this substance.
20_8	0.2	Medical experts say athletes frequently take anabolic steroids in doses high enough to have dangerous consequences, with some users known to have taken 10 to 100 times the recommended dosage.
20_9	0.4375	These steroids are synthesized from human testosterone, the hormone responsible for male characteristics like increased muscle tissue, facial hair and a deep voice.
20_10	0.0	Testosterone's effect as a muscle builder was discovered more than 100 years ago by the French physician Charles-Edouard Brown-Sequard, who in 1889 injected animal extracts into a dog and then into himself.

20_12	0.0	``Brown-Sequard overinterpreted what was happening, but he turned out to be onto something, as history has shown,'' Wadler said.
20_13	0.0	The synthetic forms of testosterone were designed to replace the body's normal supply of the hormone, which can be depleted by disease, and to help the patient regain strength, Wadler said in ``Drugs and the Athlete'' (Oxford Press), regarded as the definitive textbook on the subject.

20_23	0.0	But they pointed out that the doses used by the athletes were much higher.
20_24	0.0	Weighing medical uses against the uses to enhance athletic performance, those who take steroids must ask: What is a safe dose and when does a dose become dangerous?

20_26	0.1111111111111111	In the meantime, Wadler said, all science really knows on the subject is this: It has been found safe to increase the amount of testosterone or testosterone substitute to the normal level among sick people whose supply has become depleted.

21_0	0.0	SEATTLE _ Mark McGwire's record-setting home run race made 1998 a banner year for baseball and sports in general.
21_1	0.0	But it also made it a banner year for an issue far more serious and potentially devastating: athletes using performance-enhancing substances to build bigger and stronger bodies.
21_2	0.22727272727272727	McGwire's admission that he used two supplements, creatine and androstenedione or ``andro,'' suddenly put new light on a decades-old battle to stem the use of anabolic steroids and other so-called ergogenic aids in athletic competition.
21_3	0.0	With McGwire's admission has come a new set of concerns: (BBOX)That more young athletes will attempt to use supplements as a way of improving performance, fitness and recovery from injuries, instead of building body strength naturally.
21_4	0.0	(BBOX)That the supplements will be lumped together and considered to be medically sound simply because they are available over the counter or via mail order.
21_5	0.0	(BBOX)That policies such as the University of Washington's to administer creatine to athletes might some day create great liability if medical complications are found in the future.
21_6	0.3333333333333333	(BBOX)That while creatine is considered medically safe, andro is considered to be an anabolic steroid that can lead to several potentially life-threatening diseases.
21_7	0.0	Linking the two and using both without proper medical supervision could prove dangerous.
21_8	0.0	While McGwire will go down in the history books as the unqualified home run champion for a single season, other athletes who used similar substances last year faced far different repercussions.
21_9	0.21052631578947367	Most recently, Petr Korda was forced to forfeit his rankings points and $94,529 in prize money from Wimbledon after the International Tennis Federation found he tested positive for an anabolic steroid.
21_10	0.0	His attempt to defend his 1998 Australian Open title ended over the weekend, but his appearance stirred controversy among his fellow players, who question how Korda could have been allowed to compete.
21_11	0.0	Despite warnings from the medical community and ethical questions about unfair competition, athletes like McGwire and Korda are big-name indicators that supplements have become ingrained at all levels in the world of athletics.

21_18	0.0	Supplement use appears to be starting at younger ages.
21_19	0.2857142857142857	A study published in May by the journal Pediatrics found that nearly 3 percent of boys and girls at four Massachusetts middle schools were using anabolic steroids to build bigger bodies for sports.
21_20	0.21052631578947367	``It's ubiquitous, there's no doubt about that,'' said Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor of health and human development who has written a book on the subject, ``The Steroids Game''.
21_21	0.0	McGwire's admitted use makes him ``a very poor role model for kids, and he can argue that it's legal to buy in society, but that's merely a loophole in the laws.
21_22	0.0	He can say anything he wants, but it's a drug''.
21_23	0.043478260869565216	Patrick Olsen, president of the Washington Vocational Sports Medicine Association and the head athletic trainer at South Kitsap High School, has seen the problem first-hand and believes McGwire's admission has only clouded the issue.
21_24	0.0	``Anyone who wants to be good at whatever they do has some sort of a hero.

21_27	0.0	They fail to realize that you can buy arsenic too, but you wouldn't want to use it''.
21_28	0.0	The issue becomes all the more confusing to the average young athlete because creatine and andro are two entirely different supplements.
21_29	0.09090909090909091	Creatine is an amino acid powder found naturally in skeletal muscle, heart, brain, testes and other tissues.
21_30	0.1	It is classified as a dietary supplement that enhances muscle growth and weight gain, and not a drug.
21_31	0.0	``Creatine is acceptable, and it does enhance performance,'' Yesalis said.
21_32	0.0	``Although, if you could get the proper dose of creatine in the food supply, why would anybody pay for it?
21_33	0.0	It will cost you $40 to $50 a month''.
21_34	0.2857142857142857	Andro, on the other hand, is considered an anabolic steroid because taken as a pill it raises the level of the male hormone testosterone, and users claim it builds muscle mass and helps speed recovery from sports-related injuries.
21_35	0.0	Because it is still available at many vitamin stores, mail-order businesses and Internet suppliers, andro is not considered an illegal substance by major league baseball or the NBA, which ban only illegal drugs.
21_36	0.0	Because of the controversy surrounding McGwire's use of andro, baseball commissioner Bud Selig and players union head Donald Fehr have appointed a committee to study whether it should be banned, but the committee has yet to reach a conclusion.
21_37	0.0	Andro, however, already has been banned by the International Olympic Committee, the NCAA and the ATP tennis tour, and the NFL has banned its use since 1996, primarily because it can be classified with other steroids.
21_38	0.2	While the method of taking the steroid is far different from the injections athletes once used, many experts believe the basic health repercussions are the same: excessive acne, shrinkage of the testicles or uterus, and potentially life-threatening ailments such as liver damage, premature heart disease and cancer.
21_39	0.0	While McGwire can set the home run record using andro, other athletes haven't been so lucky.
21_40	0.0	Gold medal shot-putter Randy Barnes, the world-record holder, drew a lifetime ban last year for testing positive for andro.
21_41	0.0	And in September, Pittsburgh Steelers offensive tackle Paul Wiggins was suspended for four games after admitting he used the substance.
21_42	0.08333333333333333	Use of creatine, however, hasn't yet been banned by any sports organization, although there is plenty of debate about its effects and potential long-term health risks.
21_43	0.0	``Some of our athletes have been using creatine for three years or so,'' South Kitsap's Olsen said.
21_44	0.0	``It's not something we supply, it's not something we tell our kids they have to be on.
21_45	0.0	They go out to their own people and do their own thing on it''.
21_46	0.36363636363636365	Creatine currently is the supplement of choice for body building, primarily because it is not an anabolic steroid and because so many athletes endorse its use.
21_47	0.0	At the University of Washington, strength and conditioning coach Rick Huegli said creatine has been dispensed to many athletes under his direct supervision, with little or no apparent ill effects.
21_48	0.0	``It enhances the short-term burst energy system,'' Huegli said, adding that most of the benefit comes during weightlifting training, rather than in on-field performance.
21_49	0.0	Huegli advises athletes to begin a program of better nutrition and training without the use of supplements before trying anything like creatine.
21_50	0.0	But he says athletes will always be tempted to use supplements because it ``helps them recover better and train longer and harder''.
21_51	0.0	In the past, Huegli said the UW would dispense a one-month supply of creatine to any athlete who wanted to use it, but the school has recently discontinued the practice for fear of liability should an athlete develop a medical problem in the future.
21_52	0.0	Athletes now must buy their own supply.
21_53	0.0	It's not hard to find young athletes who have used creatine.
21_54	0.16666666666666666	One high school football player, Brian, of Mountlake Terrace, said he began using the supplement last year in an attempt to build more muscle mass and help him during offseason weight training.
21_55	0.0	He learned about creatine from other players who were using it on a regular basis.
21_56	0.0	But after experiencing some weight gain, he soon decided that the expense wasn't worth the results he was seeing.
21_57	0.0	``I just felt that it was better to do it naturally,'' he said.
21_58	0.05	Another high school football player, a 17-year-old from Edmonds, still uses creatine and says he grew from 167 pounds to 190 pounds in about six months after using the supplement and increasing his workouts.
21_59	0.0	``It doesn't work unless you also work harder, but it helps you work harder,'' he said.
21_60	0.4	The medical jury still is out on creatine, but it appears to be far safer than an anabolic steroid or a product such as andro.
21_61	0.0	However, there are few studies on its effects on adolescents, and none on long-term effects.
21_62	0.14285714285714285	``It's very difficult to separate fact from hype when it comes to creatine,'' said Juhn of UW's sports medicine clinic.
21_63	0.0	``Creatine has some potential, but people have this underlying assumption that it works for everything, but it doesn't''.
21_64	0.19047619047619047	For example, it doesn't help sprinters or distance people in track or swimming, said Juhn, who recently published a study on potential side effects of creatine in the Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine.
21_65	0.0	Juhn says the weight gain associated with creatine is largely due to water storage.
21_66	0.0	``The big issue is, in the long-term, does creatine improve strength?
21_67	0.0	That's up for debate right now,'' he said.
21_68	0.0	With concern being voiced by doctors such as Juhn, trainers like Olsen are all the more wary of its potential for abuse.
21_69	0.0	``There's no long-term study done on creatine, so you have no information from 10 years out,'' Olsen said.
21_70	0.0	From the information he has seen, Olsen believes there are several reasons to beware of the supplement: dehydration, possible kidney problems and cost.
21_71	0.0	He reports some young athletes spend hundreds of dollars on the product with minimal results.
21_72	0.0	Compared to andro or other steroids, creatine ``is probably the least harmful, but in 10 years you might have some kid who took three or four times the normal dose and find it was overworking the kidneys or something like that,'' Olsen said.
21_73	0.0	``If you get a symptom such as kidney failure 15 years down the road, how do you relate that back to their creatine use''?
21_74	0.0	There have been some benefits, Olsen said, noting some athletes have gained 10 to 15 pounds in weight and muscle mass.
21_75	0.0	``But once they get off of it, they lose maybe half that weight,'' he said.
21_76	0.0	``It takes so much water to digest that protein''.
21_77	0.0	Juhn notes that creatine is found not only in muscles, but in the brain, the heart, the liver and testicles.
21_78	0.0	``We haven't really studied what taking oral levels of creatine does to creatine levels elsewhere,'' he said.
21_79	0.0	``I'm saying we don't know.
21_80	0.0	... For all we know, creatine might be the safest thing in the world, but we haven't proven that''.
21_81	0.0	Olsen says he doesn't know of any of his athletes who are currently taking andro, but he's convinced that many kids are trying it.
21_82	0.0	``I bet if you talk to kids, most would say they're not scared by it,'' he said.
21_83	0.0	``It's the idea, would you trade a gold medal if you could only live five years?
21_84	0.0	Yeah, give me the gold medal''.
21_85	0.0	Yesalis believes there will always be some new product on the market that will attract athletes.
21_86	0.0	One is human growth hormone, which is used as an ergogenic supplement by body builders and has such a short half-life it is nearly impossible to detect by standard drug-testing methods.
21_87	0.0	Yesalis contends that many athletes who use creatine or andro do so to mask their hidden use of human growth hormone to build even bigger bodies.
21_88	0.0	``Some athletes have been using creatine and andro as a smokescreen for their use of other more potent supplements,'' he said.
21_89	0.0	With so many athletes using such products, there might be no way to turn back the tide short of drug testing at every level of athletics.
21_90	0.0	``I'm disturbed by the emphasis put on supplements when we should be thinking about the most proven method of enhancing athletic performance, which is dedication, perseverance, hard work and practice,'' Juhn said.

23_1	0.125	Siham Hanifi will lose her gold in the women's 200 meters and Morocco will also have to give up another gold it won in the 400-meter relay because Hanifi was part of the team, said Reda Kazem, the head of the Arab Games Doping Committee.
