0_1	2.0	George W.
0_2	0.4375	Bush's ``compassionate conservatism,'' an appeals court blocked a mentally ill killer's execution Tuesday just four hours before he was to die.
0_3	0.0	The Republican presidential candidate had said he was unlikely to postpone the execution of Larry Robison, who killed five people, including an 11-year-old boy and a lover who was beheaded, stabbed 49 times and sexually mutilated.
0_4	0.0	Robison, 42, said recently he was ``like a little kid at Christmas'' looking forward to his lethal injection.
0_5	0.36363636363636365	His lawyers, relatives and capital-punishment opponents contended he was mentally ill and deserved treatment rather than death.
0_6	0.045454545454545456	In a 5-4 ruling, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court, blocked Robison's execution and sent the question of whether he is mentally competent back to the trial court.
0_7	0.0	State and federal courts had rejected other appeals challenging Robison's competency.
0_8	0.0	The decision effectively put the execution off for weeks, if not months.
0_9	0.0	Prosecutors said Robison will be examined by psychiatrists selected by his attorneys and state lawyers and the findings will be presented to a trial judge in Fort Worth, who then will rule on the prisoner's competence.
0_10	0.0	Heather Browne, a spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general, said it was unclear whether the state could or would appeal the decision.
0_11	0.46153846153846156	The Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that mentally ill people could be executed as long as they understood the punishment and why they were getting it.
0_12	0.0	In a concurring opinion to Tuesday's order, Judge Tom Price wrote that because Robison ``has long suffered from schizophrenia, he does not understand the nature of the punishment to be imposed upon him''.
0_13	0.3333333333333333	The decision at least temporarily kept Bush from having to address calls from capital punishment opponents who demanded the governor, who has defined himself as a ``compassionate conservative,'' give Robison a 30-day reprieve.

0_15	0.1111111111111111	Moffitt, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, wrote in a letter.
0_16	0.2608695652173913	Bush, who was criticized for mocking executed killer Karla Faye Tucker in a recent interview published in Talk magazine, has never issued a reprieve in nearly five years as governor -- a span that has seen 98 executions in Texas.
0_17	0.9230769230769231	Last week, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted 17-0 against recommending that Robison's sentence be commuted to life.
0_18	0.6	That meant that Bush could do no more than grant Robison a 30-day reprieve to allow him more time to appeal.
0_19	0.0	Bush, however, indicated he was unlikely to delay Robison's execution.
0_20	0.0	He had no immediate comment after the court ruling Tuesday.
0_21	0.0	Bill Clinton found himself in a similar situation just weeks before the 1992 New Hampshire primary, when as governor of Arkansas he allowed a brain-damaged cop killer to be executed.
0_22	0.0	At the time, some political observers said Clinton's decision to deny the man clemency helped him distance himself from the Democrats' liberal, soft-on-crime image.
0_23	0.0	Robison, a former construction worker, was to be the fifth Texas inmate to receive lethal injection this month and the 21st this year.
0_24	0.0	Another execution is set for Wednesday evening.
0_25	0.0	``I feel like a little kid at Christmas waiting for Santa Claus to come,'' Robison said in a recent interview.
0_26	0.0	``I don't believe in death.
0_27	0.0	I'm just leaving this vehicle behind.
0_28	0.0	I'm moving on to new territory''.
0_29	0.0	Robison admitted he killed five people in neighboring cottages near Lake Worth in 1982.
0_30	0.0	One of the victims was Rickey Lee Bryant, 31, Robison's lover and roommate, who was shot twice in the head, decapitated, slashed eight times and stabbed.
0_31	0.0	Robison said he ate the man's testicles.
0_32	0.7	His case was considered by many critics an example of the problems with the state's treatment of the mentally ill.
0_33	0.0	Before the killings, Robison had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, but he was not considered violent and had been released from several public hospitals.
0_34	0.1111111111111111	He pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, but a jury convicted him and sentenced him to death.
1_0	0.6666666666666666	There have been questions all along about the depth and seriousness of George W.
1_1	0.3333333333333333	Bush. They have been brought into sharp focus now by a surprising issue: the way the death penalty is administered in Texas.
1_2	0.0	In his comments on that subject Bush has defined himself, unforgettably, as shallow and callous.
1_3	0.5	In his five years as governor of Texas, the state has executed 131 prisoners _ far more than any other state.
1_4	0.625	Bush has lately granted a stay of execution for the first time, for a DNA test.
1_5	0.14285714285714285	In answer to questions about that record, Bush has repeatedly said that he has no qualms.
1_6	0.06666666666666667	``I'm confident,'' he said last February, ``that every person that has been put to death in Texas under my watch has been guilty of the crime charged, and has had full access to the courts''.
1_7	0.36363636363636365	That defense of the record ignores many notorious examples of unfairness in Texas death penalty cases.
1_8	0.0	Lawyers have been under the influence of cocaine during the trial, or been drunk or asleep.
1_9	0.0	One court dismissed a complaint about a lawyer who slept through a trial with the comment that courts are not ``obligated to either constantly monitor trial counsel's wakefulness or endeavor to wake counsel should he fall asleep''.
1_10	0.5333333333333333	This past week The Chicago Tribune published a compelling report on an investigation of all 131 death cases in Bush's time.
1_11	0.0	It made chilling reading.
1_12	0.4666666666666667	In one-third of those cases, the report showed, the lawyer who represented the death penalty defendant at trial or on appeal had been or was later disbarred or otherwise sanctioned.
1_13	0.0	In 40 cases the lawyers presented no evidence at all or only one witness at the sentencing phase of the trial.
1_14	0.0	In 29 cases, the prosecution used testimony from a psychiatrist who _ based on a hypothetical question about the defendant's past _ predicted he would commit future violence.
1_15	0.1	Most of those psychiatrists testified without having examined the defendant: a practice condemned professionally as unethical.
1_16	0.06666666666666667	Other witnesses included one who was temporarily released from a psychiatric ward to testify, a pathologist who had admitted faking autopsies and a judge who had been reprimanded for lying about his credentials.
1_17	0.0	Asked about the Tribune study, Bush said, ``We've adequately answered innocence or guilt'' in every case.
1_18	0.8333333333333334	The defendants, he said, ``had full access to a fair trial''.
1_19	0.0	There are two ways of understanding that comment.
1_20	0.0	Either Bush was contemptuous of the facts or, on a matter of life and death, he did not care.
1_21	0.08333333333333333	At the heart of the problem is the Texas way of providing lawyers for defendants too poor to hire their own, as most are in death cases.
1_22	0.0	There is no state system.
1_23	0.0	Judges assign lawyers _ often lawyers who have contributed to their election campaigns.
1_24	0.0	``The State of Texas is a national embarrassment in the area of indigent legal services,'' a committee of the State Bar of Texas says in a report just approved.
1_25	0.0	Again, Bush has shown no concern about this reality.
1_26	0.38461538461538464	He vetoed a bill, passed by the legislature, that would have let Texas counties set up a limited public defender program for the poor.
1_27	0.16666666666666666	Capital punishment, long favored by a majority of Americans, has become a national issue again because of concern about the fairness of its administration.
1_28	0.2857142857142857	Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, a Republican, imposed a moratorium on executions in that state after 13 men on death row were shown to be innocent.
1_29	0.16666666666666666	Pat Robertson and other conservatives have called for a national moratorium.
1_30	0.3076923076923077	The most complete study ever done of the death penalty process, by Professor James Liebman and others at Columbia University, was published the other day.
1_31	0.06666666666666667	It showed that two-thirds of death convictions or sentences were upset on appeal for such reasons as incompetent defense lawyers or prosecutors who bent the rules.
1_32	0.0	To all this George Bush is seemingly indifferent.
1_33	0.0	Or perhaps not entirely.
1_34	0.2857142857142857	If he were not running for president, it is doubtful that he would just now have granted his first stay of execution.
1_35	0.0	Next week Gary Graham, convicted of murder on the testimony of a single witness who said she saw him at night from 30 to 40 feet away, is due to be executed.
1_36	0.0	Will Bush care?
2_0	0.0	AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov.
2_1	2.0	George W.
2_2	0.36	Bush followed his parole board's advice Friday and halted Tuesday's planned execution of Henry Lee Lucas, saying that too many doubts persist about the confessed killer's guilt in the case that sent him to Death Row.
2_3	0.5833333333333334	``I take every death penalty case seriously and review each case carefully,'' Bush said in a written statement.
2_4	0.2	``The first question I ask in every case is whether there is any doubt about the individual's guilt or innocence.
2_5	0.0	``This is the first case since I have been the governor when the answer to that question is `Yes'.
2_6	0.0	'' Lucas, 61, once confessed to 600 killings.
2_7	0.0	He was scheduled to die in Huntsville for the Halloween 1979 rape and strangulation of a still-unidentified woman whose almost-nude body was found near Interstate 35 in Williamson County.
2_8	0.0	But, as in many of the slayings Lucas admitted to, evidence later emerged suggesting that the drifter was nowhere near when the crime was committed.
2_9	0.34782608695652173	Bush's decision means that the oldest inmate on Huntsville's Death Row will soon be transferred to the prison system's diagnostic center, where he will undergo psychological evaluation and other tests before being permanently reassigned.
2_10	0.0	``I can only thank them for believing the truth and having the guts to stand up for what's right,'' Lucas said in a statement released by prison officials.
2_11	0.375	Bush's decision does not give Lucas hope for regaining his freedom.
2_12	0.1	He is serving six other life sentences, and 210 years in prison for nine other murders.
2_13	0.3333333333333333	A murder charge pending in Florida could earn him the death penalty if he were to obtain parole or a pardon in Texas.
2_14	0.3333333333333333	Bush, a staunch defender of the death penalty, has not intervened in the imminent execution of inmate since taking office 3 1/2 years ago.
2_15	0.15	In February, he declined to stop the execution of Karla Faye Tucker, who professed a conversion to Christianity and publicly expressed remorse for her part in using a pickax to hack to death a couple in Houston.
2_16	0.3	Numerous religious leaders, including Pope John Paul II, called for Tucker to be spared.
2_17	0.0	Bush said he allowed the execution to go forward because she was undeniably guilty.
2_18	0.25	Tucker, who never claimed innocence, became the first woman to be executed in Texas since the Civil War.
2_19	0.0	Bush raised concerns this month about whether Lucas should be executed after former Attorney General Jim Mattox cited a 1986 investigation by his office, which showed that the condemned man was probably in Florida when the 1979 Texas murder occurred.
2_20	0.0	Mattox, a Democrat who is again running for attorney general, and Bush, a Republican, said Lucas is guilty of other crimes and should never be released from prison.
2_21	0.0	But carrying out the execution for a case in which guilt is not absolutely certain would be abhorrent, both said.
2_22	0.5625	``Governor Bush's decision will make our death penalty punishment stronger than ever,'' said Mattox, who added that police should reopen cases in which Lucas made confessions.
2_23	0.0	``But it was still politically risky, and I'd be glad to stand up and defend him against attack''.
2_24	0.23076923076923078	Bush's first rebuke came from fellow Republican John Cornyn, who is running against Mattox in the attorney general's race.
2_25	0.0625	``I have confidence both in the jury who heard this case and in the 23 (appellate) judges who reviewed the evidence,'' said Cornyn, a former Texas Supreme Court Justice.
2_26	0.0	``I believe their decision should be respected and their sentence carried out''.
2_27	0.2	A spokesman for Democrat Garry Mauro, Bush's opponent in November's election, said the governor may see some political fallout from his actions.
2_28	0.23333333333333334	``The initial downside for Bush is whether or not the Christian Coalition decides to call him a fraud because he wouldn't get involved with the parole board with Karla Faye Tucker, but he's following Jim Mattox's lead on Henry Lee Lucas,'' said Joe Cutbirth, Mauro's spokesman.
2_29	0.8	Bush's decision in the Lucas case, made public 24 hours after the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles announced its recommendation, caps one of Texas' most bizarre crime sagas.
2_30	0.0	Lucas, a drifter who had served time in Michigan for killing his mother, was arrested in Montague County, Texas, in June 1983 for being an ex-con with a weapon.
2_31	0.0	While in jail, he confessed to killing an elderly woman who had disappeared from her home in Ringgold.
2_32	0.0	He also told the sheriff that he had killed a 15-year-old girl who had hitchhiked with him on trips across the South and West.
2_33	0.0	Other confessions followed, and soon Lucas' tally of death numbered in the hundreds.

4_10	0.2857142857142857	Why, Governor Bush even took a day off the campaign trail to think about it.
4_11	0.0	Bush was certainly not stirred by any of the protests made to him about the execution of Betty Lou Beets, from abroad or at home.
4_12	0.0	And there isn't much doubt that Mrs.

4_15	0.0	It may be a matter of moral reflex rather than practical politics to denounce the way that America reaches for the needle or the switch, but sometimes, things that are easy are worth doing anyway.

14_8	0.1	Texas does, and has carried it out 19 times this year alone and officeholders such as Bush believe it has strong support among Texans.

14_11	0.4444444444444444	He also insisted that Texas sought to assure due process for all, including death row convicts.
14_12	0.0	Bush was peppered with questions from several Canadian journalists, who had traveled to Texas to cover Faulder's case.
14_13	0.6666666666666666	But he refused to be drawn into a debate over the death penalty.
14_14	0.0	He maintained his cool, prompting some observers to note that if he were in training for a presidential race, he passed an early, minor test.
14_15	0.1111111111111111	The governor's potential political future, however, is only a byproduct of the debate over Faulder.
14_16	0.3333333333333333	The relevant issue is Texas' clemency process, which once again has been challenged in a capital murder case receiving international attention.

14_20	0.13333333333333333	Without a board recommendation for commutation of the death sentence or some other form of clemency, the only option remaining for the governor was one 30-day stay, or delay, of the execution.
14_21	0.3125	Bush has never granted a stay of execution, including in the case of Karla Faye Tucker, who was put to death early this year for her part in two pickax murders in Houston.
14_22	0.0	Tucker also received tons of international publicity.
14_23	0.0	Unlike Faulder, however, Tucker didn't find a receptive court.

14_28	0.13043478260869565	One of the few cases in recent years occurred a few months ago, when the board recommended commutation of alleged serial killer Henry Lee Lucas' death sentence to life imprisonment, and Bush agreed.
14_29	0.46153846153846156	The board and the governor believed that sufficient doubt had been cast on the evidence in the only case for which Lucas received the death penalty.
14_30	0.5294117647058824	Faulder's case may result in a judicial review of Texas' clemency process, which has repeatedly been attacked by death penalty opponents as secretive and unfair.
14_31	0.3333333333333333	Bush obviously believes the parole board, which he appoints, does its job diligently and fairly and would never knowingly deny clemency to someone wrongly sentenced to death.
14_32	0.0	And his faith in the panel is probably justified.
14_33	0.0	Faulder once confessed to the murder for which he was convicted and didn't raise a claim of innocence in his clemency petition.
14_34	0.16666666666666666	But the way the board normally conducts its business in clemency decisions _ taking votes by fax machine or telephone from 18 members scattered about the state _ creates at the very least a public relations and potential political problem.
14_35	0.8	Many people will always oppose the death penalty, but regardless of how one views capital punishment, there should be more openness in the parole board's clemency procedures.
14_36	0.0	It may be impractical for all 18 members to meet in the same place to vote on every case.
14_37	0.15789473684210525	But maybe we should consider requiring board members to cast their votes _ and state their reasons for voting _ over conference call hookups, which reporters and other members of the public could monitor at a central location.

15_2	0.36363636363636365	Bush confronts yet another closely scrutinized death penalty case this week, the immediate decision before him is one that has become remarkably familiar over the course of 134 executions in Texas during his five and a half years in office: whether or not to use his limited power to halt the next one.
15_3	0.0	But now that Bush is running for president and the eyes of an entire nation are upon him as never before, he faces a second, amplified challenge.
15_4	0.0	It is to demonstrate, through the tone of his voice and the set of his jaw, that he feels the full weight of his responsibility.
15_5	0.4	And it is to show, through his bearing and his choice of words, that he comes by his steadfast position in support of the death penalty after extensive soul-searching and careful thought.
15_6	0.3333333333333333	Because of the stakes involved, the emotions it stirs and the welling questions about the fairness of its administration, the death penalty has become one of the tests of Bush's seriousness, a quality he arguably comes by less easily than his levity or spunk.
15_7	0.09523809523809523	And while there is little or no hint in public opinion surveys that his advocacy of capital punishment in itself carries political risks, there is certainly reason to believe that more than a few voters are watching, and judging, the manner in which he navigates this sensitive terrain.

15_9	0.0	``Any evidence of being perfunctory or lacking sensitivity is a problem for him, not necessarily in terms of politics but in terms of gravitas''.
15_10	0.0	The current case in question is that of Gary Graham, scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection on Thursday in Huntsville, Texas.

15_12	0.6818181818181818	Bush and his aides have said that because of the circumstances of this case specifically and the boundaries of the Texas governor's powers generally, he may have little or no discretion over Graham's fate once the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles renders its ruling on the matter this week.
15_13	0.8	If the board authorizes execution, the most the governor can typically do is grant a one-time, 30-day reprieve.

15_23	0.09523809523809523	A profile of Bush in Talk magazine last year described a scene, which the governor and his aides have said was mischaracterized, in which he mocked the last-minute clemency pleas of Karla Faye Tucker, a convicted killer whom Texas ultimately executed.
15_24	0.05	And there was a moment during a Republican presidential debate in early March when Bush laughed, perhaps somewhat nervously, when asked about a Texas lawyer who fell asleep during a trial that ended with a death sentence for his client.

15_26	0.10526315789473684	But there have been many other times when Bush, who seldom holds any private introspection up to public light, has responded to questions about capital punishment with strikingly terse answers conspicuously lifted from a well-worn script.
15_27	0.3076923076923077	Bush and his aides seem to be at least partly conscious of that and eager to cast his ruminations on death penalty cases as prolonged and profound.

16_27	0.2727272727272727	In that case, as in this one, the argument against the death penalty was not a sentimental but an evidentiary one, with questions emerging about some of the testimony and material marshaled to establish the defendants' guilt and seal the particular conviction for which he received his death sentence.

18_4	0.16666666666666666	Indeed, a Boston Globe review of the 127 Texas death penalty cases found that there was powerful proof of guilt _ uncontradicted scientific evidence, freely offered confessions, or an admission of regret just before the execution _ in nine out of 10 cases.

21_0	0.7307692307692307	AUSTIN, Texas _ Amnesty International, an anti-death penalty group that monitors abuses of justice around the world, says in a new report that Texas' secretive clemency process for condemned criminals violates minimum safeguards for human rights.
21_1	0.0	The organization usually reserves such criticism for overseas countries.
21_2	0.0	``In a jurisdiction that executes more people than any other in the Western World, Texas has turned the final safeguard of executive clemency into nothing more than an empty gesture,'' according to a report the group released Tuesday.
21_3	0.6666666666666666	Texas is one of 38 U.S. states with the death penalty.
21_4	1.1923076923076923	The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles _ which recommends to the governor whether to commute sentences to life in prison or grant temporary reprieves _ has been widely criticized in recent months for not thoroughly reviewing cases, not holding meetings and not conducting its business in public.
21_5	1.0	The board has granted clemency only once in 17 years.
21_6	0.85	Such a system, the Amnesty International report said, ``violates minimum human rights safeguards by failing to provide any genuine opportunity for death row inmates to seek and obtain the reduction of their sentences''.
21_7	0.3	Victor Rodriguez, chairman of the 18-member parole board, dismissed the criticism as unfounded and unfair.
21_8	0.8571428571428571	``Amnesty International is against the death penalty, so their conclusions are not surprising in the least,'' he said.
21_9	0.0	``The standard in this country that guides us for fairness and equity is constitutionality.

21_11	0.0	When asked about the report Tuesday, Gov.
21_12	2.0	George W.
21_13	0.7	Bush, who appoints the parole board members, said the clemency system has withstood court challenge.
21_14	0.0	``The courts have looked at it.
21_15	0.0	It's fine,'' he said.
21_16	0.0	Rodriguez said he believes the report is timed to coincide with an orchestrated protest over the scheduled June 17 execution of Joseph Stanley Faulder, twice convicted of murdering an East Texas woman during a robbery.
21_17	0.3333333333333333	The Amnesty International report noted that the U.S.
21_18	0.6	Supreme Court affirmed the need for a meaningful clemency process when it re-approved capital punishment in 1976.
21_19	0.18181818181818182	The organization contends Texas' system falls far short of what the high court had in mind.
21_20	0.0	``Far from serving as the fail-safe mechanism envisaged by the U.S.
21_21	1.0	Supreme Court, the Texas (Board of Pardons and Paroles) had become something akin to a hostile and secretive agency interested only in preserving the illusion of meaningful clemency review,'' the report said.
21_22	0.2	The report cites several cases, including Houston pickax killer Karla Faye Tucker.
21_23	0.0	She was unanimously rejected for clemency even though supporters insisted she was a born-again Christian who no longer posed a threat to society.
21_24	0.125	Although the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected her court challenge, a dissenting opinion from Judge Morris Overstreet described the clemency process as ``totally inadequate'' and ``a legal fiction at best,'' because the overwhelming majority of petitions are denied.
21_25	0.125	In a separate court challenge, Danny Lee Barber and Faulder took the board to an Austin federal court last December where testimony revealed that only a handful of 4,000 letters in support of Faulder's clemency were forwarded to board members; some board members had little or no memory of the case they had decided amid a flurry of publicity; and board members do not meet to decide cases.

21_27	0.0	Although U.S.

21_29	0.0	``A flip of the coin would be more merciful than these votes''.
21_30	0.0	Rodriguez said the criticisms are misplaced.
21_31	0.125	He said the board recently has changed its rules to give members more time to review filings and to allow convicts face-to-face meetings with board members.
21_32	0.125	Mark Warren, a coordinator in Amnesty International's Canadian section who helped compile the report, said he hopes the report's conclusions do not go unheeded.

22_3	0.7647058823529411	Supporters say Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, allows the 18-member Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to do its job freely by maintaining an arm's-length relationship.

22_11	0.12	But David Dow, a University of Houston law professor who represents condemned inmates, suggests both Bush and his Democratic predecessor, Ann Richards, have used the parole board ''as an excuse to avoid having to make a tough, moral decision''.
22_12	1.5294117647058822	In Texas, the governor can only issue a one-time, 30-day reprieve or act on a recommendation of the parole board to grant a stay, commute a sentence or issue a pardon.

22_20	0.3333333333333333	Bush never has witnessed an execution.
22_21	0.0	For the most part, he limits his role to privately quizzing his attorneys about cases, aides say.
22_22	0.20833333333333334	Unlike Richards, who met with her general counsel about executions, Bush has met with the staff lawyers who studied condemned inmates' cases, said Jim Sallans, a former staff attorney who reviewed death row cases for both governors.
22_23	0.6	Sallans left after Bush's first term.
22_24	0.16666666666666666	Bush would read the lawyer's memo -- about three to four pages -- and talk with the attorney, usually from 15 minutes to 45 minutes but perhaps up to two hours, Sallans said.
22_25	0.3333333333333333	Ultimately, Sallans said, Bush would ask: ''OK, Did he do it?
22_26	1.0	Did he get a fair trial''?
22_27	0.3333333333333333	Bush did not try to instruct the board how to vote, he said.
22_28	0.0	''That's political suicide,'' Sallans said.
22_29	0.0	Gerald Garrett, the board chairman, said Bush takes a hands-off approach with members, telling them, ''in essence, make the right decision and if there is political fallout, so be it''.
22_30	0.4444444444444444	The Texas governor does not have the power to declare a moratorium on executions, as Illinois Gov.
22_31	0.0	George Ryan, a Republican, has done.
22_32	0.4666666666666667	But some suggest Bush, if concerned about the fairness of Texas' death penalty, could use his power of persuasion to generate public support for a moratorium.
22_33	0.3333333333333333	''He could have a much higher profile in the Texas death penalty debate, if he wanted to,'' said Dow, the professor who has represented inmates.

23_2	0.21052631578947367	Yet the case also affords Bush a chance to speak in a moderate voice on the death penalty without seeming to pander, because the case involves some understandable questions of evidence that have drawn national attention.
23_3	0.07142857142857142	One aide noted that this case, like that of Henry Lee Lucas, involves a question of evidence, and the aide suggested that Bush finds this sort of factor more relevant and compelling than sentimental, emotional factors such as those involved with the decision not to grant a reprieve to Karla Faye Tucker.
23_4	0.0	In other words, this case, like that of Lucas, has questions that go directly to the matter of guilt, not of contrition.

23_7	0.6333333333333333	Bush's embrace of DNA testing for death row inmates, which he never advocated in Texas, comes as some parts of the nation have seen a rethinking of capital punishment amid concerns about the execution of innocent prisoners and polls that indicate support for the death penalty is at a 20-year low, although most Americans still favor it.

23_15	0.15789473684210525	Should DNA tests indicate that the hair and semen did not come from McGinn, that would ``raise doubts about whether he could have committed the whole crime,'' said Scheck, who added that he has ``no idea'' about the guilt or innocence of McGinn.
23_16	0.14285714285714285	Only two states, New York and Illinois, allow condemned prisoners to get new DNA tests of evidence in their cases, and Scheck said Congress should pass a bill making that standard across the nation.
