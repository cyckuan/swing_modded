0_4	0.2555305	Last week, in a special issue devoted to obesity, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a litany of bad news.
0_5	0.20509374	Americans are eating more than ever, increasing their average number of calories year by year.
0_6	0.10214764	And the percentage of adults who claim they are physically inactive remained nearly flat from 1991 to 1998, at about 29 percent.
0_7	0.10910076	The combination of more calories and little exercise yields a predictable result: Americans are getting fatter every year.
0_8	0.30414733	More than half are now overweight and nearly 18 percent are obese _ more than 30 percent above ideal body weight, according to an official medical measure of fatness.

0_10	0.12518713	Your body mass index is 4.89 times your weight in pounds divided by the square of your height in feet).
0_11	0.11667976	And obesity is not just a social stigma _ it is associated with poor health, from diabetes to heart ailments to gall bladder disease.
0_12	0.091476486	To make things worse, a hormone called leptin that was supposed to be the magic bullet for obesity, making people effortlessly lose fat while retaining muscle, looks like a bust.
0_13	0.087562013	In a preliminary study reported last week, most people who took leptin lost little or no weight _ one fat person who took the highest dose actually gained 20 pounds.
0_14	0.080902305	Medical experts disagree about where the nation goes from here.

0_17	0.090533887	And these experts say the pathway to a truly effective obesity drug is being illuminated by the very hormone, leptin, that has proved so disappointing.

0_25	0.088191214	Those who expect a pharmacological fix see the beginning of a new age of drug development that will find molecules that make fat people lose interest in eating to excess.
0_26	0.11627506	Perhaps the drugs should be reserved for those cursed with the most stubborn obesity, some researchers say, but at the very least they should help very fat people who cannot control their weight.
0_27	0.08944547	The optimism comes from work that began with the discovery of leptin, the first molecule ever found that acts on the brain as part of a natural weight control system.
0_28	0.090190301	As such, it has revealed molecular pathways that may lead to truly effective and precisely targeted weight loss drugs.

0_36	0.089505592	``I got into the field 10 years ago, when there was still this lingering idea that psychological factors and gluttony or a lack of willpower were the underlying explanations for why so many people were overweight,'' Heymsfield said.
0_37	0.087171032	``Seven or eight years ago, the first studies came out saying that genetics is very, very important, but at that point most people felt that it would be one or two decades before we went from knowing that fact to a molecular discovery''.
0_38	0.087832496	With the discovery of leptin in 1994, Heymsfield said, ``People were shocked''.
0_39	0.090483741	That discovery came when scientists reported that leptin made genetically fat mice stop eating and become thin.
0_40	0.077087845	The next year, the hormone was found in people.
0_41	0.1011131	At first many researchers hoped that obesity would turn out to be a simple matter of a leptin deficiency: give the hormone to fat people and they will get thin.
0_42	0.099438575	But it turned out that overweight people make plenty of leptin.
0_43	0.086916621	Despite an assiduous search, scientists have found only a half-dozen people in the world whose bodies produce no leptin.
0_44	0.083802003	These people eat voraciously _ one 3-year-old girl consumed 2,000 calories at a sitting.
0_45	0.087404303	When several of these people were treated with leptin, they lost their appetites and their weight plummeted.
0_46	0.090464254	Now some experts suggest that the hormone's role is to signal the brain that there is fat on the body. nn

2_0	0.30987191	CHICAGO (AP) --Obesity is not as dangerous for elderly people as it is for the middle-aged or young adults, researchers reported today in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
2_1	0.19169565	The findings are similar to those in a study reported last year that indicated being overweight shortens life expectancy up to age 75, but does not make much of a difference afterwards unless people are extremely obese.

2_10	0.19025392	According to dietary guidelines issued by the Department of Agriculture, a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight and 30 and above is obese.

5_6	0.10787854	They pointed out that genetic factors are not to blame for oversized Americans, saying that genes can not have changed substantially in the last two generations.
5_7	0.11037429	They offered several options to prevent obesity.
5_8	0.15848741	First, obesity must be recognized as the serious public health problem.

5_10	0.096048184	Third, schools need to schedule more activity for youngsters, and children need to be encouraged to eat low-calorie, low-fat foods too.
6_0	0.15374401	A study of more than 1 million Americans provides the most convincing evidence yet that simply being overweight can cut your life short.
6_1	0.20459586	The study, the largest ever done on obesity and mortality, found that overweight people run a higher rate of premature death.
6_2	0.087517119	And this was true even among people who didn't smoke and were otherwise healthy during their middle years.
6_3	0.26830519	The study was conducted by the American Cancer Society and published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
6_4	0.10913586	It settles once and for all any lingering questions about whether weight alone increases the risk of death and disease, said Dr.

6_8	0.14446802	The study found an especially clear association between excess weight and a higher risk of dying from heart disease or cancer.
6_9	0.10942634	And unlike a similar study last year that suggested being overweight is less of a problem as people grow older, this study found many more deaths among overweight people of all ages, especially those over 75.

6_11	0.083434014	``The message is we're too fat and it's killing us.

6_18	0.08944835	``Now I'm thinking maybe this is true, and we need to figure out why''.
6_19	0.18202263	Still, Stevens and Manson said the study probably understates the risks of obesity for black women.
6_20	0.091201597	They pointed out that slender, non-smoking black women have a higher risk of death to begin with than their white counterparts, probably because they have less access to health care than white women and more undetected disease.
6_21	0.089583685	That makes it appear that weight alone doesn't play a big role in death rates among black women.

9_0	0.24902177	UNDATED - Health specialists are calling it a ``fat epidemic,'' and no wonder with the latest numbers showing that more than half of Americans are overweight and one out of three adults is obese.
9_1	0.14715421	The fat and fatter trend has initiated more research into obesity than ever, especially in light of another group of findings linking extra weight to myriad serious health problems, including heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes and even some forms of cancer.
9_2	0.19960356	``Being overweight is not just a personal problem but a genuine public health threat,'' said University of Colorado obesity researcher James O.
9_3	0.1579901	Hill in the May issue of the journal ``Science''.
9_4	0.10333279	Yet although much has been learned about obesity, it's still a medical enigma that prompts more questions than there are answers.
9_5	0.12233541	What is known: Obesity is caused by a complicated interaction of environmental and genetic factors.
9_6	0.12045096	Up until 20 years ago, obesity was considered less a disease and more the end result of gluttony and a sedentary lifestyle.
9_7	0.11840496	Consuming more calories than you burn off is still the primary factor in most cases of obesity.
9_8	0.074420232	But geneticists now are recognizing that heredity plays a salient role also.
9_9	0.21617225	Arizona has been a focal point of considerable research in the area of obesity and genetics.
9_10	0.12983551	For the past 30 years, the Gila River Pimas have agreed to participate in generational studies on obesity.
9_11	0.13769641	The Pimas, as a group, have an unusually high incidence of obesity, which also has contributed to their highest recorded rates of diabetes in the world.
9_12	0.09404776	A Gila River Pima man has an 80 percent chance of becoming diabetic before he's 55, according to Dr.

9_14	0.26308462	Obesity researcher Dr.
9_15	0.12290265	Eric Ravussin, formerly with the National Institutes of Health in the Phoenix area, has studied the Pimas, and was the focus of the February '98 ``New Yorker'' magazine article ``The Pima Paradox''.
9_16	0.078087007	He believes the Pimas' plight is tied closely to their genetic inheritance.
9_17	0.075074502	``As desert dwellers, the Pima evolved ``thrifty'' fat genes as a survival mechanism to help conserve fat during periods of famine,'' Ravussin said.
9_18	0.076099874	As long as they ate moderately and ate traditional low-fat foods of cholla-cactus buds, honey mesquite, prickly pears and tepary beans, squash and white-winged dove, their weight was kept in check during normal times.
9_19	0.082445571	But as the Pimas abandoned their traditional foods and began to eat like other Americans, and in mass quantities like other Americans, their thrifty fat genes became a liability.
9_20	0.087182986	Their new higher-fat diets were stored rather than metabolized, according to Ravussin.
9_21	0.086557309	Geneticist Murray Brilliant, a professor in the department of pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said it's not exactly clear what the Pima studies say about the non-Pima population.
9_22	0.076882754	``But, obviously, in every population there are people who have more thrifty genes than other people,'' Brilliant said.
9_23	0.090811984	``If that wasn't the case, then everybody who ate the same thing would be the same weight''.
9_24	0.11455718	There's also overwhelming evidence that obesity is linked to hormonal irregularities.
9_25	0.12974559	Obesity specialist Dr.
9_26	0.086128823	Donald Robertson of the Southwest Bariatric Nutrition Center in Scottsdale, Ariz.
9_27	0.082960437	, said the consensus among researchers is that a fat cell is actually an endocrine organ.
9_28	0.084738527	``Like a thyroid or adrenal, it produces its own hormone, called leptin,'' Robertson said.
9_29	0.099568333	``Understanding how leptin works seems to be a key in treating obesity''.
9_30	0.07973041	It's generally believed that leptin signals the brain to stop eating, which creates the sensation of satiation, or feeling full.
9_31	0.097079177	However, this signal does not get through properly in some overweight people.
9_32	0.083906854	Consequently, scientists have tried to inject synthetic leptin, hoping this would stimulate the satiation response.
9_33	0.08264595	But preliminary findings indicate the weight-regulating hormone leptin isn't the miracle fat cure some hoped it would be.
9_34	0.073733397	Endocrinologist Dr.
9_35	0.20979619	Antonio Tataranni worked with Ravussin in Phoenix at the National Institutes of Health in the study of Pimas and obesity.
9_36	0.098924412	His work with hormone anomalies has convinced him that obesity has a physiological basis.
9_37	0.15052533	``I don't think there's any question that obesity is a disease,'' Tataranni said.
9_38	0.085612532	``It's a matter of understanding how hormones stimulate different areas of the brain''.
9_39	0.088282031	On occasion, obesity research has turned up the unexpected.
9_40	0.087173626	A London study in 1995 connected overeating with pathological behavior.
9_41	0.14534941	People who are overweight often say they don't understand their weight gain because they ``practically eat nothing at all''.
9_42	0.099720969	Yet the London study showed that people who are fat dramatically underestimate their food intake (up to 50 percent), especially the high caloric, fatty foods.
9_43	0.086795363	``We don't know if it's lying or a subconscious omission,'' said head researcher Dr.
9_44	0.10039713	Berit Heitmann.
9_45	0.13240455	In either case, researchers in the study concluded that denial further impedes chances for weight loss.
9_46	0.098526125	It's still unclear how big a role genetics and other innate factors have in the overall obesity package.
9_47	0.10855997	But Harrowe, the Pima public health officer, feels emphasizing factors we can't control does little to help Pimas or non-Pimas who are overweight.
9_48	0.09078821	``What you don't want is people developing this attitude that there's nothing they can do about it anyway,'' Harrowe said.
9_49	0.079224229	``You have to focus on lifestyle changes''.
9_50	0.096768746	Many obesity researchers agree, and believe that the fat epidemic is primarily the end result of an abhorrent culture that places inordinate emphasis on quantity.
9_51	0.34129972	``Becoming obese is a normal response to the American environment,'' said obesity researcher Hill.
9_52	0.090491751	Hill, director of the Colorado Clinical Nutrition Research Unit at the University of Colorado, puts a preponderance of blame for fat Americans on our culture: Americans have too much food available; social and work situations encourage overeating; restaurants compete by offering bigger and bigger servings; 64-ounce Big Gulps and Thirst Busters have replaced 12-ounce bottled soda; and technology has made it possible to avoid exercise.
9_53	0.10101311	Ravussin, formerly with the National Institutes of Health, agrees and has come to group these factors into what he calls the pathoenvironment.
9_54	0.09372617	``Obviously, if the Pimas' environment had not changed so drastically, they would not be in their current condition,'' Ravussin said.
9_55	0.073352854	``But the same can be said for non-Pimas.
9_56	0.086420024	Getting food was hard work until 100 years ago.
9_57	0.093848294	Now, it's available in abundance without any activity required to obtain it''.
9_58	0.09013975	Robertson, of the Southwest Bariatric Nutrition Center, said he'd like to see our culture put more emphasis on physical activity and education on nutrition rather than see who can come up with the largest soft drink under a buck.
9_59	0.1047182	He said he'd also like restaurants to be more responsible in the portions they serve.
9_60	0.089752726	``You go to some restaurants and order what you think is a normal meal and you get enough for three people,'' Robertson said.
9_61	0.095921425	``It's obscene.
9_62	0.11069933	My wife and I now routinely order one entree and split it''.
9_63	0.11346447	If nothing else, obesity specialists want the public to snap out of it and wake up to the serious health risks associated with being overweight.
9_64	0.091822279	Science, they remind us, has yet to find a magic pill that cuts weight gain without unhealthful side effects, and many researchers believe that any such drug will have to be combined with diet and exercise anyway.

12_0	0.20526783	BOSTON _ Years of emphasizing exercise and healthier diets have done little to stem the growing epidemic of obesity in the United States, with more than 20 percent of adults and up to 15 percent of children now considered obese, a top US health official said Friday.
12_1	0.25079827	Preventing obesity is one of the most important public health issues facing the nation today, yet the best way to attack this mounting problem has not been devised, said Dr.

12_5	0.14210726	The next major problem is how to turn obesity in the other direction,'' said Dietz at a conference sponsored by the Massachusetts Public Health Association.
12_6	0.16021714	Considering that obesity and related health problems consume about 6 percent of the national health care budget, as estimated by one recent Harvard study, ``not to do anything about obesity and physical inactivity is very expensive,'' Dietz said.
12_7	0.090538423	To indicate the intractability of the problem, Dietz and other speakers at the conference Friday cited numerous studies and statistics showing the ease with which Americans put on the pounds and the difficulty in shedding them.
12_8	0.082572422	Between 1963 and 1994, for instance, the average weight of 10-year-old boys and girls increased by about 3.5 pounds, as a result of an extra 1.1 calories per child per day on average being consumed over that time period, according to statistics that Dietz has calculated but not yet published.
12_9	0.090282661	The most startling increase is for the 35-year-old woman, who gained an average of 18.6 pounds between 1980 and 1994 as a result of an extra 12.7 calories per day being consumed over that time period.
12_10	0.099571817	A 35-year-old man gained an average 5.4 pounds in that period, by consuming an average of an extra 3.7 calories per day, according to Dietz's calculations, which are based on complex formulas including average expenditures through physical activity.
12_11	0.092223195	To put the additional calories per day in perspective, a banana provides about 80 calories.
12_12	0.12741798	In an effort to help focus the nation on the need to prevent obesity, particularly among children, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plan to unveil early next year the first revision in the growth charts for children in nearly 20 years, adding a body-mass index to the traditional weight and height measurements, according to Dietz.
12_13	0.1475435	The body-mass index, or BMI, has been considered a better measurement of obesity in adults than the traditional weight and height charts.
12_14	0.091956188	The growth charts, a staple of pediatricians' offices and parents concerned about how their children compare to others of the same age, will allow the plotting of a child's BMI against that of other children of the same age.

14_0	0.15151361	WASHINGTON (AP) --Obese women are six times more likely than thin women to have a silent, smoldering inflammation inside their arteries that may increase their already high risk of developing heart disease, researchers said Tuesday.

14_2	0.17045243	Being overweight is an automatic warning sign for heart disease: The fatter people are, the more likely they are to have high cholesterol and clogged arteries, high blood pressure, diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors.
14_3	0.07514141	But no one knew if those extra pounds could cause yet another risk: low-grade inflammation inside a person's arteries.
14_4	0.092994573	In otherwise seemingly healthy people, scientists recently discovered that this low-grade inflammation can simmer for years and significantly increase a person's risk of a heart attack or stroke.

14_6	0.10235974	One theory has been that it might be bacteria, and indeed, some research suggests that antibiotics may help fight heart disease.
14_7	0.079112203	On the other hand, doctors already frequently prescribe aspirin to certain people at high risk of heart attacks because it thins their blood --and aspirin also reduces inflammation.
14_8	0.079127926	Dutch scientist Marjolein Visser knew that fat cells themselves can produce a substance called interleukin-6 that causes inflammation when it seeps into the bloodstream.
14_9	0.092372733	So she studied whether obesity could be another culprit, using a U.S. database of 16,000 Americans.
14_10	0.079806655	The only way to measure this ``micro-inflammation'' is using a blood test that detects C-reactive protein, or CRP.

14_12	0.084893333	But lower levels, between 0.2 milligrams and 1 mg per deciliter of blood, are the ones that signal the simmering inflammation that has scientists concerned.
14_13	0.11385624	Visser discovered that obese women are six times more likely to have this low-grade inflammation than normal-weight people.
14_14	0.12291838	Obese men were twice as likely to have it, a gender difference Visser couldn't explain, except to say that women in the study were much more overweight than men studied.
14_15	0.087708766	``We were surprised'' the risk was so high, Visser said Tuesday, before presenting her findings at a biology meeting here.

14_18	0.090945336	She found equal risk when examining only healthy people under age 40.

14_24	0.0866586	First, Visser is preparing to see whether losing weight causes CRP levels to drop immediately.
14_25	0.091704814	Her findings, however, raise the question of whether aspirin or any of the dozens of other anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen, could help obese people ward off heart disease, and she cautions that nobody has tested that yet.

15_6	0.10190346	NIH says all those risks apply to people with excessive abdominal fat - meaning a waist circumference of more than 40 inches in men and more than 35 inches in women - and people with a body mass index of 25 or more.
15_7	0.12100708	Someone with a body mass index of 30 or more, the level considered obese, is about 30 pounds overweight - roughly 221 pounds in a 6-foot person or 186 pounds in a 5-foot-6 person.

16_23	0.080223532	Until that time, however, doctors and their patients will have to give up the idea of turning overweight people into sleek hard bodies and settle for more modest and attainable weight loss, experts said.

19_0	0.2140412	CHICAGO (AP) --Obesity is not as dangerous for elderly people as it is for the middle-aged or young adults, according to a new study.
19_1	0.1943514	The findings are similar to those of a study reported last year that indicated being overweight shortens life expectancy up to age 75, but does not make much of a difference afterwards unless people are extremely obese.
19_2	0.25777859	``The absolute risk of dying gets higher and higher as you get older until you die, but the importance of obesity as a risk factor decreases,'' said Ralf Bender, an obesity researcher at the University of Bielefeld in Germany and principal author of the study published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.

19_8	0.13415886	Body mass index, or BMI, is increasingly becoming the standard way of talking about obesity, since it is an easy way to compare the girth of people of different heights.
19_9	0.11516791	BMI is body fat in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
19_10	0.19025392	According to dietary guidelines issued by the Department of Agriculture, a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight and 30 and above is obese.
19_11	0.14098098	Researchers found that the mortality risk for a really obese person --with a BMI of 40 or more -- was highest for those age 30 or younger.
19_12	0.12983599	Moderately obese men and women --with a BMI between 32 and 40 -- who were age 50 or older had the lowest mortality risk, the study says.
19_13	0.18390873	Some researchers not involved with the study argued that BMI is a limited measure of obesity in the elderly because bone density declines with age.

21_15	0.085164002	Doctors long believed the disease occurred only during middle age or later.
21_16	0.094533165	Although there have not been any national surveys documenting the rise of this form of diabetes in children, several small-scale studies have found that such cases have more than tripled in the last five years, and, anecdotally, doctors across the country say they have observed similar trends among their own patients.
21_17	0.20640081	In the last month, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a meeting to discuss the problem, and the American Diabetes Association has appointed a new task force.

21_34	0.097842408	Researchers speculate that the rise in reported cases of Type 2 diabetes in children results from both an increased incidence of the disease and an increased awareness of it by primary-care physicians.
21_35	0.077654166	Until the last few years, Goland said, the correct diagnosis was likely to have been missed in some children.
21_36	0.12506924	Diabetes, which affects about 16 million Americans and is the sixth-leading cause of death by disease in the United States, results from a breakdown in the body's system for absorbing sugar.

21_39	0.085678382	In Type 2, or adult-onset diabetes, the pancreas produces insulin, but the organs grow increasingly resistant to it.
21_40	0.1116279	Many people erroneously believe it to be a more benign form of the disease because it can occur in the body for years without symptoms.

22_0	0.09202172	ATLANTA _ It's official: We're fat _ all over America, and particularly in Georgia.
22_1	0.37305076	More than half of all adults in the United States _ 54.9 percent _ are now overweight or obese, according to research being published today by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
22_2	0.21728899	And of all the states surveyed each year by the Atlanta-based agency, Georgia has had the most dramatic increase in the percent of adults who are obese, CDC said.
22_3	0.13949591	From 1991 to 1998, the proportion of Georgians who are at least 30 pounds over their ideal body weight doubled.
22_4	0.19833314	That means, according to state public health experts, that almost 900,000 Georgians are so overweight that they have gravely increased their risks of heart disease, gallbladder disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and high blood pressure.
22_5	0.13158936	Nationally, overweight and obesity have increased so dramatically, and will prove so costly to the health care system as the population ages, that they should be combatted as intensely as smoking has been, the CDC's director said Tuesday.
22_6	0.19357977	``Obesity is a serious health condition, and it is occurring at an epidemic level,'' Dr.
22_7	0.078536198	Jeffrey Koplan said.
22_8	0.10613269	``Overweight and physical inactivity account for more than 300,000 premature deaths each year, second only to tobacco-related deaths''.
22_9	0.084076827	Excess weight is increasing as rapidly in the population as an infectious disease might spread, and should be treated as seriously as an epidemic, Koplan said.
22_10	0.17647919	He presented new research by CDC scientists at a Los Angeles conference hosted by the American Medical Association.
22_11	0.3536925	The Journal of the American Medical Association publishes a special issue today devoted to obesity and overweight.
22_12	0.072136684	The problem is particularly acute in Georgia.
22_13	0.1784906	Although rates of obesity increased in 33 states between 1991 and 1998, they rose the most in Georgia, according to CDC's research.
22_14	0.10378807	In 1991, 9.2 percent of the state's adults were obese; in 1998, 18.2 percent were.
22_15	0.11716077	``We are aware that obesity and overweight have been increasing in Georgia over the past 10 to 15 years,'' said Dr.
22_16	0.10725913	Kenneth Powell, an epidemiologist with the state Division of Public Health.
22_17	0.092507819	``We're also aware that the proportion of Georgians who get no regular physical activity has been increasing every year, probably 2 percent every year for the past 15 years.
22_18	0.12085344	The combination of eating too much and not getting enough physical activity sends our overweight and obesity levels up''.
22_19	0.085306739	A statewide information campaign titled ``Take Charge of Your Health'' has been in preparation for two years and is scheduled to debut in November with billboards, public service announcements and community forums, according to Alice Trainer in the state's Office of Nutrition and Physical Activity.
22_20	0.08977648	The campaign will urge residents to ``Take five a day, take down fat, take action'' _ that is, increase fruits and vegetable servings to five a day, reduce fat in the diet and get regular exercise.
22_21	0.17678379	Researchers evaluate overweight and obesity using a measure called body mass index (BMI), which divides weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters.
22_22	0.16340831	BMIs of 30 and above are considered obese.
22_23	0.27404129	BMIs of 25 to 29.9 are considered to be overweight.
22_24	0.11384263	Last year, the National Institutes of Health set the standard for overweight lower _ in effect, reclassifying as overweight an additional 29 million Americans.
22_25	0.10269935	Under the old guidelines, men with a BMI of 28 and women with a BMI of 27 were considered overweight.
22_26	0.11171304	The conclusions by researchers from CDC and from Tufts University near Boston were based on two national telephone surveys conducted by the CDC: the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which surveys up to 100,000 American adults each year, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which talked to more than 33,000 Americans between 1988 and 1994.
22_27	0.18622098	The researchers found: _ Almost 55 percent of U.S. adults are overweight or obese, compared to 43 percent in 1962.
22_28	0.090680092	(Both percentages reflect the new weight guidelines; researchers recalculated weight data gathered over the past 30 years to make sure they were delivering an apples-to-apples comparison.

22_30	0.18476172	_ Rates of obesity are rising fastest among young adults, college graduates and Hispanics.
22_31	0.092283984	_ If the trend of putting on weight cannot be reversed, the side-effects of overweight will become the greatest single cost on the U.S. health care system.
22_32	0.088111417	To reverse the trend, CDC's Koplan called for an information and prevention campaign with as much funding and energy as the nation has directed against tobacco in recent years.
22_33	0.10641493	``Both smoking and excess weight are risk factors for serious diseases, and both have behavioral components,'' he said.
22_34	0.088716245	``For both, we have to be very careful not to blame the victims of these conditions.
22_35	0.090109203	(But) it wasn't that long ago that smoking was considered a social issue, not a health issue.
22_36	0.11836225	Similarly, we need to move our society's concept of obesity from a cosmetic issue to a health issue''.
22_37	0.10512832	There is some good news on the weight front, according to JAMA.
22_38	0.090772719	Researchers reported that leptin, a hormone whose influence on weight loss made front-page news when it was discovered in mice in 1995, shows signs of working equally well in humans.
22_39	0.11610227	According to researchers from St.
22_40	0.09715984	Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York, both lean and obese subjects who were injected with leptin lost significant amounts of weight during the trial of the hormone, compared to other participants injected with an inert placebo.
22_41	0.094854702	Moreover, the longer the study went on, the more weight the 100 participants lost.
22_42	0.088448285	The weight lost was almost entirely fat, as opposed to muscle tissue.
22_43	0.10746502	There appeared to be no adverse effects on major organs in the body over the 24 weeks of the study, which was partially supported by Amgen, Inc.

23_0	0.13529978	An assortment of mice with mutant genes may be leading researchers toward the elusive goal of obesity treatments that are safe, effective and don't call for the will power of a Spartan.
23_1	0.094363537	In just a half-dozen years, scientists have captured a handful of genes that help regulate body weight in rodents, and which could point the way toward new drugs that can help people keep their poundage down while still filling up with food they like.
23_2	0.11312527	With obesity so rampant and traditional dieting such a bust, many scientists now believe the answer to obesity will emerge from work going on at a frantic pace _ and amid much secrecy _ in biotech companies that are homing in on genetic checkpoints in the body's weight control system.
23_3	0.096553254	While emphasizing that human obesity stems from a combination of genes and environment _ like America's abundance of tasty, fatty foods _ the biotech scientists believe that genes involved in weight regulation are the most promising targets of anti-obesity measures.
23_4	0.084094648	``I don't believe that social engineering (behavior change) is going to work'' to stem the soaring obesity epidemic, says David West, a genetics researcher at Parke-Davis Laboratories in Alamedia, Calif.
23_5	0.076489791	``We've been trying to change peoples' dietary habits for years and years, but we all like high-fat food, and our work style is such that many of us have sedentary jobs''.
23_6	0.091435439	Conventional diet drugs have had only modest effects in helping people lose weight and keep it off.
23_7	0.083968654	What's more promising, say West and other gene scientists _ are drugs targeted to specific genetic switches in the body's metabolic machine that keeps weight and energy in balance.
23_8	0.074015306	Such ``magic bullet'' therapies are a long way off, but the investment of money and scientific energy is enormous.
23_9	0.079809021	``It is quite a race,'' says Louis Tartaglia, a scientist at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a Cambridge biotech company heavily invested in obesity gene research.
23_10	0.075056622	Last week, Millennium scientists reported they had cloned a mutant gene in mice that enabled them to remain svelte even when eating a high-fat diet that makes normal mice corpulent.
23_11	0.075539424	The mutant gene, called mahogany, makes a protein that's involved in cell-to-cell signaling that helps determine how much fat the body stores.
23_12	0.076711015	The discovery brings to over a dozen the number of genes scientists have discovered over the last five years that influence an animal's weight-gaining tendencies.
23_13	0.086344075	It's not known exactly how the mutated mahogany gene protects the mice against diet-induced obesity.
23_14	0.091432581	But researchers are confident they will in time be able to trace the different biochemical pathways involved in weight control, and hope to be able to manipulate the genes or proteins that are turning out to be the important regulatory devices in this system.
23_15	0.086482358	``Because the desired effect is obtained when the mahogany gene is defective, we are optimistic about using the protein for obesity drug development,'' Dr.
23_16	0.082928128	Karen Moore, Millennium's director of genetic systems said when making the announcement last week.
23_17	0.092891978	``In developing a drug, it is always easier to decrease gene function rather than to try to increase it, The discovery of genes like mahogany stir excitement in the obesity research field.
23_18	0.086947655	Not only does it suggest that similar genes in humans may explain why some people eat all they want and stay thin, but it raises the prospect that such genes might provide clues leading to designer drugs for obesity that wouldn't require the person to go on a hard-to-maintain diet.
23_19	0.090071727	Even if counterparts exist in humans, however, it won't be that simple to pick apart the human weight control system.
23_20	0.098816449	``The majority of people are not defective in any one gene that would explain their obesity,'' says Tartaglia, the Millennium scientist.
23_21	0.088965628	More likely, he says, is that human weight is governed by a large number of genes, each one of which has only a modest effect, in combination with environmental factors.
23_22	0.12710976	The stakes are enormous, both in terms of improving the nation's health _ some 55 percent, or 97 million _ of Americans are overweight and obese _ but also gathering profits for biotech and pharmaceutical companies.
23_23	0.095476533	This new chapter in the age-old battle against overweight was touched off in 1994 when Jeffrey Friedman and colleagues at New York's Rockefeller University identified the protein made by a gene, called ob, which is mutant in a strain of mice that tend to be obese.
23_24	0.092730833	The protein, dubbed leptin, helps regulate weight and food intake by signaling the brain to create a ``full'' feeling in th person.
23_25	0.097728815	Researchers were quick to hypothesize that some, or perhaps many, obese people have too little leptin in their bodies and their brains fail to signal them to stop eating.
23_26	0.09862263	So, the reasoning went, give extra leptin to overweight people to curb their appetite and cause them to lose weight.
23_27	0.086834754	A leptin compound manufactured by Amgen, Inc.
23_28	0.10353694	, in California, was the first of the new gene-based drugs to go into clinical trials.
23_29	0.088023995	Reportedly the results have been disappointing, although the compound has worked for some of the volunteers.
23_30	0.099646234	Moreover, it's been found that most obese people actually have plenty of leptin: it may be that the problem is that the leptin signal isn't getting to the right receiving station.
23_31	0.08896212	Since the leptin gene discovery, scientists have found a number of other mouse strains with gene mutations affecting their weight and energy balance.
23_32	0.088444819	Each of these gene alterations provide clues to how mammals' weight is controlled, but none has led to a drug so far.
23_33	0.1145734	Still, the discovery of the ob gene was ``a real breakthrough, because it got people thinking about obesity as a disease,'' says Judith Stern, a professor of nutrition and internal medicine at the University of California in Davis.
23_34	0.081647167	How long until effective new weight control drugs reach the market is anybody's guess.
23_35	0.085289273	``We don't know the final chapter _ we're just learning about the puzzle'' of weight regulation, says Stern.
23_36	0.090218863	However, she says, ``we can't wait until we identify all the genes _ we have to do something now'' about the obesity epidemic.
23_37	0.11474536	Stern, a founder of the American Obesity Association, an advocacy group, says top health leaders like the surgeon general should make obesity a high priority for research and public policy.
23_38	0.096129498	Whether the biotech rush for gene-based obesity drugs yields dramatic results soon or not, says Stern, ``it's giving the disease of obesity some respect and allowing us to have a bit of compassion'' for the overweight.
24_0	0.23437503	LOS ANGELES, October 11 (Xinhua) --Two studies published this month in U.S. medical journals quantify for the first time the substantial health risks of obesity.
24_1	0.10825225	Both studies examined the individual risks and the benefits that even a modest amount of weight loss can confer for patients.
24_2	0.2853326	Obesity is increasingly being viewed as a chronic disease by medical professionals and has been established by the American Heart Association as a major, modifiable risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States.
24_3	0.097112978	Approximately 300,000 deaths a year are attributed to obesity.
24_4	0.081589662	According to Policy Analysis Inc.
24_5	0.11915484	, a health economic research firm, obesity increases the risk of several major diseases and that it costs the U.S. healthcare system as much as 50 billion dollars annually.
24_6	0.21549335	The studies are based on data relating to a person's degree of obesity to their risks of five major diseases --coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol.
24_7	0.15606796	In these studies, obesity was measured in terms of body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters.
24_8	0.10886433	The first study, published in Monday's issue of Archives of Internal Medicine, reports that persons with high BMIs have higher lifetime risks of obesity-related diseases.
24_9	0.12391194	For example, men 45-54 years of age who are moderately obese ( BMI of 32kg/m2) have more than twice the lifetime risk of developing high blood pressure of non-obese men (BMI of 22.5 kg/m2) of the same age, and almost three times the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
24_10	0.17896322	Risks are even greater among those who are severely obese.
24_11	0.22814142	Published in the October issue of the American Journal of Public Health, the other study examined the health and economic benefits of sustained moderate weight loss of 10 percent among persons who are overweight or obese.
24_12	0.094157301	The researchers reported that moderate weight loss would substantially reduce the expected number of years of life that people would have hypertension, type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
24_13	0.08482941	The likelihood of developing coronary heart disease was estimated to be reduced by 12 to 38 cases per 1,000 persons, and that of stroke by one to 13 cases per 1,000.
