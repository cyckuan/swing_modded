0_0	0.22116238	BOSTON _ Years of emphasizing exercise and healthier diets have done little to stem the growing epidemic of obesity in the United States, with more than 20 percent of adults and up to 15 percent of children now considered obese, a top US health official said Friday.
0_1	0.2543165	Preventing obesity is one of the most important public health issues facing the nation today, yet the best way to attack this mounting problem has not been devised, said Dr.
0_2	0.05608169	William H.
0_3	0.34950711	Dietz, director of the Division of Nutrition and Physical Activity for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
0_4	0.049684933	``We're on our way to solving the tobacco problem.
0_5	0.1519666	The next major problem is how to turn obesity in the other direction,'' said Dietz at a conference sponsored by the Massachusetts Public Health Association.
0_6	0.16797053	Considering that obesity and related health problems consume about 6 percent of the national health care budget, as estimated by one recent Harvard study, ``not to do anything about obesity and physical inactivity is very expensive,'' Dietz said.
0_7	0.10075987	To indicate the intractability of the problem, Dietz and other speakers at the conference Friday cited numerous studies and statistics showing the ease with which Americans put on the pounds and the difficulty in shedding them.
0_8	0.092223027	Between 1963 and 1994, for instance, the average weight of 10-year-old boys and girls increased by about 3.5 pounds, as a result of an extra 1.1 calories per child per day on average being consumed over that time period, according to statistics that Dietz has calculated but not yet published.
0_9	0.098648659	The most startling increase is for the 35-year-old woman, who gained an average of 18.6 pounds between 1980 and 1994 as a result of an extra 12.7 calories per day being consumed over that time period.
0_10	0.10837326	A 35-year-old man gained an average 5.4 pounds in that period, by consuming an average of an extra 3.7 calories per day, according to Dietz's calculations, which are based on complex formulas including average expenditures through physical activity.
0_11	0.094071466	To put the additional calories per day in perspective, a banana provides about 80 calories.
0_12	0.14160569	In an effort to help focus the nation on the need to prevent obesity, particularly among children, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plan to unveil early next year the first revision in the growth charts for children in nearly 20 years, adding a body-mass index to the traditional weight and height measurements, according to Dietz.
0_13	0.15366345	The body-mass index, or BMI, has been considered a better measurement of obesity in adults than the traditional weight and height charts.
0_14	0.09890493	The growth charts, a staple of pediatricians' offices and parents concerned about how their children compare to others of the same age, will allow the plotting of a child's BMI against that of other children of the same age.
0_15	0.082594464	``That's a big deal,'' Dietz said.
0_16	0.26081202	In Massachusetts, as elsewhere in the nation, low-income children are at greatest risk of obesity and other nutritional problems.
0_17	0.10706667	Elizabeth Metallinos-Katsaras, director of Pediatric and Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance for the State Department of Public Health, presented 1996 data on 128,000 low-income Massachusetts children under the age of five in the government nutritional program Woman, Infants, and Children.
0_18	0.11878006	More than 25 percent of the children had low hemoglobin levels, an indication of anemia, while the percentage of children who were overweight was more than twice as high as expected, 10.5 percent.
0_19	0.12982864	Only 5 percent were expected to be overweight.
0_20	0.097484316	Preliminary 1997 figures, to be released in the next couple of months, suggest a slight decrease in the percentage of overweight children in WIC, but the numbers for low hemoglobin, short stature, and being under weight appear to be holding steady, Metallinos-Katsaras said in an interview.
1_0	0.24188879	LOS ANGELES, October 11 (Xinhua) --Two studies published this month in U.S. medical journals quantify for the first time the substantial health risks of obesity.
1_1	0.10223219	Both studies examined the individual risks and the benefits that even a modest amount of weight loss can confer for patients.
1_2	0.28532759	Obesity is increasingly being viewed as a chronic disease by medical professionals and has been established by the American Heart Association as a major, modifiable risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States.
1_3	0.13181352	Approximately 300,000 deaths a year are attributed to obesity.
1_4	0.042008783	According to Policy Analysis Inc.
1_5	0.12879586	, a health economic research firm, obesity increases the risk of several major diseases and that it costs the U.S. healthcare system as much as 50 billion dollars annually.
1_6	0.22283379	The studies are based on data relating to a person's degree of obesity to their risks of five major diseases --coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol.
1_7	0.17813102	In these studies, obesity was measured in terms of body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters.
1_8	0.11821632	The first study, published in Monday's issue of Archives of Internal Medicine, reports that persons with high BMIs have higher lifetime risks of obesity-related diseases.
1_9	0.13733786	For example, men 45-54 years of age who are moderately obese ( BMI of 32kg/m2) have more than twice the lifetime risk of developing high blood pressure of non-obese men (BMI of 22.5 kg/m2) of the same age, and almost three times the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
1_10	0.14420321	Risks are even greater among those who are severely obese.
1_11	0.24446433	Published in the October issue of the American Journal of Public Health, the other study examined the health and economic benefits of sustained moderate weight loss of 10 percent among persons who are overweight or obese.
1_12	0.10697158	The researchers reported that moderate weight loss would substantially reduce the expected number of years of life that people would have hypertension, type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
1_13	0.089647075	The likelihood of developing coronary heart disease was estimated to be reduced by 12 to 38 cases per 1,000 persons, and that of stroke by one to 13 cases per 1,000.
2_0	0.26337015	LOS ANGELES, May 28 (Xinhua) --More than half of American citizens are overweight and one out of four is obese, according to the latest issue of Science.
2_1	0.099691803	"The prevalence of overweight has risen dramatically over the past two decades and, if this trend persists, the entire U.S. adult population could be overweight within a few generations," reported Dr.

2_3	0.081165874	John Peters of the Procter and Gamble Company in Cincinnati, Ohio.
2_4	0.088611178	They said the root cause is a sedentary lifestyle combined with the ready availability of tasty, calorie-and-fat-rich food.
2_5	0.10405264	"This is especially evident in the so-called fast food restaurants where super sizing of menu items is commonplace," they wrote.
2_6	0.11111034	They pointed out that genetic factors are not to blame for oversized Americans, saying that genes can not have changed substantially in the last two generations.
2_7	0.11886346	They offered several options to prevent obesity.
2_8	0.12704694	First, obesity must be recognized as the serious public health problem.
2_9	0.10069149	Second, consumers must be educated to eat foods low in fat, such as fruit, vegetables and whole grains in restaurants and grocery stores.
2_10	0.108536	Third, schools need to schedule more activity for youngsters, and children need to be encouraged to eat low-calorie, low-fat foods too.
3_0	0.055956882	TRENTON, N.J.
3_1	0.26662115	(AP) - Some 97 million American adults, or 55 percent, are considered overweight or obese.
3_2	0.25159328	According to the National Institutes of Health, this epidemic of obesity, which is also a growing problem among children, costs nearly $100 billion annually.
3_3	0.11479349	That includes costs for weight loss treatment and treatment of many serious health problems caused by obesity.
3_4	0.120225	Overweight people are at increased risk of illness from: -high blood pressure and other heart disease, -adult-onset diabetes, -stroke, -gallbladder disease, -osteoarthritis, -certain cancers, -lipid disorders, -respiratory problems and -sleep apnea, a disorder that primarily strikes overweight men, causing them to repeatedly stop breathing while sleeping.
3_5	0.086946894	Besides causing fatigue, it decreases the amount of oxygen and increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood and brain.
3_6	0.11199684	NIH says all those risks apply to people with excessive abdominal fat - meaning a waist circumference of more than 40 inches in men and more than 35 inches in women - and people with a body mass index of 25 or more.
3_7	0.13347006	Someone with a body mass index of 30 or more, the level considered obese, is about 30 pounds overweight - roughly 221 pounds in a 6-foot person or 186 pounds in a 5-foot-6 person.
4_0	0.10608189	And if we keep on eating the way we do now, by 2030 everyone in America will be obese.
4_1	0.18574426	The national epidemic of obesity is at such a crisis that it demands urgent attention by medical professionals, the government and the public.
4_2	0.13687301	That was the message repeated again and again this week by experts at the American Dietetic Association's annual meeting in Kansas City.
4_3	0.10732802	They came armed with statistics and a missionary zeal to enlist dietitians as front-line fighters in the war against obesity.
4_4	0.067669765	``We're the fattest we've ever been,'' said Sachiko Tokunaga de St.
4_5	0.24101319	Jeor, director of the nutrition research and education program at the University of Nevada.
4_6	0.24571214	``Obesity is the No.
4_7	0.22549237	1 malnutrition problem in the United States''.
4_8	0.21586395	The percentage of American adults who are overweight or obese has risen from about 43 percent in the early 1960s to about 55 percent today.
4_9	0.10205899	The average man now weighs 25 pounds more than men of his great-grandfather's generation.
4_10	0.10391265	The reasons for the obesity epidemic can be found in our culture of abundance and inactivity, said the experts on causes and treatment.
4_11	0.08568048	We live in a society in which people drive instead of walk, fast food is available 24 hours a day, children are bombarded with advertisements for junk food, and one-quarter of all the vegetables we eat are french fries.
4_12	0.069161995	``The average American, particularly children, recognizes `supersize' as a verb,'' said Yale University psychologist Kelly Brownell, referring to the term for ordering larger portions of french fries at McDonald's restaurants.
4_13	0.14534111	The health effects of obesity have been staggering.
4_14	0.11376945	The condition causes 75 percent of all diabetes cases in the United States and is responsible for half the high blood pressure cases and half the cases of abnormal cholesterol levels, according to figures cited at the meeting Wednesday.
4_15	0.136608	The cost of treating obesity-related diseases adds up to $52 billion per year, according to estimates cited by the National Institutes of Health.
4_16	0.15392305	When indirect costs of obesity, such as lost productivity, are added in, the sum approaches $100 billion.
4_17	0.089884214	In the past many doctors did not consider obesity a medical problem and left its treatment to fad diet promoters, said Louis Aronne, clinical professor of medicine at Cornell University Medical College.
4_18	0.13068711	He was one of the speakers at the Dietetic Association meeting.
4_19	0.16363648	New research on the biological basis of obesity and the urgency of the epidemic have changed their perspective, he said.
4_20	0.11368583	For example, in June the American Heart Association put obesity alongside smoking, high blood pressure and cholesterol, and sedentary lifestyle on its list of major modifiable risk factors for heart attack and coronary heart disease.
4_21	0.10254493	Obesity treatment ``has been on the fringe on the infomercials; now it's moving into prime time,'' Aronne said.
4_22	0.098256676	Dozens of diet drugs are being developed so that one day doctors will be ``capable of controlling body weight completely,'' he predicted.
4_23	0.082637923	Until that time, however, doctors and their patients will have to give up the idea of turning overweight people into sleek hard bodies and settle for more modest and attainable weight loss, experts said.
4_24	0.089883053	&LR; brk:No quick cure &LR; tx:Obesity is a chronic disease that requires regular medical treatment and a lifelong commitment by patients to control their weight.
4_25	0.080310832	People who quickly lose large amounts of weight typically gain it all back in a few years.
4_26	0.085644641	``We all tried to get (obese patients) down to skinny little people, and that's impossible,'' said John Foreyt, a psychologist at Baylor College of Medicine.
4_27	0.069252292	``Keep patient expectations realistic....None of us is in the business of cosmetics.
4_28	0.067529347	We're in the business of helping patients improve their health''.
4_29	0.084594222	Losing 10 percent of one's weight is a realistic initial goal, said F.
4_30	0.28841584	Xavier Pi-Sunyer, director of the obesity research center at St.
4_31	0.030342	Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York.
4_32	0.085423813	But even dropping five or 10 pounds can be beneficial.
4_33	0.091241408	``A small and achievable weight loss can have a major impact on health risks,'' said Pi-Sunyer.
4_34	0.11786849	Pi-Sunyer was chairman of a federal panel of experts that issued guidelines in June on the diagnosis and treatment of obesity.
4_35	0.22021103	According to the panel, people are considered overweight if their body mass indexes, a comparison of weight to height, are 25 or over.
4_36	0.1406931	Anyone with an index of 30 or higher is considered obese.
4_37	0.066455154	For example, a person who is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 164 pounds has an index of 25.
4_38	0.082338074	If that person weighs 197 pounds, the index is 30.
4_39	0.090829547	The report recommends that moderately overweight people should at least try to stabilize their weight.
4_40	0.11504296	If they have other medical conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes, they should lose weight.
4_41	0.13467054	For obese people, the report said, weight loss is essential.
4_42	0.094367396	Between the ages of 20 and 60, we gain an average of half a pound per year.
4_43	0.094742713	But being overweight is afflicting people of all ages.
4_44	0.14020085	Sixty percent of overweight children have a medical complication such as elevated cholesterol, triglycerides or insulin levels, a new study shows, said William Dietz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
4_45	0.099136611	Children have been losing opportunities for physical activity because their parents are less likely to let them walk to school, and schools are less likely to emphasize physical education, Dietz said.
4_46	0.14025892	The more television children watch, the more likely they are to be obese, Dietz said.
4_47	0.098992526	And the TV-obesity relationship has grown stronger in the last 20 years.
4_48	0.14358966	The elderly also are joining the ranks of the obese in greater numbers.
4_49	0.085862952	``When many people think of elderly persons, they think of tiny, frail people,'' said Gordon Jensen, associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University.
4_50	0.056981236	``They're actually frail, big people''.
4_51	0.11282994	Jensen is conducting research on more than 12,500 elderly residents of rural Pennsylvania, about one third of whom are obese.
4_52	0.091591614	He has found that as their weight goes up, so does the likelihood that the person has trouble walking or climbing stairs, or even getting into and out of a car.
4_53	0.082833826	These elderly, he said, ``are often trapped in their homes, can't bathe themselves, can't dress themselves''.
4_54	0.13354596	People who are obese in old age tended to be overweight and sedentary in middle age as well and continued gaining weight into their 50s and 60s, Jensen said.
4_55	0.058638342	That doesn't bode well for the future, he said.
4_56	0.097483741	``Guess who's right behind them?
4_57	0.089553182	The baby boomers.
4_58	0.15619061	We're going to be looking at greater and greater numbers of obese elderly people,'' Jensen said.
4_59	0.13463	``Vast numbers of older persons are going to suffer the consequences of obesity''.
4_60	0.085616733	&LR; brk:Often overlooked &LR; tx:Just as the overweight often face social discrimination, they also are slighted by government and by private health plans when they seek medical help for their condition, said Judith Stern, a nutrition professor at the University of California at Davis.
4_61	0.15512989	The National Institutes of Health spends $100 million per year on obesity research, she said.
4_62	0.092252211	But that amount is dwarfed by the $1 billion spent on cardiovascular disease research and the $2 billion spent on cancer research.
4_63	0.08485889	Insurance companies often will not cover obesity treatment, she said.
4_64	0.095486486	In many cases doctors helping a patient lose weight may have to seek reimbursement by treating the patient's obesity-related diseases.
4_65	0.09273541	Medicare and Medicaid do not cover obesity treatment, Stern said.
4_66	0.092355011	The armed services do not offer treatment for obesity, but the condition can lead to a less-than-honorable discharge, she said.
4_67	0.094754739	Obesity treatment is one of just two categories of medical care the Internal Revenue Service has ruled ineligible for tax deductions, Stern said.
4_68	0.084533161	The other category is cosmetic plastic surgery.
4_69	0.10448848	But however much medical treatment becomes available to individual patients, it won't stop the obesity epidemic, Brownell of Yale said.
4_70	0.084391455	To do that, there must be social action to change the country's ``toxic food environment,'' he said.
4_71	0.11508234	This environment has been created by a food industry that encourages people to eat too much of the wrong foods, Brownell said.
4_72	0.094359217	For example, fast food is being offered in school lunchrooms, Brownell said.
4_73	0.0690516	``Can we do anything worse in our schools?
4_74	0.069603258	This is second only to having cigarette machines in our schools,'' he said.
4_75	0.077428665	Brownell proposed changing America's eating habits by levying a tax on junk food and offering fruit and vegetables at a government subsidized discount.
4_76	0.082985131	He also called for regulating food advertising, particularly to children, the same way tobacco advertising is controlled.
4_77	0.080860025	``I don't think children should be exposed to Ronald McDonald any more than to Joe Camel,'' he said.
5_0	0.1663337	A study of more than 1 million Americans provides the most convincing evidence yet that simply being overweight can cut your life short.
5_1	0.22872838	The study, the largest ever done on obesity and mortality, found that overweight people run a higher rate of premature death.
5_2	0.078280186	And this was true even among people who didn't smoke and were otherwise healthy during their middle years.
5_3	0.27603621	The study was conducted by the American Cancer Society and published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
5_4	0.10529407	It settles once and for all any lingering questions about whether weight alone increases the risk of death and disease, said Dr.
5_5	0.06292903	JoAnn Manson, a Harvard University endocrinologist and preventive-health specialist.
5_6	0.075211639	``The evidence is now compelling and irrefutable,'' Manson said.
5_7	0.19151818	``Obesity is probably the second-leading preventable cause of death in the United States after cigarette smoking, so it is a very serious problem''.
5_8	0.13944796	The study found an especially clear association between excess weight and a higher risk of dying from heart disease or cancer.
5_9	0.11783677	And unlike a similar study last year that suggested being overweight is less of a problem as people grow older, this study found many more deaths among overweight people of all ages, especially those over 75.
5_10	0.22163092	More adults and children are overweight than ever before, with 55 percent of American adults weighing more than they should.
5_11	0.078705287	``The message is we're too fat and it's killing us.
5_12	0.11703646	We need to come up with ways as a society to eat less and exercise more,'' said American Cancer Society epidemiologist Eugenia Calle, lead author of the study.
5_13	0.091506918	Manson said: ``It's going to take a coordinated campaign to turn this around, at the community level, at the environmental level, with changes in the food industry and marketing industry, having more bike paths and sidewalks''.
5_14	0.076328064	Black women were found to be the only exceptions to the rule.
5_15	0.12901277	The study found the most obese black women did not have a significantly higher risk of premature death than slender black women.
5_16	0.091379632	That poses a fascinating scientific riddle, said June Stevens, a University of North Carolina professor of nutrition.
5_17	0.076034376	``Although I had seen this in several other studies, I wasn't ready to believe it was true,'' she said.
5_18	0.07432741	``Now I'm thinking maybe this is true, and we need to figure out why''.
5_19	0.18126226	Still, Stevens and Manson said the study probably understates the risks of obesity for black women.
5_20	0.09334483	They pointed out that slender, non-smoking black women have a higher risk of death to begin with than their white counterparts, probably because they have less access to health care than white women and more undetected disease.
5_21	0.086893172	That makes it appear that weight alone doesn't play a big role in death rates among black women.
5_22	0.084813533	``It would be really unfortunate if we became more complacent about obesity in blacks than in whites,'' Manson said.
5_23	0.16362416	The researchers studied participants in the national Cancer Prevention Study II from 1982 through 1996.
5_24	0.085455536	The average age at enrollment was 57.
5_25	0.12591578	The researchers calculated each subject's body mass index, or BMI, a ratio of weight to height, and tracked them for age and cause of death.
5_26	0.084072194	The results were adjusted for age, education, physical activity, alcohol use, marital status, use of aspirin as a blood-thinner, consumption of fats and vegetables, and use of estrogen supplements.
5_27	0.095881976	Among healthy, non-smoking white men and women and black men, the researchers found a gradually increasing risk of death beginning with a BMI of 25, which is 150 pounds for a 5-foot-5 woman and 174 pounds for a 5-foot-10 man.
5_28	0.085306985	The fattest white men, with a BMI of 40 or more --278 pounds on a 5-foot-10 frame -- were 2.58 times more likely to die than their healthiest peers, men of the same height weighing 153 to 170 pounds.
5_29	0.080324071	White women with a BMI of 40 or greater --240 pounds for a 5-foot-5 woman -- were twice as likely to die as their counterparts who weighed 132 to 148 pounds.
5_30	0.09224758	Thin men and women also had higher death rates, but it was not clear whether their low weight was a cause or an effect of disease.

6_1	0.36323644	More than half of all adults in the United States _ 54.9 percent _ are now overweight or obese, according to research being published today by scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
6_2	0.23583427	And of all the states surveyed each year by the Atlanta-based agency, Georgia has had the most dramatic increase in the percent of adults who are obese, CDC said.

6_4	0.19557151	That means, according to state public health experts, that almost 900,000 Georgians are so overweight that they have gravely increased their risks of heart disease, gallbladder disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and high blood pressure.
6_5	0.13788863	Nationally, overweight and obesity have increased so dramatically, and will prove so costly to the health care system as the population ages, that they should be combatted as intensely as smoking has been, the CDC's director said Tuesday.

6_13	0.1709784	Although rates of obesity increased in 33 states between 1991 and 1998, they rose the most in Georgia, according to CDC's research.
6_14	0.089712015	In 1991, 9.2 percent of the state's adults were obese; in 1998, 18.2 percent were.
6_15	0.1249419	``We are aware that obesity and overweight have been increasing in Georgia over the past 10 to 15 years,'' said Dr.
6_16	0.11549896	Kenneth Powell, an epidemiologist with the state Division of Public Health.
6_17	0.096093625	``We're also aware that the proportion of Georgians who get no regular physical activity has been increasing every year, probably 2 percent every year for the past 15 years.
6_18	0.11320166	The combination of eating too much and not getting enough physical activity sends our overweight and obesity levels up''.
6_19	0.092210333	A statewide information campaign titled ``Take Charge of Your Health'' has been in preparation for two years and is scheduled to debut in November with billboards, public service announcements and community forums, according to Alice Trainer in the state's Office of Nutrition and Physical Activity.
6_20	0.097488632	The campaign will urge residents to ``Take five a day, take down fat, take action'' _ that is, increase fruits and vegetable servings to five a day, reduce fat in the diet and get regular exercise.
6_21	0.17987023	Researchers evaluate overweight and obesity using a measure called body mass index (BMI), which divides weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters.
6_22	0.31899393	BMIs of 30 and above are considered obese.
6_23	0.30617022	BMIs of 25 to 29.9 are considered to be overweight.
6_24	0.1099143	Last year, the National Institutes of Health set the standard for overweight lower _ in effect, reclassifying as overweight an additional 29 million Americans.
6_25	0.10504707	Under the old guidelines, men with a BMI of 28 and women with a BMI of 27 were considered overweight.
6_26	0.11952773	The conclusions by researchers from CDC and from Tufts University near Boston were based on two national telephone surveys conducted by the CDC: the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which surveys up to 100,000 American adults each year, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which talked to more than 33,000 Americans between 1988 and 1994.
6_27	0.17423358	The researchers found: _ Almost 55 percent of U.S. adults are overweight or obese, compared to 43 percent in 1962.
6_28	0.09500994	(Both percentages reflect the new weight guidelines; researchers recalculated weight data gathered over the past 30 years to make sure they were delivering an apples-to-apples comparison.
6_29	0.18059377	) _ Almost one-fifth of all adults are now obese, defined as being more than 30 percent above ideal weight.
6_30	0.19089082	_ Rates of obesity are rising fastest among young adults, college graduates and Hispanics.
6_31	0.09727078	_ If the trend of putting on weight cannot be reversed, the side-effects of overweight will become the greatest single cost on the U.S. health care system.
6_32	0.092540742	To reverse the trend, CDC's Koplan called for an information and prevention campaign with as much funding and energy as the nation has directed against tobacco in recent years.
6_33	0.10654886	``Both smoking and excess weight are risk factors for serious diseases, and both have behavioral components,'' he said.
6_34	0.072838751	``For both, we have to be very careful not to blame the victims of these conditions.
6_35	0.084350203	(But) it wasn't that long ago that smoking was considered a social issue, not a health issue.
6_36	0.11176286	Similarly, we need to move our society's concept of obesity from a cosmetic issue to a health issue''.
6_37	0.083949338	There is some good news on the weight front, according to JAMA.
6_38	0.096029551	Researchers reported that leptin, a hormone whose influence on weight loss made front-page news when it was discovered in mice in 1995, shows signs of working equally well in humans.
6_39	0.090110754	According to researchers from St.
6_40	0.10302007	Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York, both lean and obese subjects who were injected with leptin lost significant amounts of weight during the trial of the hormone, compared to other participants injected with an inert placebo.
6_41	0.089583854	Moreover, the longer the study went on, the more weight the 100 participants lost.
6_42	0.076046162	The weight lost was almost entirely fat, as opposed to muscle tissue.
6_43	0.12187135	There appeared to be no adverse effects on major organs in the body over the 24 weeks of the study, which was partially supported by Amgen, Inc.
6_44	0.079858863	, a pharmaceutical company that synthesizes leptin.

7_0	0.1507878	An assortment of mice with mutant genes may be leading researchers toward the elusive goal of obesity treatments that are safe, effective and don't call for the will power of a Spartan.
7_1	0.10380277	In just a half-dozen years, scientists have captured a handful of genes that help regulate body weight in rodents, and which could point the way toward new drugs that can help people keep their poundage down while still filling up with food they like.
7_2	0.12329827	With obesity so rampant and traditional dieting such a bust, many scientists now believe the answer to obesity will emerge from work going on at a frantic pace _ and amid much secrecy _ in biotech companies that are homing in on genetic checkpoints in the body's weight control system.
7_3	0.10539454	While emphasizing that human obesity stems from a combination of genes and environment _ like America's abundance of tasty, fatty foods _ the biotech scientists believe that genes involved in weight regulation are the most promising targets of anti-obesity measures.
7_4	0.093432041	``I don't believe that social engineering (behavior change) is going to work'' to stem the soaring obesity epidemic, says David West, a genetics researcher at Parke-Davis Laboratories in Alamedia, Calif.
7_5	0.091682328	``We've been trying to change peoples' dietary habits for years and years, but we all like high-fat food, and our work style is such that many of us have sedentary jobs''.
7_6	0.085949822	Conventional diet drugs have had only modest effects in helping people lose weight and keep it off.
7_7	0.092753718	What's more promising, say West and other gene scientists _ are drugs targeted to specific genetic switches in the body's metabolic machine that keeps weight and energy in balance.
7_8	0.074689689	Such ``magic bullet'' therapies are a long way off, but the investment of money and scientific energy is enormous.
7_9	0.090643553	``It is quite a race,'' says Louis Tartaglia, a scientist at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a Cambridge biotech company heavily invested in obesity gene research.
7_10	0.081992912	Last week, Millennium scientists reported they had cloned a mutant gene in mice that enabled them to remain svelte even when eating a high-fat diet that makes normal mice corpulent.
7_11	0.090378979	The mutant gene, called mahogany, makes a protein that's involved in cell-to-cell signaling that helps determine how much fat the body stores.
7_12	0.088070974	The discovery brings to over a dozen the number of genes scientists have discovered over the last five years that influence an animal's weight-gaining tendencies.
7_13	0.087170315	It's not known exactly how the mutated mahogany gene protects the mice against diet-induced obesity.
7_14	0.10079413	But researchers are confident they will in time be able to trace the different biochemical pathways involved in weight control, and hope to be able to manipulate the genes or proteins that are turning out to be the important regulatory devices in this system.
7_15	0.097375209	``Because the desired effect is obtained when the mahogany gene is defective, we are optimistic about using the protein for obesity drug development,'' Dr.
7_16	0.091238283	Karen Moore, Millennium's director of genetic systems said when making the announcement last week.
7_17	0.10423812	``In developing a drug, it is always easier to decrease gene function rather than to try to increase it, The discovery of genes like mahogany stir excitement in the obesity research field.
7_18	0.09321254	Not only does it suggest that similar genes in humans may explain why some people eat all they want and stay thin, but it raises the prospect that such genes might provide clues leading to designer drugs for obesity that wouldn't require the person to go on a hard-to-maintain diet.
7_19	0.08901314	Even if counterparts exist in humans, however, it won't be that simple to pick apart the human weight control system.
7_20	0.1016556	``The majority of people are not defective in any one gene that would explain their obesity,'' says Tartaglia, the Millennium scientist.
7_21	0.099934521	More likely, he says, is that human weight is governed by a large number of genes, each one of which has only a modest effect, in combination with environmental factors.
7_22	0.1314169	The stakes are enormous, both in terms of improving the nation's health _ some 55 percent, or 97 million _ of Americans are overweight and obese _ but also gathering profits for biotech and pharmaceutical companies.
7_23	0.10100495	This new chapter in the age-old battle against overweight was touched off in 1994 when Jeffrey Friedman and colleagues at New York's Rockefeller University identified the protein made by a gene, called ob, which is mutant in a strain of mice that tend to be obese.
7_24	0.10495393	The protein, dubbed leptin, helps regulate weight and food intake by signaling the brain to create a ``full'' feeling in th person.
7_25	0.11147041	Researchers were quick to hypothesize that some, or perhaps many, obese people have too little leptin in their bodies and their brains fail to signal them to stop eating.
7_26	0.10582457	So, the reasoning went, give extra leptin to overweight people to curb their appetite and cause them to lose weight.
7_27	0.088525251	A leptin compound manufactured by Amgen, Inc.
7_28	0.090435624	, in California, was the first of the new gene-based drugs to go into clinical trials.
7_29	0.072835362	Reportedly the results have been disappointing, although the compound has worked for some of the volunteers.
7_30	0.11068746	Moreover, it's been found that most obese people actually have plenty of leptin: it may be that the problem is that the leptin signal isn't getting to the right receiving station.
7_31	0.096363835	Since the leptin gene discovery, scientists have found a number of other mouse strains with gene mutations affecting their weight and energy balance.
7_32	0.084948728	Each of these gene alterations provide clues to how mammals' weight is controlled, but none has led to a drug so far.
7_33	0.12181239	Still, the discovery of the ob gene was ``a real breakthrough, because it got people thinking about obesity as a disease,'' says Judith Stern, a professor of nutrition and internal medicine at the University of California in Davis.
7_34	0.07677223	How long until effective new weight control drugs reach the market is anybody's guess.
7_35	0.089452058	``We don't know the final chapter _ we're just learning about the puzzle'' of weight regulation, says Stern.
7_36	0.092400767	However, she says, ``we can't wait until we identify all the genes _ we have to do something now'' about the obesity epidemic.
7_37	0.11568152	Stern, a founder of the American Obesity Association, an advocacy group, says top health leaders like the surgeon general should make obesity a high priority for research and public policy.
7_38	0.10368934	Whether the biotech rush for gene-based obesity drugs yields dramatic results soon or not, says Stern, ``it's giving the disease of obesity some respect and allowing us to have a bit of compassion'' for the overweight.
8_0	0.1659534	LOS ANGELES (AP) --Obesity is a U.S. epidemic that has surged in the past decade and now affects nearly one in five adults, killing some 300,000 a year, a collection of new studies suggest.
8_1	0.2829255	The studies, which will be published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association, are the latest to spread the warning that Americans are getting fatter --and that fat kills.
8_2	0.39366952	``Obesity is a major cause of mortality in the United States,'' concludes one of the surveys.
8_3	0.090944271	One study by the U.S.
8_4	0.26559712	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the number of Americans considered obese --defined as being more than 30 percent over their ideal body weight -- soared from about one in eight in 1991 to nearly one in five last year.
8_5	0.15176895	In 1991, four out of 45 participating states had obesity rates of 15 percent or higher, while the figure for 1998 was 37 states, according to the study.
8_6	0.14663597	That data, which was to be announced today at the AMA's annual Science Reporters Convention, was based on telephone surveys of more than 100,000 participants each year between 1991-98.
8_7	0.13552556	Younger adults, people with some college education and Hispanics showed the most drastic increases, but ``a steady increase was observed in all states; in both sexes; across age groups, races, educational levels; and occurred regardless of smoking status,'' the study found.
8_8	0.23434568	Overall, the population of obese men and women increased from 12 percent in 1991 to 17.9 percent last year, according to the CDC survey, which said that figure might be conservative.
8_9	0.19812688	Other recent research has found that more than 50 percent of Americans are overweight and 22 percent are obese, even though weight-loss products and services are a $33 billion-a-year industry.
8_10	0.22933496	Being overweight has been strongly associated with greater risk of certain illnesses, including heart disease, high cholesterol and blood pressure, diabetes, stroke and some cancers.
8_11	0.2053137	A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine of more than 1 million Americans concluded that obese people run a significant risk of dying early, even if they don't smoke and are otherwise healthy.
8_12	0.17778198	Another study in this week's JAMA issue on obesity --all of the studies involved Americans at least the age of 18 -- attributed an estimated average of about 280,000 deaths a year to being overweight, but said the figure could be more than 374,000 when the numbers are calculated differently.
8_13	0.090947269	The figures were adjusted for sex, age and whether the subjects smoked but did not factor in chronic disease or family histories that might indicate a predisposition to an illness.
8_14	0.14011059	An editorial accompanying the obesity issue of JAMA calls for developing a comprehensive national strategy to prevent obesity.
8_15	0.12135983	Growth in the marketing of fast food and snack food, as well as lack of exercise, are among the reasons Americans are taking in more calories than they burn, the editorial concluded.
8_16	0.089741647	``Children watch more television daily, physical education has been markedly reduced in our schools, many neighborhoods lack sidewalks for safe walking, the workplace has become increasingly automated, household chores are assisted by labor-saving machinery, and walking or bicycling has been replaced by automobile travel,'' the editorial said.
9_0	0.31764612	CHICAGO (AP) --Obesity is not as dangerous for elderly people as it is for the middle-aged or young adults, researchers reported today in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
9_1	0.20992221	The findings are similar to those in a study reported last year that indicated being overweight shortens life expectancy up to age 75, but does not make much of a difference afterwards unless people are extremely obese.
9_2	0.20621601	``The absolute risk of dying gets higher and higher as you get older until you die, but the importance of obesity as a risk factor decreases,'' said Ralf Bender, an obesity researcher at the University of Bielefeld in Germany and principal author of the latest study.
9_3	0.083823643	Other researchers said the findings are not that meaningful.
9_4	0.2713064	``Obesity is a major public health problem at any age, and this study does nothing to suggest that that has changed,'' said Dr.
9_5	0.093623767	JoAnn Manson, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School.
9_6	0.16335134	In the latest study, researchers studied 6,193 obese men and women who ranged in age from 18 to 74, following them for an average of 14.8 years.
9_7	0.13140407	The patients, who were referred to an obesity clinic between 1961 and 1994, were grouped by their age and body mass index.
9_8	0.15198731	Body mass index, or BMI, is increasingly becoming the standard way of talking about obesity, since it is an easy way to compare the girth of people of different heights.
9_9	0.11210677	BMI is body fat in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
9_10	0.20220368	According to dietary guidelines issued by the Department of Agriculture, a BMI of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight and 30 and above is obese.
9_11	0.15358886	Researchers found that the mortality risk for a really obese person --with a BMI of 40 or more -- was highest for those age 30 or younger.
9_12	0.13572259	Moderately obese men and women --with a BMI between 32 and 40 -- who were age 50 or older had the lowest mortality risk, the study says.
9_13	0.2050006	Some researchers not involved with the study argued that BMI is a limited measure of obesity in the elderly because bone density declines with age.
9_14	0.09372305	They also noted that the study participants were recruited rather than randomly selected.

10_8	0.062904071	Two culprits were suspected for the change: urban sprawl and heat.
10_9	0.078185642	Many experts in Georgia blamed the extra pounds on modern suburbs, with no sidewalks to encourage walking and long commutes forcing residents to spend hours in their cars instead of exercising.

10_14	0.24187185	In 1991, Georgia had one of the lowest obesity rates in the country.
10_15	0.11213205	Dr. William Dietz, a co-author of the CDC study, said the sprawl around Atlanta keeps people trapped in their cars for hours, encourages them to eat quick meals of greasy fast food and prevents them from having enough time to exercise.

15_1	0.23295386	Increasingly, health experts and researchers are naming the nation's penchant for large portions and ``supersizing'' as a leading cause of obesity.
15_2	0.15562382	Nearly 55 percent of Americans are overweight, a rate much higher than Asian or European nations, says Melanie Polk, a registered dietitian with the American Institute for Cancer Research, a not-for-profit organization focusing on the link between diet and cancer.
15_3	0.11544389	Although U.S. fat intake has dropped in the last 20 years from an average of 40 percent to 33 percent of calories consumed, the average daily calorie intake has risen from 1,854 to 2,002.
15_4	0.19209604	If exercise levels remain equal, that translates into a weight gain of 15 pounds a year, according to the National Institutes of Health.
15_5	0.10815557	``A major reason people are getting bigger,'' Polk says, ``is that their servings have gotten larger, and commercial food portions are a major culprit''.

15_15	0.10200065	Even in its first 60 years in America, it stayed small and close to its European cousins _ about 11/2 to two ounces.

18_5	0.20268856	It was reported in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

21_4	0.1020265	In otherwise seemingly healthy people, scientists recently discovered that this low-grade inflammation can simmer for years and significantly increase a person's risk of a heart attack or stroke.

21_6	0.095741731	One theory has been that it might be bacteria, and indeed, some research suggests that antibiotics may help fight heart disease.
21_7	0.085779537	On the other hand, doctors already frequently prescribe aspirin to certain people at high risk of heart attacks because it thins their blood --and aspirin also reduces inflammation.
21_8	0.089392162	Dutch scientist Marjolein Visser knew that fat cells themselves can produce a substance called interleukin-6 that causes inflammation when it seeps into the bloodstream.

21_10	0.07615187	The only way to measure this ``micro-inflammation'' is using a blood test that detects C-reactive protein, or CRP.

21_12	0.082307913	But lower levels, between 0.2 milligrams and 1 mg per deciliter of blood, are the ones that signal the simmering inflammation that has scientists concerned.

21_14	0.13599823	Obese men were twice as likely to have it, a gender difference Visser couldn't explain, except to say that women in the study were much more overweight than men studied.

21_25	0.094388625	Her findings, however, raise the question of whether aspirin or any of the dozens of other anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen, could help obese people ward off heart disease, and she cautions that nobody has tested that yet.

22_36	0.080978546	``I got into the field 10 years ago, when there was still this lingering idea that psychological factors and gluttony or a lack of willpower were the underlying explanations for why so many people were overweight,'' Heymsfield said.

22_39	0.099479841	That discovery came when scientists reported that leptin made genetically fat mice stop eating and become thin.
22_40	0.063931456	The next year, the hormone was found in people.
22_41	0.11471422	At first many researchers hoped that obesity would turn out to be a simple matter of a leptin deficiency: give the hormone to fat people and they will get thin.

23_0	0.16481439	LOS ANGELES, September 24 (Xinhua) --A new study released Friday shows that most California residents are choosing fast-food over more nutritious choices -- and are paying for it with soaring rates of obesity.
23_1	0.10686563	According to statistics accumulated by the California Department of Health Services, nearly half of Californians who ate out on an average day chose a fast-food restaurant, up from one- third in 1989.
23_2	0.20524452	And the number of Californians who are overweight or obese jumped 50 percent between 1984 and 1997.
23_3	0.11967596	What's more, the rate of diabetes rose 25 percent during the same period.

23_8	0.07760955	The new study is based on two surveys.
23_9	0.092397628	Dietary habits were assessed by telephone surveys conducted every other year starting in 1989, while information on weight and physical activity came from a separate yearly report conducted every year since 1984.
24_0	0.25050593	UNDATED - Health specialists are calling it a ``fat epidemic,'' and no wonder with the latest numbers showing that more than half of Americans are overweight and one out of three adults is obese.
24_1	0.14618703	The fat and fatter trend has initiated more research into obesity than ever, especially in light of another group of findings linking extra weight to myriad serious health problems, including heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes and even some forms of cancer.
24_2	0.21067506	``Being overweight is not just a personal problem but a genuine public health threat,'' said University of Colorado obesity researcher James O.
24_3	0.26844169	Hill in the May issue of the journal ``Science''.
24_4	0.09783531	Yet although much has been learned about obesity, it's still a medical enigma that prompts more questions than there are answers.
24_5	0.10756974	What is known: Obesity is caused by a complicated interaction of environmental and genetic factors.
24_6	0.13904741	Up until 20 years ago, obesity was considered less a disease and more the end result of gluttony and a sedentary lifestyle.
24_7	0.10673455	Consuming more calories than you burn off is still the primary factor in most cases of obesity.
24_8	0.059810411	But geneticists now are recognizing that heredity plays a salient role also.
24_9	0.1908995	Arizona has been a focal point of considerable research in the area of obesity and genetics.

24_14	0.21092063	Obesity researcher Dr.
24_15	0.11392414	Eric Ravussin, formerly with the National Institutes of Health in the Phoenix area, has studied the Pimas, and was the focus of the February '98 ``New Yorker'' magazine article ``The Pima Paradox''.
24_16	0.072733387	He believes the Pimas' plight is tied closely to their genetic inheritance.
24_17	0.079513491	``As desert dwellers, the Pima evolved ``thrifty'' fat genes as a survival mechanism to help conserve fat during periods of famine,'' Ravussin said.
24_18	0.079446593	As long as they ate moderately and ate traditional low-fat foods of cholla-cactus buds, honey mesquite, prickly pears and tepary beans, squash and white-winged dove, their weight was kept in check during normal times.
24_19	0.096937629	But as the Pimas abandoned their traditional foods and began to eat like other Americans, and in mass quantities like other Americans, their thrifty fat genes became a liability.
24_20	0.065368883	Their new higher-fat diets were stored rather than metabolized, according to Ravussin.
24_21	0.086014589	Geneticist Murray Brilliant, a professor in the department of pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said it's not exactly clear what the Pima studies say about the non-Pima population.
24_22	0.07679026	``But, obviously, in every population there are people who have more thrifty genes than other people,'' Brilliant said.
24_23	0.078978829	``If that wasn't the case, then everybody who ate the same thing would be the same weight''.
24_24	0.087392908	There's also overwhelming evidence that obesity is linked to hormonal irregularities.

24_26	0.062936669	Donald Robertson of the Southwest Bariatric Nutrition Center in Scottsdale, Ariz.
24_27	0.081464414	, said the consensus among researchers is that a fat cell is actually an endocrine organ.
24_28	0.095341248	``Like a thyroid or adrenal, it produces its own hormone, called leptin,'' Robertson said.
24_29	0.084207062	``Understanding how leptin works seems to be a key in treating obesity''.
24_30	0.090121156	It's generally believed that leptin signals the brain to stop eating, which creates the sensation of satiation, or feeling full.
24_31	0.074855844	However, this signal does not get through properly in some overweight people.
24_32	0.087797982	Consequently, scientists have tried to inject synthetic leptin, hoping this would stimulate the satiation response.
24_33	0.087040147	But preliminary findings indicate the weight-regulating hormone leptin isn't the miracle fat cure some hoped it would be.
24_34	-0.021575867	Endocrinologist Dr.
24_35	0.2044231	Antonio Tataranni worked with Ravussin in Phoenix at the National Institutes of Health in the study of Pimas and obesity.
24_36	0.091327246	His work with hormone anomalies has convinced him that obesity has a physiological basis.
24_37	0.12929923	``I don't think there's any question that obesity is a disease,'' Tataranni said.
24_38	0.071353754	``It's a matter of understanding how hormones stimulate different areas of the brain''.
24_39	0.095960439	On occasion, obesity research has turned up the unexpected.
24_40	0.073525118	A London study in 1995 connected overeating with pathological behavior.
24_41	0.13855871	People who are overweight often say they don't understand their weight gain because they ``practically eat nothing at all''.
24_42	0.097199052	Yet the London study showed that people who are fat dramatically underestimate their food intake (up to 50 percent), especially the high caloric, fatty foods.
24_43	0.09845015	``We don't know if it's lying or a subconscious omission,'' said head researcher Dr.
24_44	0.071982303	Berit Heitmann.
24_45	0.12834034	In either case, researchers in the study concluded that denial further impedes chances for weight loss.
24_46	0.096685856	It's still unclear how big a role genetics and other innate factors have in the overall obesity package.
24_47	0.1233546	But Harrowe, the Pima public health officer, feels emphasizing factors we can't control does little to help Pimas or non-Pimas who are overweight.
24_48	0.088028715	``What you don't want is people developing this attitude that there's nothing they can do about it anyway,'' Harrowe said.
24_49	0.057961193	``You have to focus on lifestyle changes''.
24_50	0.10785941	Many obesity researchers agree, and believe that the fat epidemic is primarily the end result of an abhorrent culture that places inordinate emphasis on quantity.
24_51	0.33068371	``Becoming obese is a normal response to the American environment,'' said obesity researcher Hill.
24_52	0.09497459	Hill, director of the Colorado Clinical Nutrition Research Unit at the University of Colorado, puts a preponderance of blame for fat Americans on our culture: Americans have too much food available; social and work situations encourage overeating; restaurants compete by offering bigger and bigger servings; 64-ounce Big Gulps and Thirst Busters have replaced 12-ounce bottled soda; and technology has made it possible to avoid exercise.
24_53	0.10262526	Ravussin, formerly with the National Institutes of Health, agrees and has come to group these factors into what he calls the pathoenvironment.
24_54	0.085780327	``Obviously, if the Pimas' environment had not changed so drastically, they would not be in their current condition,'' Ravussin said.
24_55	0.049851295	``But the same can be said for non-Pimas.
24_56	0.092338943	Getting food was hard work until 100 years ago.
24_57	0.076807441	Now, it's available in abundance without any activity required to obtain it''.
24_58	0.087622578	Robertson, of the Southwest Bariatric Nutrition Center, said he'd like to see our culture put more emphasis on physical activity and education on nutrition rather than see who can come up with the largest soft drink under a buck.
24_59	0.087311549	He said he'd also like restaurants to be more responsible in the portions they serve.
24_60	0.08569083	``You go to some restaurants and order what you think is a normal meal and you get enough for three people,'' Robertson said.
24_61	0.10560854	``It's obscene.
24_62	0.094248704	My wife and I now routinely order one entree and split it''.
24_63	0.11710918	If nothing else, obesity specialists want the public to snap out of it and wake up to the serious health risks associated with being overweight.
24_64	0.094778019	Science, they remind us, has yet to find a magic pill that cuts weight gain without unhealthful side effects, and many researchers believe that any such drug will have to be combined with diet and exercise anyway.
