0_0	0.0	ONONDAGA NATION _ Irving Powless Jr.
0_1	0.0	, the 69-year-old chief of the Onondaga Indian Nation, longs to see the day when his people enjoy economic stability and independence _ and not from the revenues of a casino or a bingo hall.
0_2	0.0	Rather, Powless, whose tribe opposes gambling, hopes that a settlement with the state of New York over ancient land claims will bring his brethren the assets they desperately need to upgrade their 7,300-acre reservation south of Syracuse.
0_3	0.0	``We have lived in this area for 1,200 years,'' said Powless, a robust man who recalls with pride when, a generation ago, he competed against football great Jim Brown in a lacrosse match and knocked the powerful All-American and Hall of Fame fullback off his feet.
0_4	0.0	``There was fresh water, fresh air, no pollution''.
0_5	0.0	Today, the Onondagas are neither financially wealthy nor land rich.
0_6	0.0	Pollution, from a dump and from a petroleum spill at a cigarette shop, has fouled the Indian territory.
0_7	0.0	``We're considered poor,'' Powless said.
0_8	0.0	``How do you measure that?...
0_9	0.0	How many homeless people do you have in your city?
0_10	0.0	We have zero''.
0_11	0.034482758620689655	Members of the tribe have a right to live on the reservation, but many survive on low-wage jobs and welfare _ the consequence of a people ``living in abject poverty'' for 200 years, according to Robert Coulter, a lawyer with the Indian Law Resource Center, a nonprofit group that is helping the Onondagas on their proposed claim.
0_12	0.07692307692307693	The Onondagas haven't yet gone to court to stake their land claim, but the nation is building a case against the state of New York that would follow suits filed by other Iroquois nations _ the Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida and Seneca _ with the federal government as co-plaintiff.
0_13	0.0	Several Indian law and history experts believe the Onondaga case would be very strong.
0_14	0.0	The tribe has identified a 10-mile-square section of Onondaga County as an area to which it lays claim.
0_15	0.0	The land includes a mile surrounding Onondaga Lake and most of Syracuse, a city of 163,000 in upstate New York.
0_16	0.0	That represents a fraction of the acreage that the Onondagas controlled more than two centuries ago.
0_17	0.0	Powless said he has been hearing about land claims since he was a boy growing up on the reservation, where his father, Irving Powless Sr.
0_18	0.0	, also served as chief.
0_19	0.0	Powless views the reservation as an island representing the hundreds of thousands of acres wrongfully taken by and poorly used by ``the Europeans'' who obtained Indian properties illegally.
0_20	0.36363636363636365	He smiles as he talks about his boyhood on the Onondaga territory, where he learned to fish, hunt and play sports.
0_21	0.0	One of the top three officers among the 14 chiefs of the Onondagas, Powless has proven to have a tough side to him.
0_22	0.0	And some Onondaga members feel Powless is too powerful.
0_23	0.14285714285714285	``No one can have anything unless you go through him,'' says Alice Thompson, 64, who lives on the reservation.
0_24	0.0	Thompson, according to Powless, was part of an insurgent group that wanted to overthrow his government.
0_25	0.0	A land-claim settlement would be a way to ease some of the tensions that remain.
0_26	0.0	It could pump up the tribal government's popularity, pay for toxic cleanups and help the Onondaga government afford better educational, cultural and social programs.
0_27	0.1	Powless said the Onondaga people want to work with the community outside the reservation to improve the economy of the region, perhaps creating tourism destinations that might include Indian culture, or setting up a free-trade zone at unused manufacturing sites.
0_28	0.0	The Onondagas say they don't intend to threaten eviction of property owners in whatever suit they file, unlike the Cayugas and Oneidas.
0_29	0.0	But they have not ruled out governmental and commercial property holders as targets for eviction.
0_30	0.0	``Maybe they should be subjected to some of the things we were subjected to _ such as taking your land away from you for 200 years,'' Powless said .
1_0	0.0	PHOENIX _ Victoria Molina wants strangers to stop complaining about her having babies on taxpayer's money and government workers to stop asking how she spends that money.
1_1	0.0	Most of all, she wants her children to stop complaining because there's only enough money for one meal a day.
1_2	0.0	Now the welfare mother knows how to make it all stop.
1_3	0.0	And it's going to start with a screwdriver.
1_4	0.0	Molina, along with seven other welfare mothers from the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Tucson, have learned to use that screwdriver to tear apart a computer and put it back together.
1_5	0.0	It's the mothers' first and frightening step in learning to compete for wealth in a system that often treats them with insult and indifference.
1_6	0.047619047619047616	It's also the first step in a welfare reform program designed by the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, the first of Arizona's 21 Native American communities to take charge of its own program to get parents from welfare to work.
1_7	0.0	White Mountain Apache community's welfare program started in April.
1_8	0.0	Tribes throughout the state and country are just beginning to take advantage of the power and money granted them by the 1996 federal welfare law to customize their own reform programs.

1_11	0.0	The Pascua Yaqui Tribe needs computer technicians, so they're training their own.
1_12	0.0	By October, some welfare parents in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa community will be attending desk top publishing or nursing courses.
1_13	0.0	On the remote Navajo Nation, where jobs and training are scarce, welfare parents could soon be asked to tend sheep or chop wood for their elders in exchange for their benefits.
1_14	0.0	``Our nation, philosophically, certainly supports the ideals of personal responsibility and self sufficiency,'' said Virgil Pablo, a director with the Navajo Nation's Social Services Department.
1_15	0.13333333333333333	``With the remoteness on the reservation and limited access to development in remote and isolated areas, we're in the best position to say what is appropriate for us,'' Pablo said.
1_16	0.0	Jorge Garcia, who designed the Yaqui program, calls the emphasis on education the basic philosophical difference between the Yaquis' program and the state-run program.
1_17	0.0	``We want to prepare parents to be a successful provider, not someone who lives on the fringes,'' said Garcia, who knows Molina and many of the mothers in her computer class know how to get a job and have supplemented their welfare income waitressing and filing.
1_18	0.0	``These people have always been on the fringes''.
1_19	0.0	Now, Garcia said, they want a career.
1_20	0.0	But if they are to succeed, Arizona Indian leaders told a U.S.
1_21	0.058823529411764705	Congressional hearing Friday that Native American governments need more flexibility, more independence and money, and a sincere effort by counties and the state to create jobs in rural areas.

1_30	0.10344827586206896	But it won't work unless scattered tribal bureaucracies learn to work with each other and with numerous state and federal agencies distributing bits and pieces of welfare funds, said Eddie Brown, Associate Dean at the Center for American Indian Studies at Washington University in St.

1_33	0.2	Native Americans living on reservations that maintain 50 percent or more unemployment are exempt from the national five-year family limit on welfare benefits.
1_34	0.0	That limit is pressuring states to move quickly with reform.
1_35	0.0	Nine Arizona tribes are exempt.
1_36	0.0	That exemption is a blessing and a curse, said Brown.
1_37	0.1111111111111111	``It's a blessing because it understands that living on a reservation is not a normal situation,'' said Brown.
1_38	1.0	Expensive problems that keep people out of work, such as drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, poor education and teen births, and lack of jobs, are more prevelent in Indian communities, he noted.
1_39	0.13333333333333333	It's a curse, he contends, because by dropping the five-year limit, the federal government all but admitted it doesn't want to pay for solving those complicated problems.
1_40	0.0	The mothers in the Pascua Yaqui computer class, among 50 parents who are in jobs or training through the tribe's welfare program, are the cream of the welfare population, young, smart, articulate and easily motivated, said Garcia, Social Service director.
1_41	0.0	He knows many parents will need more time and cost more money to prepare for work, some are older with more children and less education and more behavioral health and medical problems.
1_42	0.0	Right now, Garcia said, the community has services to help these families, but some programs, such as childcare, already have waiting lists.
1_43	0.16666666666666666	There is little money and staff to help find families who simply drop off of the welfare roles, perhaps because of drug, alcohol or domestic abuse problems _ families Garcia is unwilling to let go.
1_44	0.2222222222222222	As Indian communities across the nation struggle with short funds and a long list of problems, they are watching the Navajo Nation's legal battle with the federal government.
1_45	0.07142857142857142	Despite the power and money granted to tribes, they still remain dependent on state-run offices to determine eligibility and distribute cash benefits for their members.
1_46	0.0	The Navajo Nation wants a block grant that will give it state-like authority and funding to take over and streamline the entire welfare program, including eligibility and distribution of cash benefits.
1_47	0.0	It wants to avoid entering into agreements with the three different states its sprawling reservation covers and avoid working with three different federal regional offices.
1_48	0.0	While the Navajos continue their legal struggle, the Yaqui Tribe is implementing a gentler program than the massive one run by the state, where welfare roles have been slashed nearly in half in a little more than two years.
1_49	0.0	The Yaqui communities, where unemployment is 30 percent, are still bound by the five-year welfare limit, but they have eliminated the state-imposed 2-year welfare limit for adults and will still provide benefits to children born while parents are on welfare.
1_50	0.0	While the state program emphasizes quick job placement, the Yaquis are spending more time and money on education.

2_1	0.0	(AP) - New York acted honorably in acquiring Cayuga Indian lands two centuries ago and even took steps to protect the Iroquois tribe, a Canadian anthropologist testified Wednesday.
2_2	0.0	After two weeks of listening to how New York officials lied, bribed and cheated the Cayugas out of their 64,027-acre reservation, U.S.
2_3	0.0	District Judge Neal McCurn heard a different historical perspective from the state's first witness, Alexander von Gernet.
2_4	0.0	McCurn previously ruled that New York illegally acquired the Cayugas reservation land in 1795 and 1807 by purchasing it from the tribe in violation of the 1790 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, which required Congressional approval for all Indian land transactions.
2_5	0.0	Following a monthlong trial, a federal court jury in February awarded the Cayugas $36.9 million for their lost ancestral lands.
2_6	0.0	The judge is now weighing historical and economic factors to decide whether the jury's award should be increased.
2_7	0.09090909090909091	It is important to look at the pre-Revolutionary War years to understand New York's behavior dealing with Native Americans after that time, said von Gernet, a Native American expert from the University of Toronto.
2_8	0.0	It was long-standing policy that New York assumed authority over Indian land transactions within its borders, von Gernet said.
2_9	0.07692307692307693	Historical documents show that as early as 1684, the colonial governor was required to approve any land deals with Indian tribes, he said.
2_10	0.0	That policy was carried forward in other treaties, laws and proclamations enacted over the next century, von Gernet testified.
2_11	0.0	It was a policy also included in the state constitution, he said.
2_12	0.0	''Congress was a newfangled institution.
2_13	0.0	Colonial New York had a longrunning relationship with the tribes,'' von Gernet said.
2_14	0.0	''The idea of dealing firsthand with the Iroquois had a long history in New York.
2_15	0.0	It was not one that emerged after the Revolutionary War''.
2_16	0.08333333333333333	The Cayugas fought on the British side in the Revolutionary War and there was widespread sentiment in the fledgling federal government and among New York lawmakers to treat the tribe as a conquered people and make them wards of the state, von Gernet said.
2_17	0.0	However, then Gov.
2_18	0.0	George Clinton ignored the warnings and instead decided to broker a treaty with them, von Gernet testified.
2_19	0.0	Although the state clearly came out the winner by gaining ownership of Indian lands, the treaty also ensured reservation land would be set aside for the Cayugas and protected them from unscrupulous individuals who were striking private deals to buy their land, he said.
2_20	0.0	Von Gernet also testified: -That it was the Cayugas who tried to dispose of their land for 22 years before the 1795 sales and first approached the state about buying their reservation land.
2_21	0.0	-That the Iroquois Grand Council had dissolved during the Revolutionary War, leaving the Cayugas and other tribes to each follow its own course.
2_22	0.0	The Cayugas' witnesses have testified that in agreeing to the 1795 treaty, New York knowingly ignored Iroquois tradition, which required the Grand Council's consensus to make the treaty binding.
2_23	0.0	Additionally, von Gernet said, following the war, the Cayugas split into factions led by local chiefs who earned their position through achievement as opposed to inheriting them.
2_24	0.0	''There was considerable confusion about who was empowered in diplomatic discourse,'' von Gernet told McCurn.
2_25	0.0	He said the majority faction led by Fish Carrier moved to Buffalo Creek in western New York and tried to sell off the Cayugas lands to private individuals in deals that were determined illegal by state lawmakers.
2_26	0.0	The minority faction, led by Steel Trap, returned to the Cayuga Lake area, where faced with an onslaught of settlers, it eventually worked out the 1789 lease giving all the tribe's lands to New York except for the 64,000-acre reservation.

3_6	0.0	After using casino gambling, over the last several years, to help reverse their fortunes, Native-American tribes like this one are beginning to build entire leisure industries on their reservations.
3_7	0.0	But as the easy-money aura of vacation resorts, gambling, golf, and shopping spreads across the land that these people have for generations cherished and protected from outside intrusion, concern is growing among tribal members that their religion, culture and sovereignty are being pushed aside.
3_8	0.0	``It's like a leisure virus,'' said Jose Lucero, a member of the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe located about 60 miles north of here.

3_15	0.0	And we're not very good stewards now, allowing all of this stuff to take over''.
3_16	0.13333333333333333	With the desperately needed jobs and money that casinos have brought to reservations, few people in the tribes have been publicly critical of casino gambling on their reservations.
3_17	0.0	But a once-faint drumbeat of disdain is growing louder.
3_18	0.0	Critics worry that tourists will trample across what they consider to be religious ground, that the business partnerships that the tribes are forming are increasingly being operated by outside professionals and managers.
3_19	0.0	``Our religious leaders are more or less opposed to the casino and all these companies moving in here,'' said Otis Leon, a member of the tribal council that governs the Santa Ana tribe.
3_20	0.0	But the medicine men and other protectors of the tribe's religion and culture, he added, ``are getting pushed aside in a way''.
3_21	0.0	Leon, who voted in favor of the casino development, now expresses mixed emotions.
3_22	0.0	``Things seemed OK at first,'' he said.
3_23	0.0	``But then more of the Las Vegas types started moving in''.
3_24	0.0	Despite such concerns, it is difficult to argue against what appears to be progress.
3_25	0.0	Of the 22 tribes across New Mexico, 11 now operate casinos, and it is estimated that they take in more than $350 million a year in gambling revenues.
3_26	0.0	And although there is still poverty on the reservations, jobs are plentiful, recreation centers and libraries have been built, and major investments are being made to augment the success of gambling.
3_27	0.0	Several tribes are expanding their casinos and planning hotels and vacation resorts, and the tribe that is leading the way is the Santa Ana Pueblo.
3_28	0.0	Two weeks ago, the tribe announced a partnership with the Hyatt Hotels Corp.

3_33	0.0	A retail shopping center is proposed for a nearby section of the reservation.
3_34	0.0	Thanks to the profit from its six-year-old casino, the Santa Ana Pueblo tribe is operating a gourmet restaurant on the reservation, next door to its golf course and luxurious clubhouse.

3_44	0.0	``Some people said stash the money.
3_45	0.0	Don't do anything with it.

3_47	0.0	The culture and religion, Montoya says, will be strengthened by the economic growth.
3_48	0.0	``Our culture and religion was very strong when we got our subsistence from farming right here on the reservation,'' he said.
3_49	0.0	``Then when the economy started changing and Dad had to go off the reservation to work things got weak.

3_51	0.0	The business-oriented tribal members seem to be winning.
3_52	0.0	When the tribal council was discussing the proposed hotel, some members bristled at the notion of building the resort just a half mile from ``The Snake Head,'' one of the reservation's many ancient religious sites.

3_59	0.0	&QL; Two weeks ago at the Taos Pueblo reservation, located 70 miles north of Santa Fe, tribal leaders two weeks ago approved a plan to buy a nearby hotel and meeting center and move the tribe's existing casino to the site, which would become a part of the tribe's reservation.
3_60	0.0	But not everyone on the reservation is happy about the growth.
3_61	0.11764705882352941	Jerome Marcus, a 38-year-old member of the tribe and former security officer at the casino, said that as the casino has prospered he has witnessed a slow deterioration of tribal values and customs.
3_62	0.0	``I've noticed a complete lack of participation in ceremonies and understanding by our people, especially with diversions like the casino,'' he said.
3_63	0.0	Still, the benefits from all of the development are evident in the opportunities that have been created.
3_64	0.0	One recent afternoon at the Isleta Pueblo reservation, 10 miles south of Albuquerque, Aaron Dailey, a 16-year-old tribal member, was busy washing golf carts at the lush golf course just across Highway 47 from the tribe's casino.
3_65	0.0	Although he has been playing golf less than three years, Aaron already carries a 10 handicap _ better than most golfers will ever play _ and the golf professionals operating the course have high hopes for him.
3_66	0.0	``The tribe is trusting us to come in and operate their business enterprises and train their people,'' said Brent Townsley, a teaching professional at the course.
3_67	0.0	``But our goal is to see someone like Aaron take this course over and become the head pro''.
3_68	0.0	Nevertheless, the phalanx of corporate interests, lawyers, accountants, casino managers and investment advisers who swirl around the reservation is unnerving to some.
3_69	0.0	``They're taking a lot of the control of the economic development on the reservation out of the hands of the tribe itself,'' said Tim Giago, a syndicated columnist and member of South Dakota's Oglala Lakota tribe.

5_14	0.0	East End power brokers on Long Island have taken notice as this new breed of Shinnecock have lain in front of bulldozers, marched on Town Hall and protested on the steps of the state Capitol in Albany to stop the development of 62 acres of virgin woodland to the north of the Montauk Highway, the road that separates the reservation from the rest of Southampton.

5_17	0.0	The Oneida reservation was once a tumble-down 32 acres in upstate New York, but the tribe now owns the state's largest casino and has a land claim wending its way through federal court asking for the return of 250,000 acres between Syracuse and Utica.

5_33	0.16666666666666666	More important, they receive no legal assistance from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, so their land claims hang in limbo.
5_34	0.0	According to records, in the early 18th century, the town of Southampton paid the tribe $20 for its land and gave it a 1,000-year lease on the 3,600 acres.

5_61	0.0	Such status would give the tribe the right to negotiate gambling deals with the state.
5_62	0.1111111111111111	The application process can take years, experts say, and the tribal trustees have yet to respond to a 1998 letter from the Bureau of Indian Affairs requesting more application materials.
5_63	0.0	Federal recognition would also mean that the tribe would have to draft a new constitution and set up a new government.

6_1	0.0	_ The tranquil shore of Wheatfields Lake, a high-country fishing hole set among the ponderosa and sandstone here on the Navajo Reservation, would seem an unlikely place to encounter violence.
6_2	0.0	But a 26-year-old Navajo man who called himself Bam Bam was prepared for the worst, filling his battered pickup truck with gas before setting off with his brother to catch some trout.
6_3	0.0	Too many times, Bam Bam said, gang rivals had beaten him while he was walking home in the dark.
6_4	0.0	In a few other instances, said Bam Bam, speaking on the condition that he be identified only by his nickname, he had done the attacking and had served time in jail for assault.
6_5	0.0	``It's gotten almost like the inner city here,'' said Bam Bam, unzipping his jacket to show a pistol hidden inside.
6_6	0.2608695652173913	The spread of violent crime here on the Navajo Reservation, a vast territory of dry plains and red rock mesas in the Four Corners region of the Southwest, reflects problems on dozens of the nation's Indian reservations.
6_7	0.0	While homicide and assault rates have declined across much of the nation in recent years, they have soared in Indian country to rival that of the nation's cities.
6_8	0.0	As the influences of the modern world grow, many reservations _ especially those in the West _ suffer from problems with gangs and drugs.
6_9	0.5	The situation is compounded by the poverty that has afflicted many Indian reservations for generations.
6_10	0.0	``Our kids have satellite TV and are influenced by things going on in Chicago and New York,'' said Leonard Butler, chief of the Navajo Nation Police Department of 280 for the reservation's 200,000 residents.
6_11	0.0	``They go to Los Angeles and bring back the way of life of the city, like drive-by shootings, graffiti and tattoos''.
6_12	0.2	In response to the surge in violent crime on reservations, President Clinton proposed increasing the 1999 law-enforcement budget for the Bureau of Indian Affairs by $25 million, to $100 million.
6_13	0.0	That total was reduced significantly in recent House and Senate votes, and by time the appropriation bill emerges from a conference committee the increase could be below $10 million.
6_14	0.2222222222222222	Administration officials are also considering reorganizing the law-enforcement division of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
6_15	0.0	One option _ criticized by some tribes and praised by others _ would be to transfer the responsibility for law enforcement to the Justice Department.
6_16	0.3	To be sure, the Navajo Reservation has always had its share of violent crime, but that increased sharply in the mid-1990s.
6_17	0.0	Homicides went from an average of 35 a year at the beginning of the decade to 67 in 1996, and 57 the year after.
6_18	0.0	In the first half of 1998, 18 people have been slain on the reservation, dropping the homicide rate closer to what it was early in the decade.
6_19	0.0	In 1997, Washington had a murder rate of 55 per 100,000 population, Baltimore and Detroit had rates of 46 while Chicago had a murder rate of 27.
6_20	0.0	The picture is similar on some smaller reservations, like the Fort Peck Reservation in eastern Montana.
6_21	0.0	There, the murder rate of 1 for 675 residents in 1995 was twice that of New Orleans, according to a federal report last year on Indian law enforcement.
6_22	0.0	New Orleans, with 1 murder per 1,350 residents in 1995, has one of the highest homicide rates in the country.
6_23	0.0	Combating the crime wave is proving especially difficult because of a lack of police officers on many reservations in the West, experts say.
6_24	0.0	For example, there are 1.4 officers per thousand Navajo residents, compared with 2.9 per thousand for other small communities, the federal report said.
6_25	0.0	The Navajo Reservation is primarily dependent on federal money.
6_26	0.0	The shortage of officers was apparent here over two recent nights, when the officers intervened in drunken domestic fights, hospitalized a man who drank antifreeze and arrested about a half-dozen people on charges of public intoxication.
6_27	0.0	Because only three officers are on duty for evening shifts in a district of 3,055 square miles that includes Window Rock, where the reservation's government is based, some calls for assistance went unanswered for hours.
6_28	0.0	There are seven police districts on the reservation.
6_29	0.0	``We know we need more police officers,'' said Officer Roanna Buck, ``but that's up to the politicians.
6_30	0.0	The tribal leadership is overlooking the crime because they don't want to admit that it's happening''.
6_31	0.0	(STORY CAN END HERE.
6_32	0.0	OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Another disparity frequently cited by the police is the lack of equipment, such as helicopters and computers mounted in squad cars, commonly found in police departments of comparable size to the reservation.
6_33	0.25	Many reservation residents are frustrated.
6_34	0.0	Seated in a round hogan, a traditional Navajo home built with logs that has a red dirt floor, Lorraine Nelson, 60, a teacher from Window Rock, recalled an earlier era when children spent their days herding sheep and assisting the tribe rather than getting in trouble.
6_35	0.0	``Today's kids have lost respect for their parents and their neighbors,'' she said.
6_36	0.0	``I don't know how to turn it around''.
6_37	0.0	A dilapidated housing project in Fort Defiance, a few miles north of Window Rock, is considered by many residents to be one of the most dangerous neighborhoods on the reservation.
6_38	0.0	The barren lots and graffiti-covered houses are the territory of the Cobras, a gang of young men whose members battle their rivals, the Dragons, with baseball bats.
6_39	0.0	``To stay strong we had to band together,'' said a 24-year-old Navajo gang member who uses the name Strange.
6_40	0.0	``It was more for fun at first, but then people took it to the next level''.
6_41	0.0	But gang violence does not fully explain the reservation's predicament.
6_42	0.0	Often, people are killed by family members or friends in petty disputes, often involving alcohol.
6_43	0.0	Over the past few years, the Navajo police force has implemented programs intended to curtail crime.
6_44	0.0	For example, 45 officers were added to the force.
6_45	0.0	Their salaries were paid with new federal grants, though the police chief complained that the money did not supply the uniforms and patrol cars needed for them.
6_46	0.0	The department also has a gang unit, a community policing program and school programs intended to discourage children from using illegal drugs.
6_47	0.0	The tribal leadership and other community leaders have begun summer work programs for young people and, in some cases, are evicting problem families from public housing.
6_48	0.0	But if such efforts are to succeed, the police say, they will have to reach boys like the three, ages 13 and 14, who were relaxing on a housing project porch on a recent afternoon.
6_49	0.0	As one of their mothers sewed inside the house, the boys spoke admiringly of drug dealing and violence by two older relatives who are gang members and contemplated joining the gang one day themselves.

8_8	0.0	Like the Crow, tribes throughout the country move with new resolve to exercise an old asset: sovereignty.
8_9	0.0	It is that dominion that makes them not just another census category, but hundreds of nations within a nation.
8_10	0.0	This peculiar status stems from a time when Indians controlled more than three-fourths of what would become the United States, prompting the writers of the Constitution to place tribes on an equal footing with foreign nations.
8_11	0.0	The ``white fathers'' in Washington underlined that status in 371 treaties that followed.
8_12	0.0	Since 1830 the Supreme Court has affirmed that although tribes are domestic and dependent, they are still part of an American family of governments entitled to self-rule.
8_13	0.5238095238095238	That sovereignty opens the way for casinos, guarantees American Indians extraordinary fishing and hunting rights, allows them to sell gasoline and cigarettes on Indian territory free of state taxes.
8_14	0.0	Those Indians-only enterprises, in turn, give new resources to some of the poorest Americans in the United States.
8_15	0.0	That money also serves as life support for hundreds of dying languages and offers a sliver of hope for the survival of customs overwhelmed by European-bred culture.

8_23	0.0	We don't disparage the Constitution by saying it's ancient''.
8_24	0.08333333333333333	Assigning different rights to one group based on bloodlines may seem anomalous in this republic born of a declaration that ``all men are created equal''.
8_25	0.3	But sovereignty clearly means recognizing Indians as not only Native Americans but also as special Americans.
8_26	0.6153846153846154	Indians working on reservations avoid state income taxes but pay federal income and Social Security taxes.

10_1	0.10526315789473684	The relationship hasn't been stress-free, tribal leaders say, but there has been marked improvement from 1990, when Census officials estimate it missed about 4.5 percent of the American Indian population.

14_0	0.3333333333333333	WASHINGTON (AP) --American Indian reservations would get an infusion of $1.2 billion in federal money for education, health care and law enforcement under President Clinton's proposed 2001 budget, a White House aide said.
14_1	0.0	Lynn Cutler, the president's top adviser on Indian issues, said it's the largest spending increase ever sought for Indians and includes new or expanded programs in nearly all federal agencies.
14_2	0.07407407407407407	``It's important that we get every agency of the federal government thinking about Indians and employing Indian people,'' Cutler said Tuesday, one day after she outlined the plan to tribal leaders at a meeting of the United South and Eastern Tribes, which represents 23 tribes from Maine to Texas.

14_6	0.1	The head of the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, the main agency funding tribal governments, said the extra money is welcome but won't address all the problems.
14_7	0.0	``In all, I don't think it's anything to have a party over, because the needs in Indian Country are so great,'' said Kevin Gover, a Pawnee who Clinton picked to head the BIA in 1997.

14_12	0.0	``I know half-a-dozen new schools is a drop in the bucket, but at least it's a drop,'' Cutler said.
14_13	0.5714285714285714	Reservations are home to some of the gravest poverty and worst health care in the country.
14_14	0.17647058823529413	The unemployment rate on reservations is about 10 times the national average and only about two-thirds of Indian adults have a high school diploma, compared to three-quarters of the general population.

15_19	0.0	Under the effort, ``one-stop mortgage centers'' would be opened at Pine Ridge and on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona to help streamline the mortgage lending process.
15_20	0.35294117647058826	Cuomo said special steps were needed to help Indians create and own houses because the nature of the land on which they live effectively shuts them out of conventional home loan processes.

21_0	0.1875	American Indians are the victims of violent crimes at more than twice the national average and, unlike the situation among whites and blacks where the large majority of crime victims are of the same race as the perpetrators, 70 percent of those committing crimes against Indians are of a different race, according to the first comprehensive study of crimes involving Indians, which was released Sunday by the Justice Department.
21_1	0.15384615384615385	The study found that the nation's 2.3 million Indians were far more likely to be victims of violent crimes than members of any other racial group, and that the rate of violent crime experienced by Indian women is nearly 50 percent higher than that by black males.
21_2	0.16666666666666666	A full 60 percent of the perpetrators of violent crimes against Indians were whites, according to the victims, while 29 percent of the offenders were other Indians and 10 percent were described as black, the report said.
21_3	0.125	By contrast, other studies have shown that 69 percent of the perpetrators of violent crimes against whites are also white, and 81 percent of those committing violent crimes against blacks are themselves black.

21_5	0.0625	Harring said much of the violence against Indians by other racial groups was attributable to racism and alcohol, ``with Indians being victimized by poor, drunken whites, people on the margins hurting each other''.
21_6	0.3333333333333333	There are still high levels of prejudice against Indians in the West, where most Indians live, he said, and a culture that lives on the edges of Indian reservations ``that tolerates this violence,'' even among law enforcement officials.

21_18	0.14285714285714285	Indian victims reported that the perpetrator had been drinking in 46 percent of violent crimes against them, the highest of any racial group, while 70 percent of Indians convicted of violence who were in jail said they had been drinking at the time of their offense.
21_19	0.08333333333333333	In addition, the survey found that the arrest rate for alcohol-related offenses among Indians (including drunken driving, liquor law violations and public drunkenness) was more than double that for the total population during 1996, though the arrest rate for drug offenses was lower than for other races.

21_21	0.1111111111111111	Peter Iverson, a professor of history at Arizona State University, said that there had been a significant shift in Indian population over the past 20 years, with a majority of Indians now living in urban areas.
21_22	0.0	But those Indians in cities form a small part of the metropolitan area and do not live in segregated areas, so they are much more likely to come in contact with people of other groups.
21_23	0.0	Residential segregation is often part of the explanation for the tendency of whites to commit violence against whites, and blacks against other blacks.
21_24	0.38461538461538464	Iverson said that in rural areas bordering Indian reservations, ``you still have significant prejudice against Indian people providing traditional justification for violence''.
21_25	0.0	Historically, he said, Indians entered these communities to shop, or to buy alcohol or for entertainment, and though whites in these towns made money off the Indians, ``there has long been an uneasy relationship, even resentment''.
21_26	0.0	In this situation, arguments, fueled by alcohol, could quickly become violent, he said.
21_27	0.05263157894736842	Separately, the report said that the murder rate by Indians in 1996 was 4 per 100,000, below the national average of 7.9 per 100,000, and less than the white rate of 4.9 per 100,000.
