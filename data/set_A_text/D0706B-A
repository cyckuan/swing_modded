4_65	0.091305907	SUU KYI: Yes, it's one way.
4_66	0.084800455	But basically I think that in order to do something like that, you have to win the confidence of the people, and I don't think you can win people's confidence through intimidation and repression.

4_75	0.087672792	SUU KYI: We do hear that AIDS is on the increase, and that's partly due to the fact that the authorities never really attack problems at their source.
4_76	0.091740333	They seem to think that if they insist the problem does not exist, it will simply go away.
4_77	0.094942989	The best way to deal with AIDS is through education.

4_82	0.094860075	SUU KYI: We are confident that our cause will prevail because that is what the great majority of the people in Burma want.
4_83	0.088549957	We all want justice and human rights.
