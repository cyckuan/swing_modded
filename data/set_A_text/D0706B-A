4_65	0.08121023	SUU KYI: Yes, it's one way.
4_66	0.0928457	But basically I think that in order to do something like that, you have to win the confidence of the people, and I don't think you can win people's confidence through intimidation and repression.
4_67	0.089250727	First we would like to talk to the people concerned and discuss the problem with them.
4_68	0.080740533	That is what democracy is all about.

4_75	0.087282662	SUU KYI: We do hear that AIDS is on the increase, and that's partly due to the fact that the authorities never really attack problems at their source.
4_76	0.093927559	They seem to think that if they insist the problem does not exist, it will simply go away.
4_77	0.099865146	The best way to deal with AIDS is through education.
4_78	0.088839325	So we need a really widespread AIDS education program.

4_83	0.078490966	We all want justice and human rights.
