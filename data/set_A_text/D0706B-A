9_61	0.11683099	SUU KYI: Perhaps it means that the only way the students can escape from the fear of the repression of the government is by taking drugs.
9_62	0.067162	That would be very sad, wouldn't it?
9_63	0.13176345	Q: Burma provides 60 percent of the heroin imported to the United States, and many of the ethnic peoples are financially dependent on the opium crop.
9_64	0.078479343	Do you think crop substitution in the areas where poppies are grown would be an effective way to fight addiction?
9_65	0.060023234	SUU KYI: Yes, it's one way.
9_66	0.088595377	But basically I think that in order to do something like that, you have to win the confidence of the people, and I don't think you can win people's confidence through intimidation and repression.
9_67	0.076805593	First we would like to talk to the people concerned and discuss the problem with them.
9_68	0.065517894	That is what democracy is all about.

9_71	0.085284218	Certainly a democratic government would do its best to make sure that the growing of opium is eliminated in this country and that the people who depend on growing opium for their life will find other ways of earning a living.

9_75	0.08546948	SUU KYI: We do hear that AIDS is on the increase, and that's partly due to the fact that the authorities never really attack problems at their source.
9_76	0.081043773	They seem to think that if they insist the problem does not exist, it will simply go away.
9_77	0.085468843	The best way to deal with AIDS is through education.
9_78	0.090056485	So we need a really widespread AIDS education program.
9_79	0.081100169	In fact, what we need in Burma is education of all kinds _ political, economic and medical.
9_80	0.089374418	AIDS education would be just one part of a whole program for education, which is so badly needed in our country.
9_81	0.075517373	Q: What do you tell people when they get discouraged?
9_82	0.090054452	SUU KYI: We are confident that our cause will prevail because that is what the great majority of the people in Burma want.
9_83	0.0546223	We all want justice and human rights.
9_84	0.074651162	Since what we want will benefit all the people in Burma, our cause is bound to win.

9_87	0.091564005	SUU KYI: I haven't been told anything like that, but of course the official papers are always talking about ``annihilating'' our forces.

20_0	0.12475108	In the decade since they seized power and renamed the country Myanmar, Burma's military rulers have become increasingly dependent on the use of forced labor and torture to maintain that power, build the country's infrastructure, and carry out its war against stubborn resistance by ethnic minorities.
20_1	0.080204302	Now, evidence is increasing that the Burmese army is using another tool of war against minority populations: rape.
20_2	0.079238933	The use of rape as a weapon in ethnic conflict is not uncommon; it's been documented in Bosnia, Rwanda, and, most recently, Indonesia.
20_3	0.077453313	But such occurrences in Burma on a vast scale have received little attention, in part because the rapes have been perpetrated in inaccessible areas.
20_4	0.088962584	The US State Department reported this year that Burmese troops ``continued to impress women for military porterage duties, and there were many reports of rape of ethnic minority women by soldiers''.
20_5	0.10330057	According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Myanmar (Burma), government troops have been abducting ``increasing numbers of women, including young girls and the elderly'' and subjecting them to rape and other abuses.
20_6	0.087643352	The Burmese Women's Union alleges that ``women have been raped in an organized and systematic way'' by the army.
20_7	0.077432896	A civil lawsuit filed on behalf of Burmese citizens in a US federal court in 1996 targeted the Burmese military junta and two oil companies --Unocal Corp.
20_8	0.07877517	, then based in Los Angeles, and Total of France --for abuses allegedly committed during construction of a natural gas pipeline in Burma, charging that ``girls and women have been raped in the presence of family members''.
20_9	0.077485816	The court, which ruled last year that Unocal and Total could be held liable for rapes committed by their military partner, will hear the case next year; the junta was dropped as a defendent because the court said it had no jurisdiction over a foreign government.
20_10	0.086275956	The UN Commission on Human Rights says women most likely to be raped are refugees, internally displaced women, and women belonging to ethnic minorities or the political opposition.
20_11	0.081474132	Rapes by the military typically occur during raids on villages; when women are abducted for forced labor; during encounters with victims of forced relocations in the jungle; and in coerced marriages.
20_12	0.090396925	Rape is systematically being used by Burma's military as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing, according to interviews with human rights workers and exiled pro-democracy officials.
20_13	0.086052285	Bolstering those contentions is a new report by EarthRights International, a legal rights group based in Washington and Thailand, that accuses Burma's military of ``the savage domination of women outside the scope of acceptable wartime conduct''.
20_14	0.10220819	The report also says that ``the violent sexual abuse of ethnic Burmese women at the hands of the military occurs in epidemic proportions''.
20_15	0.082467258	Activists are urging the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women to investigate the claims of systematic rape.
20_16	0.083942298	Thaung Tun, deputy chief of mission at the Burmese embassy in Washington, denies there is anything to investigate.
20_17	0.06586919	``It is hardly possible for rape to occur in Myanmar on a policy basis.

20_22	0.086164197	Abused physically and humiliated every day, the young recruits are then set loose among the ethnic minorities they have been indoctrinated to believe are ``the people's enemy'' and ``internal destructionists''.
20_23	0.088720926	Many ethnic leaders and pro-democracy activists claim that the violence against women is directly related to the military's goal of wiping out all ethnic resistance, even if it means genocide against a particular minority.
20_24	0.088191867	One widely circulated document --whose origin remains unverified -- appears to lend credence to the claims that rape is a conscious tool of war in Burma.
20_25	0.086136733	Marked ``top secret'' and dated only a few weeks after the military takeover in 1988, the document is addressed to ``All Great Ruling Burmans'' and outlines a policy of ``blood mixing'' and ``Burmanization'' of ethnic minorities --a reference to the process by which Burmans, who now represent two-thirds of Burma's population, could become more dominant.
20_26	0.095048678	The document says ``the easiest way to implement these ideas is to occupy (marry or impregnate) women who are not Burman,'' for which it offers a financial reward.
20_27	0.084240514	``We must deviously attack those who are not Burman in economic as well as social ways,'' the document states.
20_28	0.10603461	In Burma, children are considered to bear the ethnicity of the father only.
20_29	0.1208776	Burmese opposition leader Sein Win --an elected member of the Burmese parliament who now heads the country's government in exile -- believes the document originated in the defense ministry's department of psychological warfare.
20_30	0.10509277	``Regardless of the source or intent of this document, it accurately represents an ethnic cleansing policy of the Burmese military,'' he says.
20_31	0.076319553	``There is no doubt that the widespread rapes by troops are fueled by the policies expressed in this document''.
20_32	0.10235156	U Bo Hla Tint, a minister of the government in exile, says he was present in Burma when officials in Karen state heard the text of the document during routine monitoring of radio communications between two Burmese military commanders.

20_34	0.089592766	Although it is impossible to gather precise statistics about the incidence of rape as a tool of the Burmese military --geographical, military, and cultural barriers make that impossible, say human rights workers -- anecdotal evidence continues to mount.
20_35	0.08855443	In April, Amnesty International reported that a 30-year-old mother, Nang Ing, was raped by three soldiers who accused her of giving rice to the insurgents.

20_43	0.085105469	The tribunal, set up for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, has declared rape a war crime.
20_44	0.087248528	``The facts presented in (the EarthRights report) indicate that these acts of violence against women are both widespread and systematic, that there is a pattern of rape, and that civilians are targeted for political reasons or because they are part of a certain ethnic group,'' says Green, who is a cocounsel in the lawsuit against Unocal and Total.
