1_3	0.15494871	The play about the death of the gay University of Wyoming college student was the brainchild of Moises Kaufman, founder of the Tectonic Theater Project, whose members collaborated on the drama now on view at the Denver Center Theater through April 1.
1_4	0.077995142	``To actively step back and sit and watch everything unravel is surreal,'' said Matt Galloway, bartender at the Fireside Lounge, where Shepard met the men who killed him.

1_12	0.09703466	Kaufman has called the murder ``a watershed event,'' one that captured what this nation is and where it is going as a society.
1_13	0.08807379	In that respect, it echoes, Kaufman says, his best-known work, ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' which had a long New York run, as well as a successful engagement at the Denver Center Theater last year.

2_1	0.33985312	_ In a case that galvanized national outrage over anti-homosexual violence, a 21-year-old roofer pleaded guilty on Monday to kidnapping and murdering a gay college student and was sentenced to serve two consecutive life sentences.
2_2	0.36501047	Escaping a possible death sentence, Russell Henderson was sentenced by District Judge Jeffrey Donnell for his part in the beating and murder of the student, Matthew Shepard, here six months ago.

2_4	0.10107161	``You are deserving the fullest punishment this court can mete out,'' the judge said, after accepting a plea bargain agreement two days before opening arguments were to begin in the case.
2_5	0.22834036	In a sole reference to Shepard's sexual orientation, the judge said the murder was ``part because of his lifestyle, part for a $20 robbery''.
2_6	0.11153021	During an emotion-packed hearing at the Albany County Courthouse here, Henderson turned to Judy and Dennis Shepard and apologized for murdering their 22-year-old son.

2_11	0.10470191	In his final comments before the defendant was led away to spend the rest of his life in jail, the judge told him, ``You are not a victim here, Mr.

2_14	0.13685732	In recent weeks, a Wyoming coalition of clergy and a national coalition of gay groups spoke out against applying the death penalty in the Matthew Shepard case, a position they said was in harmony with their wider opposition to capital punishment.

8_1	0.19513632	For some older protesters, though, the march _ to express outrage over the killing of a gay college student in Wyoming _ was a return to the angry street protests that had so often symbolized the militancy of the gay rights movement.
8_2	0.16106602	As the chaotic denouement of the march and the police response was debated Tuesday, one thing seemed clear: The size of the loosely organized protest showed how the killing of Matthew Shepard has galvanized gay men and lesbians in New York and around the country as has no other single event in recent years.

8_10	0.090992412	The cause of the passion, participants say, is a sense that even as gay people have become more accepted in society than ever before, there are stark reminders of the hatred and violence of the not-so distant past.
8_11	0.10155473	Well before Shepard's murder, a sharp increase in police reports of anti-gay bias crimes in New York City had unsettled gay people, shaking them out of what some call complacency in the years since the height of AIDS activism.

12_7	0.1835525	Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, in Laramie, was fatally attacked a few hours after he had attended a planning meeting for Gay Awareness Week events on campus.
12_8	0.083119285	Debree, the lead investigator for the Albany County Sheriff's Department, testified that he conducted a tape-recorded interview with McKinney on Oct.

12_10	0.10715488	In that interview, Debree recalled, McKinney said he and Henderson had identified Shepard as a robbery target and had then lured him out of a Laramie bar and into their truck by pretending to be gay.

13_9	0.1023025	Not enough.
13_10	0.094635364	In the aftermath of the Wyoming killing, the same groups that worked overtime to stigmatize gay people have mounted a furious propaganda defense to assert that their words and ads demeaning gay people have nothing to do with any anti-gay crimes.

13_13	0.085315775	As one of their apologists, Hadley Arkes, wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, my columns on this subject are ``vibrant with a hatred of the Family Research Council and evangelical Christians''.
13_14	0.085970541	It's a nice try at changing the subject, but taking a stand against the anti-gay crusade of the political organizations of the religious right is not a stand against Christians, evangelical or otherwise.
13_15	0.087991022	Most people who abhor homophobia are themselves Christian _ and so, for that matter, are most gay Americans.
13_16	0.088384247	As for the Family Research Council, it is not even a quasi-religious organization but a moneyed secular outfit whose leader, Gary Bauer, wants to be president.
13_17	0.16526838	And the Shepard killing has hardly deterred its demonization of gay people as subhuman.
13_18	0.088786613	One new tack _ according to a council draft document I've seen _ is to show that ``homosexuals are at much greater risk from one another than from bias-related attacks''.
13_19	0.08930781	And so the plan is to inform us that more gay men die of AIDS than of bias-related murders _ a nonsensical pairing intended to brand gay men as diseased.
13_20	0.091106536	Since gay women can't be stigmatized en masse with AIDS, the council had to use real ingenuity to prove that they, too, are vermin at ``much greater risk from one another'' than from gay-bashers.
13_21	0.10713082	The solution turned up in a ``Culture Facts'' newsletter it published only nine days after Matthew Shepard's death and is still posted on its Web site.
13_22	0.087169301	Titled `` `Gay' Violence Escalates,'' it asserts that ``The University of Houston-Downtown in a recent study found that 47.5 percent of lesbian relationships involve some form of domestic abuse,'' compared with 0.22 percent for married women.
13_23	0.093003685	I reached the unnamed source of this ``fact'' in Houston _ Lisa Waldner, an assistant professor of sociology.
13_24	0.086686519	Previously unaware of what she called the council's ``misleading'' use of her work, she told me that this so-called ``recent study'' was a paper she co-wrote as a student in 1992 about the lifetime experiences of a non-random sample of gay people she knew and their circle.
13_25	0.08653181	She said it was wrong to ``say this is the average for all lesbians'' and that the council's comparison of her study with another on married women was meaningless since they used completely different methodologies.

16_1	0.419067	4: The killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming who in 1998 was beaten, lashed to a fence and left to die, shocked Americans by lifting homophobia to a new level of savagery.

16_5	0.1338235	In their opening statements they argued that McKinney was guilty only of manslaughter because sexual abuse in childhood had caused him to respond in a rage to the victim's alleged homosexual advances.
16_6	0.087297175	The presiding judge, Barton Voigt, rejected that argument as inadmissible at trial, ruling that it amounted to a diminished-capacity or temporary-insanity defense, neither of which is allowed under Wyoming law.
16_7	0.09882166	The ``gay panic'' defense has no statutory basis, but it has been invoked in other cases.
16_8	0.092515723	Typically, the argument is that the attacker, stirred by fears that he is himself homosexual, becomes so offended by what he perceives as a sexual advance that he is provoked to kill the victim.

18_16	0.14375664	In his opening arguments, Jason Tangeman, one of Kinney's court-appointed lawyers, conceded that McKinney was responsible for Shepard's death.
18_17	0.087343097	But in mounting a defense designed to bring a prison term, rather than execution, Tangeman argued that McKinney's past, as well as his poor judgment, led him to drug addiction and alcohol abuse.
18_18	0.15659061	Tangeman told jurors that McKinney had been using large amounts of methamphetamine in the days before the killing and was drinking heavily in the hours before he and Henderson encountered Shepard at a local bar.
18_19	0.1066906	But in disputing Rerucha's contention that Shepard's sexual orientation played no role in events leading to the killing and that McKinney was driven solely by greed and violence, Tangeman argued that McKinney was ``haunted by a past, that put him into a rage, put him into a five-minute emotional rage of chaos''.

18_29	0.09306919	But in Tangeman's version, Shepard was portrayed as a sexual predator who had sought a ride from the two men and had ``reached over and grabbed Aaron's genitals and licked his ear''.
18_30	0.13584547	As a result, Tangeman told the jury, McKinney ``becomes very, very upset and beats Matthew Shepard,'' prompted by memories of a sexual encounter forced upon him by an older boy when he was 7.
