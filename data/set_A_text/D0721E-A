9_18	0.094406621	One new tack _ according to a council draft document I've seen _ is to show that ``homosexuals are at much greater risk from one another than from bias-related attacks''.

13_0	0.122955	NEW YORK _ For some of the younger marchers, the demonstration Monday night that paralyzed parts of midtown Manhattan was their first political rally.
13_1	0.20103299	For some older protesters, though, the march _ to express outrage over the killing of a gay college student in Wyoming _ was a return to the angry street protests that had so often symbolized the militancy of the gay rights movement.
13_2	0.16728368	As the chaotic denouement of the march and the police response was debated Tuesday, one thing seemed clear: The size of the loosely organized protest showed how the killing of Matthew Shepard has galvanized gay men and lesbians in New York and around the country as has no other single event in recent years.
13_3	0.079303868	The demonstration began at 6 p.m. as a rally in front of the Plaza Hotel on 59th Street near Central Park, then swelled to 5,000 people on Fifth Avenue, blocking traffic.

13_10	0.097283175	The cause of the passion, participants say, is a sense that even as gay people have become more accepted in society than ever before, there are stark reminders of the hatred and violence of the not-so distant past.
13_11	0.1024833	Well before Shepard's murder, a sharp increase in police reports of anti-gay bias crimes in New York City had unsettled gay people, shaking them out of what some call complacency in the years since the height of AIDS activism.

13_34	0.088986944	Although the most incidents were reported in lower Manhattan, where they usually occur, more incidents were also reported in the boroughs of Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island.
13_35	0.088461064	Carl Locke, director of client services at the Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, a nonprofit organization that helps victims of bias crimes, said the spread of bias crimes across the city shows the extent to which gay people are becoming more visible outside their usual neighborhoods, Greenwich Village and Chelsea in Manhattan and Park Slope in Brooklyn.

13_39	0.083087082	While many activists believe that anti-gay crimes are on the rise across the country, statistics are difficult to come by.
13_40	0.085743479	The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Projects, which collects data from 14 organizations across the country, reported that violent crimes against gay people rose 2 percent, to 2,445 incidents, in 1997, the last year for which statistics are available.
13_41	0.077417091	In 1996, the report said, anti-gay crimes rose by 6 percent.
13_42	0.086832345	But those figures reflect incidents labeled bias crimes by local organizations, which often use different standards from police when determining motivation.
13_43	0.080654543	Jack Levin, a professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University in Boston and an author of ``Hate Crimes: The Rising Tide of Bigotry and Bloodshed'' (Plenum Press, 1993), said it was not unusual for anti-gay crimes to buck the trends of other bias crimes.

14_2	0.1827587	``Matthew Shepard died as a result of the blunt trauma injuries he sustained to his head and face,'' said Patrick Allen, coroner for Colorado's Larimer County, where Shepard died.
14_3	0.19997019	Some jurors winced as they viewed graphic photos of the homosexual college student's injuries, including his bloodied face and ear.

14_6	0.13653706	Defense attorneys have said McKinney was guilty of manslaughter, but have argued that his judgment was affected by drugs, alcohol and childhood memories of sexual abuse.
14_7	0.19117385	On Monday, jurors saw pictures of the ponderosa pine fence where Shepard was left to die, his hands tied behind his back, and the pool of blood caused by blows as he fought his attackers.

14_12	0.21366288	Defense attorneys countered that McKinney, who faces the death penalty, didn't intend to kill Shepard when he and a friend accompanied Shepard from a Laramie bar after he asked McKinney for a ride home.

14_14	0.1510877	The defense portrayed McKinney as the victim of sexual abuse who lashed out when approached for a gay encounter.
14_15	0.15001206	McKinney's judgment that night was affected by alcohol, methamphetamines and ``some sexually traumatic and confusing events in his life,'' defense attorney Jason Tangeman told jurors.
14_16	0.23361916	Tangeman said McKinney, 22, was confused by homosexual encounters when he was younger.

15_0	0.091968197	The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Nov.
15_1	0.40197679	4: The killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming who in 1998 was beaten, lashed to a fence and left to die, shocked Americans by lifting homophobia to a new level of savagery.
15_2	0.36374954	A jury has now convicted Aaron McKinney of murder, kidnapping and robbery in the case, and he could face the death penalty.
15_3	0.3639494	The other defendant, Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping earlier, and is serving two life sentences.
15_4	0.10036755	Although McKinney admitted that he had committed the attack, his lawyers hoped to raise a type of ``gay panic'' defense.
15_5	0.14334419	In their opening statements they argued that McKinney was guilty only of manslaughter because sexual abuse in childhood had caused him to respond in a rage to the victim's alleged homosexual advances.
15_6	0.085719965	The presiding judge, Barton Voigt, rejected that argument as inadmissible at trial, ruling that it amounted to a diminished-capacity or temporary-insanity defense, neither of which is allowed under Wyoming law.
15_7	0.087377841	The ``gay panic'' defense has no statutory basis, but it has been invoked in other cases.
15_8	0.097097422	Typically, the argument is that the attacker, stirred by fears that he is himself homosexual, becomes so offended by what he perceives as a sexual advance that he is provoked to kill the victim.
15_9	0.079012138	In other words, the attacker should not be held fully responsible for acts triggered by his own homophobia.
15_10	0.088117947	Excusing violence motivated by prejudice would not be tolerated in racist attacks against ethnic minorities, and should not be allowed to stand in cases involving attacks against gays.
15_11	0.11673325	Voigt's ruling leaves open the possibility that testimony about McKinney's childhood sexual abuse could be presented in the penalty phase of the case.
15_12	0.067370388	Childhood abuse would clearly be relevant in sentencing deliberations.
15_13	0.080385364	But that is quite a different matter from allowing anti-gay hatred to be employed as an affirmative defense for criminal acts.
16_0	0.2395931	The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, April 6: Russell Henderson's decision to plead guilty to the kidnapping and murder of Matthew Shepard is little consolation to the Shepard family, but it provides an appropriately severe sentence for one whose apparent anti-gay hatred led him to destroy a young life.
16_1	0.1929644	The sentence of two consecutive life terms saves Henderson from the possibility of the death penalty but makes it virtually certain he will spend the rest of his life in prison.
16_2	0.099156679	It is not yet clear whether he will have to testify against Aaron McKinney, the co-defendant who will be tried for capital murder this summer.
16_3	0.073465345	Judge Jeffrey Donnell said in court Monday, as he dismissed the defendant's weak apology, that ``The pain you have caused here, Henderson, will never go away''.
16_4	0.065102703	Unfortunately, lawmakers in Wyoming and in other states seem quite willing to forget what happened.
16_5	0.13300555	In the days and weeks after the murder, it seemed that the nation would be awakened to the virulence of anti-gay beliefs that partly propelled this murder.
16_6	0.1836791	Matthew Shepard's youth, and the horrific way he died _ tied to a fence, beaten and left to die in the cold _ made many realize that homosexuals need protection from the kinds of hate crimes that have caused other groups in this nation's history to live in fear.
16_7	0.09199094	Yet in a very short time, the old prejudice that homosexuals are not discriminated against and do not warrant ``special'' protection has resurfaced in a backlash.
16_8	0.11549271	The Wyoming Legislature this winter killed an effort to pass the state's first hate-crimes bill.
16_9	0.07629094	The bill would have increased penalties for those convicted of crimes motivated by bias.
16_10	0.070144567	Anti-gay bias measures also died in other mountain states.
16_11	0.094012951	In an appallingly callous explanation of the defeat, one Republican leader in the Wyoming Senate said, ``My feeling right now is that the committee is tired of discussing bias crimes''.
16_12	0.11279736	The fact remains that anti-gay violence accounted for more than 1,100 reported hate crimes in this country in 1997, according to the latest FBI figures.
16_13	0.14455917	Matthew Shepard is just one more grim statistic.
16_14	0.11684477	The conviction of one man and the trial of another for his murder are appropriate responses to this criminal act.
16_15	0.088357543	But state and national officials must still show leadership in creating laws that send an unmistakable message that such hatred will not be tolerated in this society.

20_1	0.28746316	The prosecution had originally asked for the death penalty for Aaron McKinney, 22, for killing Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college student, but later Shepard's parents agreed to spare him from lethal injection.

20_3	0.10838196	"I really don't know what to say other than that I'm truly sorry to the entire Shepard family," McKinney told the court.
20_4	0.18283622	A jury had found McKinney guilty Wednesday of felony murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery.

21_3	0.054184441	At least that is how Stephen Belber portrayed him onstage.
21_4	0.076471857	``I questioned that at first,'' the real Galloway said after watching ``The Laramie Project,'' a new play by Moises Kaufman of the New York-based Tectonic Theater Project, which had its premiere here on Saturday night.
21_5	0.060560826	``But I guess I really do talk like that.
21_6	0.011994883	It was pretty accurate''.
21_7	0.20091581	As a bartender at the Fireside Lounge in Laramie, Wyo.
21_8	0.187356	, Galloway was one of the last people to see Matthew Shepard alive 17 months ago before two local roofers lured him into a truck, beat him, robbed him and left him for dead on a wooden fence on the outskirts of town _ all because Shepard, a 21-year-old student at the University of Wyoming, was gay.
21_9	0.24481873	After five days in a Colorado hospital, Shepard died.
21_10	0.072799429	The roofers received life sentences with no chance of parole.
21_11	0.083536979	The serendipity of Galloway's role in Shepard's life, as well as the relationships that scores of others had with Shepard, have been woven into an emotional performance, drawn from court records, personal journals and 200 interviews in Laramie conducted by Kaufman, his writers and his actors.
21_12	0.079231494	``The Laramie Project'' examines homophobia, class distinctions and cowboy culture by blending the chronology of the case with the anger, confusion, sadness and embarrassment it left behind.
21_13	0.081118817	The play ultimately questions whether Laramie, or the nation, has changed as a result.
21_14	0.088357425	The words of more than 60 people are conveyed by eight actors simulating the appearance, mannerisms and speech patterns of the people they interviewed.
21_15	0.085129884	Kaufman, 36, who wrote the critically acclaimed play ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' said his new play represented an effort to use the stage as a journalistic medium.
21_16	0.088618417	And it succeeds to the extent that a three-act play lasting nearly three hours can mine deeper feelings than newspaper and television reporters who face daily deadlines.
21_17	0.093431687	Kaufman even breaks a little news in the play, revealing that Reggie Fluty, the deputy sheriff who first reached Shepard at the fence, learned later that the victim was HIV positive and feared that her efforts to resuscitate him had exposed her to the virus that causes AIDS.
21_18	0.072534808	She began drug therapy, and tests showed she was not infected.
21_19	0.11484766	But in addressing larger issues attached to the murder of a gay man for no other reason than his sexual orientation, the play reflects a community still in conflict: Romaine Patterson, a university student, says she was inspired to pursue courses in political science in order to fight for human rights, yet a Baptist minister, who goes unnamed in the play, says he hopes that during the 18 hours Shepard was tied to the fence, he had a moment to reflect on his lifestyle.
21_20	0.094864108	Galloway, 25, a senior at the university who still works at the Fireside, was one of several Laramie residents portrayed onstage who attended the opening performance.
21_21	0.13133178	In an interview, he said the Shepard murder had changed some attitudes in Laramie, including those of friends of his who no longer use the word ``fag'' to describe a gay man.
21_22	0.1006698	At the same time, he recalled two customers coming into the Fireside last week, asking to buy T-shirts bearing the name of the bar as a souvenir of where Shepard spent his last moments.
21_23	0.072096193	Galloway said he was repulsed by the request.
21_24	0.084010092	Zackie Salmon, 52, who manages a scholarship program at the university, was briefly portrayed onstage, expressing repugnance at one of the killers, Aaron J.
21_25	0.12845348	McKinney. As a lesbian, she said, she has noticed that the death of Shepard has had some salutary effects on Laramie's gay and lesbian population, which is larger than most gays and lesbians there had ever realized.
21_26	0.075557662	``Before this incident, I would have never felt as comfortable being who I am,'' Salmon said.
21_27	0.11144009	``After the Matthew Shepard incident, there was a push for understanding, like we're going to face what happened in our community and we're going to change''.
21_28	0.088310814	But even so, Salmon added, she has a lesbian friend who works in a different department at the university who has told her that she fears she could lose her job if her sexual orientation were made public.

22_7	0.18541274	Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, in Laramie, was fatally attacked a few hours after he had attended a planning meeting for Gay Awareness Week events on campus.
22_8	0.088943078	Debree, the lead investigator for the Albany County Sheriff's Department, testified that he conducted a tape-recorded interview with McKinney on Oct.

22_10	0.11234324	In that interview, Debree recalled, McKinney said he and Henderson had identified Shepard as a robbery target and had then lured him out of a Laramie bar and into their truck by pretending to be gay.
22_11	0.1296341	By McKinney's account, the detective said, the attack began after Shepard had placed his hand on McKinney's leg as they drove through Laramie.
22_12	0.12691744	``Guess what, we're not gay,'' the detective quoted McKinney as saying he had told Shepard.
22_13	0.083842187	``You're going to get jacked.

22_19	0.094026497	Reggie Fluty, an Albany County sheriff's deputy, testified on Thursday that Shepard's wrists had been so tightly bound that it had been difficult to cut the rope and that his head had been covered in blood except for a clean spot ``where he'd been crying and the tears went down his face''.
22_20	0.085900054	A Laramie police officer, Detective Ben Fritzen, testified that he had interviewed Kristen Price, McKinney's 18-year-old girlfriend.
