1_2	0.10648447	They cried and then cheered at the end of the three-act, nearly three-hour performance attended by nearly 50 townspeople and members of the media.
1_3	0.2350758	The play about the death of the gay University of Wyoming college student was the brainchild of Moises Kaufman, founder of the Tectonic Theater Project, whose members collaborated on the drama now on view at the Denver Center Theater through April 1.
1_4	0.068786787	``To actively step back and sit and watch everything unravel is surreal,'' said Matt Galloway, bartender at the Fireside Lounge, where Shepard met the men who killed him.

1_7	0.10727029	The production was a monumental effort involving 18 months of preparation, including six trips by members of the company to Laramie for interviews with scores of residents and friends of the 21-year-old Shepard.
1_8	0.048815647	Their thoughts and opinions were pieced together by the troupe, working under the guidance of Kaufman and Leigh Fondakowski, a company member who put together the script.

1_12	0.10016585	Kaufman has called the murder ``a watershed event,'' one that captured what this nation is and where it is going as a society.
1_13	0.086102476	In that respect, it echoes, Kaufman says, his best-known work, ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' which had a long New York run, as well as a successful engagement at the Denver Center Theater last year.
1_14	0.070697724	The play, which chronicled Wilde's downfall, was based, in part, on trial transcripts, trials that eventually send the homosexual Wilde to prison for ``gross indecency''.
1_15	0.086417018	``The thing that shocked me about the trials of Oscar Wilde was that in reading the transcripts, you did not only see the story of this man's downfall but you saw exactly where Victorian society was at in terms of class, gender, sexuality, the monarchy, imperialism, capitalism,'' Kaufman has said.

2_1	0.37497594	_ In a case that galvanized national outrage over anti-homosexual violence, a 21-year-old roofer pleaded guilty on Monday to kidnapping and murdering a gay college student and was sentenced to serve two consecutive life sentences.
2_2	0.39194986	Escaping a possible death sentence, Russell Henderson was sentenced by District Judge Jeffrey Donnell for his part in the beating and murder of the student, Matthew Shepard, here six months ago.

2_4	0.074555365	``You are deserving the fullest punishment this court can mete out,'' the judge said, after accepting a plea bargain agreement two days before opening arguments were to begin in the case.
2_5	0.16463815	In a sole reference to Shepard's sexual orientation, the judge said the murder was ``part because of his lifestyle, part for a $20 robbery''.
2_6	0.10641663	During an emotion-packed hearing at the Albany County Courthouse here, Henderson turned to Judy and Dennis Shepard and apologized for murdering their 22-year-old son.
2_7	0.22069686	In what may be a preview of his testimony this August at the trial of a second man accused in the case, Henderson described his former workmate, Aaron McKinney, as the mastermind of the Oct.

2_11	0.10496999	In his final comments before the defendant was led away to spend the rest of his life in jail, the judge told him, ``You are not a victim here, Mr.

2_14	0.17312877	In recent weeks, a Wyoming coalition of clergy and a national coalition of gay groups spoke out against applying the death penalty in the Matthew Shepard case, a position they said was in harmony with their wider opposition to capital punishment.
2_15	0.12312343	Compressing an enormous amount of drama into a one-hour hearing, the court proceedings included the Shepards telling Henderson of their deep pain, the defendant giving his first public account of the crime, and his grandmother telling a packed courtoom of a loving young man who grew up in a household free of hate.

2_32	0.10805883	The next day, instead of calling for medical help for Shepard, Henderson said that he and his girl friend, Chasity Pasley, and McKinney's girlfriend, Kristen LeAnn Price, drove 50 miles east to a truck stop in Cheyenne with his bloody clothing ``and put it in a dumpster to cover up that I was out there when Matthew was beaten''.

2_47	0.09318332	In closing, she turned to the judge and begged him not ``to take Russell out of our lives forever''.

2_50	0.084551204	The packed courtroom had scarcely absorbed this appeal, when it was the turn of Henderson, who hoped to earn a slim chance of one day winning parole.
2_51	0.1143637	Standing at the same podium, he turned his back to the judge and addressed Matthew's family, saying, ``Mr.

8_1	0.23887229	For some older protesters, though, the march _ to express outrage over the killing of a gay college student in Wyoming _ was a return to the angry street protests that had so often symbolized the militancy of the gay rights movement.
8_2	0.2147766	As the chaotic denouement of the march and the police response was debated Tuesday, one thing seemed clear: The size of the loosely organized protest showed how the killing of Matthew Shepard has galvanized gay men and lesbians in New York and around the country as has no other single event in recent years.
8_3	0.084807417	The demonstration began at 6 p.m. as a rally in front of the Plaza Hotel on 59th Street near Central Park, then swelled to 5,000 people on Fifth Avenue, blocking traffic.

8_10	0.097238398	The cause of the passion, participants say, is a sense that even as gay people have become more accepted in society than ever before, there are stark reminders of the hatred and violence of the not-so distant past.
8_11	0.12433613	Well before Shepard's murder, a sharp increase in police reports of anti-gay bias crimes in New York City had unsettled gay people, shaking them out of what some call complacency in the years since the height of AIDS activism.

12_7	0.23993941	Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of Wyoming, in Laramie, was fatally attacked a few hours after he had attended a planning meeting for Gay Awareness Week events on campus.

12_10	0.13460898	In that interview, Debree recalled, McKinney said he and Henderson had identified Shepard as a robbery target and had then lured him out of a Laramie bar and into their truck by pretending to be gay.

13_9	0.10572137	Not enough.
13_10	0.10926592	In the aftermath of the Wyoming killing, the same groups that worked overtime to stigmatize gay people have mounted a furious propaganda defense to assert that their words and ads demeaning gay people have nothing to do with any anti-gay crimes.

13_13	0.079380261	As one of their apologists, Hadley Arkes, wrote in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, my columns on this subject are ``vibrant with a hatred of the Family Research Council and evangelical Christians''.
13_14	0.073136846	It's a nice try at changing the subject, but taking a stand against the anti-gay crusade of the political organizations of the religious right is not a stand against Christians, evangelical or otherwise.

13_16	0.075657895	As for the Family Research Council, it is not even a quasi-religious organization but a moneyed secular outfit whose leader, Gary Bauer, wants to be president.
13_17	0.11820325	And the Shepard killing has hardly deterred its demonization of gay people as subhuman.
13_18	0.074153342	One new tack _ according to a council draft document I've seen _ is to show that ``homosexuals are at much greater risk from one another than from bias-related attacks''.
13_19	0.062164003	And so the plan is to inform us that more gay men die of AIDS than of bias-related murders _ a nonsensical pairing intended to brand gay men as diseased.
13_20	0.069829209	Since gay women can't be stigmatized en masse with AIDS, the council had to use real ingenuity to prove that they, too, are vermin at ``much greater risk from one another'' than from gay-bashers.
13_21	0.12950124	The solution turned up in a ``Culture Facts'' newsletter it published only nine days after Matthew Shepard's death and is still posted on its Web site.
13_22	0.08849652	Titled `` `Gay' Violence Escalates,'' it asserts that ``The University of Houston-Downtown in a recent study found that 47.5 percent of lesbian relationships involve some form of domestic abuse,'' compared with 0.22 percent for married women.
13_23	0.068711762	I reached the unnamed source of this ``fact'' in Houston _ Lisa Waldner, an assistant professor of sociology.
13_24	0.094849764	Previously unaware of what she called the council's ``misleading'' use of her work, she told me that this so-called ``recent study'' was a paper she co-wrote as a student in 1992 about the lifetime experiences of a non-random sample of gay people she knew and their circle.
13_25	0.089938391	She said it was wrong to ``say this is the average for all lesbians'' and that the council's comparison of her study with another on married women was meaningless since they used completely different methodologies.

16_1	0.42651223	4: The killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming who in 1998 was beaten, lashed to a fence and left to die, shocked Americans by lifting homophobia to a new level of savagery.

16_5	0.13708204	In their opening statements they argued that McKinney was guilty only of manslaughter because sexual abuse in childhood had caused him to respond in a rage to the victim's alleged homosexual advances.
16_6	0.052069146	The presiding judge, Barton Voigt, rejected that argument as inadmissible at trial, ruling that it amounted to a diminished-capacity or temporary-insanity defense, neither of which is allowed under Wyoming law.
16_7	0.094738243	The ``gay panic'' defense has no statutory basis, but it has been invoked in other cases.
16_8	0.092974466	Typically, the argument is that the attacker, stirred by fears that he is himself homosexual, becomes so offended by what he perceives as a sexual advance that he is provoked to kill the victim.
