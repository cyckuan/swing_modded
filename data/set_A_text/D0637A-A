9_1	3.875	The overcast Netherlands seems an unlikely hot spot for solar energy.
9_2	0.0	Yet the sun's meager offerings are providing electricity and hot water for homes in an expanding enclave of this central city unofficially dubbed the ``solar suburb''.
9_3	0.3157894736842105	With solar collectors and panels sprouting from rooftops and roadsides across the Netherlands, some say solar power could one day overshadow wind turbines, the modern cousins of the storied Dutch windmills.
9_4	0.0	``Holland is a very busy country with a lot of people and little space,'' says Stefan Wink at Novem, a Dutch environmental agency.
9_5	0.3333333333333333	``It's not easy to get space for wind turbines.
9_6	5.166666666666667	With solar energy, the advantage is that there are a lot of houses''.
9_7	0.3125	That means a lot of rooftops for solar panels, which convert the sun's rays to electricity, and solar collectors, which heat water piped through them.
9_8	0.0	Hundreds of houses already have them to supplement electricity and natural gas.
9_9	0.0	And an estimated 26,000 Dutch homeowners like Van Stigt have had their water-heating systems fitted with solar boilers.
9_10	0.0	The highly insulated boilers circulate solar-warmed water around an inner tank to heat up tap water for the house; a natural gas burner kicks in if there isn't enough sunlight.
9_11	0.0	``It's running almost as soon as the sun goes up,'' says Van Stigt, an environmental science teacher.
9_12	0.0	``It functions whenever there is light _ cloudy or not''.
9_13	0.0	Of course, the sun alone can't run every hair dryer and stereo system.
9_14	0.5	But solar power will allow the Dutch to cut their use of conventional energy and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, says Lex Bosselaar, spokesman for Novem's solar thermal energy program.
9_15	0.0	``You can feel every day when you're taking a shower that you're doing something for the environment,'' he says.
9_16	0.0	Nearly 60 percent of the Netherlands' electricity is produced by burning natural gas, followed by coal, 28 percent; nuclear, 5 percent; oil, 4.6 percent; burning waste products, 2.4 percent; and wind, 0.5 percent.
9_17	3.875	Solar energy accounts for just.002 percent now, but is expected to rise over the next decade.
9_18	0.0	The Economic Affairs Ministry is crusading to have 10 percent of the country's energy needs come from sustainable resources by 2010.
9_19	0.25	Wind turbines are part of the plans.

9_25	0.0	``Now the architects are trying to use the panels to make the homes look different and special,'' she says.
9_26	0.0	Construction on 500 dwellings with the highly visible panels began in December, and the 28 million guilder (dlrs 14 million) project is expected to be finished in the summer of 1999.
9_27	0.16	Once completed, Nieuwland will boast a total of 15,000 square meters (162,000 square feet) of solar panels, generating electricity and sending it to the main power grid for redistribution to Nieuwland's homes.

9_30	0.0	``It's still a rather small business, but the potential market is huge''.
9_31	1.2916666666666667	In spring and summer, when the sun shines the most, the local energy supplier, REMU, pays homeowners 25 cents (US 12 cents) per kilowatt hour for the solar energy their rooftop panels feed into the grid.
9_32	0.0	That helps offset solar homeowners' energy bills for fall and winter, when Holland is extra-cloudy and they have to buy more conventional power from REMU.
9_33	0.0	Cost-efficient solar boilers save the average homeowner 140 guilders (dlrs 70) a year on natural gas costs.

9_35	0.0	Few people can afford the 50,000 guilder (dlrs 25,000) price tag on the finest solar technology now available: a system capable of meeting 80 percent of a house's energy needs.
9_36	0.0	So Boxhoorn counsels compromise.
9_37	0.0	``If we reduce the number of panels so they generate 10 percent of the energy, the price is roughly 6,000 guilders (dlrs 3,000),'' he says.
