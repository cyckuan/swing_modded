4_0	0.22679164	WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, accepting endorsements from hundreds of Latino leaders, warned Tuesday that Republican-sponsored tax cuts, the GOP's opposition to census sampling and Texas Gov.
4_1	0.081924752	George Bush's education proposals could wipe out economic gains made by Hispanics under administration policies.
4_2	0.18822615	Gore's warnings came as his presidential campaign launched ``Ganamos con Gore'' (''We win with Gore''), a nationwide effort to build on the political organizations of the nearly 600 Hispanic elected officials and community leaders who endorsed the vice president Tuesday.
4_3	0.098445697	Gore said federal tax credit payments to the poor have been the ``single most beneficial economic change'' for Hispanics and other working poor families over the last two decades.
4_4	0.083369318	But he noted that House Republicans are considering plans to delay billions of dollars in those tax credit payments in order to pay for other federal spending and to help finance a tax cut that Gore described as ``risky'' to the current economic expansion.
4_5	0.094343949	The vice president also said GOP-sponsored tax cuts could lead to reductions in federal aid to education.
4_6	0.082294458	And while he did not mention Bush by name, he noted that ``some Republican candidates stand and pretend to support public education while at the same time supporting this risky tax scheme that would devastate public education in this country''.
4_7	0.07875406	He also criticized the kind of education policy recently outlined by Bush, in which federal dollars would be diverted from failing public schools to private schools that are not required to admit all students.
4_8	0.069979131	``It's the strangest education I've ever seen because they are claiming they can add by subtracting and dividing,'' he said.
4_9	0.082997749	Gore also questioned how any GOP presidential candidate could stand by the efforts of House Republicans to stop the Census Bureau from using statistical sampling in order to avoid the kind of undercounting of minorities that has occurred in the last two census counts.
4_10	0.072458654	``How can anyone look at the extra problems and challenges facing the Latino community and come to the conclusion that...
4_11	0.070730309	they cannot support a fair and accurate census,'' Gore said.
4_12	0.088922965	``I don't think anyone can claim to be a friend of the Latino community while simultaneously supporting an approach to the census which is designed to intentionally undercount Latinos''.

4_19	0.084915628	But in reminding the crowd that Gore has stood against Republican initiatives that were widely viewed as anti-immigrant in the Hispanic community since the GOP takeover of Congress in 1994, Menendez asked, ``Where were those who want our votes now who should have been at our side defending us then''?
4_20	0.13484698	Bradley retired from the Senate in 1996, briefly mulled an independent run for president, then spent time lecturing at Stanford University in California before deciding to challenge Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination.
