13_14	0.2777777777777778	The PATH report assumed that salmon that are barged through the lower Snake River dams are considerably less likely to survive a round-trip to the Pacific Ocean than non-barged fish.

13_18	0.08333333333333333	Those caveats aside, the Marine Fisheries Service confirmed that ``breaching meets recovery and survival goals over the widest range and highest proportion of assumptions'' for the spring-summer chinook, the best-known and most numerous salmon the Snake River.
