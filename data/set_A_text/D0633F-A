6_1	1.2222222222222223	The overall violent crime rate -- 566 murders, rapes, robberies and assaults per 100,000 residents -- dropped to its lowest level since 1985, according to the report.
6_2	0.3333333333333333	The national total of seven serious violent and property crimes reported to police around the country was about 12 million in 1998, down 5.4 percent from the previous year and 12 percent from 1989, the FBI said.
6_3	0.4444444444444444	A total of 16,914 murders were reported last year -- one murder every 31 minutes, but it still was the lowest murder rate -- six slayings for every 100,000 people -- since 1967.
6_4	0.3448275862068966	Attorney General Janet Reno attributed the decline of crime rate to "more police officers on the street, greater partnerships between law enforcement agencies, continued efforts to keep guns away from criminals, and a balanced approach that includes prevention, intervention, punishment and supervision".

7_3	0.4166666666666667	WCBS-TV, Channel 2 in New York City, chose a different story to lead its 6 p.m. newscast on July 30: Seven women had been harassed over the previous two months on a jogging path in Westchester County.
7_4	0.0	Once, a man fondled himself as a woman passed by.
7_5	0.0	Several other times, someone tried without success to grab one of the women, the station reported.
7_6	0.2	Since no one had been hurt or arrested (police were not even sure if they had one or several suspects), the incidents might seem an odd choice as the top news in the nation's largest city.
7_7	1.1538461538461537	In the early 1990s, when the New York crime rate was much higher, the report would have been unlikely to make the broadcast, much less lead it.
7_8	0.9444444444444444	The selection reflects some of the significant changes on New York's television news broadcasts and in its newspapers as the city's crime rate has dropped for the last half-dozen years.
7_9	0.0	The crime stories reported by the local news organizations these days are noticeably different, having a greater emphasis on sexual attacks and child abuse.
7_10	0.0	There are more reports on crimes in the suburbs and the outer reaches of the region, as well as stepped-up coverage of the inner workings of the Police Department itself, including police misconduct.
7_11	0.6875	But it is in the sheer numbers of reports about crime _ particularly in New York City's three major daily newspapers _ where change is most pronounced.
7_12	0.34782608695652173	In the first two weeks of May 1994, for example, there were 120 articles on crimes in the city in The New York Daily News, The New York Post and The New York Times.
7_13	0.0	In the first two weeks of May this year, there were only a third as many articles about crime in the three newspapers: 44 altogether, including several on crimes in the suburbs.
7_14	0.0	On many days in May, there was no crime news at all in The Daily News or The Post, where once it was a staple.
7_15	0.0	On local television news, which has been criticized for years for its daily diet of murder and mayhem, there appears to be a reduction as well, though much more modest.
7_16	0.4444444444444444	It is impossible to quantify, because news directors at New York's major network-owned stations refused to make available videotapes or written records of old broadcasts.
7_17	0.0	There is no rigorous independent survey that analyzed the contents of local news four or more years ago.
7_18	0.058823529411764705	But many current and former television news executives say that for many years at least 30 percent to 40 percent of the reports on local newscasts were about crime.
7_19	0.3333333333333333	The New York Times analyzed 20 news broadcasts on the three network-owned stations with the largest audiences _WCBS-TV, WNBC-TV and WABC-TV _ over four weeks this summer, and crime was the subject of 27 percent of the reports.
7_20	0.0	On some evenings, reports about crime represented a majority of the reports on local news shows, and many minutes of air time at the start of the broadcasts were devoted to them.
7_21	0.0	But on other nights, crime news was relatively brief and came late in the shows.
7_22	1.2352941176470589	These changes are largely a consequence of the remarkable decline of violent crime in New York, where the number of killings has diminished from 2,245 in 1990 to 767 last year.
7_23	0.0	At the current rate, there would be fewer than 600 this year, the lowest total in three decades.
7_24	0.0	Alterations in news coverage also reflect deliberate decisions, especially by people who manage local television news operations, to adjust somewhat the tone and content of their daily reports.
7_25	0.0	``There is a positive feeling overall, and I think reporters and editors come into the workplace feeling that, because we all live in the same community,'' said WCBS-TV news director Bill Carey.
7_26	0.0	``We look for stories that are relevant to the life that we live''.
7_27	0.0	Many reporters and editors say the changes are also the result of police department policies that make it more difficult to get information on crime and access to police officials.
7_28	0.5555555555555556	Six or seven years ago, when there were nearly six killings a day in New York City, on average, the basic question for crime reporters was which of the grisly homicides to cover.
7_29	0.0	There was seldom time to report on other kinds of crime or on the Police Department as an institution.
7_30	0.0	Crime news often crowded out other subjects on television.
7_31	0.0	``Today, there is less and less crime that is worthy of any coverage,'' said Bart Feder, news director at Channel 7, WABC-TV.
7_32	0.0	``This is an opportunity to fill the shows in a more interesting and diverse way.
7_33	0.0	I think there is more commitment at all the stations to enterprise reporting, to investigative reporting, to honest-to-goodness journalism''.
7_34	0.7692307692307693	Feder's counterparts at other New York City stations offer the same assessment, and on some nights there is evidence to buttress their view.
7_35	0.0	But careful viewing of the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. news shows also offered considerable evidence to the contrary.
7_36	0.1111111111111111	Some nights, local stations compensate for the murder gap by covering crimes committed in other places and by reporting on local crimes that, not long ago, would have passed unnoticed.
7_37	0.0	A few weeks ago, for example, Channel 7 sent a reporter to Westchester for a long piece on the expanded use of unmarked police cars on highways to counter road rage.
7_38	0.05	Local stations also reported in recent weeks on the arrest of a man in Freehold, N.J., accused of stabbing his wife, a sexual assault on an employee of a Bronx motel and a double homicide in Bayonne, N.J.
7_39	0.0	But there were also recent examples of more ambitious journalism on local stations, reports on serious subjects that might have had difficulty getting on the air when television news was overwhelmed by body bags.
7_40	0.0	On Aug.
7_41	0.6875	28, Channel 4 broadcast a long report on how the stock market's slide might affect New York City's budget.
7_42	0.0	The previous week, a Channel 4 reporter assessed the accuracy of campaign advertisements by Democratic candidates for governor and the U.S.
7_43	0.0	Senate. nn Many journalism professors and critics contend there is still too much crime on local television.
7_44	0.0	``There's no question that it is still the predominant item,'' said David Klatell, head of the broadcast program at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism.
7_45	0.0	``Television news has always been a much more emotive and emotional medium than a logical one, and so the fear of crime persists even if the reality doesn't.
7_46	0.0	It's much easier to cover crime than to cover the school system or race relations''.
7_47	0.0	Klatell worked with a group of academic researchers who began to study the content of local television news two years ago.
7_48	0.0	They analyzed broadcasts in eight cities on four nights during the 1996-1997 television season.
7_49	0.5882352941176471	The survey showed that 27.2 percent of the air time on New York City newscasts was devoted to crime, well above the eight-city average of 20.2 percent.
7_50	0.0	A similar analysis of the television season that ended last spring is not finished.
7_51	0.0	Some former broadcast executives credit NY1 News, the all-news cable station, with influencing coverage on the larger network-owned stations.
7_52	0.0	Since it started in 1992, NY1 has tried to balance crime news with beat reporting on everything from government and schools to the subway and neighborhoods.
7_53	0.0	Steve Paulus, the senior vice president for news at NY1, said that his station was devoting less time to crime these days.
7_54	0.0	``Where a police reporter would have covered the crime of the day,'' he said, ``the police reporter is now more likely to be covering police department issues''.
7_55	0.8	Paradoxically, the reduced crime rate may sometimes cause journalists to react more strongly to major crimes.
7_56	0.0625	The decline in crime means that ``those that do occur take on a prominence, seem more newsworthy than they did in the past,'' said Daily News managing editor Arthur Browne.
7_57	0.0	``There is an added shock value now when they happen''.
7_58	0.0625	Many reporters who regularly cover the police say that another factor in the decline of crime news is that the police share information less readily and are generally less cooperative.
7_59	0.0	Some police reporters said that they could usually get enough information to report breaking crime news, but that it was often difficult if not impossible to learn enough for analytic or other enterprise articles.
7_60	0.42105263157894735	``This administration has made a concerted drive to keep bad news out of the papers and off the screen,'' said Gabe Pressman, the veteran television reporter who is president of the New York Press Club.
7_61	0.2	Whether it is by design or by chance, the decrease of crime news in the city's papers is startling.
7_62	0.0	On May 4, for example, there was a single crime article in The Daily News, buried deep on page 24: a 13-year-old Long Island boy had been shot in the shoulder by a stray bullet, possibly from a nearby shooting range.
7_63	0.0	The Times, in its local pages, had one reference to crime: a few sentences on a sexual abuse case in Syracuse.

7_67	0.0	The Times carried an article on the substitute teacher on page B1.
7_68	0.4	That week, and the following one, the front pages of New York's tabloids _ where crime once was king _ were taken up with the Knicks' playoff chances, new cancer drugs and the final episode of ``Seinfeld''.

7_70	0.0	``One is that the reality has changed and news reflects reality.
7_71	0.0	I tend to doubt that.
7_72	0.0	The other is that competitive organizational pressures in the news business are responsible for the waxing and waning of crime coverage''.
7_73	0.38095238095238093	Stephens, who has a new book on video and television called ``The Rise of the Image the Fall of the Word,'' said the arrival of New York Newsday in the 1980s led to a brutal circulation war in the city.
7_74	0.0	In time-honored American fashion, he said, newspapers sought circulation by concentrating on crime.
7_75	0.6153846153846154	The death of New York Newsday eased the circulation wars, he said, reducing pressure on editors to pursue crime.
7_76	0.8181818181818182	Stephens also offered a second theory for the diminished attention to crime by the New York news organizations.
7_77	0.0	``Maybe people are feeling less paranoid,'' he said, ``and it is harder to push those buttons''.

11_0	0.7222222222222222	LOS ANGELES, February 2 (Xinhua) -- California and the rest of the United States have reported continuing drop in crime rates, but it seems difficult for police as well as criminologists to explain why.
11_1	0.2857142857142857	California state law enforcement authorities point to community policing and tougher sentences as the primary factors for the drop of crime.
11_2	0.3684210526315789	But even law enforcement-oriented sources note that increase in police staffing levels and hard-line enforcement and prosecution policies fail to totally account for falling crime rates.
11_3	0.0	Perhaps there is not a single soundbite that has the answer.
11_4	0.0	Nationwide, the recent improvement in the economy, age-demographics, gang-war cycles, the waning interest in drugs like crack, and community policing are often used by experts to explain the decline.

11_10	0.0	A study of declining homicide rate in seven cities by the National Institute of Justice also found a potential connection between employment and crime.
11_11	0.0	But this hypothesis does not apply to some cities, where economic conditions have improved since 1992 but some crimes climbed steeply.
11_12	0.7	The country's aging population is also a common explanation for falling crime rates.
11_13	0.0	According to this hypothesis, the number of people between the ages of 18 and 40, an age group in which most potential offenders are to be found, has declined by more than seven percent since 1990.
11_14	0.631578947368421	Another possible cause for the crime rate cut is the decline in the nation's crack cocaine problem, which is associated with large increase in violence crime among young people in the 1980s.
11_15	0.25	Law enforcement advocates tend to credit the recent apparent decline in crime to a nationwide tougher sentencing laws and more aggressive policing strategies.
11_16	0.16666666666666666	U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, noting that crime had decreased steadily since 1994, one said that tougher sentences and hiring more local police officers are "one of the most important reason".

11_19	0.4666666666666667	Critics of the law say that it has had a minimal impact on crime rates, but has tied up public resources on prison expansion and construction that could have been used on other governmental programs.

12_8	0.9444444444444444	Law enforcement officials attribute the continued drop in crime rates to a healthy economy, crime prevention programs, tougher sentences and more police officers on the street.

16_168	0.17647058823529413	But the criminal justice system's special treatment of crack cocaine dramatically threw off the balance, according to reports by the Sentencing Commission and the Justice Department.
16_169	0.0	For people convicted of a crack offense, the world of justice is unlike any other.
16_170	0.0	Crack is simply cocaine processed so that it can be smoked.

16_178	0.0	But in absolute numbers, twice as many whites as blacks use crack, and three times as many whites as blacks use powder cocaine, the national household survey shows.
16_179	0.125	As the war on drugs set up special penalties on crack, however, law enforcement focused on the highly visible, often violent crack trade in city neighborhoods, rather than the larger traffic in cocaine going on behind closed doors across the country.

23_11	1.2222222222222223	Although the city's violent crime rate has dropped consistently in last decade (it dropped 20 percent overall between 1990 and 1997), it still lags behind the other largest cities.

24_0	1.2272727272727273	WASHINGTON _ The nation's overall crime rate in 1997 fell for the sixth consecutive year, with the rate of violent crimes such as murders and robberies showing the sharpest drop, the FBI reported Sunday.
24_1	0.9090909090909091	The nation's big cities experienced the steepest decline in their crime rate, with a 5 percent drop, while suburban counties saw a decrease of 4 percent, and rural areas were down 1 percent.
24_2	0.18181818181818182	Criminal experts and law enforcement officials attributed the drop to several factors, including the aging of baby boomers, increased incarceration of criminals, declining use of crack, additional police officers and better policing methods.
24_3	1.1904761904761905	Overall, the rate of violent crimes fell 4 percent from 1996, helping to push down the overall U.S. crime rate by 3 percent, its lowest level in over a decade, the FBI reported.
24_4	0.16666666666666666	Murders fell by more than 7 percent to 18,209.

24_9	0.0	In the coming years, these declines could turn quickly''.
24_10	1.0	Fox and other crime experts said two dominant trends are influencing the nation's crime rate.
24_11	0.0625	First, the aging of the baby boom generation, which makes up 25 percent of the population, has pushed down the number of crimes because adults tend to be less violent than juveniles.
24_12	0.3333333333333333	At the same time, the number of crimes committed by teen-agers has risen sharply since the mid-1980s.
24_13	0.9	The number of murders committed by teen-agers increased 145 percent between 1985 and 1995.
24_14	1.0	And although the number of violent crimes committed by juveniles has fallen slightly in the past two years, the number of teen-agers will grow quickly over the next decade.
24_15	0.0	Currently, there are 40 million children under the age of 10 nationwide.
24_16	0.7	Fox said future crime rates will be determined by how society deals with the rising tide of teen-agers over the next decade.
24_17	0.6363636363636364	``Right now, crime rates peak in the couple of hours between the end of school and when most parents get home for dinner,'' he said.
24_18	0.0	``That tells you that our children are not getting enough supervision from their parents''.
24_19	0.0	At a press conference Thursday, Attorney General Janet Reno warned Americans not to ``relax their vigilance about crime, about enforcement, about prevention''.
24_20	0.13333333333333333	She said the large number of people growing through their teens and early 20s over the next decade presents law enforcement officials with a challenge, but that these kids do not have to become criminals.
24_21	0.0	``We've got to make sure, as we have more young people, that we have more programs for them, more opportunities to give them a strong and positive future,'' Reno said.
24_22	0.4666666666666667	All regions of the country saw crime rates fall in 1997, with the Northeast experiencing the largest drop, 5 percent, the FBI report said.
24_23	0.6153846153846154	The crime rate in the West and South declined nearly 3 percent, while the Midwest saw a drop of 2 percent.
