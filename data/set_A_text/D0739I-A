0_1	0.099557236	It says everything about his humor that the only topical joke came by request, and even then it wasn't a genuine Clinton joke.
0_2	0.08304603	He veered smoothly away from politics into typical Seinfeld territory, wryly observing the manners and absurdities of contemporary life.
0_3	0.080452939	``Everyone lies about sex,'' he said.
0_4	0.072451628	``People lie &UR; during &LR; sex.
0_5	0.081939037	If it weren't for lies, there'd &UR; be &LR; no sex''.
0_6	0.095077142	Those jokes were recycled from a news conference promoting the live telecast of this show (Sunday night 9 on HBO), but no matter.
0_7	0.14557162	Freshness is precisely not the point of ``Jerry Seinfeld: `I'm Telling You For the Last Time' _ Live on Broadway''.
0_8	0.072666734	Looking backward is.
0_9	0.19594869	New York is the last stop and Sunday's live television show the final performance in a two-month world tour.
0_10	0.10467701	That amounts to a farewell tour for this material, which Seinfeld has said he will retire.
0_11	0.089843526	These Broadway performances hold no clue to his future, but they say a lot about his past.
0_12	0.089227155	He comes full circle here, back to the stand-up routines that inspired his phenomenally successful sitcom.
0_13	0.12256699	He did, after all, play a stand-up comic named Jerry Seinfeld in the series, and in its early years each episode began and ended with sitcom Jerry offering a snippet of his act.
0_14	0.081174329	On Broadway, that act has a familiar but still funny feel, with material long-honed and often recognizable from the series, talk show appearances and his best-selling book ``Seinlanguage''.
0_15	0.079535767	In Australia, he visited the great Barrier Reef ; in Iceland, he worked the word Reykjavikians into the routine; in Des Moines, Iowa, he gave away all the tickets.
0_16	0.07797904	Most shows on the tour sold out; some didn't.
0_17	0.10570847	But New York is home, the audience was primed to adore him, and all he really had to do was show up.
0_18	0.07344675	He did more.
0_19	0.082905267	Relaxed, with impeccable timing, he gave a warm but controlled, hour-long performance built on small, shrewdly targeted observations.
0_20	0.08896703	And now that the cloud of hype that covered the final ``Seinfeld'' episode is receding, the performance highlights why he became immensely popular in the first place and how influential his style of stand-up has become.
0_21	0.086653401	He began with a line only New Yorkers could love, in language so purely Seinfeld that it can only be a self-reference: ``So what's with the cabbies and the b.o''.?
0_22	0.083608732	He went on to talk about the lunacy of astronauts taking a car to the moon, and the instructions given by flight attendents: ``They show you how to use a seatbelt in case you haven't been in a car since 1965''.
0_23	0.085513785	There is little danger of giving away the best jokes, because he has already given away so many himself.
0_24	0.086985795	It is nearly impossible to give away the punchlines because the essence of his style is that he has none.
0_25	0.087832711	``Tell you what I like about Chinese people, they're hanging in there with the chopsticks,'' he says, even though, ``They've seen the fork''.
0_26	0.097401163	In a dark suit and tie, stand-up Jerry is better dressed than sitcom Jerry ever was.
0_27	0.08137392	And he makes more funny faces.
0_28	0.0875527	He imitated a turtle making change, offered the voice of a sarcastic horse, as well as the pinched face of a neighbor's pet monkey.
0_29	0.087704586	``That's the look you have on your face when you're that close to being the dominant species on the planet and you didn't make it''.
0_30	0.088855746	He interacted with the audience just enough to seem warm, but not so much that he lost control.
0_31	0.093276338	To someone who threw a business card with a scribbled note on stage he said: ``No, I'm not going to read it.
0_32	0.087817218	I'm busy''!
0_33	0.092376039	Scads of comedians are now doing what Seinfeld made popular, relying on dry observations rather than jokey punch lines.
0_34	0.089380654	His opening act on Broadway (there will be none for the HBO show), the comedian Kevin Meaney, whipped the audience up with a frenetic energy that semeed conspicuously old-fashioned next to the cool Seinfeld style, even though Meaney's routine came with deliberately retro touches, such as his maroon jacket and bow tie, and a routine in which he pretends to sing a duet with Frank Sinatra.
0_35	0.10999392	Though Seinfeld has his routine down, each performance varies a bit, so Sunday's televised show is not entirely predictable.
0_36	0.096845225	The HBO show will include a brief filmed opening with Seinfeld and unannounced guests (not from the cast of ``Seinfeld'').
0_37	0.11752521	On stage, he said of the HBO special: ``It's live.
0_38	0.084994696	When I screw up, you see it''.
0_39	0.089561882	He's not likely to flub such a well-crafted routine, though it's just as well that he's putting the material out to pasture.
0_40	0.097165699	After these long Seinfeld goodbyes, it's time for something new, maybe even risky.
0_41	0.10235145	One of the funniest recent Seinfeld appearances comes in a promo for Sunday's show, in which he pretends to have taken up painting as his next career.
0_42	0.088940831	He splashes cans of paint wildy on a canvas while a proper visitor, played by Marian Seldes, asks whether he'll go back to stand-up if the art thing doesn't work out.
0_43	0.079488254	``How could it not work out''? he wonders.
0_44	0.085185449	He looks goofily pleased with himself, with a wild-eyed glimpse of inspiration at the thought of something new.
0_45	0.075620659	It may be a goof, but it holds promise.

2_0	0.29256333	&UR; &LR; NEW YORK _ Jerry Seinfeld, the star of one of the most succesful shows in television history, says he'll never do another situation comedy.
2_1	0.082078474	``I can't imagine doing another one.
2_2	0.11190196	Only an idiot would think they could do better,'' said Seinfeld, during a press conference Tuesday, promoting his Sunday night live (9 p.m).
2_3	0.16397028	HBO special, ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time''.
2_4	0.074839566	Wearing white slacks with a navy polo shirt under a gray jacket, the 44-year-old comedian joked and jostled with the media over subjects ranging from sex to money.
2_5	0.1428424	While Seinfeld says he misses some of the things about the ending of the phenomenal run of ``Seinfeld'' after 140 episodes, he's relieved it's over.
2_6	0.095179383	``Did you ever take a dog to the park and take his leash off,'' he asked asked rhetorically.
2_7	0.073658642	``The dog looks up for a minute then bolts like a maniac''.
2_8	0.090326803	Accompanied by by HBO's Marty Callner, who will be directing the special live, Seinfeld explained that returning to stand-up was liberating.
2_9	0.093854531	For nine years he worked on a show with 100 crew members, a dozen writers, and the cast.
2_10	0.077456431	``That was very much a group thing,'' he said.
2_11	0.076184333	``Now I feel like the leash is off''.
2_12	0.072362025	He has no plans to take a vacation.
2_13	0.073501468	``I've been on beaches,'' he said.
2_14	0.082620159	``I've been on boats''.
2_15	0.075237205	Then he shrugged his shoulders.
2_16	0.098587264	While Seinfeld is not retiring from stand-up, he is retiring all the material from Sunday night's program.
2_17	0.07759073	``You'll never hear these jokes again,'' he promised.
2_18	0.085508997	He's planning to work on another special, presumably for HBO, during the next eight months, and put out a comedy album based on Sunday's performance.
2_19	0.12807913	Tickets for the concert at the Broadhurst Theater are hot.
2_20	0.12933548	The New York Attorney General's office is investigating ticket scalping.
2_21	0.086126059	The going street rate for a ticket is $1,500, nearly 20 times the face value.
2_22	0.091676229	Seinfeld is donating all of the proceeds from the concert to PENCIL (Public Education Needs Civic Involvement in Learning).
2_23	0.088956052	``I didn't invent scalping, '' he said, pausing just long enough for everyone to realize the absurdity of the situation.
2_24	0.078075708	``I don't really have any control over it''.
2_25	0.093075263	While ``Seinfeld'' will never be considered controversial, the show did run into trouble with an episode in which Kramer accidentally set a Puerto Rican flag on fire.
2_26	0.084229625	``I liked that episode,'' said Seinfeld.
2_27	0.096178704	``People forget that in that episode Kramer was really looking forward to the Puerto Rican Day parade and that the whole thing was an accident''.
2_28	0.093250375	When asked if the protest of the episode by some Puerto Ricans was legitimate or a politically correct over-reaction, Seinfeld raised his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders.
2_29	0.09066007	While Seinfeld said that he doesn't have a favorite episode, he did recall with great affection the one in which he mugs an elderly woman for her loaf of marble rye.
2_30	0.087641598	``They brought in snow and we had snowball fights at five in the morning, and I was trying to throw a loaf of rye bread up to the fourth floor,'' he said.
2_31	0.083936599	``It was just fun''.
2_32	0.11203108	Seinfeld refused to confirm the rumors that cast members from the show, particularly Jason Alexander, might appear for his HBO special.
2_33	0.086473785	``If I named who might come, it wouldn't be a suprise,'' he said.
2_34	0.091485116	``How can there be suprise guests if there are no suprises''?
2_35	0.080135354	Other Seinfeld observations: On fame: ``I've been anonymous.

3_3	0.093766431	Seinfeld was en route from New York to Albuquerque, N.M., in a 1973 Volkswagen Beetle this week when he decided to pull into this country music town to see an old friend and collect on a gold mine of potential material.
3_4	0.14527032	On Tuesday, Seinfeld took in a show at the Bobby Vinton Theater.
3_5	0.095001002	Seinfeld and Vinton used to play in Las Vegas at the same time, said Chris Vinton, the pop singer's son.
3_6	0.088762653	Seinfeld ''said he was really excited about being in Branson and was somewhat overwhelmed by it and surprised by how sophisticated the facilities are,'' Chris Vinton said.
4_0	0.096721304	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) --Television viewers still in withdrawal over the end of ``Seinfeld'' could have gotten a quick fix -- in Romania.
4_1	0.083190711	The hugely successful American sitcom also is this nation's most popular comedy program, and private station ProTV aired a five-hour special Sunday to mark more than a year of broadcasting the show.
4_2	0.11758307	Twelve people competed as lookalikes of the Seinfeld characters Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer.
4_3	0.17020776	One, a 31-year-old sketch artist, won a trip to New York for his resemblance to Jerry Seinfeld.
4_4	0.07951907	Seinfeld's jokes have struck Romanians' funnybones.
4_5	0.098478306	Friends often gather to watch the show and many of the expressions, including the famous ``yada yada yada,'' have become hip.
4_6	0.080682958	``Seinfeld's kind of humor is different.
4_7	0.088451125	It's for people with brains and I consider it the best comedy show ever made,'' said Ilie Vornicu, 24, a geology student.
5_0	0.08321129	That pretty much sums up Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm.
5_1	0.081552996	The one-hour special contains some laugh-out-loud moments but also some long stretches of humor-free aridness.
5_2	0.080823098	One crucial difference: Curb Your Enthusiasm violates half of David's famous no-hugging, no-learning rule of television.
5_3	0.27076146	``There was some hugging at the end of the show,'' David said in a conference call.
5_4	0.077946422	``It was as insincere as you could get.
5_5	0.090507454	Insin cere hugging is al lowed''.
5_6	0.080964469	Although David, who penned some of Seinfeld's most darkly brilliant ep isodes, is more or less the model for George Costanza, he is also a former stand-up comedian himself.
5_7	0.08101246	He hadn't performed onstage for 10 years and mentioned to a friend that he was thinking about giv ing it another shot.
5_8	0.072954997	``He said, `You should film it,' '' David said.
5_9	0.074010429	``Like everything else, I was reluctant at first.
5_10	0.079447482	The more people I asked about it, everyone seemed to think it was a good idea.
5_11	0.086688926	I thought it was a way to motivate me to get on stage''.
5_12	0.07179184	However, he wasn't interested in the standard film-the-comedian-telling-jokes format.
5_13	0.09367758	``I wanted to do something different,'' he said, ``rather than the straight stand-up show.
5_14	0.077276991	Then, I started to think I needed some other stuff in there, what we were going to do offstage.
5_15	0.075960017	We couldn't just follow me around the supermarket shopping, so I had to come up with some stuff''.
5_16	0.12675412	``Some stuff' wound up being about 90 per cent of the show, with the stand-up routines in New York and LA only a small part (a ratio close to the early episodes of Seinfeld as well).
5_17	0.079532843	Curb Your Enthusiasm turned out to be mostly a mock LA documentary _ totally unscripted _ about David's return to stand-up.
5_18	0.084556502	``It's not totally mock,'' David said, stressing that revealing just what is real and what isn't would spoil the fun for viewers.
5_19	0.076660582	``Certainly, the stand-up is real.
5_20	0.080143787	I would say that there are elements in there that are real.
5_21	0.07504279	Most of it's embellished, but some of it's real''.
5_22	0.10219137	Part of the genuineness, David said, is his person ality.
5_23	0.10536511	``It's not that much of a character,'' he said of the Larry David we see on-screen.
5_24	0.083292587	``I'm not re ally stretching there.
5_25	0.10058549	That's pretty much who I am''.
5_26	0.086944304	That Larry David wanders around a good bit, mumbling about life and its foibles, sounding remarkably like a certain bespectacled, balding, chunky, self-proclaimed loser from a late, great hit TV series.
5_27	0.085112551	``I really resent that `who's call ing'?
5_28	0.076768694	'' he says while making a phone call.
5_29	0.083944825	``Like some people are good enough to make the cut''.
5_30	0.0982123	Jason Alexander, who played George on Seinfeld, makes an ap pearance, commenting on David.
5_31	0.092578877	So does Jerry himself, who relates that during his early stand-up days, Da vid referred to the audience as ``you people''.
5_32	0.078584294	Other comedians show up, as well, including Richard Lewis.
5_33	0.08054852	``He was a phenomenon,'' Lewis says of David.
5_34	0.090254814	``He just couldn't get over the hump that comedians have to perform in front of other people''.
5_35	0.094000125	David called his stand-up career ``the epitome of a love-hate rela tionship''.
5_36	0.088428873	``It's the kind of thing where you walk around at times when it's not going well, you blame it on the au dience,'' he said.
5_37	0.10311473	``You think the whole world must be stupid or you stink and have no talent.
5_38	0.10439608	``When it's going well, you think that you're the greatest thing on two feet and everybody's brilliant.
5_39	0.080426459	.. . It's very extreme thinking''.
5_40	0.097101355	Part of the special concerns other comics telling David how the clubs have changed in the 10 years since he has been onstage.
5_41	0.077762292	Of course, David's life has changed as well.
5_42	0.077444646	Seinfeld has made him a wealthy man, in deed.
5_43	0.089287188	But that's the only change, he said.
5_44	0.08801815	``I'm pretty much the same, but I can get dental work in my house now,'' he said.
5_45	0.078033093	``That's the difference''.
5_46	0.10023769	David left Seinfeld after the infa mous season-ending episode in which George's fiancee dies after licking bargain-basement envelopes, and the show lost its dark New York heart, which made it so funny.
5_47	0.08730662	He famously returned for the series-ending show, which managed to combine excessive hype and mini mal laughs for one of TV's biggest flops.
5_48	0.084925813	David naturally begs to differ.
5_49	0.1068009	``I couldn't be more pleased with it,'' he said of the final episode.
5_50	0.085000438	``First of all, the fact that so many people didn't like it?
5_51	0.082580157	I loved that.
5_52	0.083502136	It accomplished everything I think a finale should accomplish''.
5_53	0.089663478	Then he must be delighted with Curb Your Enthusiasm, because it's far funnier than Seinfeld's finale.
5_54	0.08165665	Then again, how could it not be?

6_1	0.087687968	_ Phil Morris must have found the whole thing professionally unsettling or, at least, personally amusing.
6_2	0.084555969	One moment he's a B-list actor whose last TV credit was The Love Boat: The Next Wave on a D-list network.
6_3	0.14378554	The next, he's resurrecting his recurring Seinfeld character, a trigger-happy lawyer named Jackie Chiles, to star in an NBC sitcom executive-produced by Jerry Seinfeld and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David.
6_4	0.082074819	And slated for 8:30 Thursday nights, no less.
6_5	0.07432279	Reporters who normally scurry by Morris en route to a higher-grade celebrity are sticking tape recorders in his face and clamoring for more specifics concerning the big announcement that's really no announcement at all.
6_6	0.08859856	Says Morris, as a joke, I hope: ``This whole thing could be wrapped up by the time I make it home''.
6_7	0.0830508	He's referring to his pretentiously sordid profession, a business in which the art of the deal can be something of a bizarre art form in itself.
6_8	0.07493373	That no matter how much talent you have, or how decorative a resume you possess, you're only as valuable as you're perceived to be.
6_9	0.071767751	Read on and this might make sense yet.
6_10	0.081466961	Morris hasn't signed anything for anyone.
6_11	0.081276174	In fact, he hasn't even met formally with Seinfeld or David or NBC about a comedy series based on the wacky attorney, last seen as a rather funny punch line in a Honda TV ad.
6_12	0.085020557	Yet as newspapers ran the item, entertainment television picked up the story.
6_13	0.07849656	And as one cable executive said while reading the blurb in the Los Angeles Times, under the heading ``Seinfeld Spin-off?,'' ``If they hadn't made a deal, they're probably in serious talks by now''.
6_14	0.079871733	This reminds me of the 1989 film The Big Picture, in which a young filmmaker, depressed by his inability to find work, spends an afternoon driving around with his girlfriend and, in the space of a few hours, becomes the hottest director in town.
6_15	0.073043694	Why? Because he didn't return phone calls.
6_16	0.081214082	Not because he's juggling the many deals pouring in, but because he was simply unavailable.
6_17	0.086909139	Morris might be experiencing a similar snowball effect.
6_18	0.10731619	He was part of a news conference promoting a movie for Black Entertainment Television when asked about the lack of minority characters who toiled on Seinfeld.
6_19	0.088410119	Seeing that the Jackie Chiles character is the only one to resurface since the comedy ended, Morris was merely pointing out the irony of it all: that the first and perhaps only spinoff of a series constantly attacked for its lack of minority characters could, would, should be fronted by the show's lone black character.
6_20	0.089833739	Journalists pounced on the just-kinda-thinking-aloud comment, and before long the news was making the rounds as though it had a life of its own.
6_21	0.082015296	Which, of course, it did.
6_22	0.087859856	In understanding this, we have to remember that a disdain for truth in labeling seems to be par for the course in this company town, and though there are certainly talented people working and creating here, it's by and large a place of style without content and progression without talent.
6_23	0.089735128	It's so backward that it's a wonder the talented ever get their share of the pie.
6_24	0.08843253	For example: Despite his striking leading-man looks and effortless acting style, Jessie Martin was struggling until David E.

11_3	0.12037424	Seinfeld has vowed that he won't do another TV series, but before he bolts off again, he is going to perform, one final time, the stand-up comedy act he developed throughout his career.

15_0	0.11721762	NEW YORK _ Only 18 months ago, NBC's executives were riding a wave of prime-time success that had raised the network to record-setting profits.

15_3	0.092672315	NBC was convinced it had a sound strategy for maintaining its elevated position in the ratings and could be the first network to avoid the ride down the bad side of the ratings wheel of fortune.
15_4	0.14404248	But some of the edge came off that confidence last Christmas, when Jerry Seinfeld announced that he was stopping production on the comedy series that had led NBC to its record profits.
15_5	0.1199954	Now, in the first season of no ``Seinfeld,'' NBC finds itself in a suddenly altered position: on the downside of dominance.
15_6	0.079569447	As it did in the early 1990s, NBC is once again struggling to counteract a combination of familiar factors: the hit that could not be replaced, the suddenly dry pipeline of new hits, the ball-and-chain encumbrances of commitments to previous hit makers and the internal executive turf battles.
15_7	0.096108835	And once again the network is looking to a new entertainment executive to help stem the downward turn of the programming cycle that has inevitably hit every network that reached a position of prime-time dominance in the last two decades.

15_10	0.083711589	Tellingly, the network's biggest losses have been among younger men, the biggest fans of ``Seinfeld''.
15_11	0.073701532	Some of that is also the result of NBC's abandonment of National Football League games this year.
15_12	0.074426381	But even when all sports programming is factored out (NBC had the World Series and the Super Bowl last year), among men between the ages of 18 and 49, NBC is still off by 22 percent.

15_26	0.082441254	Instead, they have begun what is in effect a boycott of NBC.

15_30	0.093081077	The strength of ``Seinfeld,'' along with the ratings garnered last year by the World Series and the Super Bowl, helped mask the problems for a time.
15_31	0.084219878	The network's focus on maximizing profits also led to what several NBC executives said were some questionable strategic moves, such as attempting in the fall of 1997 to flood the NBC schedule with comedies, a record 18 of them, primarily because comedies generally get a higher price from advertisers than any other kind of programming.
15_32	0.084633381	Looking to capitalize on that, NBC also dropped its Monday night movie, which had been reasonably successful.
15_33	0.08334684	That led, according to NBC executives, to internal turf battles as NBC's top movie executive, Lindy DeKoven, was squeezed out by the rest of the program department.
15_34	0.084077902	But few of the comedies NBC introduced worked.
15_35	0.084301702	Reflecting a widely held view, one former top program executive from a competing network suggested a couple of reasons for this.
15_36	0.08823891	``It was a combination of so many shows with the same upscale urban premise and simple lack of execution,'' the executive said.
15_37	0.08790668	Indeed, NBC seemed fixated on one kind of show: a vehicle for a female star playing a single woman in some media surrounding, usually in New York.
15_38	0.085410401	The list of shows with that premise introduced by NBC during the last three years includes ``Caroline in the City,'' ``Suddenly Susan,'' ``Fired Up,'' ``Naked Truth'' and ``Veronica's Closet''.
15_39	0.1323452	Each of these shows was tried in the program slot between ``Seinfeld'' and ``E.R''.
15_40	0.097039247	_ arguably the most advantageous place to build an audience for a new show ever created by television.
15_41	0.15041197	But not one of the shows has developed into a bona fide hit.
15_42	0.089746252	``We went with this cookie-cutter approach,'' one senior NBC executive said.
15_43	0.079454538	``It just didn't work.
15_44	0.09426919	And it meant we wasted that 9:30 slot behind `Seinfeld' instead of finding the hit that could help replace it''.
15_45	0.091176182	Because no hit emerged from all those attempts, NBC was forced to move its next best comedy, ``Frasier,'' to Thursday at 9, where ``Seinfeld'' lived.
15_46	0.089697389	That did help shore up Thursday, which has been NBC's stronghold for almost two decades.
15_47	0.089242603	But in so doing, NBC drastically weakened Tuesday.
15_48	0.097969584	Thanks to ``Frasier,'' NBC had erased ABC's former dominance on Tuesdays.
15_49	0.098973648	Now ``Frasier'' is relocated and another longtime comedy hit, ``Mad About You,'' is fading in its last season.
15_50	0.091580601	With some stronger ABC comedies on that night, NBC has again fallen well back of ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co.
15_51	0.08931029	Tuesday's decline has also been advanced by the failure of one hoped-for new comedy, ``Encore!
15_52	0.089047012	Encore''! That is being pointed to as evidence that NBC, despite previous assurances that it would not let commitments to stars or producers of previous hits pull it down, has fallen prey to the mistake of putting deals instead of shows on the air.
15_53	0.094177316	``Encore! Encore''! was produced because NBC had a deal with its star, Nathan Lane, and the producers of ``Frasier''.
15_54	0.091364458	But the show has been a severe disappointment that has damaged another promising comedy, ``Just Shoot Me,'' which NBC had hoped would maintain the network's strength on Tuesdays.
15_55	0.090860044	``Encore! Encore''! is far from the only failure in the current fall crop, however.

15_59	0.088279423	Only ``Will and Grace,'' a comedy about a gay man living with a straight woman, has shown some signs of promise.
15_60	0.087365476	But that may only be because it has been up against weak competition.
15_61	0.088247287	When CBS broadcast a repeat of its best comedy, ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' against ``Will and Grace'' last week, the show took a big fall.
15_62	0.087697862	Still, NBC, because it owns ``Will and Grace'' and needs it to succeed, plans to move the show to Thursday, probably in the spot now occupied by ``Veronica's Closet,'' another significant disappointment.
15_63	0.08716718	But several senior NBC executives said the network could not move ``Veronica'' until 13 episodes have been broadcast this year as a result of the huge deal with its production company, Warner Brothers, owned by Time Warner, for the continuation of ``E.R''.
15_64	0.088174757	That deal cost NBC $13 million an episode, of course, wiping out its profitability for NBC.
15_65	0.087396122	The enormous cost of that deal hardened NBC's position about insisting on an ownership stake in all its new shows, and the studios responded by refusing to deal with NBC.
15_66	0.08880287	Bob Wright, president of NBC, said he believed NBC would solve its impasse with the studios, but that it did not necessarily need to.
15_67	0.075299649	``We aren't that dependent on the studios,'' he said.

15_73	0.08525968	Some competing programmers suggested in interviews that NBC might be wise to circle its wagons and place its strongest lineup of shows on Tuesday and Thursday for the time being.
15_74	0.086765265	One show several other programmers said NBC might try to rely on is ``Third Rock From the Sun,'' a once highly regarded comedy that NBC used as a weapon on Wednesday night to try to damage the ABC hit ``Drew Carey,'' only to see ``Third Rock'' suffer badly.
15_75	0.085575938	NBC might also consider returning the Monday night made-for-television movie, several programmers suggested, pairing it with the ever-expanding news magazine ``Dateline,'' and dropping some of its weak Monday comedies.
15_76	0.08859671	But the movies that filled that slot were taken out of development and it would take months to get any stockpile of movies established.

16_8	0.089348295	24 on WHDH-TV (Ch.
16_9	0.073870038	7). He will play Vic Nardozza, a disguise-wearing private investigator who specializes in undercover work, and whom Richards describes as ``an American Inspector Clouseau''.
16_10	0.085908456	Clouseau, not Kramer: Like most actors, Richards seems leery of being typecast.
16_11	0.09894607	He says NBC was ``wide open to a new invention'' that's not a mirror image of his most famous creation.
16_12	0.075675235	``They didn't say `Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, we like the concept.

16_17	0.088531784	For another, Richards has already reached out to Seinfeld for advice on building a better sitcom.
16_18	0.097353021	``He flew in, and we sat around for an afternoon together,'' said Richards.
16_19	0.085129398	``And he had a few line suggestions, and then said, `Well, there you go,' and that was it, he was off''.

16_26	0.088742255	Offscreen, there seems to be little of Kramer in Richards.

16_30	0.10391885	By July, when Richards spoke to TV critics gathered here, ``The Michael Richards Show'' was the subject of much speculation because NBC executives, after seeing the pilot and concluding that the show relied too heavily on Richards, asked for a complete overhaul of the show.
16_31	0.090998905	The sitcom's team did so, principally by fleshing out the supporting cast around Richards.
16_32	0.08831599	``There's no trouble here,'' Richards insisted.

16_34	0.085900442	Toward that end, Tim Meadows (``Saturday Night Live'') and William Devane (``Knot's Landing,'' ``Turks'') were added to the cast as, respectively, an associate of Nardozza's with a Peeping Tom fetish and the owner of the investigative agency.

19_36	0.1040492	Despite the appeal of the ``Seinfeld'' second-stringers, not all of them can expect to be on the first team for advertisers.

20_0	0.1164458	LOS ANGELES (AP) --Michael Richards says he wasn't sure if there was life after Kramer.
20_1	0.068164752	Acting life, at least.
20_2	0.10405298	''At first I didn't really want to work,'' the former ''Seinfeld'' star said.
20_3	0.073289785	''There wasn't anything that was really exciting me.
20_4	0.074808949	So I thought I was going to retire''.
20_5	0.089171169	After earning a reported $13 million on the hit ''show about nothing,'' Richards took it easy.
20_6	0.088504414	He traveled, restored his home, read classic books by authors like Herman Melville and did little acting, outside of a role in the TNT version of ''David Copperfield''.
20_7	0.10949306	But he's back on NBC next month in ''The Michael Richards Show,'' playing a befuddled detective.
20_8	0.095955921	Some of the mannerisms are the same, but Richards told the Los Angeles Times for Sunday's editions he wants the audience to realize he won't simply rehash his ''Seinfeld'' role.
20_9	0.082770334	''I'm not the Kramer character,'' he said.
21_0	0.17806751	NEW YORK _ Literature it was not: It was only a sitcom script, filled with comma faults and repeatedly misspelled words.
21_1	0.081802011	``Alright,'' for example, appears on pages 9, 10, 24, 32, and 43.
21_2	0.097265499	All right, so ``Seinfeld'' was not perfect on paper, and bee-quality spelling is not a must for must-see television.
21_3	0.078825032	But are sitcom scripts ready to become gallery-quality collectibles worth thousands of dollars?
21_4	0.070619914	As they say on television, stay tuned.
21_5	0.08067733	On June 18, little more than a month after the quintessentially self-involved quartet from ``Seinfeld'' went the way of the barroom busybodies on ``Cheers'' and the medics on ``MASH,'' Christie's East is scheduled to auction the 68-page script with all the ``alrights''.
21_6	0.073427196	Christie's East estimates that the script from the 1992-93 season will go for $1,500 to $2,000.
21_7	0.072752146	But some television-memorabilia dealers, like Robert Schagrin of the Gotta Have It gallery in Manhattan, maintain that the bidding could easily go higher because the market for nontraditional Hollywood collectibles is blossoming.
21_8	0.079370956	``TV scripts are fast becoming the pop art of the future,'' said Schagrin, who specializes in television-age collectibles like scripts and props from old shows.
21_9	0.082802643	``As you enter the new millennium, all of this stuff is going to quite naturally become what 19th-century stuff was to the 20th century''.
21_10	0.077695534	Just as location, location, location is a mantra in real estate, television-script dealers value autographs, autographs, autographs.
21_11	0.089506815	The ``Seinfeld'' script in the Christie's East sale bears the signatures of the four principal cast members (not Larry David, who wrote it).
21_12	0.10704046	On the first page are Jerry Seinfeld's loopy but legible autograph, Michael Richards' hasty-looking flourish and the almost unreadable signatures of Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
21_13	0.081896343	``Seinfeld'' fans will recognize the script as the one that introduced the phrase ``master of my domain'' to the language.
21_14	0.082970466	``This was one of my favorites,'' chuckled Simeon Lipman, the 23-year-old head of the popular arts department at Christie's East.
21_15	0.08281513	``It's an Emmy Award-winning episode, it's an episode that `Seinfeld' fans remember and this is what is known in television jargon as an original `table draft'''.
21_16	0.081339782	In other words, the script being sold was used on the set, not an ``as broadcast'' version that codified lines the actors ad-libbed.
21_17	0.082136773	Nor is it a mere working draft that contained scenes dropped before the episode was filmed.
21_18	0.094808165	Lipman maintains that television memorabilia is an increasingly profitable corner of what trade magazines estimate is the $10 billion market for collectibles.
21_19	0.085521634	Dealers say that prices for television scripts have gained altitude in the media-saturated 1990s, propelled by network-television hype that has become an unwitting affirmation of Andy Warhol's notion of creating public awareness.
21_20	0.087890499	But dealers maintain that television memorabilia has transcended the short-term hype for a particular series like ``Seinfeld,'' becoming a genuine pop-cultural phenomenon.
21_21	0.11057638	The ``Seinfeld'' script is not the first television script to go on the auction block.
21_22	0.093128615	Christie's sold 10 scripts from ``The Honeymooners'' for $5,950 in 1996.
21_23	0.095880677	Again, value is tied to autographs: Schagrin guessed that if a signed ``Honeymooners'' script existed, it would be worth more than $50,000.
21_24	0.095977838	``God, that would be like the four Beatles signing on the music to `The White Album,''' he said.
21_25	0.089787554	Last year, a script from the short-lived 1978 revival of ``This Is Your Life'' went for $1,150.
21_26	0.088577163	Once again, autographs were essential to its value: The script was signed by Muhammad Ali and his trainer.
21_27	0.094328779	Schagrin maintains that scripts are appreciating faster than other film and television collectibles.
21_28	0.08955932	A script for an episode of ``MASH,'' signed by the entire cast, sold for $700 in 1995; earlier this year, it went for $4,000.
21_29	0.090398877	A signed script from the NBC sitcom ``Friends'' that sold for $550 in 1996 sold recently for $1,800.
21_30	0.088414352	And a ``Cheers'' script sold for $900 soon after that long-running sitcom went off the air in 1993.
21_31	0.08721391	The owner recently put it on the market for $5,000.
21_32	0.087235671	``We didn't sell it,'' Schagrin said.
21_33	0.087144913	``While we were working on it, he called back and said, `Sorry, it's gone'''.
21_34	0.088329025	In the June 18 sale, Christie's East will also auction the original proposal for ``Star Trek'' by the science fiction writer Gene Roddenberry.
21_35	0.086626534	The 26-page typewritten document describes the spaceship Enterprise as ``a wagon train to the stars''.
21_36	0.087625641	Most of the characters Roddenberry envisioned did not boldly go before the cameras, though: only Spock (``with a red-hewed, satanic look and surprisingly gentle manners'') made it onto the show.
21_37	0.088683929	Christie's East estimates that the ``Star Trek'' proposal will sell for $12,000 to $15,000, a figure that dealers like Lipman hope the ``Seinfeld'' script will someday bring.
21_38	0.091097895	Not yet, he acknowledged.
21_39	0.081156332	But not to worry, either.
21_40	0.090671652	``They're going to replay `Seinfeld' for decades to come,'' Lipman said, ``and it's truly the most iconic of all television series for this time.
21_41	0.089785181	`Seinfeld' will have staying power, which can only help with the scripts.''
22_0	0.16607682	NEW YORK (AP) --Imagine Jerry Seinfeld inside his Long Island mansion, baby bottle in one hand, burp cloth in the other, musing: Whyyyyy do they call it a burp cloth?
22_1	0.086059753	That's right.
22_2	0.077400037	First came love (1998), then came marriage (last December)--and now Seinfeld and bride, Jessica Sklar, will soon be pushing a baby carriage.
22_3	0.078426933	The big announcement was made Thursday by Seinfeld pal Regis Philbin on TV's ''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee''.
22_4	0.10142962	''Yes. It's true.
22_5	0.15957669	There will be a new little Seinfeld sometime this fall,'' said Seinfeld's spokeswoman, Elizabeth Clarke.
22_6	0.085165459	It is the first child for both Sklar and Seinfeld, who made millions from a TV show that glorified single life and poked fun at commitment.
22_7	0.095501808	But that was then and this is now, and soon the 45-year-old Seinfeld will be up to his diaper bag in commitment.
22_8	0.099603721	Seinfeld apparently asked Philbin to serve up the news for him.
22_9	0.096657861	Philbin did it gladly, informing viewers that the little Seinfeld is scheduled to arrive in October.
22_10	0.078426598	Clarke did not want to pinpoint the due date.
22_11	0.10279167	The new arrival may have the undevoted attention of his dad, who retired his series in 1998.
22_12	0.097136874	Baby Seinfeld will also have plenty of room for all that kid stuff like swing sets, playhouses, bicycles and building blocks.
22_13	0.091127411	The couple are reportedly paying as much as $40 million for Billy Joel's 12-acre oceanfront mansion in East Hampton.
22_14	0.086912336	And there are other kids in the neighborhood for playdates.

23_0	0.075221369	&UR; &LR; Some people never can say goodbye.
23_1	0.27202795	But not Jerry Seinfeld.
23_2	0.098560657	In the spring, the comedian bid a much publicized adieu to his hugely successful sitcom after nine years.
23_3	0.19576715	And Sunday night, live from New York on HBO, he said farewell again, this time to the stand-up material he has cultivated so far in his career.
23_4	0.19784297	While the special was titled ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time'' most of Seinfeld's fans were probably hearing these jokes for the first time.
23_5	0.075501164	Excluding the brief stand-up snippets that bookmarked ``Seinfeld'' in its early years, we've mostly encountered his distinctive view of life in the form of situational gags split among at least three other jokers.
23_6	0.07608813	Sunday night, wearing a suit and tie, Seinfeld appeared confident and eager as he stood alone on a stage with a stool and a glass of water, delivering his charmingly trivial observations to an adoring house.
23_7	0.082892247	At one point, a woman yelled out that she loved Seinfeld, triggering his ad lib ``I love you too, but I do feel the need to'' _ he gestured at the rest of the audience _ ``see other people''.
23_8	0.097981378	Miraculously, he managed not to be diminished by the hype that surrounded the HBO special, his first prime-time appearance since May and the final performance of a world tour that has been heavily promoted.
23_9	0.091955932	Seinfeld's hour revolved mostly around his amazement at the strangeness of ordinary things.
23_10	0.082423087	Always obsessed with hygiene, he spent some time wondering about New York cab drivers and their body odor.
23_11	0.080933359	``How long are these shifts''? he exclaimed.
23_12	0.086174748	He thought out loud on the subject of pharmacists, who always seem to dispense their drugs from platforms, and he dwelled on the very specific expiration dates milk companies put on their cartons: ``Maybe the cows tip them off when they're millking them''.
23_13	0.086618275	One surprise was the physicality of his performance.
23_14	0.11165931	It was Michael Richards as Kramer &UR; &LR; who provided most of the visual humor on ``Seinfeld,'' but Sunday night Seinfeld repeatedly used his body and facial expressions to tell his stories.
23_15	0.087882051	He mimicked the way flight attendants instruct plane passengers on how to put on a seat belt and how they point vaguely to the emergency exits.
23_16	0.076513859	He did an impression of a wolf man shaving.
23_17	0.089341819	And in a riff about a forthcoming visit to Florida, he pretended to be an elderly person backing out of a driveway without looking.
23_18	0.10282557	On ``Seinfeld,'' his humor seemed strikingly original and even edgy.
23_19	0.096596972	In a stand-up context, it had a more conventional, ``Tonight Show'' feel to it.
23_20	0.087009728	There was no envelope pushing, no Robin Williams/Jim Carrey-styled craziness; just an energetic man and his unusual sensibility.
23_21	0.087711632	But it was a mostly amusing hour that, like the sitcom, ended just before the laughs began to thin out.
23_22	0.13212137	The show left no indication of where Seinfeld hopes to take his comedy, now that he's told these jokes for the last time.
23_23	0.091223446	The stand-up routine was preceded by a very short, star-filled film set in a graveyard.
23_24	0.086825431	As a group of very familiar faces of comedy stood watching in mock grief, including Garry Shandling, George Carlin, Ed McMahon, Paul Reiser, Alan King, and Jay Leno, Seinfeld buried a coffin filled with pages of his jokes.
23_25	0.085931786	Let's hope it's his final act of finality, for this year at least.
24_0	0.12182579	It's time to cut another check for Jerry Seinfeld.
24_1	0.091511371	In a record cable deal worth more than $100 million, TBS has purchased national cable and metro Atlanta rights to syndicated repeats of ``Seinfeld'' to begin in fall 2002 and last four years.
24_2	0.078853951	The Atlanta-based station will reportedly pay more than $600,000 apiece for 180 ``Seinfeld'' episodes, eclipsing the price Lifetime earlier negotiated for cable syndication rights to Ellen DeGeneres' sitcom, ``Ellen''.
24_3	0.077809946	Though a cable benchmark, the deal doesn't approach the nearly $286 million a year NBC will pay for first-run ``ER'' episodes for the next three seasons.
24_4	0.13846171	But it's still a lot of cash for Seinfeld and his show's distributor, Columbia TriStar TV.
24_5	0.083270186	Variety estimates that all `Seinfeld'' syndication deals to date have bumped the show's overall gross to much more than $1.5 billion.
24_6	0.078774578	TBS' contract will bump ``Seinfeld'' repeats, a big ratings booster, off WATL in metro Atlanta.
24_7	0.091255502	WATL's pact expires in March 2001.
24_8	0.081182968	There remains an 18-month period between that date and the start of ``Seinfeld'' on TBS that WATL might purchase.

24_11	0.085659408	``We're very confident of this show.
24_12	0.077740801	We think it has legs''.
24_13	0.09181308	So far, ``Seinfeld'' repeats have been a strong performer, especially in metro Atlanta.
24_14	0.088835709	The show, now most often airing at 10 o'clock weeknights on WATL, sometimes beats nearly all prime-time programming.
24_15	0.091098775	During the May sweeps, the period stations use to set ad rates worth millions of dollars, ``Seinfeld'' repeats averaged nearly 185,000 metro Atlanta homes.
24_16	0.079558286	``May was sensational,'' said Don Hess, WATL programming chief.
24_17	0.092680844	But four years from now, he said, ``Seinfeld'' might lose its ratings heat.
24_18	0.09354688	``That's what happened to 'Cheers'''.
