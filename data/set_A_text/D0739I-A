0_0	0.20753818	``Just one Clinton joke,'' a man in the audience called out when Jerry Seinfeld appeared for his encore after the second show on Wednesday, opening night of his brief run of stand-up performances on Broadway.
0_1	0.096480332	It says everything about his humor that the only topical joke came by request, and even then it wasn't a genuine Clinton joke.
0_2	0.074321007	He veered smoothly away from politics into typical Seinfeld territory, wryly observing the manners and absurdities of contemporary life.
0_3	0.093981459	``Everyone lies about sex,'' he said.
0_4	0.054221059	``People lie &UR; during &LR; sex.
0_5	0.09842674	If it weren't for lies, there'd &UR; be &LR; no sex''.
0_6	0.072620508	Those jokes were recycled from a news conference promoting the live telecast of this show (Sunday night 9 on HBO), but no matter.
0_7	0.11751494	Freshness is precisely not the point of ``Jerry Seinfeld: `I'm Telling You For the Last Time' _ Live on Broadway''.
0_8	0.090357861	Looking backward is.
0_9	0.13646255	New York is the last stop and Sunday's live television show the final performance in a two-month world tour.
0_10	0.093058655	That amounts to a farewell tour for this material, which Seinfeld has said he will retire.
0_11	0.092609606	These Broadway performances hold no clue to his future, but they say a lot about his past.
0_12	0.085016023	He comes full circle here, back to the stand-up routines that inspired his phenomenally successful sitcom.
0_13	0.14378897	He did, after all, play a stand-up comic named Jerry Seinfeld in the series, and in its early years each episode began and ended with sitcom Jerry offering a snippet of his act.
0_14	0.07377386	On Broadway, that act has a familiar but still funny feel, with material long-honed and often recognizable from the series, talk show appearances and his best-selling book ``Seinlanguage''.
0_15	0.023543699	In Australia, he visited the great Barrier Reef ; in Iceland, he worked the word Reykjavikians into the routine; in Des Moines, Iowa, he gave away all the tickets.
0_16	0.096971491	Most shows on the tour sold out; some didn't.
0_17	0.097741987	But New York is home, the audience was primed to adore him, and all he really had to do was show up.
0_18	0.089789924	He did more.
0_19	0.059239938	Relaxed, with impeccable timing, he gave a warm but controlled, hour-long performance built on small, shrewdly targeted observations.
0_20	0.096474785	And now that the cloud of hype that covered the final ``Seinfeld'' episode is receding, the performance highlights why he became immensely popular in the first place and how influential his style of stand-up has become.
0_21	0.082251268	He began with a line only New Yorkers could love, in language so purely Seinfeld that it can only be a self-reference: ``So what's with the cabbies and the b.o''.?
0_22	0.056717419	He went on to talk about the lunacy of astronauts taking a car to the moon, and the instructions given by flight attendents: ``They show you how to use a seatbelt in case you haven't been in a car since 1965''.
0_23	0.088652081	There is little danger of giving away the best jokes, because he has already given away so many himself.
0_24	0.089841769	It is nearly impossible to give away the punchlines because the essence of his style is that he has none.
0_25	0.068822605	``Tell you what I like about Chinese people, they're hanging in there with the chopsticks,'' he says, even though, ``They've seen the fork''.
0_26	0.091346786	In a dark suit and tie, stand-up Jerry is better dressed than sitcom Jerry ever was.
0_27	0.091463244	And he makes more funny faces.
0_28	0.075605035	He imitated a turtle making change, offered the voice of a sarcastic horse, as well as the pinched face of a neighbor's pet monkey.
0_29	0.087837081	``That's the look you have on your face when you're that close to being the dominant species on the planet and you didn't make it''.
0_30	0.090713852	He interacted with the audience just enough to seem warm, but not so much that he lost control.
0_31	0.070047142	To someone who threw a business card with a scribbled note on stage he said: ``No, I'm not going to read it.
0_32	0.047823113	I'm busy''!
0_33	0.080390508	Scads of comedians are now doing what Seinfeld made popular, relying on dry observations rather than jokey punch lines.
0_34	0.085306053	His opening act on Broadway (there will be none for the HBO show), the comedian Kevin Meaney, whipped the audience up with a frenetic energy that semeed conspicuously old-fashioned next to the cool Seinfeld style, even though Meaney's routine came with deliberately retro touches, such as his maroon jacket and bow tie, and a routine in which he pretends to sing a duet with Frank Sinatra.
0_35	0.10088268	Though Seinfeld has his routine down, each performance varies a bit, so Sunday's televised show is not entirely predictable.
0_36	0.09564002	The HBO show will include a brief filmed opening with Seinfeld and unannounced guests (not from the cast of ``Seinfeld'').
0_37	0.10288876	On stage, he said of the HBO special: ``It's live.
0_38	0.095942046	When I screw up, you see it''.
0_39	0.092239091	He's not likely to flub such a well-crafted routine, though it's just as well that he's putting the material out to pasture.
0_40	0.094991471	After these long Seinfeld goodbyes, it's time for something new, maybe even risky.
0_41	0.097773463	One of the funniest recent Seinfeld appearances comes in a promo for Sunday's show, in which he pretends to have taken up painting as his next career.
0_42	0.077262549	He splashes cans of paint wildy on a canvas while a proper visitor, played by Marian Seldes, asks whether he'll go back to stand-up if the art thing doesn't work out.
0_43	0.090215035	``How could it not work out''? he wonders.
0_44	0.090255217	He looks goofily pleased with himself, with a wild-eyed glimpse of inspiration at the thought of something new.
0_45	0.087711768	It may be a goof, but it holds promise.

2_0	0.24582583	&UR; &LR; NEW YORK _ Jerry Seinfeld, the star of one of the most succesful shows in television history, says he'll never do another situation comedy.
2_1	0.091404056	``I can't imagine doing another one.
2_2	0.082995064	Only an idiot would think they could do better,'' said Seinfeld, during a press conference Tuesday, promoting his Sunday night live (9 p.m).
2_3	0.15970587	HBO special, ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time''.
2_4	0.033910398	Wearing white slacks with a navy polo shirt under a gray jacket, the 44-year-old comedian joked and jostled with the media over subjects ranging from sex to money.
2_5	0.12051223	While Seinfeld says he misses some of the things about the ending of the phenomenal run of ``Seinfeld'' after 140 episodes, he's relieved it's over.
2_6	0.09158389	``Did you ever take a dog to the park and take his leash off,'' he asked asked rhetorically.
2_7	0.090944683	``The dog looks up for a minute then bolts like a maniac''.
2_8	0.090308867	Accompanied by by HBO's Marty Callner, who will be directing the special live, Seinfeld explained that returning to stand-up was liberating.
2_9	0.086679746	For nine years he worked on a show with 100 crew members, a dozen writers, and the cast.
2_10	0.090677799	``That was very much a group thing,'' he said.
2_11	0.091323056	``Now I feel like the leash is off''.
2_12	0.088820503	He has no plans to take a vacation.
2_13	0.089534081	``I've been on beaches,'' he said.
2_14	0.094136089	``I've been on boats''.
2_15	0.090011514	Then he shrugged his shoulders.
2_16	0.09238582	While Seinfeld is not retiring from stand-up, he is retiring all the material from Sunday night's program.
2_17	0.091395248	``You'll never hear these jokes again,'' he promised.
2_18	0.07328658	He's planning to work on another special, presumably for HBO, during the next eight months, and put out a comedy album based on Sunday's performance.
2_19	0.10220884	Tickets for the concert at the Broadhurst Theater are hot.
2_20	0.11384782	The New York Attorney General's office is investigating ticket scalping.
2_21	0.067861647	The going street rate for a ticket is $1,500, nearly 20 times the face value.
2_22	0.090507161	Seinfeld is donating all of the proceeds from the concert to PENCIL (Public Education Needs Civic Involvement in Learning).
2_23	0.090504482	``I didn't invent scalping, '' he said, pausing just long enough for everyone to realize the absurdity of the situation.
2_24	0.088933495	``I don't really have any control over it''.
2_25	0.080419866	While ``Seinfeld'' will never be considered controversial, the show did run into trouble with an episode in which Kramer accidentally set a Puerto Rican flag on fire.
2_26	0.095823269	``I liked that episode,'' said Seinfeld.
2_27	0.092695832	``People forget that in that episode Kramer was really looking forward to the Puerto Rican Day parade and that the whole thing was an accident''.
2_28	0.095322323	When asked if the protest of the episode by some Puerto Ricans was legitimate or a politically correct over-reaction, Seinfeld raised his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders.
2_29	0.078217736	While Seinfeld said that he doesn't have a favorite episode, he did recall with great affection the one in which he mugs an elderly woman for her loaf of marble rye.
2_30	0.080729318	``They brought in snow and we had snowball fights at five in the morning, and I was trying to throw a loaf of rye bread up to the fourth floor,'' he said.
2_31	0.090626127	``It was just fun''.
2_32	0.094983636	Seinfeld refused to confirm the rumors that cast members from the show, particularly Jason Alexander, might appear for his HBO special.
2_33	0.092537955	``If I named who might come, it wouldn't be a suprise,'' he said.
2_34	0.091120114	``How can there be suprise guests if there are no suprises''?
2_35	0.087429388	Other Seinfeld observations: On fame: ``I've been anonymous.

3_3	0.098690652	Seinfeld was en route from New York to Albuquerque, N.M., in a 1973 Volkswagen Beetle this week when he decided to pull into this country music town to see an old friend and collect on a gold mine of potential material.
3_4	0.12134446	On Tuesday, Seinfeld took in a show at the Bobby Vinton Theater.
3_5	0.092819321	Seinfeld and Vinton used to play in Las Vegas at the same time, said Chris Vinton, the pop singer's son.
3_6	0.091812192	Seinfeld ''said he was really excited about being in Branson and was somewhat overwhelmed by it and surprised by how sophisticated the facilities are,'' Chris Vinton said.
4_0	0.080705063	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) --Television viewers still in withdrawal over the end of ``Seinfeld'' could have gotten a quick fix -- in Romania.
4_1	0.066458305	The hugely successful American sitcom also is this nation's most popular comedy program, and private station ProTV aired a five-hour special Sunday to mark more than a year of broadcasting the show.
4_2	0.11738619	Twelve people competed as lookalikes of the Seinfeld characters Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer.
4_3	0.16523393	One, a 31-year-old sketch artist, won a trip to New York for his resemblance to Jerry Seinfeld.
4_4	0.090417586	Seinfeld's jokes have struck Romanians' funnybones.
4_5	0.09500975	Friends often gather to watch the show and many of the expressions, including the famous ``yada yada yada,'' have become hip.
4_6	0.09121212	``Seinfeld's kind of humor is different.
4_7	0.065570824	It's for people with brains and I consider it the best comedy show ever made,'' said Ilie Vornicu, 24, a geology student.
5_0	0.098991704	That pretty much sums up Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm.
5_1	0.10457182	The one-hour special contains some laugh-out-loud moments but also some long stretches of humor-free aridness.
5_2	0.019759807	One crucial difference: Curb Your Enthusiasm violates half of David's famous no-hugging, no-learning rule of television.
5_3	0.10654912	``There was some hugging at the end of the show,'' David said in a conference call.
5_4	0.088909612	``It was as insincere as you could get.
5_5	0.019268193	Insin cere hugging is al lowed''.
5_6	0.050442406	Although David, who penned some of Seinfeld's most darkly brilliant ep isodes, is more or less the model for George Costanza, he is also a former stand-up comedian himself.
5_7	0.050302262	He hadn't performed onstage for 10 years and mentioned to a friend that he was thinking about giv ing it another shot.
5_8	0.062897302	``He said, `You should film it,' '' David said.
5_9	0.090615643	``Like everything else, I was reluctant at first.
5_10	0.089843312	The more people I asked about it, everyone seemed to think it was a good idea.
5_11	0.088473824	I thought it was a way to motivate me to get on stage''.
5_12	0.09113983	However, he wasn't interested in the standard film-the-comedian-telling-jokes format.
5_13	0.092690799	``I wanted to do something different,'' he said, ``rather than the straight stand-up show.
5_14	0.094417998	Then, I started to think I needed some other stuff in there, what we were going to do offstage.
5_15	0.092823037	We couldn't just follow me around the supermarket shopping, so I had to come up with some stuff''.
5_16	0.14748226	``Some stuff' wound up being about 90 per cent of the show, with the stand-up routines in New York and LA only a small part (a ratio close to the early episodes of Seinfeld as well).
5_17	0.084923773	Curb Your Enthusiasm turned out to be mostly a mock LA documentary _ totally unscripted _ about David's return to stand-up.
5_18	0.096602511	``It's not totally mock,'' David said, stressing that revealing just what is real and what isn't would spoil the fun for viewers.
5_19	0.091884924	``Certainly, the stand-up is real.
5_20	0.089089019	I would say that there are elements in there that are real.
5_21	0.090908051	Most of it's embellished, but some of it's real''.
5_22	0.10074568	Part of the genuineness, David said, is his person ality.
5_23	0.091740546	``It's not that much of a character,'' he said of the Larry David we see on-screen.
5_24	0.083772178	``I'm not re ally stretching there.
5_25	0.10277447	That's pretty much who I am''.
5_26	0.055088138	That Larry David wanders around a good bit, mumbling about life and its foibles, sounding remarkably like a certain bespectacled, balding, chunky, self-proclaimed loser from a late, great hit TV series.
5_27	0.094972308	``I really resent that `who's call ing'?
5_28	0.090795183	'' he says while making a phone call.
5_29	0.091163981	``Like some people are good enough to make the cut''.
5_30	0.08665184	Jason Alexander, who played George on Seinfeld, makes an ap pearance, commenting on David.
5_31	0.087279714	So does Jerry himself, who relates that during his early stand-up days, Da vid referred to the audience as ``you people''.
5_32	0.09547912	Other comedians show up, as well, including Richard Lewis.
5_33	0.094613302	``He was a phenomenon,'' Lewis says of David.
5_34	0.09280912	``He just couldn't get over the hump that comedians have to perform in front of other people''.
5_35	0.095009767	David called his stand-up career ``the epitome of a love-hate rela tionship''.
5_36	0.08414072	``It's the kind of thing where you walk around at times when it's not going well, you blame it on the au dience,'' he said.
5_37	0.095934661	``You think the whole world must be stupid or you stink and have no talent.
5_38	0.081884793	``When it's going well, you think that you're the greatest thing on two feet and everybody's brilliant.
5_39	0.092412152	.. . It's very extreme thinking''.
5_40	0.08502944	Part of the special concerns other comics telling David how the clubs have changed in the 10 years since he has been onstage.
5_41	0.091590133	Of course, David's life has changed as well.
5_42	0.095092315	Seinfeld has made him a wealthy man, in deed.
5_43	0.096881427	But that's the only change, he said.
5_44	0.091997689	``I'm pretty much the same, but I can get dental work in my house now,'' he said.
5_45	0.090070475	``That's the difference''.
5_46	0.10891261	David left Seinfeld after the infa mous season-ending episode in which George's fiancee dies after licking bargain-basement envelopes, and the show lost its dark New York heart, which made it so funny.
5_47	0.079386739	He famously returned for the series-ending show, which managed to combine excessive hype and mini mal laughs for one of TV's biggest flops.
5_48	0.08471647	David naturally begs to differ.
5_49	0.092614933	``I couldn't be more pleased with it,'' he said of the final episode.
5_50	0.089683059	``First of all, the fact that so many people didn't like it?
5_51	0.093842008	I loved that.
5_52	0.092438936	It accomplished everything I think a finale should accomplish''.
5_53	0.093016815	Then he must be delighted with Curb Your Enthusiasm, because it's far funnier than Seinfeld's finale.
5_54	0.091648534	Then again, how could it not be?

6_1	0.085003316	_ Phil Morris must have found the whole thing professionally unsettling or, at least, personally amusing.
6_2	0.066904457	One moment he's a B-list actor whose last TV credit was The Love Boat: The Next Wave on a D-list network.
6_3	0.17925124	The next, he's resurrecting his recurring Seinfeld character, a trigger-happy lawyer named Jackie Chiles, to star in an NBC sitcom executive-produced by Jerry Seinfeld and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David.
6_4	0.0948947	And slated for 8:30 Thursday nights, no less.
6_5	0.035400632	Reporters who normally scurry by Morris en route to a higher-grade celebrity are sticking tape recorders in his face and clamoring for more specifics concerning the big announcement that's really no announcement at all.
6_6	0.091138362	Says Morris, as a joke, I hope: ``This whole thing could be wrapped up by the time I make it home''.
6_7	0.095010476	He's referring to his pretentiously sordid profession, a business in which the art of the deal can be something of a bizarre art form in itself.
6_8	0.08933732	That no matter how much talent you have, or how decorative a resume you possess, you're only as valuable as you're perceived to be.
6_9	0.091067265	Read on and this might make sense yet.
6_10	0.090985801	Morris hasn't signed anything for anyone.
6_11	0.073139831	In fact, he hasn't even met formally with Seinfeld or David or NBC about a comedy series based on the wacky attorney, last seen as a rather funny punch line in a Honda TV ad.
6_12	0.085343293	Yet as newspapers ran the item, entertainment television picked up the story.
6_13	0.053295681	And as one cable executive said while reading the blurb in the Los Angeles Times, under the heading ``Seinfeld Spin-off?,'' ``If they hadn't made a deal, they're probably in serious talks by now''.
6_14	0.07467145	This reminds me of the 1989 film The Big Picture, in which a young filmmaker, depressed by his inability to find work, spends an afternoon driving around with his girlfriend and, in the space of a few hours, becomes the hottest director in town.
6_15	0.074613175	Why? Because he didn't return phone calls.
6_16	0.091465092	Not because he's juggling the many deals pouring in, but because he was simply unavailable.
6_17	0.097644534	Morris might be experiencing a similar snowball effect.
6_18	0.10417653	He was part of a news conference promoting a movie for Black Entertainment Television when asked about the lack of minority characters who toiled on Seinfeld.
6_19	0.091043899	Seeing that the Jackie Chiles character is the only one to resurface since the comedy ended, Morris was merely pointing out the irony of it all: that the first and perhaps only spinoff of a series constantly attacked for its lack of minority characters could, would, should be fronted by the show's lone black character.
6_20	0.092820033	Journalists pounced on the just-kinda-thinking-aloud comment, and before long the news was making the rounds as though it had a life of its own.
6_21	0.094369879	Which, of course, it did.
6_22	0.060664698	In understanding this, we have to remember that a disdain for truth in labeling seems to be par for the course in this company town, and though there are certainly talented people working and creating here, it's by and large a place of style without content and progression without talent.
6_23	0.092022944	It's so backward that it's a wonder the talented ever get their share of the pie.

15_3	0.085347395	NBC was convinced it had a sound strategy for maintaining its elevated position in the ratings and could be the first network to avoid the ride down the bad side of the ratings wheel of fortune.
15_4	0.13453486	But some of the edge came off that confidence last Christmas, when Jerry Seinfeld announced that he was stopping production on the comedy series that had led NBC to its record profits.
15_5	0.1016546	Now, in the first season of no ``Seinfeld,'' NBC finds itself in a suddenly altered position: on the downside of dominance.
15_6	0.068116441	As it did in the early 1990s, NBC is once again struggling to counteract a combination of familiar factors: the hit that could not be replaced, the suddenly dry pipeline of new hits, the ball-and-chain encumbrances of commitments to previous hit makers and the internal executive turf battles.
15_7	0.071989815	And once again the network is looking to a new entertainment executive to help stem the downward turn of the programming cycle that has inevitably hit every network that reached a position of prime-time dominance in the last two decades.

15_11	0.091319639	Some of that is also the result of NBC's abandonment of National Football League games this year.
15_12	0.031487861	But even when all sports programming is factored out (NBC had the World Series and the Super Bowl last year), among men between the ages of 18 and 49, NBC is still off by 22 percent.

15_28	0.089430487	NBC must have those hits because for the last three seasons, no compelling new program has been added to NBC's store.
15_29	0.083734548	Network executives concede that program development has been weak and no real hits have emerged in the last three years.
15_30	0.093007559	The strength of ``Seinfeld,'' along with the ratings garnered last year by the World Series and the Super Bowl, helped mask the problems for a time.
15_31	0.044721121	The network's focus on maximizing profits also led to what several NBC executives said were some questionable strategic moves, such as attempting in the fall of 1997 to flood the NBC schedule with comedies, a record 18 of them, primarily because comedies generally get a higher price from advertisers than any other kind of programming.
15_32	0.090017078	Looking to capitalize on that, NBC also dropped its Monday night movie, which had been reasonably successful.
15_33	0.058875062	That led, according to NBC executives, to internal turf battles as NBC's top movie executive, Lindy DeKoven, was squeezed out by the rest of the program department.
15_34	0.10026411	But few of the comedies NBC introduced worked.
15_35	0.055676363	Reflecting a widely held view, one former top program executive from a competing network suggested a couple of reasons for this.
15_36	0.093376319	``It was a combination of so many shows with the same upscale urban premise and simple lack of execution,'' the executive said.
15_37	0.07627743	Indeed, NBC seemed fixated on one kind of show: a vehicle for a female star playing a single woman in some media surrounding, usually in New York.
15_38	0.056857123	The list of shows with that premise introduced by NBC during the last three years includes ``Caroline in the City,'' ``Suddenly Susan,'' ``Fired Up,'' ``Naked Truth'' and ``Veronica's Closet''.
15_39	0.10194279	Each of these shows was tried in the program slot between ``Seinfeld'' and ``E.R''.
15_40	0.095290755	_ arguably the most advantageous place to build an audience for a new show ever created by television.
15_41	0.10049395	But not one of the shows has developed into a bona fide hit.
15_42	0.081192122	``We went with this cookie-cutter approach,'' one senior NBC executive said.
15_43	0.092714739	``It just didn't work.
15_44	0.093198177	And it meant we wasted that 9:30 slot behind `Seinfeld' instead of finding the hit that could help replace it''.
15_45	0.077036148	Because no hit emerged from all those attempts, NBC was forced to move its next best comedy, ``Frasier,'' to Thursday at 9, where ``Seinfeld'' lived.
15_46	0.094009449	That did help shore up Thursday, which has been NBC's stronghold for almost two decades.
15_47	0.085158224	But in so doing, NBC drastically weakened Tuesday.
15_48	0.083218138	Thanks to ``Frasier,'' NBC had erased ABC's former dominance on Tuesdays.
15_49	0.076258664	Now ``Frasier'' is relocated and another longtime comedy hit, ``Mad About You,'' is fading in its last season.
15_50	0.07531959	With some stronger ABC comedies on that night, NBC has again fallen well back of ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co.
15_51	0.092105444	Tuesday's decline has also been advanced by the failure of one hoped-for new comedy, ``Encore!
15_52	0.073060317	Encore''! That is being pointed to as evidence that NBC, despite previous assurances that it would not let commitments to stars or producers of previous hits pull it down, has fallen prey to the mistake of putting deals instead of shows on the air.
15_53	0.095841979	``Encore! Encore''! was produced because NBC had a deal with its star, Nathan Lane, and the producers of ``Frasier''.
15_54	0.086979551	But the show has been a severe disappointment that has damaged another promising comedy, ``Just Shoot Me,'' which NBC had hoped would maintain the network's strength on Tuesdays.
15_55	0.093291999	``Encore! Encore''! is far from the only failure in the current fall crop, however.

15_60	0.085864456	But that may only be because it has been up against weak competition.

15_62	0.084841754	Still, NBC, because it owns ``Will and Grace'' and needs it to succeed, plans to move the show to Thursday, probably in the spot now occupied by ``Veronica's Closet,'' another significant disappointment.
15_63	0.090109536	But several senior NBC executives said the network could not move ``Veronica'' until 13 episodes have been broadcast this year as a result of the huge deal with its production company, Warner Brothers, owned by Time Warner, for the continuation of ``E.R''.
15_64	0.074522451	That deal cost NBC $13 million an episode, of course, wiping out its profitability for NBC.
15_65	0.075177521	The enormous cost of that deal hardened NBC's position about insisting on an ownership stake in all its new shows, and the studios responded by refusing to deal with NBC.
15_66	0.078170058	Bob Wright, president of NBC, said he believed NBC would solve its impasse with the studios, but that it did not necessarily need to.
15_67	0.091331369	``We aren't that dependent on the studios,'' he said.

15_73	0.080777699	Some competing programmers suggested in interviews that NBC might be wise to circle its wagons and place its strongest lineup of shows on Tuesday and Thursday for the time being.
15_74	0.090040926	One show several other programmers said NBC might try to rely on is ``Third Rock From the Sun,'' a once highly regarded comedy that NBC used as a weapon on Wednesday night to try to damage the ABC hit ``Drew Carey,'' only to see ``Third Rock'' suffer badly.
15_75	0.080811607	NBC might also consider returning the Monday night made-for-television movie, several programmers suggested, pairing it with the ever-expanding news magazine ``Dateline,'' and dropping some of its weak Monday comedies.
15_76	0.094190755	But the movies that filled that slot were taken out of development and it would take months to get any stockpile of movies established.

16_5	0.089003928	For nine seasons, Richards played Kramer, a human pinball who was perpetually careening through Jerry Seinfeld's apartment door when he wasn't concocting loony get-rich-quick schemes with Newman the mailman.

16_7	0.12038283	Now, the 52-year-old Richards is bringing his mobile features and his gift for slapstick to a new NBC sitcom titled ``The Michael Richards Show,'' which premieres Oct.
16_8	0.00011345669	24 on WHDH-TV (Ch.
16_9	0.028264234	7). He will play Vic Nardozza, a disguise-wearing private investigator who specializes in undercover work, and whom Richards describes as ``an American Inspector Clouseau''.
16_10	0.095961331	Clouseau, not Kramer: Like most actors, Richards seems leery of being typecast.
16_11	0.097990214	He says NBC was ``wide open to a new invention'' that's not a mirror image of his most famous creation.
16_12	0.083369062	``They didn't say `Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, we like the concept.

16_17	0.093067957	For another, Richards has already reached out to Seinfeld for advice on building a better sitcom.
16_18	0.095734596	``He flew in, and we sat around for an afternoon together,'' said Richards.
16_19	0.087872083	``And he had a few line suggestions, and then said, `Well, there you go,' and that was it, he was off''.
16_20	0.12509065	Because Richards will be an executive producer as well as the star of the series, he also tapped Seinfeld's knowledge of the ``logistics'' of the former role.
16_21	0.092307198	The biggest logistical challenge may be in getting viewers to accept Richards in a non-Kramer role.
16_22	0.091987944	Co-creator Gregg Kavet touched on the conundrum the ``Michael Richards'' team faced.

16_26	0.087186694	Offscreen, there seems to be little of Kramer in Richards.

16_30	0.11575158	By July, when Richards spoke to TV critics gathered here, ``The Michael Richards Show'' was the subject of much speculation because NBC executives, after seeing the pilot and concluding that the show relied too heavily on Richards, asked for a complete overhaul of the show.
16_31	0.083889188	The sitcom's team did so, principally by fleshing out the supporting cast around Richards.
16_32	0.093178865	``There's no trouble here,'' Richards insisted.
16_33	0.098550509	He did emphasize, though, his hopes that the show will develop the kind of ensemble strength that became a hallmark of ``Seinfeld''.
16_34	0.093058011	Toward that end, Tim Meadows (``Saturday Night Live'') and William Devane (``Knot's Landing,'' ``Turks'') were added to the cast as, respectively, an associate of Nardozza's with a Peeping Tom fetish and the owner of the investigative agency.

20_0	0.082707546	LOS ANGELES (AP) --Michael Richards says he wasn't sure if there was life after Kramer.
20_1	0.06163973	Acting life, at least.
20_2	0.094868843	''At first I didn't really want to work,'' the former ''Seinfeld'' star said.
20_3	0.088071342	''There wasn't anything that was really exciting me.
20_4	0.088407801	So I thought I was going to retire''.
20_5	0.089823664	After earning a reported $13 million on the hit ''show about nothing,'' Richards took it easy.
20_6	0.075354721	He traveled, restored his home, read classic books by authors like Herman Melville and did little acting, outside of a role in the TNT version of ''David Copperfield''.
20_7	0.10353676	But he's back on NBC next month in ''The Michael Richards Show,'' playing a befuddled detective.
20_8	0.093450867	Some of the mannerisms are the same, but Richards told the Los Angeles Times for Sunday's editions he wants the audience to realize he won't simply rehash his ''Seinfeld'' role.
20_9	0.093422394	''I'm not the Kramer character,'' he said.
21_0	0.15485181	NEW YORK _ Literature it was not: It was only a sitcom script, filled with comma faults and repeatedly misspelled words.
21_1	0.044639339	``Alright,'' for example, appears on pages 9, 10, 24, 32, and 43.
21_2	0.095245762	All right, so ``Seinfeld'' was not perfect on paper, and bee-quality spelling is not a must for must-see television.
21_3	0.091932137	But are sitcom scripts ready to become gallery-quality collectibles worth thousands of dollars?
21_4	0.08985944	As they say on television, stay tuned.
21_5	0.0751318	On June 18, little more than a month after the quintessentially self-involved quartet from ``Seinfeld'' went the way of the barroom busybodies on ``Cheers'' and the medics on ``MASH,'' Christie's East is scheduled to auction the 68-page script with all the ``alrights''.
21_6	0.091981492	Christie's East estimates that the script from the 1992-93 season will go for $1,500 to $2,000.
21_7	0.035366329	But some television-memorabilia dealers, like Robert Schagrin of the Gotta Have It gallery in Manhattan, maintain that the bidding could easily go higher because the market for nontraditional Hollywood collectibles is blossoming.
21_8	0.064138755	``TV scripts are fast becoming the pop art of the future,'' said Schagrin, who specializes in television-age collectibles like scripts and props from old shows.
21_9	0.091917031	``As you enter the new millennium, all of this stuff is going to quite naturally become what 19th-century stuff was to the 20th century''.
21_10	0.053970654	Just as location, location, location is a mantra in real estate, television-script dealers value autographs, autographs, autographs.
21_11	0.088823153	The ``Seinfeld'' script in the Christie's East sale bears the signatures of the four principal cast members (not Larry David, who wrote it).
21_12	0.12643756	On the first page are Jerry Seinfeld's loopy but legible autograph, Michael Richards' hasty-looking flourish and the almost unreadable signatures of Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
21_13	0.093490319	``Seinfeld'' fans will recognize the script as the one that introduced the phrase ``master of my domain'' to the language.
21_14	0.077286178	``This was one of my favorites,'' chuckled Simeon Lipman, the 23-year-old head of the popular arts department at Christie's East.
21_15	0.070135782	``It's an Emmy Award-winning episode, it's an episode that `Seinfeld' fans remember and this is what is known in television jargon as an original `table draft'''.
21_16	0.063511449	In other words, the script being sold was used on the set, not an ``as broadcast'' version that codified lines the actors ad-libbed.
21_17	0.093166954	Nor is it a mere working draft that contained scenes dropped before the episode was filmed.
21_18	0.049308234	Lipman maintains that television memorabilia is an increasingly profitable corner of what trade magazines estimate is the $10 billion market for collectibles.
21_19	0.051361275	Dealers say that prices for television scripts have gained altitude in the media-saturated 1990s, propelled by network-television hype that has become an unwitting affirmation of Andy Warhol's notion of creating public awareness.
21_20	0.077192994	But dealers maintain that television memorabilia has transcended the short-term hype for a particular series like ``Seinfeld,'' becoming a genuine pop-cultural phenomenon.
21_21	0.096946107	The ``Seinfeld'' script is not the first television script to go on the auction block.
21_22	0.052008573	Christie's sold 10 scripts from ``The Honeymooners'' for $5,950 in 1996.
21_23	0.067449295	Again, value is tied to autographs: Schagrin guessed that if a signed ``Honeymooners'' script existed, it would be worth more than $50,000.
21_24	0.091988605	``God, that would be like the four Beatles signing on the music to `The White Album,''' he said.
21_25	0.082479204	Last year, a script from the short-lived 1978 revival of ``This Is Your Life'' went for $1,150.
21_26	0.093812698	Once again, autographs were essential to its value: The script was signed by Muhammad Ali and his trainer.
21_27	0.085935159	Schagrin maintains that scripts are appreciating faster than other film and television collectibles.
21_28	0.076957658	A script for an episode of ``MASH,'' signed by the entire cast, sold for $700 in 1995; earlier this year, it went for $4,000.
21_29	0.076291047	A signed script from the NBC sitcom ``Friends'' that sold for $550 in 1996 sold recently for $1,800.
21_30	0.086739998	And a ``Cheers'' script sold for $900 soon after that long-running sitcom went off the air in 1993.
21_31	0.08844822	The owner recently put it on the market for $5,000.
21_32	0.06821957	``We didn't sell it,'' Schagrin said.
21_33	0.082177702	``While we were working on it, he called back and said, `Sorry, it's gone'''.
21_34	0.079485223	In the June 18 sale, Christie's East will also auction the original proposal for ``Star Trek'' by the science fiction writer Gene Roddenberry.
21_35	0.08843046	The 26-page typewritten document describes the spaceship Enterprise as ``a wagon train to the stars''.
21_36	0.092322257	Most of the characters Roddenberry envisioned did not boldly go before the cameras, though: only Spock (``with a red-hewed, satanic look and surprisingly gentle manners'') made it onto the show.
21_37	0.080629134	Christie's East estimates that the ``Star Trek'' proposal will sell for $12,000 to $15,000, a figure that dealers like Lipman hope the ``Seinfeld'' script will someday bring.
21_38	0.10333093	Not yet, he acknowledged.
21_39	0.091946217	But not to worry, either.
21_40	0.081530414	``They're going to replay `Seinfeld' for decades to come,'' Lipman said, ``and it's truly the most iconic of all television series for this time.
21_41	0.090127483	`Seinfeld' will have staying power, which can only help with the scripts.''
22_0	0.19232199	NEW YORK (AP) --Imagine Jerry Seinfeld inside his Long Island mansion, baby bottle in one hand, burp cloth in the other, musing: Whyyyyy do they call it a burp cloth?
22_1	0.034589839	That's right.
22_2	0.062262465	First came love (1998), then came marriage (last December)--and now Seinfeld and bride, Jessica Sklar, will soon be pushing a baby carriage.
22_3	0.041305617	The big announcement was made Thursday by Seinfeld pal Regis Philbin on TV's ''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee''.
22_4	0.086837998	''Yes. It's true.
22_5	0.10542495	There will be a new little Seinfeld sometime this fall,'' said Seinfeld's spokeswoman, Elizabeth Clarke.
22_6	0.08540579	It is the first child for both Sklar and Seinfeld, who made millions from a TV show that glorified single life and poked fun at commitment.
22_7	0.091757112	But that was then and this is now, and soon the 45-year-old Seinfeld will be up to his diaper bag in commitment.
22_8	0.091448487	Seinfeld apparently asked Philbin to serve up the news for him.
22_9	0.091842742	Philbin did it gladly, informing viewers that the little Seinfeld is scheduled to arrive in October.
22_10	0.089655025	Clarke did not want to pinpoint the due date.
22_11	0.1009265	The new arrival may have the undevoted attention of his dad, who retired his series in 1998.
22_12	0.083765644	Baby Seinfeld will also have plenty of room for all that kid stuff like swing sets, playhouses, bicycles and building blocks.
22_13	0.070164471	The couple are reportedly paying as much as $40 million for Billy Joel's 12-acre oceanfront mansion in East Hampton.
22_14	0.086416917	And there are other kids in the neighborhood for playdates.

23_0	0.093554866	&UR; &LR; Some people never can say goodbye.
23_1	0.1628213	But not Jerry Seinfeld.
23_2	0.088758382	In the spring, the comedian bid a much publicized adieu to his hugely successful sitcom after nine years.
23_3	0.18305908	And Sunday night, live from New York on HBO, he said farewell again, this time to the stand-up material he has cultivated so far in his career.
23_4	0.13252393	While the special was titled ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time'' most of Seinfeld's fans were probably hearing these jokes for the first time.
23_5	0.039232871	Excluding the brief stand-up snippets that bookmarked ``Seinfeld'' in its early years, we've mostly encountered his distinctive view of life in the form of situational gags split among at least three other jokers.
23_6	0.050312448	Sunday night, wearing a suit and tie, Seinfeld appeared confident and eager as he stood alone on a stage with a stool and a glass of water, delivering his charmingly trivial observations to an adoring house.
23_7	0.079619647	At one point, a woman yelled out that she loved Seinfeld, triggering his ad lib ``I love you too, but I do feel the need to'' _ he gestured at the rest of the audience _ ``see other people''.
23_8	0.10531564	Miraculously, he managed not to be diminished by the hype that surrounded the HBO special, his first prime-time appearance since May and the final performance of a world tour that has been heavily promoted.
23_9	0.086799919	Seinfeld's hour revolved mostly around his amazement at the strangeness of ordinary things.
23_10	0.077777681	Always obsessed with hygiene, he spent some time wondering about New York cab drivers and their body odor.
23_11	0.093365123	``How long are these shifts''? he exclaimed.
23_12	0.05223956	He thought out loud on the subject of pharmacists, who always seem to dispense their drugs from platforms, and he dwelled on the very specific expiration dates milk companies put on their cartons: ``Maybe the cows tip them off when they're millking them''.
23_13	0.093627594	One surprise was the physicality of his performance.
23_14	0.11035832	It was Michael Richards as Kramer &UR; &LR; who provided most of the visual humor on ``Seinfeld,'' but Sunday night Seinfeld repeatedly used his body and facial expressions to tell his stories.
23_15	0.076664862	He mimicked the way flight attendants instruct plane passengers on how to put on a seat belt and how they point vaguely to the emergency exits.
23_16	0.089932773	He did an impression of a wolf man shaving.
23_17	0.090798006	And in a riff about a forthcoming visit to Florida, he pretended to be an elderly person backing out of a driveway without looking.
23_18	0.09339827	On ``Seinfeld,'' his humor seemed strikingly original and even edgy.
23_19	0.092884464	In a stand-up context, it had a more conventional, ``Tonight Show'' feel to it.
23_20	0.086261753	There was no envelope pushing, no Robin Williams/Jim Carrey-styled craziness; just an energetic man and his unusual sensibility.
23_21	0.09316003	But it was a mostly amusing hour that, like the sitcom, ended just before the laughs began to thin out.
23_22	0.11040512	The show left no indication of where Seinfeld hopes to take his comedy, now that he's told these jokes for the last time.
23_23	0.093945373	The stand-up routine was preceded by a very short, star-filled film set in a graveyard.
23_24	0.094638951	As a group of very familiar faces of comedy stood watching in mock grief, including Garry Shandling, George Carlin, Ed McMahon, Paul Reiser, Alan King, and Jay Leno, Seinfeld buried a coffin filled with pages of his jokes.
23_25	0.092066507	Let's hope it's his final act of finality, for this year at least.
24_0	0.13144902	It's time to cut another check for Jerry Seinfeld.
24_1	0.079858332	In a record cable deal worth more than $100 million, TBS has purchased national cable and metro Atlanta rights to syndicated repeats of ``Seinfeld'' to begin in fall 2002 and last four years.
24_2	0.054106938	The Atlanta-based station will reportedly pay more than $600,000 apiece for 180 ``Seinfeld'' episodes, eclipsing the price Lifetime earlier negotiated for cable syndication rights to Ellen DeGeneres' sitcom, ``Ellen''.
24_3	0.055877305	Though a cable benchmark, the deal doesn't approach the nearly $286 million a year NBC will pay for first-run ``ER'' episodes for the next three seasons.
24_4	0.11833118	But it's still a lot of cash for Seinfeld and his show's distributor, Columbia TriStar TV.
24_5	0.077300191	Variety estimates that all `Seinfeld'' syndication deals to date have bumped the show's overall gross to much more than $1.5 billion.
24_6	0.040804666	TBS' contract will bump ``Seinfeld'' repeats, a big ratings booster, off WATL in metro Atlanta.
24_7	0.016334031	WATL's pact expires in March 2001.
24_8	0.085828416	There remains an 18-month period between that date and the start of ``Seinfeld'' on TBS that WATL might purchase.

24_11	0.093850761	``We're very confident of this show.
24_12	0.089221663	We think it has legs''.
24_13	0.093540593	So far, ``Seinfeld'' repeats have been a strong performer, especially in metro Atlanta.
24_14	0.066860227	The show, now most often airing at 10 o'clock weeknights on WATL, sometimes beats nearly all prime-time programming.
24_15	0.068194851	During the May sweeps, the period stations use to set ad rates worth millions of dollars, ``Seinfeld'' repeats averaged nearly 185,000 metro Atlanta homes.
24_16	0.068095624	``May was sensational,'' said Don Hess, WATL programming chief.
24_17	0.089166849	But four years from now, he said, ``Seinfeld'' might lose its ratings heat.
