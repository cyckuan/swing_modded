4_0	0.1026106	NEW YORK _ Only 18 months ago, NBC's executives were riding a wave of prime-time success that had raised the network to record-setting profits.
4_1	0.089151738	The executives were so confident that they were occasionally suggesting that they did not merely want to be the No.
4_2	0.10865804	1 network; they wanted to be the only network.
4_3	0.096574259	NBC was convinced it had a sound strategy for maintaining its elevated position in the ratings and could be the first network to avoid the ride down the bad side of the ratings wheel of fortune.
4_4	0.1531913	But some of the edge came off that confidence last Christmas, when Jerry Seinfeld announced that he was stopping production on the comedy series that had led NBC to its record profits.
4_5	0.13013712	Now, in the first season of no ``Seinfeld,'' NBC finds itself in a suddenly altered position: on the downside of dominance.
4_6	0.077624053	As it did in the early 1990s, NBC is once again struggling to counteract a combination of familiar factors: the hit that could not be replaced, the suddenly dry pipeline of new hits, the ball-and-chain encumbrances of commitments to previous hit makers and the internal executive turf battles.
4_7	0.099099264	And once again the network is looking to a new entertainment executive to help stem the downward turn of the programming cycle that has inevitably hit every network that reached a position of prime-time dominance in the last two decades.
4_8	0.071276423	If there were ever any doubts about the ratings clout of ``Seinfeld,'' they have now been erased.
4_9	0.082931993	NBC's ratings are off by more than 20 percent this fall, a figure surely higher than NBC expected when it calculated how badly it would be hit by the departure of ``Seinfeld''.
4_10	0.07783414	Tellingly, the network's biggest losses have been among younger men, the biggest fans of ``Seinfeld''.
4_11	0.068883218	Some of that is also the result of NBC's abandonment of National Football League games this year.
4_12	0.071392401	But even when all sports programming is factored out (NBC had the World Series and the Super Bowl last year), among men between the ages of 18 and 49, NBC is still off by 22 percent.
4_13	0.076282734	Among men between 18 and 34 the figure grows to 31 percent.
4_14	0.090983153	That is the state of play that the new executive, Scott Sassa, encounters as he joins the network as the president of entertainment.
4_15	0.067344195	Sassa, 39, former head of all entertainment operations for the Turner Broadcasting cable channels, was appointed to replace the longtime NBC programmer, Warren Littlefield, last week.
4_16	0.078028333	NBC called the move the first step in a planned transition that would bring Sassa into total control of NBC entertainment operations.
4_17	0.080493369	For at least a year he will work under Don Ohlmeyer, the executive brought in the last time NBC, a unit of General Electric, faced a clouding-over prime-time picture.
4_18	0.052243569	That was in 1993, and things were much worse then.
4_19	0.081737533	Ohlmeyer, who is now widely credited with providing the leadership that turned NBC around, had to start almost from scratch.
4_20	0.076241726	NBC's executive reorganization this time comes at a far earlier point in NBC's ratings decline.
4_21	0.080711925	Still, senior NBC executives acknowledge that they must make moves now to level off the network; and they believe they can.
4_22	0.078834347	NBC's position remains reasonably secure for the moment, because no other network is making a strong upward movement that would help force NBC down further, and because NBC still possesses a core of television's strongest shows _ ``E.R.
4_23	0.091191867	,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Friends'' and ``Law and Order''.
4_24	0.075361267	But NBC is also embroiled in a bitter standoff with the Hollywood studios that supply all those hits.
4_25	0.076625843	NBC has demanded an ownership stake in all new programs and the studios have refused.
4_26	0.071711718	Instead, they have begun what is in effect a boycott of NBC.
4_27	0.081413763	For the moment, that means those studios will not be supplying NBC with any of the hits the network needs to pull out of its current slide.
4_28	0.091497548	NBC must have those hits because for the last three seasons, no compelling new program has been added to NBC's store.
4_29	0.083182421	Network executives concede that program development has been weak and no real hits have emerged in the last three years.
4_30	0.098207188	The strength of ``Seinfeld,'' along with the ratings garnered last year by the World Series and the Super Bowl, helped mask the problems for a time.
4_31	0.086046854	The network's focus on maximizing profits also led to what several NBC executives said were some questionable strategic moves, such as attempting in the fall of 1997 to flood the NBC schedule with comedies, a record 18 of them, primarily because comedies generally get a higher price from advertisers than any other kind of programming.
4_32	0.091990878	Looking to capitalize on that, NBC also dropped its Monday night movie, which had been reasonably successful.
4_33	0.079917511	That led, according to NBC executives, to internal turf battles as NBC's top movie executive, Lindy DeKoven, was squeezed out by the rest of the program department.
4_34	0.076743617	But few of the comedies NBC introduced worked.
4_35	0.092927183	Reflecting a widely held view, one former top program executive from a competing network suggested a couple of reasons for this.
4_36	0.085418027	``It was a combination of so many shows with the same upscale urban premise and simple lack of execution,'' the executive said.
4_37	0.085372952	Indeed, NBC seemed fixated on one kind of show: a vehicle for a female star playing a single woman in some media surrounding, usually in New York.
4_38	0.081535924	The list of shows with that premise introduced by NBC during the last three years includes ``Caroline in the City,'' ``Suddenly Susan,'' ``Fired Up,'' ``Naked Truth'' and ``Veronica's Closet''.
4_39	0.11403774	Each of these shows was tried in the program slot between ``Seinfeld'' and ``E.R''.
4_40	0.091794789	_ arguably the most advantageous place to build an audience for a new show ever created by television.
4_41	0.12400217	But not one of the shows has developed into a bona fide hit.
4_42	0.092186835	``We went with this cookie-cutter approach,'' one senior NBC executive said.
4_43	0.028461955	``It just didn't work.
4_44	0.090489334	And it meant we wasted that 9:30 slot behind `Seinfeld' instead of finding the hit that could help replace it''.
4_45	0.099494198	Because no hit emerged from all those attempts, NBC was forced to move its next best comedy, ``Frasier,'' to Thursday at 9, where ``Seinfeld'' lived.
4_46	0.083613044	That did help shore up Thursday, which has been NBC's stronghold for almost two decades.
4_47	0.094934959	But in so doing, NBC drastically weakened Tuesday.
4_48	0.096460204	Thanks to ``Frasier,'' NBC had erased ABC's former dominance on Tuesdays.
4_49	0.093593782	Now ``Frasier'' is relocated and another longtime comedy hit, ``Mad About You,'' is fading in its last season.
4_50	0.08919383	With some stronger ABC comedies on that night, NBC has again fallen well back of ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co.
4_51	0.07936801	Tuesday's decline has also been advanced by the failure of one hoped-for new comedy, ``Encore!
4_52	0.08492212	Encore''! That is being pointed to as evidence that NBC, despite previous assurances that it would not let commitments to stars or producers of previous hits pull it down, has fallen prey to the mistake of putting deals instead of shows on the air.
4_53	0.10134239	``Encore! Encore''! was produced because NBC had a deal with its star, Nathan Lane, and the producers of ``Frasier''.
4_54	0.09381144	But the show has been a severe disappointment that has damaged another promising comedy, ``Just Shoot Me,'' which NBC had hoped would maintain the network's strength on Tuesdays.
4_55	0.075148231	``Encore! Encore''! is far from the only failure in the current fall crop, however.
4_56	0.068516684	One drama, ``Wind on Water,'' has already been canceled.
4_57	0.076139765	Another, ``Trinity'' (created as a result of a deal with the producer of ``E.R.''), is endangered.
4_58	0.085824776	Another comedy, ``Conrad Bloom,'' is listing badly on Mondays.
4_59	0.08729617	Only ``Will and Grace,'' a comedy about a gay man living with a straight woman, has shown some signs of promise.
4_60	0.064654202	But that may only be because it has been up against weak competition.
4_61	0.090984937	When CBS broadcast a repeat of its best comedy, ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' against ``Will and Grace'' last week, the show took a big fall.
4_62	0.083229224	Still, NBC, because it owns ``Will and Grace'' and needs it to succeed, plans to move the show to Thursday, probably in the spot now occupied by ``Veronica's Closet,'' another significant disappointment.
4_63	0.082804488	But several senior NBC executives said the network could not move ``Veronica'' until 13 episodes have been broadcast this year as a result of the huge deal with its production company, Warner Brothers, owned by Time Warner, for the continuation of ``E.R''.
4_64	0.087868452	That deal cost NBC $13 million an episode, of course, wiping out its profitability for NBC.
4_65	0.089998653	The enormous cost of that deal hardened NBC's position about insisting on an ownership stake in all its new shows, and the studios responded by refusing to deal with NBC.
4_66	0.091475064	Bob Wright, president of NBC, said he believed NBC would solve its impasse with the studios, but that it did not necessarily need to.
4_67	0.064766081	``We aren't that dependent on the studios,'' he said.
4_68	0.077229146	Sassa, however, seemed to signal that he would take steps to resolve the standoff.
4_69	0.08992127	And another senior NBC executive said, ``Scott will solve that''.
4_70	0.093211397	What Sassa will do to solve the drought of hits is less certain.
4_71	0.080065602	The cupboard is all but bare at the moment, with only two possible replacement series in production.
4_72	0.089670685	And neither of those, a comedy, ``Lateline,'' and a drama, ``Providence,'' is thought to resemble a cavalry charge.
4_73	0.08348947	Some competing programmers suggested in interviews that NBC might be wise to circle its wagons and place its strongest lineup of shows on Tuesday and Thursday for the time being.
4_74	0.085293529	One show several other programmers said NBC might try to rely on is ``Third Rock From the Sun,'' a once highly regarded comedy that NBC used as a weapon on Wednesday night to try to damage the ABC hit ``Drew Carey,'' only to see ``Third Rock'' suffer badly.
4_75	0.082751748	NBC might also consider returning the Monday night made-for-television movie, several programmers suggested, pairing it with the ever-expanding news magazine ``Dateline,'' and dropping some of its weak Monday comedies.
4_76	0.087779788	But the movies that filled that slot were taken out of development and it would take months to get any stockpile of movies established.
4_77	0.08651996	Ohlmeyer is expected to take a much more hands-on role in developing the next batch of NBC shows while Sassa learns the details of running the entertainment division.

18_28	0.093473541	When asked if the protest of the episode by some Puerto Ricans was legitimate or a politically correct over-reaction, Seinfeld raised his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders.
18_29	0.081922854	While Seinfeld said that he doesn't have a favorite episode, he did recall with great affection the one in which he mugs an elderly woman for her loaf of marble rye.

19_7	0.16348358	Freshness is precisely not the point of ``Jerry Seinfeld: `I'm Telling You For the Last Time' _ Live on Broadway''.
19_8	0.017095855	Looking backward is.
19_9	0.19445936	New York is the last stop and Sunday's live television show the final performance in a two-month world tour.
19_10	0.090202069	That amounts to a farewell tour for this material, which Seinfeld has said he will retire.
19_11	0.079827559	These Broadway performances hold no clue to his future, but they say a lot about his past.
19_12	0.096311099	He comes full circle here, back to the stand-up routines that inspired his phenomenally successful sitcom.
19_13	0.10963916	He did, after all, play a stand-up comic named Jerry Seinfeld in the series, and in its early years each episode began and ended with sitcom Jerry offering a snippet of his act.
19_14	0.090109674	On Broadway, that act has a familiar but still funny feel, with material long-honed and often recognizable from the series, talk show appearances and his best-selling book ``Seinlanguage''.
19_15	0.077528046	In Australia, he visited the great Barrier Reef ; in Iceland, he worked the word Reykjavikians into the routine; in Des Moines, Iowa, he gave away all the tickets.
19_16	0.071460131	Most shows on the tour sold out; some didn't.
19_17	0.10224724	But New York is home, the audience was primed to adore him, and all he really had to do was show up.
19_18	-0.0035420182	He did more.
19_19	0.085532901	Relaxed, with impeccable timing, he gave a warm but controlled, hour-long performance built on small, shrewdly targeted observations.
19_20	0.092592241	And now that the cloud of hype that covered the final ``Seinfeld'' episode is receding, the performance highlights why he became immensely popular in the first place and how influential his style of stand-up has become.
19_21	0.09277167	He began with a line only New Yorkers could love, in language so purely Seinfeld that it can only be a self-reference: ``So what's with the cabbies and the b.o''.?
19_22	0.07990761	He went on to talk about the lunacy of astronauts taking a car to the moon, and the instructions given by flight attendents: ``They show you how to use a seatbelt in case you haven't been in a car since 1965''.
19_23	0.075584166	There is little danger of giving away the best jokes, because he has already given away so many himself.
19_24	0.077091583	It is nearly impossible to give away the punchlines because the essence of his style is that he has none.
19_25	0.092012512	``Tell you what I like about Chinese people, they're hanging in there with the chopsticks,'' he says, even though, ``They've seen the fork''.
19_26	0.096217763	In a dark suit and tie, stand-up Jerry is better dressed than sitcom Jerry ever was.
19_27	0.054703059	And he makes more funny faces.
19_28	0.087297601	He imitated a turtle making change, offered the voice of a sarcastic horse, as well as the pinched face of a neighbor's pet monkey.
19_29	0.087128742	``That's the look you have on your face when you're that close to being the dominant species on the planet and you didn't make it''.
19_30	0.07530466	He interacted with the audience just enough to seem warm, but not so much that he lost control.
19_31	0.09190893	To someone who threw a business card with a scribbled note on stage he said: ``No, I'm not going to read it.
19_32	0.10007022	I'm busy''!
19_33	0.09512183	Scads of comedians are now doing what Seinfeld made popular, relying on dry observations rather than jokey punch lines.
19_34	0.084146597	His opening act on Broadway (there will be none for the HBO show), the comedian Kevin Meaney, whipped the audience up with a frenetic energy that semeed conspicuously old-fashioned next to the cool Seinfeld style, even though Meaney's routine came with deliberately retro touches, such as his maroon jacket and bow tie, and a routine in which he pretends to sing a duet with Frank Sinatra.
19_35	0.11468354	Though Seinfeld has his routine down, each performance varies a bit, so Sunday's televised show is not entirely predictable.
19_36	0.104919	The HBO show will include a brief filmed opening with Seinfeld and unannounced guests (not from the cast of ``Seinfeld'').
19_37	0.095863335	On stage, he said of the HBO special: ``It's live.
19_38	0.077078295	When I screw up, you see it''.
19_39	0.08336502	He's not likely to flub such a well-crafted routine, though it's just as well that he's putting the material out to pasture.
19_40	0.089485294	After these long Seinfeld goodbyes, it's time for something new, maybe even risky.
19_41	0.11021084	One of the funniest recent Seinfeld appearances comes in a promo for Sunday's show, in which he pretends to have taken up painting as his next career.
19_42	0.084332095	He splashes cans of paint wildy on a canvas while a proper visitor, played by Marian Seldes, asks whether he'll go back to stand-up if the art thing doesn't work out.
19_43	0.062953351	``How could it not work out''? he wonders.
19_44	0.082795309	He looks goofily pleased with himself, with a wild-eyed glimpse of inspiration at the thought of something new.

20_5	0.074752479	Excluding the brief stand-up snippets that bookmarked ``Seinfeld'' in its early years, we've mostly encountered his distinctive view of life in the form of situational gags split among at least three other jokers.
20_6	0.074211108	Sunday night, wearing a suit and tie, Seinfeld appeared confident and eager as he stood alone on a stage with a stool and a glass of water, delivering his charmingly trivial observations to an adoring house.
20_7	0.080737869	At one point, a woman yelled out that she loved Seinfeld, triggering his ad lib ``I love you too, but I do feel the need to'' _ he gestured at the rest of the audience _ ``see other people''.
20_8	0.097433187	Miraculously, he managed not to be diminished by the hype that surrounded the HBO special, his first prime-time appearance since May and the final performance of a world tour that has been heavily promoted.
20_9	0.092745713	Seinfeld's hour revolved mostly around his amazement at the strangeness of ordinary things.
20_10	0.097067727	Always obsessed with hygiene, he spent some time wondering about New York cab drivers and their body odor.
20_11	0.062453236	``How long are these shifts''? he exclaimed.
20_12	0.080414018	He thought out loud on the subject of pharmacists, who always seem to dispense their drugs from platforms, and he dwelled on the very specific expiration dates milk companies put on their cartons: ``Maybe the cows tip them off when they're millking them''.
20_13	0.077728713	One surprise was the physicality of his performance.
20_14	0.10597022	It was Michael Richards as Kramer &UR; &LR; who provided most of the visual humor on ``Seinfeld,'' but Sunday night Seinfeld repeatedly used his body and facial expressions to tell his stories.
20_15	0.087980289	He mimicked the way flight attendants instruct plane passengers on how to put on a seat belt and how they point vaguely to the emergency exits.
20_16	0.061276014	He did an impression of a wolf man shaving.
20_17	0.086518652	And in a riff about a forthcoming visit to Florida, he pretended to be an elderly person backing out of a driveway without looking.
20_18	0.078153505	On ``Seinfeld,'' his humor seemed strikingly original and even edgy.
20_19	0.082396442	In a stand-up context, it had a more conventional, ``Tonight Show'' feel to it.
20_20	0.081995686	There was no envelope pushing, no Robin Williams/Jim Carrey-styled craziness; just an energetic man and his unusual sensibility.
20_21	0.081366514	But it was a mostly amusing hour that, like the sitcom, ended just before the laughs began to thin out.
20_22	0.13643727	The show left no indication of where Seinfeld hopes to take his comedy, now that he's told these jokes for the last time.
20_23	0.082277097	The stand-up routine was preceded by a very short, star-filled film set in a graveyard.
20_24	0.08181019	As a group of very familiar faces of comedy stood watching in mock grief, including Garry Shandling, George Carlin, Ed McMahon, Paul Reiser, Alan King, and Jay Leno, Seinfeld buried a coffin filled with pages of his jokes.
20_25	0.074141368	Let's hope it's his final act of finality, for this year at least.

22_1	0.091260474	_ Phil Morris must have found the whole thing professionally unsettling or, at least, personally amusing.
22_2	0.089600326	One moment he's a B-list actor whose last TV credit was The Love Boat: The Next Wave on a D-list network.
22_3	0.13797518	The next, he's resurrecting his recurring Seinfeld character, a trigger-happy lawyer named Jackie Chiles, to star in an NBC sitcom executive-produced by Jerry Seinfeld and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David.
22_4	0.058516162	And slated for 8:30 Thursday nights, no less.
22_5	0.075034617	Reporters who normally scurry by Morris en route to a higher-grade celebrity are sticking tape recorders in his face and clamoring for more specifics concerning the big announcement that's really no announcement at all.
22_6	0.088673998	Says Morris, as a joke, I hope: ``This whole thing could be wrapped up by the time I make it home''.
22_7	0.092321575	He's referring to his pretentiously sordid profession, a business in which the art of the deal can be something of a bizarre art form in itself.
22_8	0.073491659	That no matter how much talent you have, or how decorative a resume you possess, you're only as valuable as you're perceived to be.
22_9	0.047857869	Read on and this might make sense yet.
22_10	0.06264369	Morris hasn't signed anything for anyone.
22_11	0.083372802	In fact, he hasn't even met formally with Seinfeld or David or NBC about a comedy series based on the wacky attorney, last seen as a rather funny punch line in a Honda TV ad.
22_12	0.089541726	Yet as newspapers ran the item, entertainment television picked up the story.
22_13	0.082457783	And as one cable executive said while reading the blurb in the Los Angeles Times, under the heading ``Seinfeld Spin-off?,'' ``If they hadn't made a deal, they're probably in serious talks by now''.
22_14	0.081250941	This reminds me of the 1989 film The Big Picture, in which a young filmmaker, depressed by his inability to find work, spends an afternoon driving around with his girlfriend and, in the space of a few hours, becomes the hottest director in town.
22_15	0.072817615	Why? Because he didn't return phone calls.
22_16	0.068208112	Not because he's juggling the many deals pouring in, but because he was simply unavailable.
22_17	0.080675137	Morris might be experiencing a similar snowball effect.
22_18	0.11356023	He was part of a news conference promoting a movie for Black Entertainment Television when asked about the lack of minority characters who toiled on Seinfeld.
22_19	0.08960788	Seeing that the Jackie Chiles character is the only one to resurface since the comedy ended, Morris was merely pointing out the irony of it all: that the first and perhaps only spinoff of a series constantly attacked for its lack of minority characters could, would, should be fronted by the show's lone black character.
22_20	0.090327958	Journalists pounced on the just-kinda-thinking-aloud comment, and before long the news was making the rounds as though it had a life of its own.
22_21	0.054839283	Which, of course, it did.
22_22	0.086828658	In understanding this, we have to remember that a disdain for truth in labeling seems to be par for the course in this company town, and though there are certainly talented people working and creating here, it's by and large a place of style without content and progression without talent.
22_23	0.076149047	It's so backward that it's a wonder the talented ever get their share of the pie.
22_24	0.094730122	For example: Despite his striking leading-man looks and effortless acting style, Jessie Martin was struggling until David E.
22_25	0.085253287	Kelley cast him in a handful of episodes of Ally McBeal playing Ally's (Calista Flockhart's) love interest.
22_26	0.07838287	Martin's buzz came not during his episodes but after his character returned after being written out.
22_27	0.091203694	Sensing that audience reaction convinced Kelley to bring Martin back, networks started falling over themselves to sign the actor to development deals.
22_28	0.085634234	Fox seemingly had the inside track, but once Benjamin Bratt exited Dick Wolf's Law &AMP; Order, NBC came up with the best offer: a key spot on a stable, creatively satisfying series.
22_29	0.084913965	Then there's Tea Leoni, a former ``it'' girl who came to our attention as the good-time girl in the Fox comedy Flying Blind and nearly immediately landed in the disastrous The Naked Truth.
22_30	0.044838625	She's now out of TV.
22_31	0.080913432	Jenna Elfman's similar tale had a more positive result.
22_32	0.076560787	She was jobless after the Molly Ringwald-led sitcom Townies, in which she co-starred, flopped.
22_33	0.0344624	But not for long.
22_34	0.082416645	This could be debated, but it seems Elfman raised her stature when, during a promotional party for ABC stars, she leapt on the stage at the House of Blues and danced, if you want to call it that.
22_35	0.081856657	Shortly after that, the statuesque, slinky Elfman became a hot commodity _ and ABC gave her a sitcom, Dharma &AMP; Greg.
22_36	0.08147588	Will Morris actually do a sitcom based on Jackie Chiles?
22_37	0.037887312	The wait will be interesting.
22_38	0.085584192	Or did his comments have about as much validity as the cabbie who tried to convince me that CBS is sitting on a sitcom script of his, one about a taxi driver and the wacky people who parade in and out of his back seat?
22_39	0.066014191	My advice?
22_40	0.072981055	Don't return phone calls.

23_0	0.23410328	NEW YORK (AP) --A judge threw out a $100 million lawsuit filed by a man who claims Jerry Seinfeld and his TV producers stole his identity for the character of George Costanza.
23_1	0.085572627	State Supreme Court Justice Harold Tompkins said Michael Costanza's suit was frivolous.
23_2	0.1010934	Costanza, a real estate agent who lives on Long Island, said his rights were violated when the show used his ``name, likeness and persona'' to create the neurotic and nutty George for ``Seinfeld''.
23_3	0.10263546	Costanza said the show portrayed him in a negative, humiliating light, and that ``Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David defamed him when he called Costanza a ``liar'' and ``flagrant opportunist'' trying to cash in.
23_4	0.084141026	Tompkins said he found the lawsuit baseless and assessed sanctions of $2,500 each against Costanza, 43, and his lawyer, Jonathan Fisher.
24_0	0.071150248	That pretty much sums up Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm.
24_1	0.069477058	The one-hour special contains some laugh-out-loud moments but also some long stretches of humor-free aridness.
24_2	0.053669735	One crucial difference: Curb Your Enthusiasm violates half of David's famous no-hugging, no-learning rule of television.
24_3	0.26306695	``There was some hugging at the end of the show,'' David said in a conference call.
24_4	0.041725026	``It was as insincere as you could get.
24_5	0.050302332	Insin cere hugging is al lowed''.
24_6	0.067781032	Although David, who penned some of Seinfeld's most darkly brilliant ep isodes, is more or less the model for George Costanza, he is also a former stand-up comedian himself.
24_7	0.066653688	He hadn't performed onstage for 10 years and mentioned to a friend that he was thinking about giv ing it another shot.
24_8	0.042732644	``He said, `You should film it,' '' David said.
24_9	0.041691842	``Like everything else, I was reluctant at first.
24_10	0.068868014	The more people I asked about it, everyone seemed to think it was a good idea.
24_11	0.064966451	I thought it was a way to motivate me to get on stage''.
24_12	0.072389221	However, he wasn't interested in the standard film-the-comedian-telling-jokes format.
24_13	0.10103774	``I wanted to do something different,'' he said, ``rather than the straight stand-up show.
24_14	0.076874685	Then, I started to think I needed some other stuff in there, what we were going to do offstage.
24_15	0.071356132	We couldn't just follow me around the supermarket shopping, so I had to come up with some stuff''.
24_16	0.09208958	``Some stuff' wound up being about 90 per cent of the show, with the stand-up routines in New York and LA only a small part (a ratio close to the early episodes of Seinfeld as well).
24_17	0.078275906	Curb Your Enthusiasm turned out to be mostly a mock LA documentary _ totally unscripted _ about David's return to stand-up.
24_18	0.086641052	``It's not totally mock,'' David said, stressing that revealing just what is real and what isn't would spoil the fun for viewers.
24_19	0.041794108	``Certainly, the stand-up is real.
24_20	0.063033571	I would say that there are elements in there that are real.
24_21	0.057292831	Most of it's embellished, but some of it's real''.
24_22	0.084560282	Part of the genuineness, David said, is his person ality.
24_23	0.089720695	``It's not that much of a character,'' he said of the Larry David we see on-screen.
24_24	0.083330329	``I'm not re ally stretching there.
24_25	0.10895066	That's pretty much who I am''.
24_26	0.074725995	That Larry David wanders around a good bit, mumbling about life and its foibles, sounding remarkably like a certain bespectacled, balding, chunky, self-proclaimed loser from a late, great hit TV series.
24_27	0.073995498	``I really resent that `who's call ing'?
24_28	0.052300245	'' he says while making a phone call.
24_29	0.068506086	``Like some people are good enough to make the cut''.
24_30	0.067145521	Jason Alexander, who played George on Seinfeld, makes an ap pearance, commenting on David.
24_31	0.076661735	So does Jerry himself, who relates that during his early stand-up days, Da vid referred to the audience as ``you people''.
24_32	0.067121203	Other comedians show up, as well, including Richard Lewis.
24_33	0.069467223	``He was a phenomenon,'' Lewis says of David.
24_34	0.080150367	``He just couldn't get over the hump that comedians have to perform in front of other people''.
24_35	0.072036681	David called his stand-up career ``the epitome of a love-hate rela tionship''.
24_36	0.088925556	``It's the kind of thing where you walk around at times when it's not going well, you blame it on the au dience,'' he said.
24_37	0.091017839	``You think the whole world must be stupid or you stink and have no talent.
24_38	0.1054146	``When it's going well, you think that you're the greatest thing on two feet and everybody's brilliant.
24_39	0.06135405	.. . It's very extreme thinking''.
24_40	0.10378491	Part of the special concerns other comics telling David how the clubs have changed in the 10 years since he has been onstage.
24_41	0.064780216	Of course, David's life has changed as well.
24_42	0.079053937	Seinfeld has made him a wealthy man, in deed.
24_43	0.081212819	But that's the only change, he said.
24_44	0.079986725	``I'm pretty much the same, but I can get dental work in my house now,'' he said.
24_45	-0.0020432305	``That's the difference''.
24_46	0.073626363	David left Seinfeld after the infa mous season-ending episode in which George's fiancee dies after licking bargain-basement envelopes, and the show lost its dark New York heart, which made it so funny.
24_47	0.07415301	He famously returned for the series-ending show, which managed to combine excessive hype and mini mal laughs for one of TV's biggest flops.
24_48	0.078623278	David naturally begs to differ.
24_49	0.088618771	``I couldn't be more pleased with it,'' he said of the final episode.
24_50	0.069613176	``First of all, the fact that so many people didn't like it?
24_51	0.03689985	I loved that.
24_52	0.073859833	It accomplished everything I think a finale should accomplish''.
24_53	0.094126639	Then he must be delighted with Curb Your Enthusiasm, because it's far funnier than Seinfeld's finale.
24_54	0.063157174	Then again, how could it not be?
