4_1	0.076890569	Back from a two-day European Union summit in Amsterdam, Waigel told reporters in Munich that due to the massive debt burden left over from the former East Germany, Bonn could run up a national debt slightly above the Euro benckmark of 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
4_2	0.082758941	As for another key Euro criterion which requires member states to bring their budget deficits to less than three percent of GDP, Waigel reiterated that three was three, and it should not be softened.
4_3	0.084307219	Waigel also warned against any delay in the planned 1999 launching of the Euro, saying that a delay would encourage EU countries to ease up on budgetary restraint and would almost certainly lead to a surge in the German mark's value that would threaten Germany's economic recovery, and its chances of reducing unemployment.

14_0	0.10399831	PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua) --The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) today called on France to adopt more flexible socio-economic policies in its on-going structural reforms.
14_1	0.089007774	In its 1997 Economic Survey report on France published today, the OECD, which groups 29 industrialized nations, gave credit to the French government over economic growth and cutting public deficits.
14_2	0.10279119	It said that France's economic growth rate could attain 2.5 percent in 1997, and 2.6 percent in 1998, while its public deficit could drop to 3.2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of 1997.
14_3	0.082882735	This means that the aim by the French government to attain the Maastricht deficit limit for joining the European single currency, the euro, is within reach, said the report.
14_4	0.083093937	The OECD said that the real problem France is faced with is not only "cyclical" but also "structural".
14_5	0.091405591	France is greatly lagging behind other OECD countries in flexibility and de-regulation, especially in budgetary policy and the role played by the state in the country's economy, said the report.

14_10	0.14202964	The OECD said that the high unemployment rate of France, which stands around 12.5 percent, reflects the "substantial structural impediments in the functioning of labor markets" of the country.
14_11	0.090307469	But it predicted that France's unemployment should fall over the medium term due to reduction in cyclical unemployment, while the measures taken in recent years, in particular the reduction of the cost of unskilled labor, should reduce structural unemployment.

17_0	0.097683083	BRUSSELS, November 6 (Xinhua) --Two weeks prior to the European Union (EU) job summit, ministers in the European Council still seem far from agreeing on how to iron out their differences.
17_1	0.078019558	The EU ministers spent a long Wednesday airing their sometimes poles-apart views while discussing the guidelines for member states employment policies in 1998.
17_2	0.076155974	Wednesday's discussions concluded without an expected press conference, and the discussion continued today for what looked likely to be another prolonged working day for the ministers.
17_3	0.094279357	Today's meeting was said to be held with consensus that the problem of unemployment has to be solved through entrepreneurship, employability, adaptability and equal opportunity.
17_4	0.075873987	The ministers agreed that they have to move toward concrete and quantifiable commitments for the guidelines which will be delivered to the job summit.
17_5	0.079132242	The summit later this month will be in Luxembourg.
17_6	0.08574465	At stake will be how much each member state has to pay to create a combined total of 25 million more jobs, if the union is to solve the biting issue of unemployment which now runs at an average high of 10.6 percent.
17_7	0.11623929	Unemployment is as high as 19.2 percent in Spain, 12.6 percent in both Finland and France and 10.7 percent in Ireland.
17_8	0.093255722	Though the journal of European Report said that unemployment in Germany was at 9.6 percent, the country itself announced its fifth post-war record high of 11.7 percent last month.
17_9	0.095159089	The EU is already paying 200 billion ECU (229 billion U.S. dollars) each year in unemployment allowances.
17_10	0.093039176	One EU spokesperson said the union was not calling for extra expenditure on unemployment allowances.
17_11	0.089257616	It was calling for priorities to be offered in youth employment and long-term employment.
17_12	0.089687922	European Commissioner Padraig Flynn, in charge of employment and social affairs, said earlier this week that the shared task of the ministers was to ensure that the EU did not remain the zone of high unemployment as it had been for much of the past decade.
17_13	0.092393797	The EU is dedicating the present week as employment week, and discussions and meetings are focused on the issue.
17_14	0.090369545	But observers here were left with the impression that before the job summit, the questions of how much to pay in unemployment allowances and in creating more jobs might still remain "a hard nut to crack."
18_0	0.12121941	PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua)--The OECD report said that the labor costs for low-skilled workers in France are too high, and recommended that wage flexibility should be raised, including reforming the country's minimum wage system, the SMIC.
18_1	0.076846963	It suggests that the role of minimum wage "as a distributive instrument" be reassessed with the objective of increasing employment opportunities, and that the minimum wage be differentiated by age and region.
18_2	0.1021347	While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system of France, the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of France's social protection system, in particular the high cost of unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates.
18_3	0.079379507	"Despite the 1993 reform of the unemployment insurance system, replacement rates (unemployment compensation rates) have remained relatively high for low income earners," it said.
18_4	0.11426823	It suggested that the problems of unemployment and poverty in France be solved through "making the country's benefit system less generous".
18_5	0.086396854	The OECD also called on France to reduce restrictions on mass lay-offs by enterprises, and raise restrictions on the renewal of job contracts for an undetermined period of time, and increase the flexibility of work schedules.
18_6	0.088952266	It said that the costs of mass layoffs and the time they take to implement are "substantial" in France, and that some collective agreements on employment contain "stringent obligations which can severely hamper the pace of restructuring".
18_7	0.098175769	It also regretted that while French enterprises can lay off workers out of economic difficulties, they cannot legally do this simply for obtaining economic benefits.
18_8	0.097405135	The report said that since 1992, the supply of part-time jobs has risen substantially in France, where part-time employment was underdeveloped by comparison with other OECD countries in the past.
18_9	0.088024838	It pointed out that working hour flexibility for full-time workers is "not as yet very developed" in France, even though the relevant legislation has been relaxed.
18_10	0.093949021	"Since 1994, agreements providing for greater flexibility compensated by an overall reduction in working hours have been allowed, but little progress in striking such agreements has actually been made," it said.

19_2	0.080889186	Blair, whose Labor party won a landslide victory on the May 1 general election, is expected to press the case for Europe to move towards the policies that have encouraged overseas firms to choose Britain as a base for investment.
19_3	0.087323691	The 43-year-old new British Prime Minister will tell the other EU leaders that there is a third way between the Tory-style non-intervention and the kind of over-regulation that is blamed for imposing extra costs and higher unemployment on France and Germany.
19_4	0.10390861	He is also expected to make it clear at the summit that he will not allow the Social Chapter to become a means of backdoor imposition on Britain of European legislation on social security and worker involvement on company boards.

20_4	0.089615736	Facing the arrogance of the employers, the silence of the UNEDIC (Union Nationale pour l'Emploi Dans L'Industrie et le Commerce), and absence of new proposals from the government, a dynamic should absolutely continue to find its place," said a communique issued by the associations.
