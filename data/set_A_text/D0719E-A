19_0	0.14636403	PARIS, July 31 (Xinhua) --The number of jobless in France rose by 22,800 in June, which registered a 0.7 percent increase over the previous month and a 4.6 percent rise over the same period last year.
19_1	0.19274417	According to statistics published today by the French Ministry of Labor, the total number of jobless in France now stands at 3,065,600, or 12.5 percent of the working age population of the country.
19_2	0.089387349	Le Monde said in a report for its Thursday edition that the rise of unemployment in June was partly attributed to the season, when a large number of youths graduating from school in summer entered the job market.
19_3	0.093950988	Another reason is that the economic climate in France remains bad, with a near-zero growth or even below-zero growth in the April-May-June period of 1996, said the local daily.
19_4	0.091407023	Agence France Presse said that the rise of unemployment in June has given ground for speculation of an even darker employment situation, with "rigidity in budget policy and decline in social plans risking to push down a revival".
19_5	0.06262352	"For the year, the forecasts of specialists are not in the least encouraging.
19_6	0.10325599	The National Institution of Statistics and Economics Study expects a 12.3-12.5 percent unemployment rate, while the French Observatory of Economic Circumstances expects an unemployed population of 140,000 by the end of the year and 120,000 in the following year," said AFP.
19_7	0.10318134	Meanwhile, Minister of Labor, Employment and Social Affairs Jacques Barrot said today that the government will subsidize 15-20 billion francs (3-4 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997 to finance employment programs.

19_9	0.095049036	"Far from taking the seriousness of the employment situation into its conscience, the government is taking measures which will accentuate the tendency towards the rising of unemployment," said Socialist Party spokesman Francois Hollande.

20_0	0.098772057	BONN, June 18 (Xinhua) --German Finance Minister Theo Waigel admitted today that Germany may slightly overshoot the debt requirement for joining the planned single European currency -- the Euro, but stressed that other criteria would be strictly adhered to.
20_1	0.087396475	Back from a two-day European Union summit in Amsterdam, Waigel told reporters in Munich that due to the massive debt burden left over from the former East Germany, Bonn could run up a national debt slightly above the Euro benckmark of 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
20_2	0.093210851	As for another key Euro criterion which requires member states to bring their budget deficits to less than three percent of GDP, Waigel reiterated that three was three, and it should not be softened.
20_3	0.093779435	Waigel also warned against any delay in the planned 1999 launching of the Euro, saying that a delay would encourage EU countries to ease up on budgetary restraint and would almost certainly lead to a surge in the German mark's value that would threaten Germany's economic recovery, and its chances of reducing unemployment.
20_4	0.10368216	The Euro is due to be introduced from January 1, 1999.
20_5	0.094248854	Countries will be selected to take part in early 1998 based on full economic data of 1997.
20_6	0.099248093	But there remains widespread doubts about the future of the Euro because both Germany and France, the two country at the heart of the project, are struggling to meet the qualification criteria, mainly due to their sluggish economic growth and the cost for financing benefits for record high unemployment.
20_7	0.10730378	France has openly asked for a softening in the interpretation of the qualification terms of the Euro but Germany has so far insisted on strict adherence.
21_0	0.14629162	PARIS, January 3 (Xinhua) --The French government Saturday announced several emergency measures to support the jobless people, including sending an additional 500 million franc (84 million U.S. dollars) unemployment aid package.

22_1	0.096997047	The protest took place when leaders of the group of seven (G-7) industrialized nations gathered in this southeastern French city for a three-day summit meeting.
22_2	0.084393962	The peaceful demonstration, organized by a group of 53 non-governmental organizations, consisted of a series of speeches at Lyon's city labor exchange.
22_3	0.086585303	"The G-7 presents itself as the pilot of the general ship of world affairs, thus it places itself in a situation of power and responsibility," said Nigerian Nobel Literature Prize laureate Wole Soyinka, who chaired the event.

22_5	0.090100249	This, he added, is "leading to mass unemployment, a widening gap between the North and the South and even more profoundly between the affluent and the poor in every society".
22_6	0.092489421	"We appeal to the members of the G-7 to take stock of their power and its failures, to be aware of the consequences of the policies that they set in motion," he said.

23_0	0.11346817	PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua) --The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) today called on France to adopt more flexible socio-economic policies in its on-going structural reforms.
23_1	0.10099524	In its 1997 Economic Survey report on France published today, the OECD, which groups 29 industrialized nations, gave credit to the French government over economic growth and cutting public deficits.
23_2	0.115739	It said that France's economic growth rate could attain 2.5 percent in 1997, and 2.6 percent in 1998, while its public deficit could drop to 3.2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of 1997.
23_3	0.09921818	This means that the aim by the French government to attain the Maastricht deficit limit for joining the European single currency, the euro, is within reach, said the report.
23_4	0.075061284	The OECD said that the real problem France is faced with is not only "cyclical" but also "structural".
23_5	0.10413144	France is greatly lagging behind other OECD countries in flexibility and de-regulation, especially in budgetary policy and the role played by the state in the country's economy, said the report.
23_6	0.10531812	It said that as France's public spending is one of the highest among OECD countries in terms of its GDP, it is inevitable for the country to vigorously continue the process of the reform of public spendings.
23_7	0.096736676	The OECD called on France to pay attention to the reform of its public sector management, pointing out that many other OECD countries have more flexible public sector management.
23_8	0.080296196	It also called on France to pursue the reform of public spending "beyond Maastricht".
23_9	0.092759151	"In view of demographic changes, which would suggest that spending pressures are likely to build up after the year 2000, further public spending cuts will probably prove necessary," said the report.
23_10	0.15909919	The OECD said that the high unemployment rate of France, which stands around 12.5 percent, reflects the "substantial structural impediments in the functioning of labor markets" of the country.
23_11	0.098903572	But it predicted that France's unemployment should fall over the medium term due to reduction in cyclical unemployment, while the measures taken in recent years, in particular the reduction of the cost of unskilled labor, should reduce structural unemployment.
24_0	0.27767324	PARIS, December 30 (Xinhua) --The unemployment rate in France dropped by 0.3 percent to stand at 12.4 percent in November, said the Ministry of Employment Tuesday.
24_1	0.11555735	This means that France had 3,114,600 jobless people in November, 9,000 fewer than in October, according to the official way of accounting unemployment.
24_2	0.17782892	This is also the first time for the unemployment rate in France to be below 12.5 percent since September 1996.
24_3	0.15084306	The unemployment rate dropped by 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent in Septebmer and October.
24_4	0.13106926	The drop of unemployment rates among young men and young women below 25 had contributed to the overall improvement of job situation in the country, said the ministry.
24_5	0.10801936	The jobless rate among young men dropped by 2.2 percent, that that of young women by 1.7 percent in November.
24_6	0.14628371	But people who remained jobless for more than one year increased by 1.2 percent in November, taking up 36.8 percent of the overall number of the unemployed in France.
