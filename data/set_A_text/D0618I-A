12_10	0.0	Why so many cases, and why should anyone die of a disease that doctors have long known how to cure?
12_11	0.0	Because many people outside the endemic areas do not take malaria seriously and ignore the measures recommended to prevent it or are careless about them.
12_12	0.0	When the flu-like symptoms of malaria develop, they are often not acted on soon enough.
12_13	0.058823529411764705	In addition, outside of endemic areas, doctors often fail to recognize the symptoms of malaria and thus do not make the correct diagnosis or treat the disease properly or quickly enough to cure it.
12_14	0.6363636363636364	Complicating matters, preventive measures have gotten trickier and much more costly in recent years, ever since the malaria parasite in most areas developed resistance to chloroquine, the inexpensive and well-tolerated medication that had long been used to prevent and treat malaria.

12_30	0.07407407407407407	Norton, 1991), a malaria infection in humans begins when an infected female Anopheles mosquito, seeking a blood meal to foster the development of her eggs, injects into the human bloodstream threadlike malaria parasites called sporozoites that have been stored in her salivary glands.
12_31	0.08333333333333333	Thousands of sporozoites are usually injected into the blood with one mosquito bite, and they quickly invade the cells in the liver where they multiply.
12_32	0.0	In this period, the infected person experiences no symptoms.
12_33	0.0	The first symptoms appear about 10 to 35 days later when the liver cells burst and the spores enter the blood stream, causing intense chills and sweating with high fever.
12_34	0.0	Then the symptoms come and go _ usually in 24- to 72-hour cycles _ as the tiny parasites feed on the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin of the infected person's red blood cells.
12_35	0.0	Each cycle can render the victim more anemic with less and less oxygen reaching the brain and other vital tissues.
12_36	0.0	Ruebush said that two of the nondeadly species could remain alive in a person's liver for up to a couple of years, periodically causing relapses of malarial symptoms.
12_37	0.0	The other nonfatal form can hide in the body outside the liver for up to 30-40 years, waiting for some unknown signal to trigger its emergence and cause a recurrence of symptoms.
12_38	0.0	The deadly species, P.
12_39	0.0	falciparum, causes the most severe symptoms, but if the victim does not get treated and does not die, the infection burns itself out within a year or two.
12_40	1.0434782608695652	PREVENTION AND TREATMENT Since there is no vaccine against malaria, prevention depends on two important measures: taking a drug that combats the parasite prophylactically _ that is, in advance of any known infection _ and avoiding bites by the Anopheles mosquito.
12_41	0.058823529411764705	In the few areas where there is still little or no chloroquine resistance, this drug is taken weekly starting one week prior to departure for the endemic area, weekly while there and for four weeks after returning home.
12_42	0.13333333333333333	For most endemic areas where chloroquine-resistant parasites flourish, the Centers for Disease Control now recommends mefloquine, sold under the trade name of Lariam.
12_43	0.1	This drug is taken one time a week before departure, each week while in the malaria area and for four weeks after returning.
12_44	0.2	It is extremely effective but expensive _ about $7 a tablet _ so for a two-week trip the cost is about $50.
12_45	0.07142857142857142	Lariam can sometimes cause anxiety, depression, hallucinations and insomnia, and in one in 10,000 or 15,000 cases, these side effects are incapacitating.
12_46	0.0	A trip-mate of mine to Panama developed sky-high blood pressure, fever, shaking chills, severe anxiety, hallucinations and was unable to walk on her own, all attributed to Lariam.
12_47	0.0	It took her months to recover.
12_48	0.08333333333333333	An equally effective alternative to Lariam is doxycycline, which is recommended for northern Thailand, where mefloquine resistance has been detected.
12_49	0.0	Doxycycline has to be taken daily, starting one to two days before departure and continued for four weeks after returning.
12_50	0.0	Anyone who chooses doxycycline must be very conscientious about taking it every day; if you miss a couple of days, you are unprotected.
12_51	0.058823529411764705	Among the possible side effects are upset stomach, yeast infection in women and increased sensitivity to the sun _ which means you must remain covered to avoid a severe sunburn.
12_52	0.2222222222222222	A standby treatment is the drug Fansidar, which can cause rather severe skin rashes.
12_53	0.2	It is used only as an emergency treatment, should symptoms suspicious of malaria develop when the person is far from medical care.
12_54	0.0	But even if one takes Fansidar, it is vital to get to a doctor for thorough treatment as soon as possible.
12_55	0.0	Ruebush emphasized that preventive medication is only one measure.
12_56	0.05555555555555555	Travelers should be aware of the habits of the Anopheles mosquito, which typically reigns in rural areas and bites between dusk and dawn (although in heavily shaded jungle areas it may bite in daylight).

21_1	0.041666666666666664	The study, by the Harvard Center for International Development and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, will be presented in Nigeria at the first conference at which African heads of state will meet to discuss malaria, which kills more than 1 million people a year, most of them children.
21_2	0.05555555555555555	Analyzing the effects of malaria on 27 African economies between 1965 and 1990, the study concluded that the disease cut one percentage point a year from the annual growth rates of those economies.
21_3	0.0	If malaria had been eliminated in 1965, the annual gross domestic product of Africa would now be $400 billion rather than $300 billion, the study estimated.
21_4	0.0	The study's economic models, according to Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard center, took into account more than the costs of treatment and losses associated with death.
21_5	0.0	They also estimated the losses from tourists and foreign investors who avoid malaria-prone countries, the damage done by large numbers of sick children missing school and the increase in population and impoverishment when parents have extra children because they know some will die.
21_6	0.14285714285714285	In most affected countries, the disease crosses class lines.
21_7	0.0	``It doesn't matter if you are rich or poor _ your chances of catching it are high,'' said Nils Delaire, president of the Global Health Council, a participant in the conference.
21_8	0.2903225806451613	The conference this week in Abuja, Nigeria, is sponsored by the World Health Organization and will draw together U.N. agencies, the World Bank, Western donors and the heads of 20 African countries in a Roll Back Malaria campaign that hopes to halve deaths from malaria, a mosquito-borne disease, within 10 years.
21_9	0.1	The chief weapon the sponsors endorse is a simple one: bed nets treated with insecticide.
21_10	0.21052631578947367	After that, they favor more spraying to kill mosquito larvae, education of rural people in the use of simple blood tests and cheap drugs to keep patients alive until they can reach doctors.
21_11	0.0	(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) Nets alone could cut the disease by half, but only 2 percent of all African children sleep under them.
21_12	0.0	Each $8 spent on prevention adds about a year of healthy life to an African, according to Ann Mills, one of the London School analysts who worked on the study.
21_13	0.1	``World spending on malaria control and research for Africa is maybe 10 cents per case per year,'' said Sachs.

21_17	0.0	Meanwhile, he said, many malaria-prone countries have per capita incomes of less than $300 and health budgets too small for ``these very reasonable interventions''.
21_18	0.0	(END OPTIONAL TRIM) Sachs suggested that Western nations could significantly cut the disease by spending $1 billion a year on malaria.
21_19	0.0	The U.S. share of that, he said, would be 75 cents per American.
21_20	0.0	``In a world where we're enjoying riches beyond what was imagined 20 years ago, we can afford to do more than we do,'' Sachs said.
21_21	0.0	He might even, he said, dare to also suggest $1 billion for AIDS and $1 billion for tuberculosis, for a total of $2.25 per American.
21_22	0.0	``I think Americans would readily come up with $10 per person if they believed it was cost-effective,'' he said.

22_0	0.0	ADDIS ABABA, October 25 (Xinhua) --Medicine spraying activities are being undertaken in Rift Valley of the central Ethiopia to halt the malaria epidemic in the area, a report from the Ethiopian News Agency said today.
22_1	0.0	The report quoted local official Kemal Morke as saying that medicines have so far been sprayed at over 24,000 residential houses in Rift Valley and over 83,000 residents in the area have been protected from being infected by malaria.
22_2	0.5	Kemal said that the malaria prevention activities are being undertaken in a series of campaigns because of the occurence of the epidemic in the area in a larger scale than that of last year.
22_3	0.0	Meanwhile, blood test services have been given to 24,500 persons and those who are found infected are being treated, Kemal added.

23_0	0.19047619047619047	DAR ES SALAAM, October 11 (Xinhua) --Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye Monday called on people to use insecticide treated nets to prevent mosquito from spreading malaria.
23_1	0.2857142857142857	Sumaye made the appeal while opening the Second International Conference on Insecticide Treated Nets in Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam.
23_2	0.0	He said in Tanzania, malaria is the leading cause of outpatient services and the number one cause of child mortality.
23_3	0.0	Statistics indicated that 25- 42 percent of outpatient visits and 25 percent of deaths reported in Tanzanian health facilities are due to the disease.
23_4	0.0	Malaria is also a major impediment to social and economic development throughout Africa, he said, adding that it is estimated that by the year 2000 the annual direct economic cost of malaria across Africa will exceed 3.

23_6	0.18181818181818182	He said many governments in Sub-Saharan Africa overstretched their resources to provide prevention and treatment services on malaria related illness.
23_7	0.23076923076923078	For example, outpatient treatment of malaria accounts for up to 40 percent of Africa's public health expenditure.
23_8	0.19230769230769232	The recent emergence and spread of malaria resistant to chloroquine, a drug that has saved millions of lives for over five decades, further highlights the need to promote new strategies to protect vulnerable populations from infection and put our emphasis on preventative measures, he noted.
23_9	0.5	The use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) is one of the key components of prevention, he said.
23_10	0.0	He said based on field trials in Tanzania, Kenya and Ghana, it has been established that when properly used ITNs could reduce mortality by more than 30 percent, and hospitalization by more than 40 percent.
23_11	0.46153846153846156	"We learnt also that malaria could be prevented, and more than 500,000 lives could be saved each year (C if ITNs were widely available to many households in Africa," he said.
23_12	0.6363636363636364	Meanwhile, the Tanzanian Prime Minister said that the fight against malaria by destroying habitat of mosquitoes has to continue, adding that people need to clean their surroundings by cutting grass and shrubs around houses and destroying stationary water ponds.
23_13	0.0	The conference, sponsored by the London-based Malaria Consortium, has attracted more than 230 delegates from some 40 countries across the world.

24_0	0.2857142857142857	WASHINGTON (AP) --A team of researchers has discovered a possible new way to vaccinate against malaria, one of the world's biggest killers.
24_1	0.375	Malaria kills up to 3 million people a year and sickens another 300 million.
24_2	0.3333333333333333	Creating a vaccine is crucial because the parasite has begun developing resistance to drugs used to treat malaria, and even mosquitos that spread the disease are withstanding pesticides.
24_3	0.058823529411764705	But finding a malaria vaccine has proved exceptionally difficult, and testing in 1997 concluded the candidate long thought the best hope was actually worthless.
24_4	0.23076923076923078	The reason most vaccine attempts have failed is that they focused on just one part of the malaria parasite's complex life cycle.

24_6	0.08333333333333333	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from India have created a multipronged vaccine designed to make the immune system fight the parasite at many stages: When the mosquito bite sends it into the body, when it invades the liver and when infection moves into the bloodstream.
24_7	0.0	The scientists immunized rabbits.
24_8	0.18181818181818182	The animals' immune system produced antibodies that prevented malaria parasites from invading liver cells and from replicating in the blood, the scientists reported Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
24_9	0.047619047619047616	Just because the vaccine stimulates a rabbit's immune system doesn't mean it would work in people, cautioned parasitologist Anthony Holder of London's National Institute for Medical Research.
24_10	0.0	The CDC hopes further testing in primates will prove promising enough to try the vaccine in people.
