1_22	0.088431294	``It's not necessary to have a thorough interview'' with the patient if she wants to tone up her face, Mitchell said.
1_23	0.090699454	For him as for other colleagues, using acupuncture as a tool for healing is a more challenging job than making people feel good by ``pumping up'' their faces, said acupuncturist Cameron Bishop of Western Communities Family Practice Association in Florida.

2_1	0.29691773	A new study by Yale University researchers says acupuncture is an effective treatment for cocaine abuse.
2_2	0.17296899	The finding gives the ancient Chinese remedy a much-needed foothold in Western medicine, experts say, because it's based on a well-controlled clinical study from a major American medical school.
2_3	0.23315609	A report on the finding appears in the latest issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine.
2_4	0.135016	Although the work might be the first large, controlled trial of acupuncture for cocaine addiction, it's not the first time anyone has used the treatment for substance abuse.
2_5	0.12090609	Indeed, some 1,000 clinics worldwide offer the needle therapy for the symptoms of cocaine withdrawal, including nearly 175 in New York state alone, says Dr.
2_6	0.073692269	Michael Smith, a pioneer in the field.
2_7	0.098204325	Smith, a Cornell University psychiatrist who has been practicing acupuncture at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx for nearly two decades, calls the Yale research ``a very well-documented report with high standards that shows that acupuncture helps reduce the craving for cocaine''.
2_8	0.10505149	The study, led by Yale psychologist Arthur Margolin, looked at the effectiveness of acupuncture in 82 heroin and cocaine addicts who were getting methadone for the first habit but nothing for the second.
2_9	0.07593314	Margolin and his colleagues split the subjects into three groups.
2_10	0.10303414	The first received eight weeks of standard addiction acupuncture therapy, based on guidelines from the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association, which calls for three to five needles placed at specific points in the outer ear.
2_11	0.084818479	The second group had sham needles placed in non-therapeutic sites on the ear.
2_12	0.072868518	The third group watched relaxing videos.
2_13	0.081567062	Urine tests for cocaine were taken three times a week over the trial's two-month period, during which all patients received counseling and group therapy.
2_14	0.13986045	By the last week of the trial, nearly 54 percent of the patients in the acupuncture group had cocaine-free urine, compared with 23 percent of those in the sham needle group and only 9 percent of those who watched videos.
2_15	0.097355505	``This was a highly active placebo arm and we still found an effect over and above that,'' says Margolin, who notes that the effect of acupuncture was as good as that from drug treatment for cocaine addiction.
2_16	0.087145336	HOW IT WORKS STILL A MYSTERY While the latest work suggests that acupuncture helps control cravings for cocaine, it doesn't say anything about why it succeeds.
2_17	0.084909449	``Quite honestly, we don't know why it works,'' Margolin says.
2_18	0.095749658	``We're just beginning to look in Western terms'' at the biological mechanism behind acupuncture's effect.
2_19	0.096957751	Smith, however, says tests show that the needles, if properly placed, restore balance to the body's electrical currents.
2_20	0.089134476	``Acupuncture helps the body help itself''.
2_21	0.089253518	Still, he admits, no one really understands the full mechanics of this assistance.
2_22	0.093044759	Whatever the reason, Margolin and Smith agree that acupuncture alone isn't a sufficient treatment for addiction, be it to cocaine, alcohol, tobacco or other substances.
2_23	0.11041963	``This is a treatment that helps a person participate in all the other treatments we have,'' such as counseling and group therapy, Smith says.
2_24	0.095333352	In fact, by law, ear acupuncture for addicts can only be performed in the context of a licensed drug-treatment program that includes these other methods, he says.
2_25	0.095240706	However, acupuncture does have a key advantage over counseling, Smith says.
2_26	0.090513698	If addicts refuse to acknowledge their drug cravings, therapists have little recourse to treat them.
2_27	0.097256276	But with acupuncture, he says, addicts can get treated without losing face.
2_28	0.08799304	``You can treat a problem that the patient doesn't admit to''.
2_29	0.120868	Barbara Mitchell, a licensed acupuncturist and executive director of the Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Alliance in Olalla, Wash.
2_30	0.08479722	, says the Yale research lends an extra measure of credibility to the practice.
2_31	0.091827938	On the other hand, Mitchell says, with an estimated 15,000 licensed acupuncturists in the United States already, the field is well on its way to becoming mainstream.
2_32	0.10250524	Many insurance companies now reimburse for the treatment, which got a major shot in the arm in 1997 when the National Institutes of Health held a consensus conference to discuss the scientific validity of needle therapy.
2_33	0.091439715	That report found that acupuncture helped control pain from dental procedures, menstruation and other conditions, with fewer side effects than conventional remedies, Mitchell says.

4_4	0.075226168	In common is that they all fall outside the list of "standard" therapies approved by U.S. government agencies and medical authorities.
4_5	0.14613538	While the Stanford survey reflected the growing acceptance of alternative medicine in the United States, half the people who seek out alternative practitioners still rely on Western medicine for basic health care.

5_1	0.14200841	Experts on drug abuse say cocaine addiction is one of the most difficult forms of drug dependency to treat.
5_2	0.14182741	And while many treatment centers have been using acupuncture for some time, usually in combination with other therapies, scientific studies of its effectiveness in treating cocaine addiction have been inconclusive.
5_3	0.16817913	In the Yale study, 53.8 percent of the subjects who had needles inserted in four acupuncture ``zones'' in the ear five times a week tested free of cocaine at the end of the eight-week study period.

5_5	0.16482046	The report appears in the August issue of the journal Archives of Internal Medicine.
5_6	0.092766232	The study involved 82 men and women in the New Haven area who were addicted to both heroin and cocaine.

5_14	0.10555764	Dr. Arthur Margolin, a research scientist in the department of psychiatry at Yale's medical school and lead author of the report, said that among the benefits of acupuncture were its low cost and lack of side effects.

5_16	0.095983716	The study's findings are also encouraging, he added, because ``they suggest that with the proper groundwork we can conduct rigorous trials of complementary or alternative therapies''.
5_17	0.096573617	One obstacle that has confronted researchers trying to determine whether acupuncture works has been the difficulty of finding convincing ``placebo'' treatments to act as scientific controls.
5_18	0.11461373	For the sham needle treatment, the Yale researchers inserted four needles along the rim of the ear, in spots that are not commonly used in acupuncture treatment and had little effect when stimulated in preliminary tests.

5_20	0.14043252	In the acupuncture treatment, the needles were inserted five times a week for about 45 minutes per session, according to guidelines developed at Lincoln Hospital in New York, and adopted by the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association.

5_22	0.14433371	All the subjects in the study, which was financed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, also received psychotherapy as part of the treatment program.
5_23	0.089866756	Margolin said that scientists did not yet understand how acupuncture might work to curb addiction but that there were a variety of theories.
5_24	0.096502456	For example, acupuncture has been linked to the release of opioids, the body's natural painkillers, which might help reduce the craving for cocaine.
5_25	0.087503703	Or the procedure might stimulate the vagus nerve that runs through the center of the ear, producing a relaxing effect.
5_26	0.10359173	In Chinese medicine, Margolin added, the stimulation points used in the study are associated with a diagnosis called ``empty fire''.

13_3	0.11385955	Arnold Relman, opposing the mainstreaming of these ancient medical treatments into modern medicine, duked it out in a landmark debate Friday night at the University of Arizona College of Medicine.
13_4	0.11324607	Weil, who is on the cutting edge of what is new in alternative medicine, sparred on most points with Relman, editor and chief emeritus at the New England School of Medicine, who is squarely from the mainstream medical community.
13_5	0.086990889	The debate came on the wings of a scathing article Relman wrote in the ``New'' ``Republic,'' in which he referred to Weil's methods as preposterous.
13_6	0.10441432	At the debate, he said Weil's therapies are ``based on wildly implausible theories''.
13_7	0.094805702	The fact that the debate took place at all is an acknowledgment that the mainstream medical community is no longer ignoring alternative medicine.
13_8	0.11666495	With 42 percent of the public now using some sort of alternative medical therapies, Weil and others have been pushing the nation's medical schools to start requiring more medical students to learn more about such things as acupuncture, herbal therapies and hundreds of other therapies.
13_9	0.088698838	Relman was appalled by that idea that medical students should be taught alternative therapies.
13_10	0.10453053	Teaching medical students how to do alternative therapies would overthrow what medical schools teach, Relman said.

13_21	0.091781737	This is the future not only because patients want it, but practitioners do, too, he added.
13_22	0.088940481	``Medical students want to know why they aren't learning about herbal therapies,'' Weil said.
13_23	0.094558672	Relman replied that the reason more doctors and medical students are interested in it is that medical care is being delivered like a business.

13_25	0.090330675	It was the first of what may be many discussions in the future that could affect every person's health, and the two participants hope to take the debate to other college campuses.

18_2	0.077789387	The aim is to develop them within the next five years to meet world criteria.
18_3	0.086830798	He said that the bureau will conduct a quality standard study of 80 kinds of commonly-used TCM in a bid to build up a world-recognized standards system for traditional Chinese medicine.
18_4	0.090576277	Chinese traditional medicine has become more popular in world markets in recent years due to few side-effects.
18_5	0.08822994	But China's export volume of TCM is only about 500 million US dollars a year, a very small share in the world market.
18_6	0.099255869	However, Chinese acupuncture and moxibustion enjoy a legal status in medical treatment in many developed countries due to efforts by Chinese scientist.

19_0	0.12917631	The random telephone survey of 1,000 people also showed that 56 percent of those interviewed believe their health plans should cover alternative care.
19_1	0.15998061	They are also willing to pay for it in their medical insurance premiums.
19_2	0.088808056	``What we see from this survey and many other indicators is that people generally want to take control of their own health, using those services they find most effective,'' said William Haskell, a Stanford professor of medicine.

19_4	0.14000426	While the survey reflected the growing acceptance of alternative medicine in the United States, it said roughly half the people who seek out alternative practitioners still rely on Western medicine for basic health care.
19_5	0.11054169	On average, participants in the study made four visits annually to a conventional doctor.
19_6	0.089062689	Significantly, those surveyed said that their decision whether to consult a conventional physician or a practitioner of alternative medicine, was guided principally by the practitioner's ``technical skills at diagnosis and treatment''.

19_11	0.1174176	The Stanford findings did not include patient expenditures for alternative medicine.
19_12	0.096143187	But, on average, survey respondents said they would be willing to spend an additional $15.41 a month in health insurance for complementary services such as chiropractic, massage or acupuncture.
19_13	0.14786246	While many physicians are still skeptical of alternative medicine, a growing number of patient care organizations offer complementary services in clinics alongside traditional medicine or reimburse patients for alternative treatments.
19_14	0.097680649	Public interest in alternative medicine presents some challenges and obligations for traditional physicians, said Wes Alles of the Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention.

24_13	0.085135485	Across the country, an ever-increasing number of conventional hospitals and health-care organizations are setting up complementary-care centers.
24_14	0.08176201	As yet, no one is tracking these centers as a group, but last year, the American Hospital Association found that roughly 9 percent of U.S. hospitals offer complementary services; some estimates say that between 25 and 50 complementary centers affiliated with hospitals are presently open or will be opening in the near future.
24_15	0.12112697	Many of these facilities are fully staffed with medical doctors and alternative practitioners who work together to determine each patient's course of treatment.
24_16	0.087408964	Others offer individual therapies such as therapeutic touch or guided imagery to patients who ask for it.
24_17	0.083414064	``If you look at what was happening even a few years ago, the extent to which complementary services have become part of the health-care system is astonishing,'' said John Weeks, editor and publisher of The Integrator, a newsletter covering the business of alternative medicine.
24_18	0.074977885	``We're really in the first phase of a process that will evolve over the next 10 or 20 years''.
24_19	0.074779526	``As we see more and more consumers making health-care decisions for themselves, this trend is really going to take off,'' said Dr.

24_21	0.096796362	``There will be only one medicine in the future, and it will include all of the things that we once thought of as either alternative or conventional''.
24_22	0.077130656	What's more, demographics support the notion that these centers are here to stay.
24_23	0.076287711	``Baby boomers are hearing that they could live to 80 or 90 or 100, and they want to be healthy doing it,'' Weeks said.
24_24	0.076788995	An expected squeeze in the labor market in the next several years should prompt companies to seek more and better services with which to attract and retain employees.
24_25	0.088347764	At the top of any worker's list: better health care.
24_26	0.095168115	``Patients are going to demand more complementary medicine, and they're going to demand it right in the hospital they're using,'' said Dr.

24_29	0.090899136	Many complementary-care clinics are also moving beyond patient care to address one of the biggest concerns in integrative medicine: the information shortfall.
24_30	0.098205919	Patients often use alternative therapies in a smorgasbord-like way, without a complete understanding of the advantages or risks involved.
24_31	0.088139088	``Part of what got me into the development of our center is that I knew my patients were already using alternative therapies,'' said Dr.
24_32	0.13208782	Mimi Guarneri, an interventional cardiologist and the medical director of the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine in La Jolla, Calif.
24_33	0.08297151	``They were out there buying every vitamin and herb they could find, and I was concerned that they might not know enough about what they were taking''.
24_34	0.091482654	With this in mind, hospitals like Scripps have set up classes to inform patients about various alternative therapies.
24_35	0.086445943	Since traditionally schooled physicians are often unduly skeptical about complementary approaches, many clinics have also made research and analysis part of their standard operations.
24_36	0.086091451	``If we don't evaluate the evidence with an objective eye, there's no way that complementary therapies can ever be brought into the medical mainstream in a way that makes sense,'' said Guarneri.
24_37	0.085650942	``As a physician, you can't stand up and present anecdotes without being thrown out of the room''.
24_38	0.091628917	Virtually all of the centers track patient outcomes and share that information with other hospitals nationwide.
24_39	0.14467933	Many centers are conducting comprehensive studies on the effects of individual therapies _ the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, for one, is researching complementary treatments for asthma, while George Washington University's Center for Integrative Medicine in Washington, D.C., is looking at the use of acupuncture in treating carpal tunnel syndrome.
24_40	0.093342011	Of course, what matters to patients isn't hard-core data but real-life outcomes.
24_41	0.080580038	And in that respect, the news is positive.
24_42	0.090442794	``Many complementary therapies can help people face an illness more calmly, use less pain medication and recover more quickly,'' said Dr.
24_43	0.1320946	Lewis Mehl-Medrona, program director for the Pittsburgh medical center and the author of ``Coyote Medicine''.
24_44	0.097898467	Tracy Cunning definitely agreed.

24_48	0.089611405	Just one day after her surgery, she put away the crutches she'd been given; by the third day, she'd tossed her pain pills, having taken only six of the 30 that had been prescribed.
24_49	0.077921616	``Everyone was very supportive,'' she recalled.
24_50	0.099526484	``I sailed through surgery and was up and moving around much more quickly than I'd expected.
24_51	0.091367915	I think the care I was given made a big difference''.
24_52	0.091245471	OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS THE INSURANCE QUESTION Will the fact that so many hospitals are bringing complementary therapies under one roof mean less out-of-pocket costs for consumers?
24_53	0.087352886	Probably not _ at least, not right away, said Dr.
24_54	0.098916853	James N.
24_55	0.16711958	Dillard, medical director for alternative medicine at Oxford Health Plans in New York City.
24_56	0.089647225	``The fact that these centers are opening will put pressure on insurers to pay for more things,'' he said.
24_57	0.080774673	``But that will take time.
24_58	0.09202585	Right now, we're seeing very few insurers paying for any alternative medical treatment beyond chiropractic, which is licensed in all 50 states''.
24_59	0.095651797	But chiropractic is the one treatment that most of these centers have the hardest time offering, he said.
24_60	0.11279351	``Most academic medical centers freak out at the mere mention of the word''.
24_61	0.092842525	So where does that leave consumers?
24_62	0.090118476	``You'll see massage offered at most of the centers, but most insurers won't pay for it,'' Dillard said.
24_63	0.093195624	At best, you'll get a discounted rate.
24_64	0.083770902	How about acupuncture, therapeutic touch or nutritional counseling?
24_65	0.072624301	``Maybe,'' he said.
24_66	0.096776936	``But it's still not too common, no matter where it's provided''.
24_67	0.097889089	Insurance companies are motivated by numbers, he explained, meaning they will pay for treatments that are cost-effective.
24_68	0.086193998	So the pressure is on the complementary-care centers to track patient outcomes and prove to insurers that alternative treatments work as well as _ or better than _ conventional treatments in managing disease and keeping costs down.
