0_16	0.0818619	Her fiercest critics have been civil libertarians, who have decried her efforts to restrict information on the Internet (ranging from the dissemination of personal data to instructions on how to build bombs) and gun advocates, who oppose her ban on assault weapons, which was passed in 1994.

3_0	0.4533611	WASHINGTON _ Dianne Feinstein's easy ride to re-election is over.
3_1	0.077721755	Though Feinstein remains the favorite, Rep.
3_2	0.094610172	Tom Campbell's entry Tuesday into California's 2000 Senate race immediately transformed the sleepy contest into a spirited showdown of national significance.
3_3	0.083016755	Campbell's experience, fund-raising ability and moderate positions instantly make him the front-runner in a crowded field of largely unknown GOP candidates.
3_4	0.13586465	Feinstein must now engage in a far more aggressive campaign, while Democratic Party leaders no longer will be able to ignore the California contest in favor of headline grabbers such as Hillary Rodham Clinton's quest for a New York Senate seat.
3_5	0.17202299	And the sudden intensity diminishes the likelihood that Feinstein will be named to the Democratic ticket as either Al Gore or Bill Bradley's running mate.
3_6	0.31668716	``Tom Campbell has won elections,'' said Jim Jordan, political director for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee.
3_7	0.050421645	``He's a serious person and not a joke''.
3_8	0.088905767	Feinstein, who abhors campaigning perhaps more than any other politician at her level, must now gird for another tough contest, her fourth statewide battle of the decade.
3_9	0.085149175	``Campbell is a much smarter, more experienced and much more adroit candidate'' than Feinstein's previous Senate opponents, said Dan Schnur, a GOP strategist who served as former Gov.
3_10	0.04321837	Pete Wilson's communications director.
3_11	0.064579317	``This will be her toughest race since she lost to Pete Wilson (in 1990)''.
3_12	0.075363533	Even before Campbell entered the race, Feinstein's camp maintained that they took nothing for granted.
3_13	0.088888075	However, none of the other candidates _ Ron Unz, Ray Haynes, Bill Horn or J.P.
3_14	0.092123084	Gough _ has Campbell's electoral advantages.
3_15	0.086133868	``He's the best candidate that Republicans have in the field,'' said Jennifer Duffy, an editor for the Cook Report, a nonpartisan political newsletter that handicaps congressional races.
3_16	0.094382344	``She may not have to run a marathon,'' Duffy said of Feinstein's race for re-election, ``but she's going to break a sweat''.
3_17	0.087997983	Campbell, a Stanford Law professor who is regarded by colleagues as perhaps the most cerebral member of Congress, said he will base his Senate run on the intellectual notion of individual liberty.
3_18	0.079151341	``I believe a person should have a personal life as free from government intrusion as possible,'' Campbell said.
3_19	0.088134757	It is from that belief that Campbell says he draws his support for legal abortions, as well as his opposition to a personal income tax (which he says should be replaced by a national sales tax).
3_20	0.079695601	It will be a tough sell in a contest against a woman whom &LR; Campbell has so far refused to criticize.
3_21	0.44071414	``Senator Feinstein has been a good senator,'' Campbell said Tuesday.
3_22	0.10990744	``I believe I could be a better senator''.
3_23	0.094028824	Though his moderation will be an asset in the contest with Feinstein, he must first convince conservative Republican primary voters that he is their best choice.
3_24	0.10371349	At a news conference last night in Washington, Campbell said no less than five times that he was a ``fiscal conservative,'' touting his support of small government and less taxes.
3_25	0.088904144	``I'm as fiscally conservative as anyone in the field,'' Campbell said, ``and I'm someone who's got a chance to actually win''.
3_26	0.092219347	No matter how eloquent Campbell gets &LR; may be on the stump, the case against Feinstein will be hard to make.
3_27	0.14725678	She is a respected political moderate, as Republican Senate candidate Matt Fong _ who lost to Barbara Boxer last year _ seemed to concede when he repeatedly commended Feinstein in his stump speech, declaring that Boxer ``is no Dianne Feinstein''.
3_28	0.11852147	Now that she is their opponent, Republicans have begun to portray Feinstein as less accommodating, insisting the crowning achievements of her Senate career _ the creation of a new national park in the Mojave Desert and the enactment of a ban on assault weapons _ are not so popular in the burgeoning suburbs and inland cities far from the coast.
3_29	0.15194757	``Barbara Boxer was far left, and Dianne Feinstein is moderate left,'' said Fong, who is now a state co-chair of George W.
3_30	0.02047322	Bush's campaign.
3_31	0.12419893	Fong said Feinstein's GOP opponent in 1995, former Rep.
3_32	0.16842059	Michael Huffington, ``who was not exactly a first-tier candidate, showed that Dianne Feinstein is vulnerable''.
3_33	0.084785347	Of course, what Huffington had in ample supply was money, pumping $29 million of his own resources into the campaign.
3_34	0.097275243	Fong, who has yet to endorse a candidate in the GOP race, said the best candidate will be ``whomever can raise the most money''.
3_35	0.14313783	Republicans also are counting on the strong coattails of the GOP presidential nominee to help whomever runs against Feinstein.
3_36	0.091487366	``The political climate is going to be significantly better for Tom Campbell in 2000 than it was for Matt Fong running in 1998,'' said Steve Schmidt, who was Fong's communication director.
3_37	0.10343973	Republicans will go after Feinstein for her strong political connections to China _ she is on close terms with Chinese President Jiang Zemin _ as well as her husband's business ties to the country.
3_38	0.087054959	``At the same time that we're looking into accusations of Chinese spying, she's having dinner with Jiang Zemin,'' said Stuart DeVeaux, a spokesman for the California Republican Party.
3_39	0.080644337	For all of the potential lines of attack, Feinstein enjoys a broad base of support.
3_40	0.078045896	A Field Poll released last week showed her favorable ratings well above 50 percent.
3_41	0.13546814	``Feinstein has demonstrated she can be an independent voice for the people of California,'' said her campaign manager, Kam Kuwata, in what is likely to emerge as a campaign theme.
3_42	0.11313837	Campbell's announcement puzzled many observers _ and not only because it was made after sunset from the Republican Party headquarters on Capitol Hill.
3_43	0.088823379	Why leave a safe House seat to take on an incumbent with great poll numbers, proven fund-raising ability and a strong bipartisan reputation?
3_44	0.09196975	Those who know him say Campbell has grown increasingly frustrated in the House, where he has always been treated as an outsider.
3_45	0.095127207	Campbell has consistently voted against his GOP colleagues on matters ranging from abortion to gun control, and he was one of only seven Republicans to vote against Newt Gingrich's bid to be re-elected as speaker in January 1997.
3_46	0.089332773	That, coupled with pressure from Stanford University to choose between a career in politics or academia, pushed Campbell into making the gamble.
3_47	0.097718745	``He hates it in the House,'' said a Democratic member who asked not to be identified.
3_48	0.061237056	``I think he believes he has nothing to lose.''

4_1	0.17843904	Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill Tuesday to require buyers of handguns and certain semiautomatic weapons to get licenses.
4_2	0.099105901	``When you want to hunt, you get a hunting license; when you want to fish, you get a fishing license, but when you want a gun, no license is required,'' the California Democrat said at a news conference announcing her proposal.
4_3	0.17647388	Feinstein said the legislation is needed because each day 80 people, including 12 children, are killed by guns in the United States.
4_4	0.10048472	She said she does not expect her measure to pass this year but predicted it will be buoyed by the tens of thousands of mothers who plan to demonstrate on Mother's Day in the nation's capital and 67 other cities against gun violence.
4_5	0.074992486	Under Feinstein's proposal current owners of handguns and semiautomatic firearms that can use detachable ammunition clips would have up to 10 years to get licenses.

4_17	0.17192982	Feinstein said only one lobby can stand up to the NRA _ women.
4_18	0.087249269	She said the Million Mom March is just ``the beginning of an effort to mobilize women''.
4_19	0.10064315	The senator said that ``for years we've been hearing from gun owners who say they have rights''.

4_23	0.05864666	The organization also favors gun registration.

4_25	0.078073451	Sunday. She also predicted that tens of thousands of women, including large numbers of ``stroller-moms'' with young children, will turn out to protest in Denver, Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles.
4_26	0.11342758	She said the main objective of the march is to urge women to find out how their lawmakers are voting on gun control legislation.
4_27	0.064560395	``This is about mothers taking responsibility for themselves,'' she said.
4_28	0.092951422	The march organizers are also pushing for passage of gun control measures in the so-called juvenile justice bill, passed in different forms by both houses of Congress last year.
4_29	0.089780156	The legislation has been stalled in a conference committee for more than 10 months.
4_30	0.098126975	The most controversial part of the stalled bill is a measure that would require that private dealers at gun shows check the backgrounds of would-be firearm buyers.
4_31	0.086199741	The legislation would also require safety locks on handguns, ban the sale of assault weapons to minors and stop the import of high capacity ammunition clips.

6_3	0.12621598	``Although I deplore the circumstances that have brought us to this point, I do not believe they present a clear and present danger to the functioning of our government,'' Feinstein said during closed-door deliberations on the Senate floor Wednesday.

6_12	0.089060312	House prosecutors relied on Lewinsky's testimony to prove this charge, but Lewinsky herself said that Clinton never told her to lie and that the two of them never discussed the contents of her affidavit, Feinstein said.

6_14	0.080649244	Charges that Clinton conspired to hide gifts he gave Lewinsky and worked with confidant Vernon Jordan to find her a job also were marked by contradictory testimony and evidence bolstering a more innocent interpretation of events, Feinstein said.
