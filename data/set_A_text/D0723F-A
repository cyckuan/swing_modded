0_1	0.13101985	Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill Tuesday to require buyers of handguns and certain semiautomatic weapons to get licenses.
0_2	0.094503322	``When you want to hunt, you get a hunting license; when you want to fish, you get a fishing license, but when you want a gun, no license is required,'' the California Democrat said at a news conference announcing her proposal.
0_3	0.24589681	Feinstein said the legislation is needed because each day 80 people, including 12 children, are killed by guns in the United States.
0_4	0.13450567	She said she does not expect her measure to pass this year but predicted it will be buoyed by the tens of thousands of mothers who plan to demonstrate on Mother's Day in the nation's capital and 67 other cities against gun violence.
0_5	0.071256002	Under Feinstein's proposal current owners of handguns and semiautomatic firearms that can use detachable ammunition clips would have up to 10 years to get licenses.
0_6	0.095407793	Buyers of new guns would pay a $25 fee to a firearms dealer or a state-certified entity to get licenses.

0_25	0.079616147	Sunday. She also predicted that tens of thousands of women, including large numbers of ``stroller-moms'' with young children, will turn out to protest in Denver, Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles.
0_26	0.10190751	She said the main objective of the march is to urge women to find out how their lawmakers are voting on gun control legislation.
0_27	0.090308995	``This is about mothers taking responsibility for themselves,'' she said.
0_28	0.096116925	The march organizers are also pushing for passage of gun control measures in the so-called juvenile justice bill, passed in different forms by both houses of Congress last year.
0_29	0.096548803	The legislation has been stalled in a conference committee for more than 10 months.
0_30	0.093670784	The most controversial part of the stalled bill is a measure that would require that private dealers at gun shows check the backgrounds of would-be firearm buyers.
0_31	0.079649414	The legislation would also require safety locks on handguns, ban the sale of assault weapons to minors and stop the import of high capacity ammunition clips.

3_5	0.13694795	Her comments at a breakfast meeting with reporters came in the wake of the Senate defeat Tuesday of Democratic proposals including one by Feinstein that would have ensured that doctors, not health plans, would decide if a treatment is medically necessary.
3_6	0.12602076	Her comments were echoed by other Capitol Hill Democrats who contend they are forcing Republicans to take politically unpopular stances on the Senate floor opposing patients' rights.
3_7	0.093026428	In votes Tuesday, Senate Republicans also beat back popular Democratic amendments that would have let women in health maintenance organizations pick an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary doctor and ensure that doctors and patients have the final say on how long women can stay in the hospital after surgery for breast cancer.

11_3	0.15404011	Flanked by march organizers, Feinstein said the rally ``gives us the opportunity to bring together people around a measure that I think will be a pivotal one in the upcoming presidential campaign''.

11_15	0.15208953	Feinstein chose to introduce the measure, nearly a year in the making, in the days before the ``Million Mom March'' as a way of galvanizing support and trying to apply pressure to the pro-gun forces in Congress.
11_16	0.05892828	Although the march is being sponsored by a nonpartisan group, its leaders stood with Feinstein at Tuesday's news conference and said licensing and registration is their top priority.
11_17	0.1310902	Several far more modest gun control measures _ including legislation to require child safety locks, ban the sale of guns to minors, and extend a three-day background check to gun shows _ were passed by the Senate last year.

11_19	0.10120046	Feinstein acknowledged that her more sweeping measure has almost no chance to pass the current Congress, saying that the most powerful lobby in Washington is the gun lobby.
11_20	0.096928495	``There is only one counter-lobby that can stand up to them,'' she said, ``and this is the women in America''.
11_21	0.14683175	Feinstein said the political climate in Washington will change if Democrats prevail in November's election.
11_22	0.09047277	Organizers of the Million Mom March hope to attract at least 100,000 _ and perhaps as many as 250,000 _ supporters to the National Mall on Sunday, and tens of thousands more at spin-off rallies in 67 other cities, including Oakland (the Oakland rally begins at 1 p.m. at the Lake Merritt bandstand).
11_23	0.081209116	Adding to the confrontational atmosphere surrounding the issue, a Dallas-based group called the Second Amendment Sisters will hold a counter-march to draw attention to the lives that are saved by guns every year.

12_1	0.17600835	Dianne Feinstein said Thursday she felt ``a personal sense of betrayal'' and said she rebuffed an offer to talk to the president about it.
12_2	0.21908198	But Feinstein, D-Calif.
12_3	0.074838561	, said talk about whether Clinton should resign ``is way premature'' and said the congressional investigation into alleged impeachable offenses should be allowed to play out.
12_4	0.087900102	In a rare interview in her office, Feinstein was at times at a loss for words when trying to describe the ``sadness and disappointment'' she felt after reading the report of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, a task she said took four hours.
12_5	0.10252532	She also said revelations that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde had had an affair with a married woman in the 1960s ``is different'' from Clinton's situation and ``only increases animosity'' from Republicans.

12_14	0.13309322	``I said I didn't want to talk to the president,'' Feinstein said.
12_15	0.090673801	``I was angry''.
12_16	0.14032251	Since then, Feinstein said, she hasn't talked to the president but has consulted on other matters with members of his administration.
12_17	0.16881158	``To be candid, it's still hard to believe,'' said Feinstein, who is the senior senator from California, a state Clinton has assiduously courted throughout his presidency.
12_18	0.088920607	``This is the kind of thing that is difficult on a personal level for me''.
12_19	0.091870892	However, she added, ``I can separate my personal dismay and disappointment from what I have to do as a senator'.
12_20	0.093549395	Clinton's admission that he lied about the Lewinsky affair, and the sordid details surrounding it, have drawn a growing number of Democrats in Congress to criticize the president's conduct.
12_21	0.091333823	But most have stopped short of saying Clinton should be forced from office because of an extramarital relationship.
12_22	0.11302924	Feinstein was ambivalent about the impending release of a videotape of the president's Aug.

12_26	0.093896002	``But if it's something to inflame the situation, I don't think that's what it should be about''.
12_27	0.090228575	She also said she the House Judiciary Committee must be bipartisan as it proceeds with its own assessment of whether Clinton committed impeachable offenses.
12_28	0.089258946	The Starr report accused the president of perjury, abuse of power and obstruction of justice in trying to conceal the Lewinsky affair.

12_32	0.11698242	Feinstein said ``the body language'' and the ``directness of the statement'' convinced her he was telling the truth and she believed that for seven months.
12_33	0.089942962	``I believed it and I believed it totally,'' she said.
12_34	0.091923216	Later, when Clinton dispatched members of his Cabinet to convince others he was telling the truth, she was even more certain.
12_35	0.08578227	But then she was shattered.

12_37	0.091930454	``I feel a personal sense of betrayal.
12_38	0.095863751	I felt a gut-level deep sense of betrayal''.
12_39	0.15744122	At the time, Feinstein told reporters her faith in the president's credibility was badly ``shattered''.
12_40	0.094858389	Feinstein said her office had received about 12,000 phone calls from constituents since Friday, when the Starr report was made public, as well as 1,500 electronic mail messages.

13_1	1.5351208	Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
13_2	0.17771566	, said she will vote against both articles of impeachment because House prosecutors failed to prove ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' that President Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice in the Monica Lewinsky matter.
13_3	0.14935127	``Although I deplore the circumstances that have brought us to this point, I do not believe they present a clear and present danger to the functioning of our government,'' Feinstein said during closed-door deliberations on the Senate floor Wednesday.
13_4	0.089927884	Her office released a copy of her statement Thursday.
13_5	0.18284954	``Therefore, this president, who has been a good president for the people of the United States, should not be convicted and removed from office,'' Feinstein said.

13_9	0.10910298	Impeachment, Feinstein said, is a grave step envisioned by the Constitution's framers as a last resort when a president's actions threaten the function of government.
13_10	0.072012861	Given that high threshold, ``I do not believe the House (prosecutors) established beyond a reasonable doubt that this president is guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice''.
13_11	0.095252455	Feinstein cited the charge that Clinton encouraged Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
13_12	0.096929256	House prosecutors relied on Lewinsky's testimony to prove this charge, but Lewinsky herself said that Clinton never told her to lie and that the two of them never discussed the contents of her affidavit, Feinstein said.
13_13	0.094975492	``One may speculate that the president encouraged her to lie, but quite simply the point hasn't been proven,'' Feinstein said.
13_14	0.061353724	Charges that Clinton conspired to hide gifts he gave Lewinsky and worked with confidant Vernon Jordan to find her a job also were marked by contradictory testimony and evidence bolstering a more innocent interpretation of events, Feinstein said.
13_15	0.11999076	She took dead aim at Republican handling of the impeachment process, saying GOP House members ``prematurely released'' grand jury testimony to the public and failed to call key witnesses during impeachment hearings before the House Judiciary Committee.
13_16	0.13133381	While she was ``appalled'' by Clinton's characterization of Lewinsky as a stalker in a conversation with White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, ``the fact that this is a popular, well-respected president (who) has strong support must be considered''.
13_17	0.14300966	In the international arena, removing Clinton would be ``de-stabilizing,'' Feinstein added.
13_18	0.10774257	Feinstein devoted part of her floor speech to the push for censure.
13_19	0.19758738	``The president's behavior was immoral, deplorable and indefensible,'' Feinstein said.
13_20	0.090736549	``It sent the wrong message to the nation and our children''.
13_21	0.10461718	While it does not threaten the security and stability of the nation, Clinton's behavior does warrant ``strong condemnation and censure, and there should be a formal means for senators...
13_22	0.087751797	to express this condemnation''.
13_23	0.089857897	Censure would not be a legal judgment, but rather a ``legislative measure'' through which senators could express ``moral conclusions'' on Clinton's conduct, and thereby send a message ``to the people of our nation, especially its youth''.
13_24	0.36868639	Feinstein's California colleague, Sen.
13_25	0.39786066	Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
13_26	0.098695833	, also said Thursday that she would vote to acquit Clinton.
13_27	0.10819054	But unlike Feinstein, Boxer said she opposes censure.
13_28	0.091992036	Boxer told reporters she is concerned that a Senate debate over censure could eat into the chamber's legislative agenda.
13_29	0.11055103	``I worry about it becoming the dominant issue in the Senate,'' she said.
13_30	0.089519962	``I'm worried it could take too much time away from other work''.
13_31	0.088398806	Republican opposition to censure is growing, presenting a high hurdle to Feinstein and other censure advocates.
13_32	0.24881348	Moving a censure resolution to the floor would require two-thirds of the Senate _ 67 votes _ to suspend Senate rules, Feinstein said.
13_33	0.091470581	``I would hope at the appropriate time these votes would be present,'' she said .

14_3	0.14778137	As Clinton's impeachment trial continued in the Senate, lawmakers in both parties made clear they still believe that Republicans will be unable to muster the two-thirds majority needed to remove him from office on perjury and obstruction of justice charges.

14_5	0.089620914	The measure does not deal with the perjury or obstruction of justice charges approved by the House of Representatives but instead focuses on presidential misconduct.

14_9	0.082872003	Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I.
14_10	0.10254049	, said Feinstein's resolution is the first of what will likely be a number of proposals that Democrats will consider before bringing a censure plan to the floor.
14_11	0.09116052	``It's a very good place to begin,'' Reed said of the resolution.
14_12	0.088881105	He added that lawmakers need to find the exact, appropriate wording to ensure the resolution passes constitutional muster.
14_13	0.092313078	``From the very beginning of this process, I thought censure was appropriate,'' Reed said.

14_17	0.093571653	For instance, Sen.

14_19	0.1165175	But DeWine said a number of Republicans may find the censure option appealing if the Senate votes against articles of impeachment.
14_20	0.11347866	Republicans control 55 seats while the Democrats have 45 seats.

14_25	0.097524707	There is an outside chance, however, that the Senate may never get to an actual vote on the articles themselves.
14_26	0.13744467	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has proposed that the Senate simply vote to adjourn and accept the House charges of perjury and obstruction of justice as the ``highest form of censure'' against Clinton without having the Senate take its own vote on the charges themselves.

20_0	0.18184057	WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday approved a measure that would help guarantee access to cheap generic AIDS drugs for African countries that have been devastated by the epidemic.
20_1	0.11830256	The measure's approval was a major defeat for the American pharmaceutical industry, which had pressed Congress to stop foreign countries from producing generic versions of their drugs.
20_2	0.091314265	But AIDS groups applauded the measure's approval, saying the price of AIDS drugs is critical because the vast majority of the world's HIV and AIDS cases are in developing countries, where people can't afford expensive drug cocktails.
20_3	0.081139905	``In the case of drugs that can give men, women and children a new lease on life, we should not be bickering over obscure trade policy,'' said Daniel Zingale, executive director for AIDS Actions, a Washington advocacy group.
20_4	0.074500736	Although exact figures are unavailable, generic drugs tend to be significantly cheaper than brand name AIDS drugs, which can cost $12,000 to $15,000 a year.
20_5	0.096176506	The conflict pitting intellectual property rights vs.
20_6	0.041636366	access to AIDS drugs began in 1997.
20_7	0.022988819	That's when South Africa passed legislation allowing it to circumvent Western pharmaceutical firms by granting small local companies permission to produce their own AIDS drugs, or import them from countries, such as India, that make cheaper generic versions.
20_8	0.055749341	However, trade officials and lobbyists for U.S. drug companies have fought back, pressing Congress to protect intellectual property rights.
20_9	0.10626594	U.S. drug companies appeared poised to win a battle in that fight early on Wednesday, when the Senate was considering an African trade bill that would have allowed the U.S.
