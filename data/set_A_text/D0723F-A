0_1	0.15907124	Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill Tuesday to require buyers of handguns and certain semiautomatic weapons to get licenses.
0_2	0.10161188	``When you want to hunt, you get a hunting license; when you want to fish, you get a fishing license, but when you want a gun, no license is required,'' the California Democrat said at a news conference announcing her proposal.
0_3	0.2057336	Feinstein said the legislation is needed because each day 80 people, including 12 children, are killed by guns in the United States.
0_4	0.10470596	She said she does not expect her measure to pass this year but predicted it will be buoyed by the tens of thousands of mothers who plan to demonstrate on Mother's Day in the nation's capital and 67 other cities against gun violence.
0_5	0.07943948	Under Feinstein's proposal current owners of handguns and semiautomatic firearms that can use detachable ammunition clips would have up to 10 years to get licenses.

0_25	0.087964153	Sunday. She also predicted that tens of thousands of women, including large numbers of ``stroller-moms'' with young children, will turn out to protest in Denver, Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles.
0_26	0.11243421	She said the main objective of the march is to urge women to find out how their lawmakers are voting on gun control legislation.
0_27	0.089708762	``This is about mothers taking responsibility for themselves,'' she said.
0_28	0.092300019	The march organizers are also pushing for passage of gun control measures in the so-called juvenile justice bill, passed in different forms by both houses of Congress last year.
0_29	0.096872572	The legislation has been stalled in a conference committee for more than 10 months.
0_30	0.090946457	The most controversial part of the stalled bill is a measure that would require that private dealers at gun shows check the backgrounds of would-be firearm buyers.
0_31	0.086669846	The legislation would also require safety locks on handguns, ban the sale of assault weapons to minors and stop the import of high capacity ammunition clips.

11_1	0.18086293	Dianne Feinstein introduced legislation Tuesday to require that gun owners obtain licenses and register their firearms.
11_2	0.16229011	Feinstein introduced her measure as thousands of women began traveling to Washington for a Mother's Day rally on the National Mall in support of gun control.
11_3	0.15202122	Flanked by march organizers, Feinstein said the rally ``gives us the opportunity to bring together people around a measure that I think will be a pivotal one in the upcoming presidential campaign''.

11_14	0.079426291	``That makes no sense''.
11_15	0.12135978	Feinstein chose to introduce the measure, nearly a year in the making, in the days before the ``Million Mom March'' as a way of galvanizing support and trying to apply pressure to the pro-gun forces in Congress.
11_16	0.080630353	Although the march is being sponsored by a nonpartisan group, its leaders stood with Feinstein at Tuesday's news conference and said licensing and registration is their top priority.
11_17	0.10548741	Several far more modest gun control measures _ including legislation to require child safety locks, ban the sale of guns to minors, and extend a three-day background check to gun shows _ were passed by the Senate last year.

11_19	0.1014473	Feinstein acknowledged that her more sweeping measure has almost no chance to pass the current Congress, saying that the most powerful lobby in Washington is the gun lobby.
11_20	0.091209307	``There is only one counter-lobby that can stand up to them,'' she said, ``and this is the women in America''.
11_21	0.20119741	Feinstein said the political climate in Washington will change if Democrats prevail in November's election.
11_22	0.089205827	Organizers of the Million Mom March hope to attract at least 100,000 _ and perhaps as many as 250,000 _ supporters to the National Mall on Sunday, and tens of thousands more at spin-off rallies in 67 other cities, including Oakland (the Oakland rally begins at 1 p.m. at the Lake Merritt bandstand).
11_23	0.088671553	Adding to the confrontational atmosphere surrounding the issue, a Dallas-based group called the Second Amendment Sisters will hold a counter-march to draw attention to the lives that are saved by guns every year.

11_42	0.11066366	Feinstein has been a foe of the gun lobby since she was San Francisco's mayor nearly two decades ago and sponsored a citywide handgun ban that was approved by the Board of Supervisors but ultimately struck down by a state court.

12_1	0.24320294	Dianne Feinstein said Thursday she felt ``a personal sense of betrayal'' and said she rebuffed an offer to talk to the president about it.
12_2	0.25156647	But Feinstein, D-Calif.
12_3	0.082594046	, said talk about whether Clinton should resign ``is way premature'' and said the congressional investigation into alleged impeachable offenses should be allowed to play out.
12_4	0.083729881	In a rare interview in her office, Feinstein was at times at a loss for words when trying to describe the ``sadness and disappointment'' she felt after reading the report of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, a task she said took four hours.
12_5	0.092502784	She also said revelations that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde had had an affair with a married woman in the 1960s ``is different'' from Clinton's situation and ``only increases animosity'' from Republicans.

12_13	0.15665631	Feinstein said she turned down an offer from one of Clinton's aides to talk with the president about the Lewinsky affair.
12_14	0.2967777	``I said I didn't want to talk to the president,'' Feinstein said.
12_15	0.075271095	``I was angry''.
12_16	0.1652974	Since then, Feinstein said, she hasn't talked to the president but has consulted on other matters with members of his administration.
12_17	0.18114339	``To be candid, it's still hard to believe,'' said Feinstein, who is the senior senator from California, a state Clinton has assiduously courted throughout his presidency.
12_18	0.089342952	``This is the kind of thing that is difficult on a personal level for me''.
12_19	0.089463872	However, she added, ``I can separate my personal dismay and disappointment from what I have to do as a senator'.
12_20	0.098385264	Clinton's admission that he lied about the Lewinsky affair, and the sordid details surrounding it, have drawn a growing number of Democrats in Congress to criticize the president's conduct.
12_21	0.084265224	But most have stopped short of saying Clinton should be forced from office because of an extramarital relationship.
12_22	0.19333881	Feinstein was ambivalent about the impending release of a videotape of the president's Aug.
12_23	0.086727246	17 testimony before the federal grand jury investigating his conduct.
12_24	0.087820716	After the testimony, Clinton went on national television and admitted having an extramarital relationship with Lewinsky.
12_25	0.10229229	``If there's something that adds light to the situation and is pertinent to the situation, it might be a wise thing to do,'' Feinstein said.
12_26	0.092043017	``But if it's something to inflame the situation, I don't think that's what it should be about''.
12_27	0.090254509	She also said she the House Judiciary Committee must be bipartisan as it proceeds with its own assessment of whether Clinton committed impeachable offenses.
12_28	0.090444187	The Starr report accused the president of perjury, abuse of power and obstruction of justice in trying to conceal the Lewinsky affair.
12_29	0.10886428	``I hope we can have a relatively short process,'' Feinstein said.

12_31	0.12360204	Feinstein recalled how she was sitting only a few feet away from Clinton in the White House in January when he waved his index finger at the television cameras and denied to the nation that he had ever had ``sexual relations'' with Lewinsky.
12_32	0.12736233	Feinstein said ``the body language'' and the ``directness of the statement'' convinced her he was telling the truth and she believed that for seven months.
12_33	0.1004194	``I believed it and I believed it totally,'' she said.
12_34	0.092435592	Later, when Clinton dispatched members of his Cabinet to convince others he was telling the truth, she was even more certain.
12_35	0.074350162	But then she was shattered.
12_36	0.089318872	``On August 17, when I heard the statement, my world came crashing down,'' Feinstein said.
12_37	0.078766459	``I feel a personal sense of betrayal.
12_38	0.083886812	I felt a gut-level deep sense of betrayal''.
12_39	0.22374082	At the time, Feinstein told reporters her faith in the president's credibility was badly ``shattered''.
12_40	0.088737361	Feinstein said her office had received about 12,000 phone calls from constituents since Friday, when the Starr report was made public, as well as 1,500 electronic mail messages.

13_2	0.13887533	, said she will vote against both articles of impeachment because House prosecutors failed to prove ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' that President Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice in the Monica Lewinsky matter.
13_3	0.12222383	``Although I deplore the circumstances that have brought us to this point, I do not believe they present a clear and present danger to the functioning of our government,'' Feinstein said during closed-door deliberations on the Senate floor Wednesday.
13_4	0.072011265	Her office released a copy of her statement Thursday.
13_5	0.25289037	``Therefore, this president, who has been a good president for the people of the United States, should not be convicted and removed from office,'' Feinstein said.

13_9	0.099051046	Impeachment, Feinstein said, is a grave step envisioned by the Constitution's framers as a last resort when a president's actions threaten the function of government.
13_10	0.078253836	Given that high threshold, ``I do not believe the House (prosecutors) established beyond a reasonable doubt that this president is guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice''.
13_11	0.088139868	Feinstein cited the charge that Clinton encouraged Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
13_12	0.088327881	House prosecutors relied on Lewinsky's testimony to prove this charge, but Lewinsky herself said that Clinton never told her to lie and that the two of them never discussed the contents of her affidavit, Feinstein said.
13_13	0.09904572	``One may speculate that the president encouraged her to lie, but quite simply the point hasn't been proven,'' Feinstein said.
13_14	0.082854239	Charges that Clinton conspired to hide gifts he gave Lewinsky and worked with confidant Vernon Jordan to find her a job also were marked by contradictory testimony and evidence bolstering a more innocent interpretation of events, Feinstein said.
13_15	0.10188232	She took dead aim at Republican handling of the impeachment process, saying GOP House members ``prematurely released'' grand jury testimony to the public and failed to call key witnesses during impeachment hearings before the House Judiciary Committee.
13_16	0.10937325	While she was ``appalled'' by Clinton's characterization of Lewinsky as a stalker in a conversation with White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, ``the fact that this is a popular, well-respected president (who) has strong support must be considered''.
13_17	0.1627282	In the international arena, removing Clinton would be ``de-stabilizing,'' Feinstein added.
13_18	0.14242615	Feinstein devoted part of her floor speech to the push for censure.
13_19	0.19881078	``The president's behavior was immoral, deplorable and indefensible,'' Feinstein said.
13_20	0.10971498	``It sent the wrong message to the nation and our children''.
13_21	0.10098871	While it does not threaten the security and stability of the nation, Clinton's behavior does warrant ``strong condemnation and censure, and there should be a formal means for senators...
13_22	0.076485013	to express this condemnation''.
13_23	0.090726955	Censure would not be a legal judgment, but rather a ``legislative measure'' through which senators could express ``moral conclusions'' on Clinton's conduct, and thereby send a message ``to the people of our nation, especially its youth''.
13_24	0.18858559	Feinstein's California colleague, Sen.
13_25	0.20744877	Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
13_26	0.13580126	, also said Thursday that she would vote to acquit Clinton.
13_27	0.085589527	But unlike Feinstein, Boxer said she opposes censure.
13_28	0.090394068	Boxer told reporters she is concerned that a Senate debate over censure could eat into the chamber's legislative agenda.
13_29	0.18659548	``I worry about it becoming the dominant issue in the Senate,'' she said.
13_30	0.085700475	``I'm worried it could take too much time away from other work''.

13_32	0.25573638	Moving a censure resolution to the floor would require two-thirds of the Senate _ 67 votes _ to suspend Senate rules, Feinstein said.
13_33	0.096035219	``I would hope at the appropriate time these votes would be present,'' she said .

14_3	0.11883288	As Clinton's impeachment trial continued in the Senate, lawmakers in both parties made clear they still believe that Republicans will be unable to muster the two-thirds majority needed to remove him from office on perjury and obstruction of justice charges.

14_5	0.086564441	The measure does not deal with the perjury or obstruction of justice charges approved by the House of Representatives but instead focuses on presidential misconduct.

14_10	0.1197174	, said Feinstein's resolution is the first of what will likely be a number of proposals that Democrats will consider before bringing a censure plan to the floor.
14_11	0.096228353	``It's a very good place to begin,'' Reed said of the resolution.
14_12	0.080485878	He added that lawmakers need to find the exact, appropriate wording to ensure the resolution passes constitutional muster.
14_13	0.084203532	``From the very beginning of this process, I thought censure was appropriate,'' Reed said.

14_17	0.077163489	For instance, Sen.

14_19	0.11998672	But DeWine said a number of Republicans may find the censure option appealing if the Senate votes against articles of impeachment.
14_20	0.11266789	Republicans control 55 seats while the Democrats have 45 seats.

14_25	0.1236723	There is an outside chance, however, that the Senate may never get to an actual vote on the articles themselves.
14_26	0.12851891	Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has proposed that the Senate simply vote to adjourn and accept the House charges of perjury and obstruction of justice as the ``highest form of censure'' against Clinton without having the Senate take its own vote on the charges themselves.

20_0	0.17559075	WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday approved a measure that would help guarantee access to cheap generic AIDS drugs for African countries that have been devastated by the epidemic.
20_1	0.11383697	The measure's approval was a major defeat for the American pharmaceutical industry, which had pressed Congress to stop foreign countries from producing generic versions of their drugs.
20_2	0.086969857	But AIDS groups applauded the measure's approval, saying the price of AIDS drugs is critical because the vast majority of the world's HIV and AIDS cases are in developing countries, where people can't afford expensive drug cocktails.
20_3	0.080391253	``In the case of drugs that can give men, women and children a new lease on life, we should not be bickering over obscure trade policy,'' said Daniel Zingale, executive director for AIDS Actions, a Washington advocacy group.
20_4	0.072498544	Although exact figures are unavailable, generic drugs tend to be significantly cheaper than brand name AIDS drugs, which can cost $12,000 to $15,000 a year.
20_5	0.083247277	The conflict pitting intellectual property rights vs.
20_6	0.076240653	access to AIDS drugs began in 1997.
20_7	0.079813037	That's when South Africa passed legislation allowing it to circumvent Western pharmaceutical firms by granting small local companies permission to produce their own AIDS drugs, or import them from countries, such as India, that make cheaper generic versions.
20_8	0.079480049	However, trade officials and lobbyists for U.S. drug companies have fought back, pressing Congress to protect intellectual property rights.
20_9	0.094312969	U.S. drug companies appeared poised to win a battle in that fight early on Wednesday, when the Senate was considering an African trade bill that would have allowed the U.S.
