0_13	0.0	Behind this attitude was the fact that the majority were children of working parents and they wanted to make sure their own children came first.
0_14	0.0	But lest feminists fear that this generation is destroying all of their hard work, understand that this trend is not simply about going back to the values and customs of the '50s.
0_15	0.07142857142857142	Rather, it's about Xers recognizing that it's difficult to be a good parent and that raising a teen in today's world may be harder than ever before.
0_16	0.0	Even though the ``stay-at-home'' parent of choice continues to be the woman, many of the male trendsetters surveyed by Youth Intelligence suggested that if the mother of their children had a better job than they did, they would stay home themselves.

1_1	0.0	(AP) - Rabbi Joshua Hammerman made an uplifting discovery when he started searching for God on the Internet.
1_2	0.0	Hammerman, who leads Stamford's conservative Jewish congregation, Temple Beth El, tried a search by typing in ''God''.
1_3	0.0	The search reaped about 2 million hits and was the brainchild for his recently released book, ''thelordismyshepherd.com: Seeking God in Cyberspace''.
1_4	0.0	Hammerman's book explores the reasons that people are using the Internet to find faith.
1_5	0.0	He's concluded that younger generations are not rejecting God but understanding him in a different way.
1_6	0.375	''Most people of Generation X are searching for a way back to religious faith, but the forms and the metaphors some traditions use in their denominations just don't resonate with them,'' Hammerman said.
1_7	0.0	While many young people don't set foot in a church, synagogue or mosque, they may be more likely to discuss religion in a chat room or surf for Web sites where they can learn about different religions.
1_8	0.0	''The whole notion of God as the pastor leading the flock of congregations and parishes, most people now can't relate to that,'' Hammerman said.
1_9	0.0	Instead, people are identifying God with the concept of the World Wide Web, ''that God seems to be within and between us, rather than above us''.
1_10	0.0	A recent survey found that 75 percent of Internet users have engaged Web searches with religious themes.
1_11	0.0	The Internet is sometimes viewed as an alienating force, driving surfers into an artificial world and away from real human contact.
1_12	0.0	Hammerman, unlike many mainstream religious leaders, views the Internet as a vessel for improved communication between people, with the power to ''connect us in ways we've never seen before''.
1_13	0.0	Some churches and congregations, including Hammerman's, have Web sites.
1_14	0.0	In the future, prayer services will probably be available online, too, he said.
1_15	0.0	Hammerman has even married a couple who met on the Internet.
1_16	0.0	''I think there is something real happening in the virtual world,'' he said.
1_17	0.0	''The word 'religion,' in Latin, actually means 'reconnect'.
1_18	0.0	'' The book is supplemented by a Web site, aptly addressed, thelordismyshepherd.com, where surfers can read about the book and discuss it.

9_11	0.0	The protest has shut down Latin America's largest university for more than 3 months and forced most of its 276,000 students and 30,000 professors to go off campus for classes.
9_12	0.0	Frustrated university officials finally canceled the spring semester earlier this month.
9_13	0.0	But as a social movement, the strike has a particular problem: Nobody, including the strikers, seems to know exactly what they want.
9_14	0.0	Unlike the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, which initially drew wide sympathy from the left and the country's urban poor, Mexican society has an ambivalent relationship with its new revolutionaries.
9_15	0.0	Polls suggest that the majority of Mexicans don't approve of the strike.
9_16	0.0	Talks between university officials and the students have broken down repeatedly.
9_17	0.0	Officials now say they will no longer even sit down with the strike leaders until the students promise to abandon the campus that they have occupied since April.
9_18	0.0	``They're only hurting themselves,'' said Maria Isabel Castro, a 76-year-old grandmother, as she tended a market stand in the city's center.
9_19	0.0	``I say the ones who want to study should study and the rest, throw them out in the street''.
9_20	0.0	Even so, nearly everyone has been surprised by the determination of the students and a capacity to organize that has repeatedly brought supportive crowds of thousands into the capital's streets and the university's main square.
9_21	0.0	The strike appears to have tapped the frustration of a generation that has grown up as Mexico has stumbled from one economic crisis to another.
9_22	0.0	Real wages have dropped dramatically since the early 1980s, analysts say, and the inequality gap that separates rich from poor has grown.
9_23	0.08333333333333333	``This is a moment when some sectors of society feel alienated, and the youth are reacting to that,'' said Sergio Aguayo, a political analyst.
9_24	0.0	``Forty to 50 percent of this country lives in poverty''.
9_25	0.07407407407407407	That may explain why the strikers didn't stop June 7, when the university's president gave in to their primary demand and withdrew his proposal for a mandatory increase in fees from the current equivalent of about 2 cents per semester _ effectively free _ to about $150.
9_26	0.0	The students had won, but they had also captured the public pulpit and seemed unwilling to give it up.
9_27	0.0	They have added several more demands, including a restructuring of how the university is governed.
9_28	0.0	But it is also clear from interviews with students and their faculty supporters that many hope the strike can spark a nationwide political movement that can connect with workers, primary and secondary school teachers, and other universities _ invigorating the country's left in a grand, grass-roots coalition.
9_29	0.0	``One of the engines of democratization in the country over the last 30 years has been the public university.
9_30	0.0	That's what you're seeing now _ the university moving to recapture this national role,'' said Carola Garcia Calderon, a professor of communication in the faculty of political and social sciences, which has served as the movement's nerve center.
9_31	0.0	Yet not much agreement has emerged on what this larger movement ought to be about.
9_32	0.0	Recent protests have lashed out against targets as varied as the World Bank, Mexico's stock market, the country's news media, the United States and university entrance exams.
9_33	0.0	``They don't have a clear message, and the image that they are projecting of themselves is quite radical,'' Aguayo said.
9_34	0.0	``In a way, this is a nostalgic moment.
9_35	0.0	They are trying to appeal to a Mexico that no longer exists''.
9_36	0.0	Most analysts say confused goals and apparent intransigence will limit the students' capacity to expand their following.
9_37	0.0	Internal splits are already forming.
9_38	0.0	After weeks of brewing dissent, a sizable group of students broke ranks July 18 over the issue of whether they should hand over the campus to help restart negotiations.
9_39	0.0	In the end, the most significant thing about the students' uprising may be that they can shut down a massive university, march in the streets, hand ultimatums to government negotiators and, through it all, give the authorities little choice but to stand by and wait it out.
9_40	0.0	It's a dramatic contrast to Mexico's leftist student movement of 1968 that ended when federal troops opened fire on the protesters in a square, killing, by one estimate, nearly 200.
9_41	0.0	Private papers of the general who was Mexico's secretary of defense at the time were made public last month.
9_42	0.0	The documents show that members of the presidential bodyguard team fired on the students and that the order came directly from the president, Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, something long denied by successive governments.
9_43	0.0	This time around, such intervention would be hard to imagine in a Mexico obsessed with its international image and securing a role in the global economy.
9_44	0.0	The army has said it will not intervene.
9_45	0.0	Authorities have not ruled out police action, but a recent poll in the daily Reforma indicates that while public opinion does not support the strike, it is also overwhelmingly against using force to stop it.
9_46	0.0	With the most competitive presidential election in the country's modern history shaping up for next year, observers say direct intervention would present too much of a political risk for the government of President Ernesto Zedillo.
9_47	0.0	``The police aren't entering to retake the campus because no one in the government is prepared to pay the consequences of even a single student dying,'' said Denise Maerker, the host of a TV interview program.
9_48	0.0	``Nineteen sixty-eight was another Mexico, another society altogether''.

11_0	0.0	FORT WORTH, Texas _ We can assume that the Rev.
11_1	0.0	Edgar Helms of Boston _ who, in 1910, founded what would become Goodwill Industries _ was not hip.
11_2	0.0	Neither was the good reverend, most likely, groovy.
11_3	0.25	He certainly didn't know that gray would become the new black.
11_4	0.0	Nonetheless, hip is how a new breed of Goodwill shoppers has come to consider the retail stores.
11_5	0.2727272727272727	Due in part to Generation X's preternatural nostalgia for all things from the '70s (and '80s and even early '90s, it seems) and thanks to image-building efforts from the organization itself, Goodwill isn't just for people with ``special needs'' anymore.
11_6	0.0	``I was Goodwill before Goodwill was cool,'' says local twentysomething bohemian Bret McCabe.
11_7	0.0	``I've been going there for about a decade.
11_8	0.0	My shopping technique, wherever I've lived, is to find the poorest neighborhood and to go there.
11_9	0.0	You avoid places where hipsters go because they'll sift through everything and get the good stuff.
11_10	0.0	They won't go to the poor neighborhood''.
11_11	0.0	Like most Goodwillers, McCabe speaks lovingly of a favorite find.
11_12	0.0	``It was an early '70s-era purple, shiny three-piece suit, with, like, huge lapels.
11_13	0.0	It had a sheen to it,'' he says.
11_14	0.0	``I paid about $1.50 or $2.
11_15	0.0	But I gave it to a friend because it looked better on him.
11_16	0.0	He had an Afro''.
11_17	0.0	McCabe does admit to having ``special needs,'' but not the sort that Goodwill has strived to meet for almost a century.
11_18	0.0	The nonprofit organization uses revenues from its stores to fund community-based training and job-placement programs for people who otherwise might slip through the cracks.
11_19	0.0	Last year, Goodwill Industries served more than 200,000 people through training and job placement and sold nearly $690 million in donated goods.
11_20	0.0	Erin Quillian, the director of sales for Goodwill Industries of Fort Worth, says her organization got its groove back by focusing on retail display in the stores.
11_21	0.0	``I think a lot of it really has to do with changing our image and the way we present ourselves,'' she says.
11_22	0.0	``We're not what people typically think a thrift store is.
11_23	0.0	It's surprising to a lot of people, when they first come in, that we look just like any other store''.
11_24	0.0	Quillian says the national trend within Goodwill is to recruit store managers who have retail experience, people who ``really know how to set up a store and really create some excitement in it''.
11_25	0.0	Quillian herself worked at Ross Dress For Less and Dillard's before coming to Goodwill.
11_26	0.0	But perhaps the most surprising thing about Goodwill is not that bohemian hipsters snatch up the retro threads hanging on its well-displayed racks, but that the decidedly downscale shop founded by a Methodist minister is actually shaping the future of upscale fashion.
11_27	0.0	Doubters need look no further than the Dallas-based design firm William Reid.
11_28	0.0	William Reid's fall line graces such high-end shops as Stanley Korshak, Takashimaya and Saks Fifth Avenue.
11_29	0.0	Reid is so hip that sources say he knows what the new gray is _ or at least has a good idea.
11_30	0.0	And, as it turns out, he shops Goodwill for inspiration.
11_31	0.0	``It's almost like a fashion library,'' Reid says.
11_32	0.0	``I go in there just looking for things that are very unusual, whether it's details or fabrics or certain silhouettes that you can't explain to someone.
11_33	0.0	We find a lot of old ties, and we'll take a pattern of that tie and put it in the computer and play with it a little bit and make it into shirts and all sorts of things''.
11_34	0.0	In fact, Reid has found clothes at Goodwill whose sartorial splendor has stymied the finest craftsmen of Italy.
11_35	0.0	Only a few weeks ago, he bought a jacket for $15.
11_36	0.0	``It was a leather jacket that had this braiding stitched around the cuff,'' he remembers fondly.
11_37	0.0	``It was so unusual.
11_38	0.0	We immediately sent it over to our manufacturers and said, `How difficult is it to do this'?
11_39	0.0	They laughed and said they couldn't touch it.
11_40	0.0	The machinery to do some of those things just isn't around anymore''.

12_18	0.0	The older-than-boomer bunch was bobbing in agreement, too.
12_19	0.1111111111111111	It seems to me that meeting the needs of Gen X in the workplace is, or at least should be, the same as meeting the needs of everybody else.

13_6	0.6666666666666666	The name is intended to link images of Generation X and rugged terrain.
13_7	0.0	This SUV will not have leather seats, but there is an option for neoprene covers, which could be useful to surfers or scuba divers who climb in while wet.

14_3	0.0	on June 1, he will be the youngest chief executive ever at GM, running the world's largest automaker at age 47.
14_4	0.0	But whether he can keep the company in good health will depend in part on improving GM's standing among consumers half his age.
14_5	0.0	With rivals hustling harder for younger buyers, Wagoner will have to show that GM can compete profitably for those consumers and keep bringing them back as they grow older.
14_6	0.0	"I think it's critical that we engage that group," Wagoner said Friday.
14_7	0.0	"History has shown that when you get a buyer into your family and treat them well, it's easier to keep them than to attract someone new.

14_15	0.3157894736842105	Karen Piurkowski, director of loyalty with Polk, said buyers in the age range from 23 to 35, commonly labeled Generation X, tend to consider foreign manufacturers more than their predecessors.

14_17	0.4666666666666667	"It's not as natural for (Generation X members) to be as loyal to a domestic manufacturer, whereas the baby boomers were always a Ford family or a GM family".
14_18	0.0	Younger buyers have not always been a major concern of automakers, since they tend to choose cheaper, smaller vehicles that carry slim profits.
14_19	0.0	In recent years, GM has shifted its attention from small cars to trucks and sport utility vehicles.
14_20	0.0	The company has said it loses money on every Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire it builds; those models will be 10 years old by the time GM brings out their replacements in 2004.
14_21	0.0	"Our research on younger buyers says they aren't necessarily interested in small cars," Wagoner said.
14_22	0.0	"I don't necessarily believe that traditional small cars with more progressive styling are what young buyers are after".
14_23	0.0	Other automakers have gone after younger buyers with more force.
14_24	0.043478260869565216	Among the new vehicles targeted at the market are Chrysler's Neon and upcoming PT Cruiser, the Toyota Echo and Ford's Focus -- all well-equipped models that carry far more options than cars of that size and price had before.
14_25	0.0	Ford said Friday that one fourth of all Focus buyers so far were under 25 years old -- a higher share of younger buyers than any other vehicle sold in the United States.
14_26	0.0	To compete with those models, Wagoner said GM would use more expressive vehicles that are a step above the bottom of the market.
14_27	0.0	He points to the Pontiac Aztek, a new SUV coming out this year and the Pontiac Piranha, a concept car that will be shown for the first time at this week's Chicago Auto Show, as the types of vehicles that eventually will bring younger buyers back into the GM fold.
14_28	0.0	"Our view is that we're increasingly focused on the kind of things that will attract youthful (buyers) into the family," Wagoner said.
14_29	0.0	"That's why we're putting so much more emphasis on the Internet, because more people are using it and because of the kind of people that are using it as well".
14_30	0.0	Analyst Jim Hall with AutoPacific said the Aztek and an upcoming Saturn SUV had the potential to make GM a contender for those consumers.
14_31	0.0	"The fact that they're developing vehicles like that at all is amazing," Hall said.

16_5	0.0	Is it: A) the name of the so-so punk band Billy Idol led over a decade and a half go?
16_6	0.14285714285714285	B) the title of the 1991 ``groundbreaking'' novel by Douglas Coupland?
16_7	0.0	C) the title of the exploitative Marvel comic book series?
16_8	0.0	D) the buzzword of the decade (after ``information superhighway'') misused to describe anyone between 20 and 29 years old?
16_9	0.0	The answer is, of course, all of the above, but the definition we're most concerned with here is ``D''.
16_10	0.9090909090909091	In the '90s, ``Generation X'' is a fashionable synonym for twentysomethings like ``baby boomers'' was for thirtysomethings in the '80s.
16_11	0.07692307692307693	The problem is ``Gen X'' also comes with plenty of connotational baggage, giving rise to conflicting interpretations and semantic confusion.
16_12	0.375	Some have taken Generation X to mean the ``jilted generation'' (from the 1995 Prodigy album Music for the Jilted Generation) -- ``jilted'' in the economic sense.

16_21	0.030303030303030304	According to Generation Ecch!, the definitive 1994 satirical tome on the Gen X phenom by Jason Cohen and Michael Krugman, it all started with a 1990 Time cover story that christened the post-boomer generation the ``twentysomething'' generation, an echo of thirtysomething, that dreary TV show about angst-ridden boomers who dressed incredibly well.
16_22	0.46153846153846156	``Baby buster'' was the catchphrase for a while, as was ``13th generation,'' before stumbling out of vogue and allowing ``Generation X'' to seize the buzzword throne.
16_23	0.05555555555555555	If ``Gen X'' is the king of buzzwords, then ``slacker'' is prince, bestowed staying power by Richard Linklater's 1991 cult hit film of that name.
16_24	0.07142857142857142	To further complicate matters, according to 13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail, the definitive 1993 non-satirical tome on the Gen X phenom by Neil Howe and Bill Strauss, Gen X is a mere subset of the ``13ers'', the authors' own coinage.
16_25	0.0	The number comes from Howe and Strauss' thesis that ``Counting back to the peers of Benjamin Franklin, this generation is the 13th to know the American nation, flag, and Constitution''.
16_26	0.1111111111111111	If you're born between 1961 and 1981, you're a 13er, say the authors.
16_27	0.75	Note, however, that by their definition, 13ers -- and by implication, Gen Xers -- are inherently American.
16_28	0.08333333333333333	But thanks to the global hegemony of American media and popular culture, certain Gen X affectations engendered by America's particular socioscape have also taken root abroad, infecting the youths as distant and discrete as those in Singapore.

17_0	0.0	When he catalogs the ups and downs of going to work for Apple Computer at age 14, several elements are missing from Tom Williams' unflinching, self-critical rap: Finger-pointing.
17_1	0.0	Blame. Limp surrender to the Fates or impersonal forces beyond his control, be they The Man, The System or The Economy.
17_2	0.0	Instead, the former wunderkind exhibits a headlong acceptance of personal responsibility, a steadfast refusal to play the victim and a firm acknowledgment that his own decisions -- good or bad -- have given him the life he leads.
17_3	0.0	``I can't stand people who play victim,'' said Williams, now 21 and living in Los Angeles where he screens technological projects for a venture capital firm.
17_4	0.0	``None of this was anybody's choice but mine.
17_5	0.0	No matter how impressionable or naive I have been, it has always been my decision''.
17_6	0.0	For Jacob Leverich, 18, a freshly minted high school graduate who holds down a sophisticated job at a high-end computer graphics company, pragmatic faith in self is a mantra.
17_7	0.0	``I can't allow someone to be responsible for my success; I can't allow someone to protect me from failure,'' said Leverich, who is headed to the University of Texas this fall.
17_8	0.0	``If I fail, it's my responsibility to get back up and back in the game''.
17_9	0.0	Riding the wave of technological innovation and economic expansion is a back-to-the-future ethic that emphasizes individual initiative and accountability, expressed with the hipness and attitude of youth.
17_10	0.0	In a land where Jerry Springer is a minor deity and the culture of complaint, alibi and blame is so strong that a conservative commentator once dubbed us a Nation of Victims, such unadulterated blasts of personal responsibility are bracingly refreshing.
17_11	0.0	``We're moving in the direction of putting a greater emphasis on personal responsibility rather than blaming fate or the social structure,'' said Ted Goertzel, a sociology professor at the Camden, N.J., campus of Rutgers University.
17_12	0.0	``There's been a shift in societal attitude away from blaming the system and looking for blame in the individual.
17_13	0.0	It's moving in a direction back toward a more positive view of what you can do rather than complaining about how the system is broke and what you can't do''.
17_14	0.0	The trend is particularly pronounced among the age groups represented by Leverich and Williams, experts say.
17_15	0.1	And this provides sharp generational contrast with the graying Baby Boomers just ahead of them on the march through life.
17_16	0.3333333333333333	Self-reliance is the common thread between kids like Leverich, at the leading edge of what some sociologists call the Millennium Generation, and young adults like Williams, who is at the tail end of Generation X.
17_17	0.0	Experts note that Xers manifest this cross-generational trait with a decided cynicism and sense of isolation, while Millennials are more optimistic and more likely to band together.
17_18	0.0	Remember, though, that this is vague and mushy sociological stuff, lacking the absolutes of atomic physics.
17_19	0.5384615384615384	Generation X is an exceedingly broad monicker for anyone born after the Baby Boom and before the Class of 2000 just now leaving high school.
17_20	0.08333333333333333	But polls back the notion of generational differences in outlook about responsibility, self-reliance and the power of individual effort.
17_21	0.0	A July 1999 Pew Research Center survey shows that a significantly higher share of those between ages 18 and 29 -- almost 79 percent -- believe individual effort is the key to success.
17_22	0.0	In contrast, only 71 percent of those between 30 and 49 believe this.
17_23	0.03333333333333333	The same survey shows the younger age group also has the strongest belief in the power of the individual: 84 percent of those 18 to 29 think everyone has the inner strength to succeed in life; only 77 percent of those between the ages of 50 and 64 and 70 percent of those age 65 and older believe this.
17_24	0.35714285714285715	Xers and Millennials are also linked by matter-of-fact low expectations about politics, government, corporations and other traditional social institutions, the pros say.
17_25	0.0	To the degree that they look to others for support or commitment, it's to a loose collective of friends, family or like-minded peers, or non-traditional organizations like non-profits.
17_26	0.0	They believe in action over words, movement toward a goal rather than discussion of an idea.
17_27	0.20588235294117646	``Look at it this way -- if the motto of Generation X is `Just Do It,' then the motto of the Millennials is `Let's Do It,' while the motto of the Baby Boomers is `Let's Meditate About It,''' said Neil Howe, co-author of ``Generations: The History of America's Future''.
17_28	0.0	In a series of books with co-author William Strauss, Howe argues that American history has been strongly influenced by a cycle of generational traits ranging from idealism to alienation.
17_29	0.0	Boomers were idealistic until Vietnam, Nixon, the assassinations of the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King Jr.
17_30	0.0	and the economic upheaval of the '70s and '80s made them disillusioned and inward-looking, Howe said.
17_31	0.26666666666666666	Xers are alienated and isolated, taking as a given the empty promise of traditional societal institutions like family and government, arming themselves with the cynical belief that they're on their own.
17_32	0.0	Howe said the most motivated of this generation turn lone-wolf cynicism into individual action that has positioned them to take advantage of the current economic expansion; those who don't are slackers, missing out on the boom's big ride.
17_33	0.0	``This is a very libertarian generation,'' Howe said of the Xers.
17_34	0.0	``They believe you take care of yourself, that you rely on yourself and your platoon, your surrogate family.
17_35	0.0	... The take was: Life can be cruel, you have to deal with it on your own''.
17_36	0.0	Still a work in progress, the Millennials are just emerging from high school.
17_37	0.0	They exhibit the most optimism about the future, a by-product of growing up in nothing-but-good economic times, in an era of renewed emphasis on protecting kids from the ravages of broken homes and other societal forces.
17_38	0.0	Howe said Millenials are just as cynical about traditional institutions and can be just as alienated as Xers, but he also notes a mighty cross-current -- willingness to join cooperative efforts that aren't self-centered, and belief that they can rise above the challenges of the future.
17_39	0.10526315789473684	If that combination persists, it's Howe's belief that the Millenials will take on the mantle of the World War II generation and their unstinting belief in duty, honor and country.
17_40	0.0	Much of this rings true to Jackson Pace.
17_41	0.0	The teacher and technology coordinator at Lyndon Baines Johnson High School in Austin, Texas, works closely with the teen computer wizards in the school's special science and technology program, including Jacob Leverich.
17_42	0.0	The Millennials in his program are technologically savvy, confident that their computer skills are a bankable backstop for the future.
17_43	0.0	They're unburdened by the baggage carried by boomers -- such as the need to be in touch with every emotion, or the financial worries ingrained by the economies of the '70s and '80s and the Great Depression stories passed down by parents and grandparents.
17_44	0.0	``There's no overriding fear that they can't whip it, they can't overcome it,'' Pace, 43, said of his students.
17_45	0.0	``These kids have a full toolbelt of skills.
17_46	0.0	They analyze quicker, they assess need quicker, they pull the tool, get it done and move on''.
17_47	0.058823529411764705	Pace, a Baby Boomer, contrasts this with his own approach to issues: ``I have to know that it's OK, know that you think it's OK, and I want to talk to you about it being OK.
17_48	0.0	We'll justify our point and then do it.
17_49	0.0	``These kids process it and get it done with no talk''.
17_50	0.05263157894736842	(FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) Pace thinks the Millennials have a decided advantage over Xers -- a willingness to cooperate with each other, a sense of something larger than themselves and a fearlessness born from prosperity and comfort with technology.
17_51	0.5	``The Xers knew the only reason they were in this world was because that yuppie parent had money and they were another possession,'' said Pace.
17_52	0.0	``And that created a real cynical kid.

17_54	0.0	They're not money grubbers.
17_55	0.0	They know they can get the money.
17_56	0.0	And I'm not sure they're basing their human happiness on cash''.
17_57	0.0	Leverich echoes this last point: ``What will make me happy is not necessarily making more money.
17_58	0.0	What will make me happy is to set myself apart and not just be another person off the assembly line''.
17_59	0.0	(FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS) Technology is the key to this confident self-reliance, said Mary Ann Rafoth, professor of educational psychology at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
17_60	0.0	Computer competence gives adolescents and young adults a taste of success at a crucial stage of life, a boost they are likely to ride into middle age.
17_61	0.0	``They see technology as a big part of the future and they're comfortable with it,'' Rafoth said.
17_62	0.125	``They tend to be individualistic and see themselves in control and not the pawns of giant, impersonal forces.
17_63	0.25	That's because they haven't lived through a Vietnam or World War II.
17_64	0.0	They see it as getting what they want out of life and nothing stopping them and technology enabling to do that''.
17_65	0.0	The flip side of this confidence is an uninformed arrogance, an unwillingness to acknowlege the value of life experiences outside the narrow band of technological competence.
17_66	0.0	It is the thing that drives boomers to crazed distraction when they confront Xers and Millennials.
17_67	0.0	``They may be more sophisticated and more knowlegeable about one thing -- technology -- and because of that they won't give you credit for the things you've lived through,'' Rafoth said.
17_68	0.0	(SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) Howe, who runs management seminars, says fixation on technology exacerbates the biggest cultural clash in the modern workplace -- the conflict between boomer-era managers and Xers who discount what their elders have lived through.
17_69	0.0	``Boomers are into mission statements and corporate culture and creating a sense of community and team play,'' said Howe.
17_70	0.0	``Xers are much more contractual about work.
17_71	0.0	`If it's 5 o'clock, I'm outta here'.
17_72	0.0	They say they bring to the job all they need to bring.
17_73	0.0	They don't bring all the baggage and expectations that boomers bring''.
17_74	0.0	Millennials share this transactional attitude about work, but sport it with less of a nasty edge.
17_75	0.0	``Instead of being the enemy of these corporations, it's just where we go to work,'' said Leverich.
17_76	0.0	``I don't see them as my enemy, but I don't see them as my savior, either''.
17_77	0.0	Williams, who sometimes sounds like a world-weary boomer instead of the tail-end Xer he is, buys the notion that his generation believes in self- determination.
17_78	0.0	But he doesn't see this as something noble.
17_79	0.45454545454545453	Deserted by divorcing parents and discredited social institutions, Xers had no choice but to rely on their own devices, he says.
17_80	0.0	And he doesn't see his generation or the Millennials as any less self- absorbed than the boomers.
17_81	0.0	As proof he cites the resiliance of conspicuous consumption, wide reliance on the anti-depressant Prozac and the popularity of the public self-confessional.
17_82	0.0	Still, he wryly notes the grit and high-tech gumption of his peers and the next generation down.
17_83	0.0	``Maybe it was Steven Spielberg,'' he jokes.
