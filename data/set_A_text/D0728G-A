0_0	0.151542	LONDON (AP) --Glaxo Wellcome PLC today released new data indicating its drug Zeffix may help prevent chronic hepatitis B sufferers from developing cirrhosis.
0_1	0.11992053	The data from three large clinical studies showed a smaller proportion of chronic hepatitis B patients treated with Zeffix progressed to cirrhosis, or liver scarring, compared with those treated with placebo or interferon-alpha.
0_2	0.12223157	The results were presented at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver in Naples, and supported by other data showing additional Zeffix benefits, Glaxo said.
0_3	0.15516692	Only 1.8 percent of Zeffix-treated patients progressed to cirrhosis, compared with 7.1 percent placebo-treated patients and 9.5 percent of those treated with interferon-alpha.
0_4	0.11465545	Glaxo said the results showed a continued increase in the incidence of e-antigen seroconversion --an immune response to the virus that is thought to predict long-lasting remission of the disease -- and a continued reduction in levels of viral replication.
0_5	0.09827381	Zeffix is available in the Philippines, Canada and the U.S. and approved in China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Pakistan and New Zealand.
0_6	0.092930902	Regulatory applications have been made in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Europe.
0_7	0.12955682	Hepatitis B is a potentially fatal liver disease --the ninth-most common killer worldwide.
0_8	0.22181339	About 350 million people are long-term carriers of the hepatitis B virus and nearly one-third are expected to develop progressive inflammation of the liver, leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer.

1_0	0.21313021	The early moments after patients are infected with the feared Ebola virus may be the most important to their survival, researchers report this week in the journal Nature Medicine.
1_1	0.084500813	A French team working in Gabon in West Africa have successfully taken and analyzed blood samples from 11 patients infected during outbreaks in Gabon and the Congo.
1_2	0.08776858	This is in itself a feat because outbreaks have so far only taken place in very remote areas and because those who contract the disease die swiftly.
1_3	0.085233021	Ebola is a rare viral disease, confined to occasional outbreaks in Africa since its first appearance in 1979.
1_4	0.068972848	But this exotic virus gets attention disproportionate to its human toll for two reasons.
1_5	0.10936666	First, the virus kills 70 percent of those it infects, and kills horribly, with the disease advancing from fever to massive bloody hemorrhaging in a space of 10 days.
1_6	0.084761383	Second, researchers worry that Ebola may not remain forever in its remote jungle confines, but may one day break out.
1_7	0.010125045	Led by Dr.
1_8	0.091751437	Sylvain Baize and Eric M.
1_9	0.10617267	Leroy of the International Center for Medical Research in Gabon, the team found a striking difference in the first days of the infection between those who would eventually die and those who would survive.
1_10	0.12549286	Of the 11 patients from whom blood was taken, four survived and are now believed immune to further Ebola infection.
1_11	0.068607829	The research focused on the differences between those who lived and those who died.
1_12	0.090761146	They discovered that the immune defenses in the two groups were quite distinct.
1_13	0.081204092	The immune system puts up two general types of defense against invading microbes.
1_14	0.078479504	In one, the humoral system, antibodies identify and latch on to the invading bugs.
1_15	0.096058617	In the other, the cellular system, defenders spot cells that the invading bugs have infected.
1_16	0.091355703	Among the surviving patients, the immune defenses were stable enough to produce a good humoral response, including antibodies to attack the virus, as well as a good cellular response, including a substantial number of ``killer cells'' (or cytotoxic T cells) and modest amounts of interferon, the body's own antiviral substance.
1_17	0.073510645	Thus, there appeared to be a balanced attack from both humoral and cellular defenses.
1_18	0.10432044	These patients were able to clear much of the Ebola out of their blood, then continued to produce both ``killer'' cells and interferon to suppress further multiplication of the viruses.
1_19	0.10897006	By contrast, the immune systems of the majority, those who did not survive the infection, failed to give a balanced defense within the first two to three days after infection.
1_20	0.10380819	They had a poor showing of antibodies, but at the same time apparently produced too much of the cellular kind of defense, as signaled by excessive production of interferon.
1_21	0.10684156	One possibility is that the too-strong response of one part of the immune system may be giving falsely strong signals, thereby passing information that would suppress the other side of the defense.
1_22	0.14011456	Or, possibly, the patient was infected by so much virus that it overwhelmed one half of the immune system's defenses.
1_23	0.084582802	The lack of one kind of defense and excess of another suggests that a good strategy to attack Ebola infection may be to intervene in the body to balance the two kinds of defenses by enhancing one or depressing the other.
1_24	0.022769456	Dr. Philip K.
1_25	0.081249286	Russell, emeritus professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, said the work represented an important step in understanding how Ebola works.
1_26	0.10918818	Dr. Pierre Rollin, of the Special Pathogens Branch at the federal Centers for Disease Control, said the work would help researchers test ideas.
1_27	0.099724003	For example, therapies that would suppress the interferon production and related cellular immune defenses might now be put at the top of the list to try, he said.
1_28	0.080731721	But therapies that used interferon as a treatment might be ruled out.

3_0	0.16687988	BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) --China has started to put into mass production a genetic engineering drug which can effectively treat liver diseases.
3_1	0.11980317	Chen Zhangliang, the 35-year-old vice-president of Beijing University, declared at a seminar here today that recombinant a-1b interferon was approved for production by the Ministry of Public Health in April this year and has become China's first genetic engineering drug to be put into mass production in the biotechnology section of the country's "863 Hi-Tech Plan".
3_2	0.091132869	China listed biotechnology among its top eight fields for scientific and technological development in 1978.
3_3	0.081675653	Biotechnology was listed among the top seven pioneering sciences in March 1986, when the "863" plan was introduced.
3_4	0.10670141	So far, China has put onto the market five genetic engineering drugs, and another dozen such drugs are under research.
3_5	0.14488236	Interferon is a protein isolated from human cells and internationally acknowledged as efficacious for the treatment of liver diseases, experts said.
3_6	0.11329879	In the early 1980s China's first interferon research lab was established under the directorship of Hou Yunde, a member of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine and a leading scientist in the "863" plan.

4_1	0.24771388	for a stake in the burgeoning market for hepatitis C treatments.
4_2	0.20661875	Fisher's Specialized Pharmacy Services in Pittsburgh has announced plans to fill prescriptions nationwide for the anti-viral drug ribavirin, used by growing numbers of hepatitis C patients in combination with the drug interferon.
4_3	0.12979718	The hepatitis C virus, or HCV, is typically spread through contact with contaminated blood and now infects an estimated 4 million Americans, although only about 1 million have been diagnosed.
4_4	0.085630933	Chronic carriers often go decades without symptoms but may eventually develop severe liver damage.
4_5	0.1029653	The ribavirin-interferon combination generates a lasting response in fewer than half of those who try it, often at the cost of serious side effects.
4_6	0.073244393	Still, the combination is considered the best treatment now available for most patients.
4_7	0.082457186	Schering reported worldwide sales of $719 million for the two drugs last year, reflecting both a growing demand among HCV patients as well as some use for treating cancer and other conditions.
4_8	0.22082906	The company claims more than 80 percent of the HCV drug market.
4_9	0.085163046	But along with that success, the New Jersey-based drugmaker has also generated complaints of high prices and overly aggressive marketing tactics.
4_10	0.14025813	In the United States, Schering-Plough has been the sole source of ribavirin, sold only as part of a kit that also include's the company's proprietary brand of interferon, called Intron A.
4_11	0.10099593	Other forms of interferon are available from different manufacturers.
4_12	0.10105493	Some patient advocates charge that Schering's bundling strategy has made it difficult for people to experiment with different drug combinations and dosages.
4_13	0.093881123	``It's anticompetitive,'' said Brian Klein, a San Francisco leader of a national patients group called the Hepatitis C Action and Advocacy Coalition.
4_14	0.064111368	``It's delaying research and hurts patients''.
4_15	0.082315131	The group issued nationwide e-mail alerts this week announcing the new source of ribavirin, complete with the Pittsburgh pharmacy's toll-free phone number (888-347-3416) and Web site (www.spsdrug.com).
4_16	0.11201864	Schering's spokesman, Robert Consalvo, said the company is convinced that its package is the safest, most convenient way to make the drugs available.
4_17	0.1093428	Special ``compassionate use'' arrangements can be worked out for patients who need ribavirin alone, he added.
4_18	0.13845979	The HCV drug kit was specifically approved only as a combination product by the U.S.
4_19	0.43571682	Food and Drug Administration.
4_20	0.095662232	By contrast, European authorities have banned such practices, forcing Schering to seek approval to market each product individually.
4_21	0.066279002	That application was approved by European regulators just last month.
4_22	0.084304084	The Pittsburgh pharmacy said it holds all the necessary licenses to fill mail-order prescriptions as a so-called ``compounding'' pharmacy, referring to the specialized practice of preparing individual drug orders.
4_23	0.090986827	Betty Stein, one of three pharmacists at Fisher's, would not disclose her supplier of ribavirin, other than to say it is imported from abroad.
4_24	0.093009721	She said the product has been tested and found to be pure.
4_25	0.08582882	The pharmacy plans to fill capsules as individual prescription orders are received starting after midnight July 8, when certain U.S. patent rights Schering holds will expire.
4_26	0.092712611	The mail-order pharmacy is offering the anti-viral drug at $1.25 per 200-mg capsule.
4_27	0.13507068	That works out to about one-fifth the cost of the same drug obtained in the Schering-Plough combination kit.
4_28	0.076057637	Consalvo said the drugmaker has no plans to change its marketing practices or prices.
4_29	0.098628344	He also said that patients need to be wary of the possibility that other sources of ribavirin may not meet the manufacturer's standards for purity and other chemical factors.
5_0	0.1258217	NEW ORLEANS _ Responding to reports that the highly-touted anticancer drug endostatin has failed to impress in its first human tests, Dr.
5_1	0.10411644	Judah Folkman of Children Hospital in Boston told thousands of cancer specialists Monday that he was ``very pleased'' with the drug's early trials in Boston and hinted there will be more good news ahead.
5_2	0.10642633	Addressing a standing-room-only crowd at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, Folkman, who developed endostatin in Boston labs, urged specialists not to be discouraged if the drugs don't work right away.
5_3	0.088815975	``It doesn't matter if it takes a long time. . .,'' Folkman said.
5_4	0.10920883	Folkman was making the first public comments to cancer specialists about the drug's effectiveness since a National Cancer Institute official was quoted in the Globe earlier this month saying ``no dramatic benefits,'' have been seen in endostatin trials going on now in Boston and two other cities.
5_5	0.073168208	That report sent the stock in Maryland-based Entremed Inc.
5_6	0.059419405	, which makes endostatin, into a tailspin.
5_7	0.085038308	Investors have been closely following the development of endostatin and Folkman's progress ever since a scientist predicted in 1998 that Folkman would cure cancer within two years.
5_8	0.07328102	That hasn't happened but the enthusiasm of some investors and scientists has barely been dented as they await results of the endostatin trials.
5_9	0.13939187	Because patients began receiving endostatin in the Boston study in October, two months ahead of the other centers, Folkman seemed to hint Monday that the drug's effectiveness improves over time.
5_10	0.080796957	Folkman, however, does not directly oversee the trials, from which no official data has been reported, and cannot speak publicly about them.
5_11	0.083561419	However, he said Monday ``We are very pleased with the results at the Boston hospital''.
5_12	0.081926697	He also disclosed the results of other cases in which so-called angiogenesis inhibitors, of which endostatin is one, have proved to be powerful cancer fighters.
5_13	0.088481109	Unlike standard cancer drugs that attack tumors directly, angiogenesis inhibitors cut off the tumor's blood supply and slowly strangles them, or at least halts their growth.
5_14	0.095343005	Folkman said Monday that in about 80 cancer patients, mostly children, the drugs destroyed growths that would have killed them.
5_15	0.097476746	``If we'd given up in the first month or two, they wouldn't be around,'' he said.
5_16	0.093502169	One of the most dramatic cases was that of a Vermont teenager who in 1998 had a volleyball-sized pelvic tumor that resisted all therapies.
5_17	0.08848001	She had been ``sent home to die,'' Folkman said, but after months of treatment with an angiogenesis inhibitor, the growth began to shrink and today she is free of cancer.
5_18	0.091047274	The patient, Tonya Kalesnik, of Colchester, may be alive only because her doctor went to a Folkman lecture at a time when specialists had tried every treatment they knew but failed to halt her tumor's growth.
5_19	0.089145533	In a telephone interview Monday, Kalesnik said she was in constant and excruciating pain, incontinent, and her legs were increasingly numb as the tumor grew.
5_20	0.097671109	Kalesnik's doctor got in touch with Folkman and eventually prescribed interferon alpha, an infection-fighting substance that is a weak angiogenesis inhibitor.
5_21	0.084261996	It is also effective in blocking a substance some tumors secrete, which signal the body to grow more blood vessels.
5_22	0.094726317	Kalesnik's tumor, called a giant cell tumor, was of a type that doesn't spread through the body but kills through sheer size.
5_23	0.10499016	Folkman prescribed nightly injections of interferon alpha but it wasn't until three months had passed that doctors observed that the tumor seemed to have stabilized.
5_24	0.091708921	``It was the first time it had done something other than grow,'' said Kalesnik, who is taking a break from her freshman year at the University of Vermont.
5_25	0.10062601	Over the next 18 months, the tumor shrank by about 80 percent, and Folkman believes she may be able to stop taking the drug within a few months.
5_26	0.092700927	Because the anti-angiogenesis drugs work slowly, in small doses over along periods of time, Folkman said the standard way of conducting initial clinical trials may not be appropriate.
5_27	0.1037252	In other words, angiogenesis inhibitors might be thought not to be effective against tumors if they grow despite treatment, but treating for longer periods might eventually rein in the cancer, he said.
5_28	0.089006574	Interferon has also saved many children with life threatening growths, called hemangiomas.
5_29	0.093036612	Folkman showed slides of infants with enormous, disfiguring tumors that are made of thousands of blood vessels.
5_30	0.093366906	These life-threatening growths, which also produce substances that tell the body to create more blood vessels, also responded well to interferon treatment, he said.
5_31	0.055087276	Previously, no other anticancer treatment had worked.
5_32	0.090304902	Folkman said about 40 reports have been disclosed on tests of angiogenesis inhibitors in cancer.
5_33	0.08025621	Most have been inconclusive but some show promise that will be explored in wider testing .

7_5	0.088061083	Until now, people who suffer inflammation of nerves in the eye, spinal cord or lower brain --indications that MS might be developing -- have not been diagnosed with the autoimmune disorder, let alone treated.
7_6	0.064882598	The diagnosis only follows a second flare-up elsewhere in the central nervous system.
7_7	0.11017442	However, researchers at the State University of New York School of Medicine at Buffalo and about 50 other U.S. and Canadian sites concluded that giving patients a drug called interferon beta-1a within weeks of the first nerve inflammation cut the likelihood of developing MS symptoms within three years by 44 percent.
7_8	0.17462708	Only one-third of patients who gave themselves weekly thigh injections of the drug developed MS within three years, compared with half the patients who injected a harmless substance.
7_9	0.088059474	Dr. Stephen Reingold, vice president for research programs at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, said the findings will push doctors to promptly order magnetic resonance imaging in patients with an initial nerve flare-up.
7_10	0.094110708	If brain lesions --scarring that indicates past inflammation -- are spotted during the MRI, Reingold said, ''it should encourage treatment with this interferon''.
7_11	0.090831702	In multiple sclerosis, the body's immune system goes awry and attacks the nerves and brain, slowly stripping away the protective ''insulation'' coating nerve fibers.
7_12	0.097654546	That damage builds up over years to cause muscle weakness or paralysis, fatigue, dim or blurred vision, memory loss and other problems with thinking.

7_14	0.11817637	Along with giving patients steroids to reduce inflammation during each attack, doctors have offered three drugs that reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and slow the progression of the disease.
7_15	0.12357674	One of them, interferon beta-1a, known by the brand name Avonex, is a genetically engineered replica of a naturally occurring human protein, said the lead researcher, Dr.
7_16	0.092636957	Lawrence Jacobs, professor of neurology at SUNY-Buffalo and head of neurology at Buffalo General Hospital.
7_17	0.077851635	It works by reducing inflammation and quieting down the overactive immune system.
7_18	0.097603474	Along with delaying the onset of MS, Avonex cut the number of new or actively inflamed lesions detected by MRIs by more than half, compared with patients in the comparison group.
7_19	0.094002368	It also cut the total volume of such lesions in the nervous system by 91 percent over the comparison patients, Jacobs said.
7_20	0.083089907	European researchers recently came up with a similar finding on Avonex's effects when it is used early.
7_21	0.089125405	The 383 people in the latest study had suffered an initial nerve flare-up and had at least two brain lesions detected by an MRI, Jacobs said.
7_22	0.095012132	Until MRIs recently enabled doctors to see inside live brains, they would not begin treatment for MS until the second nerve flare-up confirmed the diagnosis; in about half the patients, something else, such as infection, caused the initial inflammation.
7_23	0.094777071	''In the meantime, half of them have lesions in the brain that are smoldering and doing further damage,'' Jacobs said.
7_24	0.089312212	About 350,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, and one-fifth of them are in this group with ''silent'' brain damage who could be helped by aggressive treatment.
7_25	0.086709286	Leist said its price tag of about $10,000 annually could limit use.
7_26	0.10721343	He also said that patients need to be followed for longer than three years to determine how long they need the interferon treatment and that other MS drugs should be studied to determine if there are similar benefits when given earlier.

15_0	0.19595891	HOUSTON _ In a move that could save millions of dollars, health-care contractors for the Texas prison system are purchasing a drug used to treat hepatitis C from a small Pennsylvania pharmacy rather than from a pharmaceutical company whose marketing of the drug has been controversial.
15_1	0.13762062	Starting this week, the prison system's health maintenance organization will purchase the drug, called Ribavirin, from Fisher's Specialty Pharmacy Services in Pittsburgh, said Dr.
15_2	0.086365098	Jason Calhoun, the HMO's medical director.
15_3	0.31418301	Ribavirin is one of two components of a combination therapy approved last year by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of hepatitis C.
15_4	0.14760849	Prison system health-care officials decided in June to begin treating prisoners with the combination therapy after a study showed that 29 percent of the state's inmates, or about 42,000 prisoners, were infected with the potentially lethal liver virus.
15_5	0.11625659	Although many of those prisoners would not be candidates for treatment for various reasons, officials have expressed concern that the high costs of the two drugs could have a serious impact on the prison health-care budget.
15_6	0.2101281	Until recently, Ribavirin was available for treatment of hepatitis C only as part of a kit marketed by Schering-Plough Corp.

15_9	0.11715295	For a standard one-year course of treatment, the retail cost of the two drugs is almost $18,000 per patient, although Calhoun said the prison system was purchasing Rebetron for about $14,700.
15_10	0.1139642	By obtaining the Ribavirin from Fisher's and the interferon from another supplier, the prison system will reduce the cost of the combination therapy to about $5,000 per patient, Calhoun said.
15_11	0.092246486	``That means we can treat more than twice as many patients for the same cost,'' he said.
15_12	0.13063259	Some doctors and patient groups have criticized Schering-Plough for refusing to ``unbundle'' the two drugs, marketed as a product called Rebetron, so that patients could use Ribavirin with another brand of interferon.

15_14	0.093500223	Then in July, Fisher's began ``compounding'' Ribavirin _ obtaining it from an overseas supplier and packing it into capsules, then selling it to patients based on a doctor's prescription.
15_15	0.12525176	The pharmacy is charging $225 for a month's supply, compared to $1,040 per month when the drug is purchased as part of the Schering-Plough kit.
15_16	0.10846028	Calhoun said only about 20 Texas prison inmates are receiving combination therapy, but that the lower costs will make it possible to provide the treatment to many more.
15_17	0.11289538	Bob Consalvo, a spokesman for Schering-Plough, said the compounded Ribavirin that Fisher's is selling has not been subjected to the rigorous tests necessary to demonstrate that it is safe and effective in combination with interferon.

15_19	0.1251205	Calhoun said liver specialists at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, one of the partners in the prison system's managed health-care contract, said tests have established that the drug supplied by Fisher's is identical to Schering-Plough's version of Ribavirin.
15_20	0.094204655	Don Kerrish, a co-owner of Fisher's, said the pharmacy began looking for alternative ways to supply patients with Ribavirin after realizing that many patients, including some with health insurance, were unable to afford the Rebetron kit.

16_16	0.13088972	A Schering-Plough spokesman, Robert Consalvo, said Rebetron is sold in this way because ribavirin has been approved for use only in combination with Schering's brand of interferon.
16_17	0.12522712	But some patients say that their doctors would like to prescribe ribavirin with another brand of interferon.
16_18	0.12515825	And they accuse Schering of bundling the products in order to maintain the high price of the drugs and compel patients to use its interferon.

18_23	0.068214158	of Madison, N.J., is needlessly alarming Americans about the disease in its advertising.
18_24	0.1401824	Hepatitis C is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood.

18_26	0.076072656	Before the test for the virus came into use, transfusions were the main route of transmission.
18_27	0.079997948	Since then, the number of new infections has plummeted.
18_28	0.10106153	But Schering has called the disease an epidemic and has featured on its Web site illustrations of people with the hideously yellow eyes of jaundice, a symptom of severe liver disease.
18_29	0.10392933	``To put it bluntly,'' the ads say, ``every living, breathing human being can get hepatitis C _ even you''.
18_30	0.080055069	The Lancet, a British medical journal, says the advertising campaign has ``breached the public trust''.
18_31	0.1481574	But in a telephone interview, Robert Consalvo, a spokesman for Schering, said the word ``epidemic'' was reasonable, given that hepatitis C infects 4 million Americans and is the leading blood-borne infection in the nation.
18_32	0.11509016	Dr. Leonard Seeff, a senior scientist for hepatitis C research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Diseases, said, ``The inference from the word `epidemic' is that people are getting infected like crazy, and that's not so''.
18_33	0.1214729	Seeff said he worried that fears about the disease, and the pressure to test and treat everyone, would lead people infected with the virus to take expensive drugs with potentially serious side effects, whether they need them or not.
18_34	0.19349891	He said more than 80 percent of those infected with the virus ``will survive with no disease whatsoever''.
18_35	0.11531317	But he added that people with the virus must never drink alcohol, because it accelerates liver damage from the infection.
18_36	0.13705472	Consalvo said Schering scientists believe that the earlier patients start treatment, the better their chances of getting rid of the virus.
18_37	0.12502894	Dr. Jay Hoofnagle, director of the division of digestive diseases and nutrition at the National Institutes of Health, said: ``There's no epidemic going on now of hepatitis C.
18_38	0.10824165	New cases have fallen precipitously since the discovery of the virus.
18_39	0.092985557	The epidemic, if it occurred, occurred during the '60s and '70s, when there was a lot of experimentation with drugs, and the virus got into the population that donated blood.

18_41	0.10642427	Because some of those people will fall ill, a substantial increase is expected in the demand for liver transplants, though donor organs are already in short supply.
18_42	0.088908852	Hepatitis deaths are also expected to increase, possibly doubling or tripling to 20,000 or 30,000 a year within a decade or so.
18_43	0.092337116	But the number of deaths will probably peak and then decline again, because of the decline in new infections, Seeff said.
18_44	0.096773947	According to a CDC report issued in October, there were an estimated 230,000 new infections each year through the 1980s.
18_45	0.095994902	By 1996, the figure had dropped to 36,000.
18_46	0.12447502	Today, the most common means of transmission is the sharing of needles by drug users, which accounts for 60 percent of new infections in the United States.
18_47	0.14548327	Among those who have injected drugs for five years, 90 percent are thought to be infected.
18_48	0.1891844	The origin of the remaining 40 percent of infections is less clear.

18_50	0.085962262	Another 10 percent are thought to have been infected while working at a hospital, undergoing hemodialysis for kidney failure, during birth, or by sharing a toothbrush or razor or being exposed in some other way to infected blood.

18_52	0.10386637	Despite widespread warnings about tattooing and body piercing _ and the common-sense assumption that dirty instruments could spread the virus _ the CDC says there is no evidence linking those practices to the disease in the United States.
18_53	0.10187532	Similarly, many doctors suspect that people can transmit the virus by sharing straws used to inhale cocaine, but researchers are not sure whether that has occurred.
18_54	0.095628653	Mrs. Buchanan said she belongs to the ``no explanation'' group, having never received a transfusion or taken drugs.

18_56	0.068873163	In 1995, when she first learned she was infected, Mrs.
18_57	0.26813661	Buchanan enrolled in a study that provided six months of treatment with Schering-Plough's version of the drug interferon, which eliminates the virus in 10 to 20 percent of patients.
18_58	0.10264419	But half of patients do not respond to interferon at all, and Mrs.

18_60	0.247676	At the time, interferon was the only treatment available.
18_61	0.23781685	In June, a new treatment was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, a combination therapy that paired interferon with the antiviral drug ribavirin.
18_62	0.16616629	The combination, Rebetron, made by Schering-Plough, reduced the virus to undetectable levels in about twice as many patients as interferon did.

18_65	0.059761993	Buchanan wanted to try the combination treatment.
18_66	0.10566169	But because Schering-Plough's brand of interferon had not worked for her, she hoped to purchase the ribavirin alone and combine it with another form of interferon, a slightly different one made by another company.

18_68	0.059222657	Her doctor agreed it was worth a try.

18_71	0.11040505	Patients could buy Schering's interferon alone, but not ribavirin.
18_72	0.1574921	A company spokesman said the product was packaged that way because there was no approved use for ribavirin except in combination with interferon as a treatment for hepatitis C.
18_73	0.11809024	Because Schering-Plough had the exclusive right to market ribavirin in the United States, there was no other way to buy it.
18_74	0.093998973	Mrs. Buchanan did not want to purchase the entire kit _ a six-month supply costs $6,400 to $8,600 _ just to get the ribavirin.
18_75	0.095820796	A spokesman for Schering said the price of Rebetron reflected the hundreds of millions of dollars it has cost to develop the product.
18_76	0.11466356	The bundling of Rebetron, which might seem a stroke of marketing genius to a drug company, looked like a dangerous precedent to people with hepatitis C.
18_77	0.044124534	Many, like Mrs.
18_78	0.097357068	Buchanan, wanted to mix ribavirin with another company's interferon, and some, particularly people who had received liver transplants, needed smaller doses of interferon than the kit provided, but would be forced to throw away the extra medication because it was perishable.

19_0	0.25691242	OTTAWA, November 20 (Xinhua) --People infected with hepatitis C may have a better chance of a cure after researchers in Canada discovered a new combination of drugs to treat the disease.
19_1	0.23633869	According to this week's New England Journal of Medicine, six months after treatment, patients who received the two-drug combination were more likely to be free of hepatitis C than they would be if they accepted the traditional drug treatment of interferon.

19_6	0.19496536	The traditional drug, interferon, approved in Canada in 1991, has helped in 40 percent of the cases, but the benefits are generally not long lasting as less than 15 percent of the patients achieve complete remission after the treatment.

23_0	0.20393902	WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) --U.S. doctors said that a combination of two virus-fighting drugs has proved considerably more effective against chronic hepatitis C infections than the standard single medicine, said the Washington Post.
23_1	0.28350389	In the United States nearly 4 million people are believed to have hepatitis C, with about 10,000 deaths from the disease each year.
23_2	0.3611856	The virus is the leading cause of chronic liver disease.
23_3	0.19510334	For the time being interferon is the only treatment.
23_4	0.28580648	Typically only 15 percent to 20 percent of patients who get interferon are rid of all signs of the virus, and most will eventually relapse.
24_0	0.053400952	BOSTON _ It started with an earache.
24_1	0.098900495	But in a scenario every parent fears, 5-year-old Jennifer LaChance's problem eventually proved to be a large, aggressive tumor in her jaw.
24_2	0.095423797	Jennifer's tumor technically was not cancer, yet it was so aggressive and resistant to standard treatment that it was almost as menacing.
24_3	0.080053709	Laced with a dense web of blood vessels that fed its growth, the tumor kept coming back within months after surgeons twice removed it.
24_4	0.072830911	At its biggest, the tumor kept her from closing her mouth, and her teeth were pushed out of place.
24_5	0.081908104	Surgeons resorted to removing half her lower jaw in hopes of getting it all, but still the tumor grew back.
24_6	0.083872587	``That was a tough time for us,'' said her mother of the period in 1994.
24_7	0.066961789	``We were thinking, now what''?
24_8	0.085207534	Radiation was one fallback treatment, but doctors feared it would stunt growth in one side of Jennifer's face while the other side grew normally.
24_9	0.052923885	Faced with this dilemma, their oral surgeon, Dr.
24_10	0.048137495	Leonard Kaban of Massachusetts General Hospital, consulted Dr.
24_11	0.09458873	Judah Folkman, head of the surgical research lab at Children's Hospital in Boston.
24_12	0.083306014	Folkman had pioneered the use of drugs that can treat tumors rich in blood vessels, called hemangiomas, in children by cutting off the ``private blood supply'' the tumors recruit from nearby tissues.
24_13	0.091346408	In a paper being published Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics, Folkman, Kaban, and colleagues describe how the tumor was finally beaten with a yearlong regimen of a drug, interferon alfa-2a, that knocked out the tumor's ability to recruit new blood vessels.
24_14	0.083393896	Folkman has discussed the case to rapt audiences at medical meetings, but had not previously identified Jennifer.
24_15	0.08541334	What broke the treatment impasse was Folkman's suggestion that Jennifer's blood be tested for the presence of a protein called basic fibroblast growth factor (basic FGF).
24_16	0.087690686	He suspected that Jennifer's tumor might be secreting FGF, a so-called angiogenic factor that the tumor puts out as a signal for nearby tissues to sprout new vessels to feed it.
24_17	0.087246574	And, Folkman knew, recent research had shown that interferon alpha, made by the body's immune system, could shut down overproduction of FGF.
24_18	0.06600067	The test showed that Folkman was right.
24_19	0.077708998	Her blood contained many times the normal amount of FGF.
24_20	0.094156652	``That was exciting, because now we had a treatment that could potentially help her'' without having the drastic side effects of radiation therapy, Kaban said Monday.
24_21	0.10470741	Folkman reasoned, ``You could give interferon alpha at a low dose every day'' without causing the side effects it can trigger in large doses.
24_22	0.093698325	``We started giving her small injections at night, and by four weeks'' the tumor was gone, he said.
24_23	0.093087042	Jennifer had few side effects, except early in the treatment when she had hallucinations ``and saw gummy bears running around the house,'' said her mother.
24_24	0.11248853	The doctors were gratified to see that as the interferon treatment progressed and the tumor shrank, Jennifer's blood levels of FGF fell.
24_25	0.098847883	That was strong evidence that the interferon was shrinking the tumor by shutting off its FGF signals in search of new blood vessels.
24_26	0.10536334	Twice during the year of treatment the doses had to be raised because the tumor was coming back, but both times it worked.
24_27	0.10280039	Tuesday, Jennifer is 9.
24_28	0.096951968	The tumor, called a giant-cell tumor, appears to be gone for good, and her missing jawbone has regrown, somewhat to the doctors' surprise.
24_29	0.090419236	Looking at her, says her father, Michael, ``If you didn't know it, you wouldn't think anything was wrong''.
24_30	0.081757068	The LaChances live in Lincoln, R.I.
24_31	0.11123028	It is believed to be the first time that a giant-cell tumor of the jaw has been cured with a drug that inhibits angiogenesis _ the growth of blood vessels that allow a tumor to enlarge and spread.
24_32	0.095415905	Since then, the treatment has been used successfully in about six other cases, says Folkman.
24_33	0.09397981	The half of Jennifer's jaw that had been removed grew back during her year of therapy: whether the interferon was responsible isn't clear, said Kaban.
24_34	0.089725422	She is still missing all her lower teeth on that side, but Kaban said it isn't a major problem and that she can have implants put in when she's older.
24_35	0.088367848	Angiogenesis inhibitors, pioneered by Folkman and his colleagues at Children's Hospital, are in the spotlight because they show enormous promise for treating cancer by starving it of its blood supply.
24_36	0.13714077	Interferon is one of the weaker angiogenesis inhibitors, Folkman says.
24_37	0.078675657	Yet it worked well in Jennifer's case by being given over a long period.
24_38	0.088561991	That's how Folkman believes newer and stronger angiogenesis inhibitors, like the promising drugs endostatin and angiostatin that have not yet been tested in people, may be able to control cancer.
