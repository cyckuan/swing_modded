1_0	0.28259874	The Food and Drug Administration Wednesday approved the expanded use of Rebetron, a treatment already on the market for hepatitis C, a viral infection of the liver that can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure.
1_1	0.23464623	Hepatitis C infects an estimated four million Americans and kills 8,000 to 10,000 a year.
1_2	0.23900818	The disease, spread mainly by dirty needles and exposure to infected blood, is the leading reason for liver transplants.
1_3	0.10506913	Rebetron, made by the Schering-Plough Corp.
1_4	0.30743526	, was approved in June only for patients who had relapsed after taking interferon drugs, the only other approved treatment for the disease.
1_5	0.096066961	The expanded approval now means that Rebetron can also be given to patients who had not taken interferon.
1_6	0.13113801	The Rebetron treatment combines interferon injections with a second anti-viral drug, ribavirin, which is swallowed in capsules.
1_7	0.072572242	A six-month treatment costs $6,400 to $8,600.
1_8	0.076089137	By the end of October, Rebetron sales had totaled $46 million, according to IMS Health, a firm that tracks the pharmaceutical industry.

1_10	0.21721566	It suppresses blood levels of the virus far better than interferon alone.
1_11	0.13721642	But researchers say that not all hepatitis C patients need Rebetron, which can have severe side effects including flulike symptoms, anemia, depression and suicidal behavior.
1_12	0.075649391	It can also cause birth defects.
1_13	0.091355249	The expanded use was approved over the protests of patient advocates, who object to the way Rebetron is being sold.

1_16	0.12949262	A Schering-Plough spokesman, Robert Consalvo, said Rebetron is sold in this way because ribavirin has been approved for use only in combination with Schering's brand of interferon.
1_17	0.13477693	But some patients say that their doctors would like to prescribe ribavirin with another brand of interferon.
1_18	0.11574174	And they accuse Schering of bundling the products in order to maintain the high price of the drugs and compel patients to use its interferon.

2_1	0.10378861	The finding, from an international study halted early because the results were so strong, could help thousands of patients who currently don't get treatment until they have substantial brain or nerve damage.
2_2	0.11290097	''It's a very important finding because it really shows if one starts treatment early on, one can change the fate of a patient,'' delaying or even preventing the onset of the disease, said Dr.
2_3	0.086631074	Thomas Leist, director of the Comprehensive Multiple Sclerosis Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.

2_5	0.081974061	Until now, people who suffer inflammation of nerves in the eye, spinal cord or lower brain --indications that MS might be developing -- have not been diagnosed with the autoimmune disorder, let alone treated.
2_6	0.083265399	The diagnosis only follows a second flare-up elsewhere in the central nervous system.
2_7	0.09942172	However, researchers at the State University of New York School of Medicine at Buffalo and about 50 other U.S. and Canadian sites concluded that giving patients a drug called interferon beta-1a within weeks of the first nerve inflammation cut the likelihood of developing MS symptoms within three years by 44 percent.
2_8	0.16642291	Only one-third of patients who gave themselves weekly thigh injections of the drug developed MS within three years, compared with half the patients who injected a harmless substance.
2_9	0.079458645	Dr. Stephen Reingold, vice president for research programs at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, said the findings will push doctors to promptly order magnetic resonance imaging in patients with an initial nerve flare-up.
2_10	0.083952339	If brain lesions --scarring that indicates past inflammation -- are spotted during the MRI, Reingold said, ''it should encourage treatment with this interferon''.
2_11	0.08623184	In multiple sclerosis, the body's immune system goes awry and attacks the nerves and brain, slowly stripping away the protective ''insulation'' coating nerve fibers.
2_12	0.092952534	That damage builds up over years to cause muscle weakness or paralysis, fatigue, dim or blurred vision, memory loss and other problems with thinking.
2_13	0.089168763	Some people merely suffer mild weakness for decades, while others steadily worsen from repeated attacks.
2_14	0.10315687	Along with giving patients steroids to reduce inflammation during each attack, doctors have offered three drugs that reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and slow the progression of the disease.
2_15	0.10956666	One of them, interferon beta-1a, known by the brand name Avonex, is a genetically engineered replica of a naturally occurring human protein, said the lead researcher, Dr.
2_16	0.099932394	Lawrence Jacobs, professor of neurology at SUNY-Buffalo and head of neurology at Buffalo General Hospital.
2_17	0.089774631	It works by reducing inflammation and quieting down the overactive immune system.
2_18	0.091669216	Along with delaying the onset of MS, Avonex cut the number of new or actively inflamed lesions detected by MRIs by more than half, compared with patients in the comparison group.
2_19	0.09008165	It also cut the total volume of such lesions in the nervous system by 91 percent over the comparison patients, Jacobs said.
2_20	0.08952539	European researchers recently came up with a similar finding on Avonex's effects when it is used early.
2_21	0.088107546	The 383 people in the latest study had suffered an initial nerve flare-up and had at least two brain lesions detected by an MRI, Jacobs said.
2_22	0.090547577	Until MRIs recently enabled doctors to see inside live brains, they would not begin treatment for MS until the second nerve flare-up confirmed the diagnosis; in about half the patients, something else, such as infection, caused the initial inflammation.
2_23	0.096428475	''In the meantime, half of them have lesions in the brain that are smoldering and doing further damage,'' Jacobs said.
2_24	0.086452039	About 350,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, and one-fifth of them are in this group with ''silent'' brain damage who could be helped by aggressive treatment.
2_25	0.098327936	Leist said its price tag of about $10,000 annually could limit use.
2_26	0.098105092	He also said that patients need to be followed for longer than three years to determine how long they need the interferon treatment and that other MS drugs should be studied to determine if there are similar benefits when given earlier.

10_25	0.12665058	Jay Hoofnagle, director of the division of digestive diseases and nutrition at the national institute said they expected that many doctors would prescribe it for all hepatitis C patients, including those who have not taken interferon or who did not respond to it.
10_26	0.10102398	Hoofnagle said data had been presented at medical meetings showing that when the combination was given for one year to people who had never been treated before, the relapse rate was only 20 percent.
10_27	0.10561994	Given the poor response rate with interferon alone, he said, it seems reasonable to go straight to the combination.
10_28	0.13183539	But the drugs can have serious side effects.
10_29	0.093067348	While interferon alone is associated with flulike side effects, ribavirin can cause severe anemia that comes on suddenly, Hoofnagle said, and in people with cardiovascular disease that can touch off a heart attack or stroke.

10_31	0.086484801	Psychiatric problems have also been reported.
10_32	0.19735964	In addition, the interferon component of the treatment causes flulike symptoms.
10_33	0.11647998	Because of the risks of treatment, and its partial success rate, Hoofnagle said, doctors have tried to determine which patients truly need it rather than just giving the drugs to everyone with hepatitis C.
10_34	0.19596962	Only 20 percent to 30 percent of people with chronic infections develop cirrhosis, liver failure or cancer.
10_35	0.095845972	It is impossible to predict just which ones will become severely ill, but medical authorities now recommend treatment only for patients who have detectable viral levels and abnormal results on tests of liver enzymes.

11_12	0.11521028	Brian Klein, an activist with the Hepatitis C Action and Advocacy Council, said Schering-Plough packages the drugs together just to make more money.

12_18	0.11816744	Treatment is generally not recommended for those without signs of liver damage, but regular monitoring is, because in the early stages of infection it is impossible to tell whether the disease will progress.

12_24	0.17819838	Hepatitis C is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood.
12_25	0.07622955	There is no vaccine.
12_26	0.086423122	Before the test for the virus came into use, transfusions were the main route of transmission.
12_27	0.081128531	Since then, the number of new infections has plummeted.
12_28	0.10244172	But Schering has called the disease an epidemic and has featured on its Web site illustrations of people with the hideously yellow eyes of jaundice, a symptom of severe liver disease.
12_29	0.092534776	``To put it bluntly,'' the ads say, ``every living, breathing human being can get hepatitis C _ even you''.
12_30	0.076866988	The Lancet, a British medical journal, says the advertising campaign has ``breached the public trust''.
12_31	0.16174759	But in a telephone interview, Robert Consalvo, a spokesman for Schering, said the word ``epidemic'' was reasonable, given that hepatitis C infects 4 million Americans and is the leading blood-borne infection in the nation.
12_32	0.12201143	Dr. Leonard Seeff, a senior scientist for hepatitis C research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Diseases, said, ``The inference from the word `epidemic' is that people are getting infected like crazy, and that's not so''.
12_33	0.12570629	Seeff said he worried that fears about the disease, and the pressure to test and treat everyone, would lead people infected with the virus to take expensive drugs with potentially serious side effects, whether they need them or not.
12_34	0.18580221	He said more than 80 percent of those infected with the virus ``will survive with no disease whatsoever''.
12_35	0.11635243	But he added that people with the virus must never drink alcohol, because it accelerates liver damage from the infection.
12_36	0.13245838	Consalvo said Schering scientists believe that the earlier patients start treatment, the better their chances of getting rid of the virus.
12_37	0.13286784	Dr. Jay Hoofnagle, director of the division of digestive diseases and nutrition at the National Institutes of Health, said: ``There's no epidemic going on now of hepatitis C.
12_38	0.14322011	New cases have fallen precipitously since the discovery of the virus.
12_39	0.087293853	The epidemic, if it occurred, occurred during the '60s and '70s, when there was a lot of experimentation with drugs, and the virus got into the population that donated blood.
12_40	0.10438742	People infected then are now turning 50 and 60, at which point hepatitis C rears its head''.
12_41	0.09405387	Because some of those people will fall ill, a substantial increase is expected in the demand for liver transplants, though donor organs are already in short supply.
12_42	0.08804229	Hepatitis deaths are also expected to increase, possibly doubling or tripling to 20,000 or 30,000 a year within a decade or so.
12_43	0.092581212	But the number of deaths will probably peak and then decline again, because of the decline in new infections, Seeff said.
12_44	0.086127511	According to a CDC report issued in October, there were an estimated 230,000 new infections each year through the 1980s.
12_45	0.094329907	By 1996, the figure had dropped to 36,000.
12_46	0.13415242	Today, the most common means of transmission is the sharing of needles by drug users, which accounts for 60 percent of new infections in the United States.
12_47	0.12921755	Among those who have injected drugs for five years, 90 percent are thought to be infected.
12_48	0.18598458	The origin of the remaining 40 percent of infections is less clear.
12_49	0.11527842	Although sexual contact does not seem to spread hepatitis C efficiently (unlike the AIDS and hepatitis B viruses), 20 percent of infected people report no other means of exposure.
12_50	0.090400036	Another 10 percent are thought to have been infected while working at a hospital, undergoing hemodialysis for kidney failure, during birth, or by sharing a toothbrush or razor or being exposed in some other way to infected blood.

12_52	0.10684841	Despite widespread warnings about tattooing and body piercing _ and the common-sense assumption that dirty instruments could spread the virus _ the CDC says there is no evidence linking those practices to the disease in the United States.
12_53	0.092236749	Similarly, many doctors suspect that people can transmit the virus by sharing straws used to inhale cocaine, but researchers are not sure whether that has occurred.
12_54	0.089223067	Mrs. Buchanan said she belongs to the ``no explanation'' group, having never received a transfusion or taken drugs.

12_61	0.23391237	In June, a new treatment was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, a combination therapy that paired interferon with the antiviral drug ribavirin.
12_62	0.14207486	The combination, Rebetron, made by Schering-Plough, reduced the virus to undetectable levels in about twice as many patients as interferon did.

12_72	0.14440602	A company spokesman said the product was packaged that way because there was no approved use for ribavirin except in combination with interferon as a treatment for hepatitis C.
12_73	0.11826886	Because Schering-Plough had the exclusive right to market ribavirin in the United States, there was no other way to buy it.

13_0	0.19991507	WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) --U.S. doctors said that a combination of two virus-fighting drugs has proved considerably more effective against chronic hepatitis C infections than the standard single medicine, said the Washington Post.
13_1	0.28620562	In the United States nearly 4 million people are believed to have hepatitis C, with about 10,000 deaths from the disease each year.
13_2	0.44086141	The virus is the leading cause of chronic liver disease.
13_3	0.13289076	For the time being interferon is the only treatment.
13_4	0.26416187	Typically only 15 percent to 20 percent of patients who get interferon are rid of all signs of the virus, and most will eventually relapse.

14_1	0.083049959	Maxygen, a company in Santa Clara, Calif.

14_4	0.075559053	When organisms reproduce sexually, the offspring end up with a mix-and-match set of genes inherited from both parents.
14_5	0.073739421	Maxygen's technique is similar, except the parents are a series of related genes.
14_6	0.075476817	These are cut into pieces, shuffled together and then assembled to form a new genetic generation.
14_7	0.073504462	Some of these daughter genes can manufacture proteins that are much better at certain tasks than nature's originals.
14_8	0.076811468	The best ones can be screened out and shuffled to produce whole lineages of superior descendants, in a process mimicking evolution by natural selection.
14_9	0.080197481	Maxygen's technique was described earlier this year in Nature (vol.
14_10	0.099462054	391, p.
14_11	0.073698258	288). Now its potential is beginning to be realized.
14_12	0.083923533	The parent genes are first broken into fragments by shattering their DNA with ultrasound, or cutting them up with an enzyme called DNAse.
14_13	0.08172526	They are reassembled into daughter genes, comprising fragments from several parents, using a variant of the DNA-building polymerase chain reaction.
14_14	0.083394481	Short template or ``primer'' sequences ensure that the fragments are stitched together in the correct order to produce a functioning gene.
14_15	0.091974428	The daughter genes can then be inserted into bacteria or fungi, where they begin making protein.
14_16	0.085591368	To make superior versions of an industrial enzyme, the identity of which is still secret, Maxygen's scientists isolated genes from 26 microorganisms which each make their own versions of the enzyme.
14_17	0.094242565	Using its system of DNA shuffling, Maxygen made 600 new daughter genes, 77 of which produced superior enzymes.
14_18	0.094133109	Screening showed up variants which functioned better than natural enzymes at high, low or intermediate pH.
14_19	0.092912544	Others were more resistant to solvents or heat.
14_20	0.092277373	``They're all highly significant commercially,'' says Pim Stemmer, Maxygen's vice-president of research.
14_21	0.100169	Maxygen has also shuffled genes that make the 20 known human interferons.
14_22	0.089071002	This time they made 2,000 daughter genes _ and once again, the results were spectacular.
14_23	0.099656444	The best interferon produced by the genes was 285,000 times as potent as interferon alpha-2b, which is marketed as a drug, as measured by its ability to protect cultured cells against a mouse virus.

14_25	0.10848196	Sales of interferon alpha-2b, which is used to treat viral diseases and cancer, pull in $600 million each year for Schering-Plough of Berlin.
14_26	0.093336851	At present the most popular method of coaxing genes into making new versions of proteins is random mutagenesis, in which ultraviolet light or a DNA-disrupting chemical makes genes mutate.
14_27	0.087382039	But most of these mutations are damaging, with typically only 1 percent yielding genes that make improved proteins.
14_28	0.1008346	By comparison, 13 percent of the enzymes Maxygen produced through DNA shuffling were superior.
14_29	0.088419131	``DNA shuffling is a very powerful technology,'' says Andy Ellington of the University of Texas at Austin, who is currently comparing the technique with random mutagenesis.

16_0	0.083116804	BOSTON _ It started with an earache.
16_1	0.093497865	But in a scenario every parent fears, 5-year-old Jennifer LaChance's problem eventually proved to be a large, aggressive tumor in her jaw.
16_2	0.10186502	Jennifer's tumor technically was not cancer, yet it was so aggressive and resistant to standard treatment that it was almost as menacing.
16_3	0.079209237	Laced with a dense web of blood vessels that fed its growth, the tumor kept coming back within months after surgeons twice removed it.
16_4	0.078471056	At its biggest, the tumor kept her from closing her mouth, and her teeth were pushed out of place.
16_5	0.075698456	Surgeons resorted to removing half her lower jaw in hopes of getting it all, but still the tumor grew back.
16_6	0.09208443	``That was a tough time for us,'' said her mother of the period in 1994.
16_7	0.090407968	``We were thinking, now what''?
16_8	0.07485606	Radiation was one fallback treatment, but doctors feared it would stunt growth in one side of Jennifer's face while the other side grew normally.
16_9	0.072923807	Faced with this dilemma, their oral surgeon, Dr.
16_10	0.074456033	Leonard Kaban of Massachusetts General Hospital, consulted Dr.
16_11	0.093453558	Judah Folkman, head of the surgical research lab at Children's Hospital in Boston.
16_12	0.081165337	Folkman had pioneered the use of drugs that can treat tumors rich in blood vessels, called hemangiomas, in children by cutting off the ``private blood supply'' the tumors recruit from nearby tissues.
16_13	0.089050993	In a paper being published Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics, Folkman, Kaban, and colleagues describe how the tumor was finally beaten with a yearlong regimen of a drug, interferon alfa-2a, that knocked out the tumor's ability to recruit new blood vessels.
16_14	0.080634886	Folkman has discussed the case to rapt audiences at medical meetings, but had not previously identified Jennifer.
16_15	0.086110805	What broke the treatment impasse was Folkman's suggestion that Jennifer's blood be tested for the presence of a protein called basic fibroblast growth factor (basic FGF).
16_16	0.087869276	He suspected that Jennifer's tumor might be secreting FGF, a so-called angiogenic factor that the tumor puts out as a signal for nearby tissues to sprout new vessels to feed it.
16_17	0.088967883	And, Folkman knew, recent research had shown that interferon alpha, made by the body's immune system, could shut down overproduction of FGF.
16_18	0.082686534	The test showed that Folkman was right.
16_19	0.088123366	Her blood contained many times the normal amount of FGF.
16_20	0.088072577	``That was exciting, because now we had a treatment that could potentially help her'' without having the drastic side effects of radiation therapy, Kaban said Monday.
16_21	0.095918602	Folkman reasoned, ``You could give interferon alpha at a low dose every day'' without causing the side effects it can trigger in large doses.
16_22	0.089446465	``We started giving her small injections at night, and by four weeks'' the tumor was gone, he said.
16_23	0.090366768	Jennifer had few side effects, except early in the treatment when she had hallucinations ``and saw gummy bears running around the house,'' said her mother.
16_24	0.099835423	The doctors were gratified to see that as the interferon treatment progressed and the tumor shrank, Jennifer's blood levels of FGF fell.
16_25	0.095968681	That was strong evidence that the interferon was shrinking the tumor by shutting off its FGF signals in search of new blood vessels.
16_26	0.10146147	Twice during the year of treatment the doses had to be raised because the tumor was coming back, but both times it worked.
16_27	0.098288938	Tuesday, Jennifer is 9.
16_28	0.090276629	The tumor, called a giant-cell tumor, appears to be gone for good, and her missing jawbone has regrown, somewhat to the doctors' surprise.
16_29	0.091010256	Looking at her, says her father, Michael, ``If you didn't know it, you wouldn't think anything was wrong''.
16_30	0.082966061	The LaChances live in Lincoln, R.I.
16_31	0.10640274	It is believed to be the first time that a giant-cell tumor of the jaw has been cured with a drug that inhibits angiogenesis _ the growth of blood vessels that allow a tumor to enlarge and spread.
16_32	0.10549926	Since then, the treatment has been used successfully in about six other cases, says Folkman.
16_33	0.089356976	The half of Jennifer's jaw that had been removed grew back during her year of therapy: whether the interferon was responsible isn't clear, said Kaban.
16_34	0.089441566	She is still missing all her lower teeth on that side, but Kaban said it isn't a major problem and that she can have implants put in when she's older.
16_35	0.088971923	Angiogenesis inhibitors, pioneered by Folkman and his colleagues at Children's Hospital, are in the spotlight because they show enormous promise for treating cancer by starving it of its blood supply.
16_36	0.15727935	Interferon is one of the weaker angiogenesis inhibitors, Folkman says.
16_37	0.087858666	Yet it worked well in Jennifer's case by being given over a long period.
16_38	0.086927857	That's how Folkman believes newer and stronger angiogenesis inhibitors, like the promising drugs endostatin and angiostatin that have not yet been tested in people, may be able to control cancer.
17_0	0.24162995	OTTAWA, November 20 (Xinhua) --People infected with hepatitis C may have a better chance of a cure after researchers in Canada discovered a new combination of drugs to treat the disease.
17_1	0.22162349	According to this week's New England Journal of Medicine, six months after treatment, patients who received the two-drug combination were more likely to be free of hepatitis C than they would be if they accepted the traditional drug treatment of interferon.
17_2	0.20962258	"This is a major advance in the treatment of hepatitis C," said Morris Sherman, an assistant professor in medicine at the University of Toronto.
17_3	0.10222337	"Prior to these studies the success rate for treatment was somewhere around 15 to 20 percent.
17_4	0.16506483	With these drugs, with the combination, it is now approximately 40 percent".
17_5	0.090524761	The key drug involved --known as ribavirin -- has not been approved for official use in Canada, but it is available throughout the country.
17_6	0.18074394	The traditional drug, interferon, approved in Canada in 1991, has helped in 40 percent of the cases, but the benefits are generally not long lasting as less than 15 percent of the patients achieve complete remission after the treatment.
17_7	0.10687164	As part of an international group of researchers from the United States, Australia, Greece and Canada, Dr.
17_8	0.07788106	Sherman conducted his study with 832 patients in Canada.
17_9	0.18039692	Six months after treatment, 43 percent of those who undergone 48 weeks of combination therapy had undetectable levels of the virus, compared to 19 percent of those on interferon alone.

18_0	0.19746576	The early moments after patients are infected with the feared Ebola virus may be the most important to their survival, researchers report this week in the journal Nature Medicine.
18_1	0.088845862	A French team working in Gabon in West Africa have successfully taken and analyzed blood samples from 11 patients infected during outbreaks in Gabon and the Congo.
18_2	0.08885492	This is in itself a feat because outbreaks have so far only taken place in very remote areas and because those who contract the disease die swiftly.
18_3	0.077183636	Ebola is a rare viral disease, confined to occasional outbreaks in Africa since its first appearance in 1979.
18_4	0.078219275	But this exotic virus gets attention disproportionate to its human toll for two reasons.
18_5	0.11666545	First, the virus kills 70 percent of those it infects, and kills horribly, with the disease advancing from fever to massive bloody hemorrhaging in a space of 10 days.
18_6	0.073831767	Second, researchers worry that Ebola may not remain forever in its remote jungle confines, but may one day break out.
18_7	0.069314631	Led by Dr.

18_9	0.1008019	Leroy of the International Center for Medical Research in Gabon, the team found a striking difference in the first days of the infection between those who would eventually die and those who would survive.
18_10	0.10779646	Of the 11 patients from whom blood was taken, four survived and are now believed immune to further Ebola infection.
18_11	0.080893068	The research focused on the differences between those who lived and those who died.
18_12	0.11541494	They discovered that the immune defenses in the two groups were quite distinct.
18_13	0.084849665	The immune system puts up two general types of defense against invading microbes.
18_14	0.086113358	In one, the humoral system, antibodies identify and latch on to the invading bugs.
18_15	0.097498915	In the other, the cellular system, defenders spot cells that the invading bugs have infected.
18_16	0.091101333	Among the surviving patients, the immune defenses were stable enough to produce a good humoral response, including antibodies to attack the virus, as well as a good cellular response, including a substantial number of ``killer cells'' (or cytotoxic T cells) and modest amounts of interferon, the body's own antiviral substance.
18_17	0.088783601	Thus, there appeared to be a balanced attack from both humoral and cellular defenses.
18_18	0.098275395	These patients were able to clear much of the Ebola out of their blood, then continued to produce both ``killer'' cells and interferon to suppress further multiplication of the viruses.
18_19	0.098118275	By contrast, the immune systems of the majority, those who did not survive the infection, failed to give a balanced defense within the first two to three days after infection.
18_20	0.097348791	They had a poor showing of antibodies, but at the same time apparently produced too much of the cellular kind of defense, as signaled by excessive production of interferon.
18_21	0.096355112	One possibility is that the too-strong response of one part of the immune system may be giving falsely strong signals, thereby passing information that would suppress the other side of the defense.
18_22	0.1371347	Or, possibly, the patient was infected by so much virus that it overwhelmed one half of the immune system's defenses.
18_23	0.087573615	The lack of one kind of defense and excess of another suggests that a good strategy to attack Ebola infection may be to intervene in the body to balance the two kinds of defenses by enhancing one or depressing the other.
18_24	0.083590079	Dr. Philip K.
18_25	0.085903254	Russell, emeritus professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, said the work represented an important step in understanding how Ebola works.
18_26	0.11231831	Dr. Pierre Rollin, of the Special Pathogens Branch at the federal Centers for Disease Control, said the work would help researchers test ideas.
18_27	0.090188833	For example, therapies that would suppress the interferon production and related cellular immune defenses might now be put at the top of the list to try, he said.
18_28	0.096482907	But therapies that used interferon as a treatment might be ruled out.

19_15	0.15683861	In some patients, drugs can make all signs of the virus disappear, but it's unclear how long the effect lasts.
20_0	0.18126051	HOUSTON _ In a move that could save millions of dollars, health-care contractors for the Texas prison system are purchasing a drug used to treat hepatitis C from a small Pennsylvania pharmacy rather than from a pharmaceutical company whose marketing of the drug has been controversial.
20_1	0.13132703	Starting this week, the prison system's health maintenance organization will purchase the drug, called Ribavirin, from Fisher's Specialty Pharmacy Services in Pittsburgh, said Dr.
20_2	0.078274389	Jason Calhoun, the HMO's medical director.
20_3	0.29015927	Ribavirin is one of two components of a combination therapy approved last year by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of hepatitis C.
20_4	0.14011794	Prison system health-care officials decided in June to begin treating prisoners with the combination therapy after a study showed that 29 percent of the state's inmates, or about 42,000 prisoners, were infected with the potentially lethal liver virus.
20_5	0.10040053	Although many of those prisoners would not be candidates for treatment for various reasons, officials have expressed concern that the high costs of the two drugs could have a serious impact on the prison health-care budget.
20_6	0.20342942	Until recently, Ribavirin was available for treatment of hepatitis C only as part of a kit marketed by Schering-Plough Corp.
20_7	0.080931213	, a drug manufacturer based in Madison, N.J.
20_8	0.16361065	The other drug in the kit is Schering-Plough's brand of alpha interferon.
20_9	0.10419167	For a standard one-year course of treatment, the retail cost of the two drugs is almost $18,000 per patient, although Calhoun said the prison system was purchasing Rebetron for about $14,700.
20_10	0.099615002	By obtaining the Ribavirin from Fisher's and the interferon from another supplier, the prison system will reduce the cost of the combination therapy to about $5,000 per patient, Calhoun said.
20_11	0.10613481	``That means we can treat more than twice as many patients for the same cost,'' he said.
20_12	0.12013795	Some doctors and patient groups have criticized Schering-Plough for refusing to ``unbundle'' the two drugs, marketed as a product called Rebetron, so that patients could use Ribavirin with another brand of interferon.
20_13	0.18623631	Schering-Plough responded that the drug had been tested for this purpose only with its brand of interferon.
20_14	0.089706651	Then in July, Fisher's began ``compounding'' Ribavirin _ obtaining it from an overseas supplier and packing it into capsules, then selling it to patients based on a doctor's prescription.
20_15	0.11090477	The pharmacy is charging $225 for a month's supply, compared to $1,040 per month when the drug is purchased as part of the Schering-Plough kit.
20_16	0.097140416	Calhoun said only about 20 Texas prison inmates are receiving combination therapy, but that the lower costs will make it possible to provide the treatment to many more.
20_17	0.10353688	Bob Consalvo, a spokesman for Schering-Plough, said the compounded Ribavirin that Fisher's is selling has not been subjected to the rigorous tests necessary to demonstrate that it is safe and effective in combination with interferon.
20_18	0.092574985	An FDA spokeswoman said the agency could not comment on its response to Schering-Plough's complaint.
20_19	0.11603911	Calhoun said liver specialists at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, one of the partners in the prison system's managed health-care contract, said tests have established that the drug supplied by Fisher's is identical to Schering-Plough's version of Ribavirin.
20_20	0.091874304	Don Kerrish, a co-owner of Fisher's, said the pharmacy began looking for alternative ways to supply patients with Ribavirin after realizing that many patients, including some with health insurance, were unable to afford the Rebetron kit.
20_21	0.096768589	After the patent for Ribavirin expired recently, he said, the pharmacy's lawyers did some research and concluded that compounding the drug would be legal.
20_22	0.088017876	Kerrish also said he was contacted recently by an attorney in the Texas attorney general's office, who told him that the office was ``looking at investigating Schering-Plough'' for possible violations of anti-trust laws.

23_5	0.086644543	That report sent the stock in Maryland-based Entremed Inc.
23_6	0.080932423	, which makes endostatin, into a tailspin.
23_7	0.074956723	Investors have been closely following the development of endostatin and Folkman's progress ever since a scientist predicted in 1998 that Folkman would cure cancer within two years.
23_8	0.07563761	That hasn't happened but the enthusiasm of some investors and scientists has barely been dented as they await results of the endostatin trials.
23_9	0.14203708	Because patients began receiving endostatin in the Boston study in October, two months ahead of the other centers, Folkman seemed to hint Monday that the drug's effectiveness improves over time.
23_10	0.078422173	Folkman, however, does not directly oversee the trials, from which no official data has been reported, and cannot speak publicly about them.
23_11	0.099747021	However, he said Monday ``We are very pleased with the results at the Boston hospital''.
23_12	0.079500828	He also disclosed the results of other cases in which so-called angiogenesis inhibitors, of which endostatin is one, have proved to be powerful cancer fighters.
23_13	0.083526216	Unlike standard cancer drugs that attack tumors directly, angiogenesis inhibitors cut off the tumor's blood supply and slowly strangles them, or at least halts their growth.
23_14	0.090699934	Folkman said Monday that in about 80 cancer patients, mostly children, the drugs destroyed growths that would have killed them.
23_15	0.095375588	``If we'd given up in the first month or two, they wouldn't be around,'' he said.
23_16	0.087974756	One of the most dramatic cases was that of a Vermont teenager who in 1998 had a volleyball-sized pelvic tumor that resisted all therapies.
23_17	0.087829044	She had been ``sent home to die,'' Folkman said, but after months of treatment with an angiogenesis inhibitor, the growth began to shrink and today she is free of cancer.
23_18	0.090202191	The patient, Tonya Kalesnik, of Colchester, may be alive only because her doctor went to a Folkman lecture at a time when specialists had tried every treatment they knew but failed to halt her tumor's growth.
23_19	0.090488841	In a telephone interview Monday, Kalesnik said she was in constant and excruciating pain, incontinent, and her legs were increasingly numb as the tumor grew.
23_20	0.093720941	Kalesnik's doctor got in touch with Folkman and eventually prescribed interferon alpha, an infection-fighting substance that is a weak angiogenesis inhibitor.
23_21	0.090761817	It is also effective in blocking a substance some tumors secrete, which signal the body to grow more blood vessels.
23_22	0.090249273	Kalesnik's tumor, called a giant cell tumor, was of a type that doesn't spread through the body but kills through sheer size.
23_23	0.09914042	Folkman prescribed nightly injections of interferon alpha but it wasn't until three months had passed that doctors observed that the tumor seemed to have stabilized.
23_24	0.089280339	``It was the first time it had done something other than grow,'' said Kalesnik, who is taking a break from her freshman year at the University of Vermont.
23_25	0.09834894	Over the next 18 months, the tumor shrank by about 80 percent, and Folkman believes she may be able to stop taking the drug within a few months.
23_26	0.090389788	Because the anti-angiogenesis drugs work slowly, in small doses over along periods of time, Folkman said the standard way of conducting initial clinical trials may not be appropriate.
23_27	0.095245464	In other words, angiogenesis inhibitors might be thought not to be effective against tumors if they grow despite treatment, but treating for longer periods might eventually rein in the cancer, he said.
23_28	0.0948465	Interferon has also saved many children with life threatening growths, called hemangiomas.
23_29	0.089238781	Folkman showed slides of infants with enormous, disfiguring tumors that are made of thousands of blood vessels.
23_30	0.090327493	These life-threatening growths, which also produce substances that tell the body to create more blood vessels, also responded well to interferon treatment, he said.
23_31	0.080660178	Previously, no other anticancer treatment had worked.
23_32	0.086891678	Folkman said about 40 reports have been disclosed on tests of angiogenesis inhibitors in cancer.
23_33	0.087650431	Most have been inconclusive but some show promise that will be explored in wider testing .

24_2	0.1290474	Little did they know that intravenous drug use, tattoos and body piercing would be an invitation to a slow-growing virus that eventually would become the recently identified hepatitis C.
24_3	0.11099961	Like other forms of hepatitis, the C variety inflames the liver, causing debilitating symptoms or, even more frightening, virtually no symptoms until the disease is on the eve of destruction.

24_9	0.14891187	But it's patients who received blood transfusions before 1992, before testing of the blood supply was refined, who are the target of an intense public-education campaign spearheaded by the office of the U.S. surgeon general, Dr.
24_10	0.087527294	David Satcher.
24_11	0.10243438	Satcher's office has urged organizations such as the American Red Cross, hospitals and blood banks to notify pre-1992 blood recipients and recommend they be tested for hepatitis C.
24_12	0.075020252	Identifying and contacting that population will be a daunting but worthwhile task, doctors say.
24_13	0.084059048	Though critics have questioned the cost-effectiveness of alerting people to a disease that can be treated in less than half of all cases, health-care advocates insist patients have a right to know their health status and that withholding information is disgraceful.

24_18	0.2429627	Only about 5 percent of patients refuse medication, he says.
24_19	0.074845487	Even those who cannot be cured must be informed on how to manage their disease and how to avoid transmitting it.
24_20	0.076043475	They should drink no alcohol, be scrupulous about protecting others from infection and maintain good nutrition.
24_21	0.14101031	How long hepatitis C has been around is anybody's guess.
24_22	0.080803296	It may have its origins in World War II, where unsterile battlefield blood transfusions could have spread the virus.
24_23	0.081927384	First called non-A, non-B hepatitis because its specific virus couldn't be differentiated from other strains, it wasn't identified until 1975.
24_24	0.071473718	A blood test wasn't developed until 1989.
24_25	0.074569919	That blood test remained unreliable until 1992.
24_26	0.094252009	Unlike hepatitis A (transmitted through unsanitary food preparation) and hepatitis B (spread through blood and sexual contact), for which there are vaccines and effective cures, the C strain becomes chronic in 85 percent of cases.
24_27	0.13450105	It is the leading cause of cirrhosis, which scars the liver and inhibits its function.

24_31	0.084322475	Yet HIV has enjoyed much more media and medical attention.
24_32	0.20148682	Doctors who work with hepatitis C patients are dismayed by such inequities.

24_43	0.090848709	Unfortunately, the liver's large capacity allows it to quietly harbor disease for many years without signaling its deterioration.

24_56	0.11491563	Although doctors hesitate to call treatments for hepatitis C ``cures'' _ scattered bits of virus may remain, says Leibowitz of the Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center _ medication does offer some hope.
24_57	0.22483327	Currently, the drug of choice is interferon, which produces remission or suppression of the virus in about 20 percent of cases.
24_58	0.10534452	That means liver enzymes appear normal and the virus cannot be detected.
24_59	0.094911538	Interferon is delivered as self-administered injections three times a week for 12 to 18 months.
