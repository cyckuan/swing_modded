3_12	0.0	Their children play in sports leagues with non-Muslim children, go on field trips with non-Muslim children, meet with non-Muslim home-schoolers, and are inundated with mainstream American culture, they say.
3_13	0.0	``We're not trying to withdraw or create a shell _ that's unrealistic and unfair to the children,'' Beresford said.
3_14	0.0	The challenge, Beresford and other parents say, is communicating Islamic faith, history, and values to their children in the face of the broader and more dominant culture.
3_15	0.03333333333333333	``Muslims are a new, emerging community, and a number of them are not happy with the public-schooling system, either because they feel that the schools are not really teaching their kids right or they object that they are not paying attention to moral issues,'' said Aly Abuzaakouk, executive director of the American Muslim Council, who said education is the top concern of Muslims in America.
3_16	2.2857142857142856	``There is a secular turn in public schooling that Muslim families are not happy with, and some of those who are not able to join Muslim schools do home schooling''.
3_17	0.0	The Muslim home-schooling movement resembles, and in some ways piggybacks on, the wider home-schooling movement popularized by evangelical Christians since the 1980s.
3_18	0.7333333333333333	The Christian home-schoolers cite many of the same reasons as Muslims _ a desire to inculcate their children with values and behavioral norms that are off-limits in public schools.
3_19	1.0	``If a person has a strong belief in the area of religion, they're going to want to pass it on to their children, and the only effective way is to teach them at home,'' said Michael Smith, president of the Home School Legal Defense Association.
3_20	0.8	The organization estimates that 1.7 million American youngsters are now home schooled _ a number contested as too high by some _ and although the majority are thought to be white evangelical Christians with highly educated parents, Smith said his group is seeing rapid growth in home schooling among other religious groups, such as Muslims and Catholics.
3_21	0.92	But for American Muslims _ an ethnically diverse and fast-growing group whose population is estimated to be 6 million to 7 million _ it is not yet clear whether home schooling will be a permanent part of the landscape or a temporary phenomenon until the community builds more private schools.
3_22	0.0	Already there are two Muslim grade schools in Greater Boston, the Al-Hamra Academy in Northborough and the Islamic Academy of New England in Sharon.
3_23	0.6666666666666666	There are no statistics about the numbers of Muslim home-schoolers in this country, but it is clear that most Muslims still send their children to public schools and depend on weekend Islamic schools for religious instruction.
3_24	1.4	Nevertheless, there are several organizations devoted to the topic, including the Muslim Home School Network (www.muslimhomeschool.com), which is hosting a home-schooling convention in Sharon on Saturday and Sunday.
3_25	0.6875	The organization is directed by Cynthia Sulaiman, a mother of four, who started her eldest children in the public schools but then decided to teach her family at home.
3_26	2.909090909090909	Like Sulaiman, Beresford sent her eldest son to public school for a year before deciding to try home schooling.
3_27	1.5714285714285714	``Our local school is quite good, but we felt that because in Islam, you want to integrate religion into all aspects of life, we could achieve that better by home schooling,'' she said.
3_28	0.7142857142857143	Beresford and Sulaiman teach their children at home for some of the same reasons cited by other home-schooling parents: a desire for safety, a concern about the secular nature of public schools, and a hope their children will do better with individual attention.
3_29	0.0	But they have other, less familiar concerns: They want their children to pray five times a day, they want their daughters to be able to cover their heads without fear of teasing, and they don't want boys mixing socially with girls.
3_30	0.0	They teach the basics _ reading, writing, and mathematics _ alongside Islamic history, culture, and religion.
3_31	0.0	Beresford and Sulaiman are both converts to Islam who married immigrants from Islamic countries.
3_32	0.9285714285714286	Scholars say home schooling has been particularly popular among American Muslim families in which at least one parent was born in the United States, perhaps because the home-schooling phenomenon is most familiar to Americans, and perhaps because of a concern that children of converts are thought to be less likely to retain their parents' chosen faith.
3_33	0.0	``There are more parents who want to do it, but feel they are not equipped, and those who are equipped are often African-American or Euro-American Muslims,'' said Shabbir Mansuri, executive director of the Council on Islamic Education, a California-based organization that works to improve and expand the depiction of Islam and Muslims in textbooks.
3_34	1.1578947368421053	Variations of home schooling, such as groups of families teaching their children together, have been popular particularly among African-American Muslims, said Ilyas Ba-Yunus, a sociologist at State University of New York at Cortland.
3_35	0.0	``Many of these people are new converts who are very unhappy with the drugs and guns and dating and sex that they consider to be un-Islamic,'' Ba-Yunus said.
3_36	0.0	``They think their own teaching at home will be morally strong, and that they will be able to counter whatever immoral things are happening in school.

9_2	0.7619047619047619	Bush of Texas faced an audience of more than 1,600 home schoolers Friday, offering encouragement but stopping short of supporting tax credits or vouchers for parents who choose to bypass public schools.
9_3	1.1578947368421053	``In Texas, we think home schooling is something to respected and something to be protected,'' the Republican presidential front-runner told the first national meeting of the Virginia-based Home School Legal Defense Association.
9_4	0.0	``Respecting the energy and commitment of loving mothers and loving fathers.
9_5	0.0	Protecting them from the interference of government''.
9_6	0.0	That line got rousing applause from the audience, many of whose members are fearful that any government help might come with strings, such as testing and curriculum requirements.
9_7	0.0	The association supports tax credits, but not vouchers, said Michael Smith, the group's vice-president.
9_8	1.4	The best thing Bush could say about home schooling is ``nothing,'' said Bob Mann, 42, of New Jersey, who home-schools his five children.
9_9	1.9090909090909092	``The state of New Jersey has no laws regarding home schooling, and I would like to keep it that way,'' he said.

9_11	0.6875	Earlier this month, he proposed a limited program of vouchers _ giving parents tax money for educational choices other than public schools _ that some Republicans said doesn't go far enough.
9_12	0.0	And he has proposed placing the federal Head Start program under the U.S.
9_13	0.0	Department of Education, expanding a federal agency that is anathema to many conservatives.
9_14	0.0	On Friday, Bush delivered a variation of his stump speech designed neither to alienate nor appease an audience unsure about whether his ``compassionate conservative'' message is conservative enough for them.

11_0	0.25925925925925924	BOSTON _ In a major victory for home schoolers that also serves as a warning to school districts statewide, Massachusetts' highest court Wednesday ruled that Lynn school officials have no right to visit parent's homes to see how they teach their children.
11_1	0.24242424242424243	Capping a seven-year lawsuit over parents' rights to teach children any way they choose, the ruling comes at a critical time for home schoolers: As their numbers have quadrupled in the last decade to an estimated 4,500 statewide, hundreds of families are struggling to understand their rights in vaguely written laws and court rulings.
11_2	0.0	Lynn will not appeal the decision and the new school superintendent said Wednesday the district had already begun to revamp the policy before the Supreme Judicial Court ruled.
11_3	0.0	``Still, this ruling definitely clears the air for school districts,'' said Lynn superintendent James Mazareas, who took office in August.
11_4	0.0	The district originally pursued the case because ``Six or seven years ago this was uncharted territory,'' he said.
11_5	0.23809523809523808	The case stretches back to 1991, when Stephen and Lois Pustell filed a suit against the Lynn School Committee because the board required home schoolers to be periodically observed by school officials.
11_6	0.0	In 1994, Michael and Virginia Brunelle faced criminal charges in the same city when they objected to home visits and refused to submit their educational plans to Lynn officials.
11_7	0.0	While the criminal charges were dropped, the Brunelles, Pustells and their attorneys challenged the validity of Lynn's policy first in the federal courts and then in the state courts during the past three years.
11_8	0.2	Meanwhile, both couples, each with five children, continued teaching their children at home rather than sending them to school.
11_9	0.0	``We're just thrilled with the decision,'' said Stephen Pustell, 44, a computer analyst, Wednesday.
11_10	0.0	The city's job ``is to know that children are being educated, not to educate them''.

23_2	0.0	They won't drink.
23_3	0.0	They won't date, unless their parents ``are informed of the potential romance'' and approve.
23_4	0.0	All of which will set the college apart when it opens next fall.
23_5	0.09090909090909091	Yet what is drawing national attention to the school is not its strict code of conduct, but its future student body.
23_6	0.0	Almost every undergraduate entering Patrick Henry College will have been home-schooled.
23_7	0.0	That makes them graduates of one of the most controversial movements in American education, one that gained steam in the 1980s amid a series of legal battles pitting parents against the government.
23_8	0.23529411764705882	Now that the first wave of the country's 1.5 million home-schooled children is reaching college age, there is a new debate: When, and how, should they be thrust into the ``real world''?
23_9	0.36363636363636365	Critics of home-schooling have long argued children need exposure to the outside world and peers to grow into well-rounded adults.
23_10	0.0	And home-schoolers freely admit their aim is to ``let children be children'' by sheltering them from the harsh realities and temptations of the modern world.
23_11	0.0	But when do children stop being children?
23_12	0.0	How do they make that transition?
23_13	0.42857142857142855	And what kind of adult lives will home-schooled children be prepared to lead?
23_14	0.0	Officials at Patrick Henry College, believed to be the first ever to target home-schoolers, think they have found an answer in their curriculum: The only major for incoming freshmen will be government.
23_15	0.0	In addition to their classes, students will write legislative papers for US congressmen, which they hope will then be used as actual guides for congressional staffers.
23_16	0.0	Students will also participate in Capitol Hill ``apprenticeships,'' all to train them for a future in the most unsheltered of careers: politics.
23_17	0.07692307692307693	``If the real world means Capitol Hill, they'll be as prepared as anyone,'' said the school's founder, Michael P.
23_18	0.0	Farris, who has home-schooled his 10 children, the oldest of whom is 24.
23_19	0.0	``If it is defined as the college bar scene?
23_20	0.0	No, they're not going to be prepared for that a bit.
23_21	0.0	It would be fair to say we're skipping one phase of wildness.
23_22	0.0	We're skipping them straight into adulthood''.
23_23	0.23076923076923078	This intertwining of politics and home-schooled students is bound to draw notice, especially since the home-schooling movement is so often depicted as antigovernment.
23_24	1.4375	In the last 19 years advocates for home schooling have filed hundreds of lawsuits in more than 40 states, according to the Home School Legal Defense Association.
23_25	0.0	The purpose of the litigation, in most cases, has been to get government out of citizens' educational lives.
23_26	0.0	But to Farris and his colleagues, the vision is entirely consistent.
23_27	0.0	Patrick Henry College will be a breeding ground for the next generation of crusaders _ who may abstain from partying with the rest of the world, but will still work to change it.
23_28	0.0	The school's promotional material states the goal: ``Eventually, these highly-qualified public servants will themselves begin to run for elective office and will have the opportunity to lead our nation back to its constitutional roots''.
23_29	0.0	Those roots do not exclude religion, in Farris's view, and fundamentalist Christianity is clearly at the core of what the college hopes to stand for.
23_30	0.0	Students will attend daily chapel.
23_31	0.0	They must ``show evidence of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ,'' the school pamphlet says, and must subscribe to a seven-point statement of faith that includes believing in the literal resurrection of Christ.
23_32	0.0	Emblazoned on the blue-and-white folders being distributed to prospective students is a school motto: ``For Christ &AMP; For Liberty''.
23_33	0.0	Farris's vision for student relationships is also closely tied to faith.
23_34	0.0	He hopes to develop a ``practice of courtship,'' in which students ``engage in the activity of seriously looking for God's partner in life''.
23_35	0.0	Students who find themselves attracted to one another will be required to call their parents to discuss it.
23_36	0.0	The role of parents, Farris said, is ``to help them make a wise choice of whether they will marry''.
23_37	0.0	Campus life is still just a dream, of course.
23_38	0.0	The main hall is little more than a steel frame in the middle of a muddy field, surrounded by cranes and construction material.
23_39	0.0	The administrators, including Farris, work out of a cluster of townhouses in a subdivision of this tiny town in western Loudon County, whose other inhabitants include a Dunkin' Donuts and a McDonald's along a two-lane main road.
23_40	0.0	But, if all goes well, the state higher education council of Virginia will recommend Patrick Henry be approved to enroll students, a final step toward opening its doors in 2000.
23_41	0.0	Farris said he hopes to send out applications as early as this week.
23_42	0.0	And he is in the midst of fund-raising to help pay the school's $50 million in long-term costs; since June, he said he has raised close to $1.5 million.
23_43	0.0	Among those who have helped is the Republican Governor of Virginia, Jim Gilmore, who signed copies of a Patrick Henry biography at a party to raise funds, Farris said.
23_44	0.0	There are other political connections, too: Janet Ashcroft, the wife of Republican Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, is on the school's board of trustees.
23_45	0.0	And Farris considers Representative Steve Largent, an influential Republican from Oklahoma, a ``good friend''.
23_46	0.0	Those political ties will become increasingly important if the apprenticeship system is put into practice, as some of the 100 to 140 students begin to write legislative papers for congressmen.
23_47	0.0	But there are those who wonder whether integrating home-schooled, and to some degree ``home-colleged'', students into the political culture of Capitol Hill will be as easy or productive as Farris makes it sound.
23_48	0.0	``Their experience is of being cut off, to a large extent, from people with different values and different backgrounds,'' said Mark Rozell, a professor of politics at Catholic University.
23_49	0.0	``Once anyone goes into politics, to be successful it's necessary to know how to converse with different people and to know how to work effectively with them''.
23_50	0.0	But to Brad Jacob, the school's provost, that is exactly why schools like Patrick Henry are in demand.
23_51	2.4444444444444446	``We see this college as a transition from the home, and from a home school, into the real world of living on your own,'' he said.
23_52	0.0	``We don't think it's necessary to make that transition by dumping an 18-year-old cold turkey on a college campus.
23_53	0.0	We're trying to make that transition in a controlled way.''
24_0	0.0	My daughter isn't ready for kindergarten yet.
24_1	0.0	Which is good, because neither am I.
24_2	0.0	The biggest question _ public vs.
24_3	0.0	private education _ quickly breaks into myriad other questions, all crucial and all confusing.
24_4	0.0	As dissatisfaction with the state of American education grows, the alternatives also grow, creating a plethora of hard-to-evaluate choices.
24_5	0.0	Public education has deep roots in our society.
24_6	0.44	A vast empire involving almost 50 million young people, 88,000 schools and trillions of dollars, public schools long have been the social balancing wheel of society, fostering diverse interests, dreams and goals.
24_7	0.0	Americans stood by public education through integration in the 1960s, the burgeoning magnet and alternative schools in the 1970s and the draconian financial cuts of the 1980s.
24_8	0.0	But attitudes have shifted in the 1990s.
24_9	0.07142857142857142	In a recent study titled ``Where Connoisseurs Send Their Children to School,'' Denis Doyle, educational analyst and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, reported that urban public-school teachers are more likely to send their children to private schools.
24_10	0.25	In Jersey City, N.J., 50.3 percent choose private schools.
24_11	0.0	In San Francisco, it's 36.7 percent, Cleveland is at 39.7 percent and Chicago at 36.3 percent.
24_12	3.0	``And let's not forget home schooling,'' Doyle says.
24_13	0.0	``It's the fastest-growing trend in the country''.
24_14	0.0	Brenda and Tommy Teepell of Baton Rouge, La.
24_15	2.3333333333333335	, have home schooled their four sons, now ages 23, 22, 17 and 14.
24_16	0.0	The boys were in a Christian school when the Teepells decided to make the change.
24_17	0.1111111111111111	``I wanted more of our family values to be part of our children's lives,'' she says.
24_18	0.0	``The boys participated in plenty of outside activities, such as sports and the 4-H Club.
24_19	0.0	``Life simply turned into a big classroom,'' she adds.
24_20	0.0	``If we went shopping, the boys calculated prices.
24_21	0.0	Traveling was a rich history lesson.
24_22	0.1111111111111111	The boys matured faster than their peers, and are extremely independent young men''.
24_23	1.6923076923076923	Approximately 1.2 million children are home schooled, according to the National Home Education Research Institute in Salem, Ore.
24_24	0.0	Catholic schools, because of their affordability and diversity, remain a leading private option for middle-class parents.
24_25	0.0	And parochial schools score high academically.
24_26	0.0	Between 1993 and 1996, parochial enrollment increased by almost 590,000, according to the Washington-based National Catholic Educational Association.
24_27	0.0	Private institutions are flourishing across the country.
24_28	0.09523809523809523	The Hudson Institute says there are 28,000 private schools nationwide, with 5.9 million children enrolled, and that private enrollment has risen faster than public for the past five years.
24_29	0.0	Clearly, private education is not everyone's favorite option.
24_30	0.0	Many parents and educators insist that public education is the cornerstone of democracy.
24_31	0.0	``Education is not just academics _ it's socialization, real America with all its glory and depravity,'' says Michael Castleman, a public-school advocate and an author who specializes in health.
24_32	0.7333333333333333	``It's a tremendous commitment,'' adds Castleman, whose two children survived a difficult search for a public school in San Francisco.
24_33	0.0	San Francisco has 15 alternative sites and 59 regular elementary schools.
24_34	0.0	Castleman and his wife, Anne, along with several hundred hopeful families, opted for an alternative program.
24_35	0.0	The couple investigated a dozen schools, keenly aware that their chance of obtaining a spot in one of the city's five most sought-after alternatives was slim.
24_36	0.0	San Francisco has open enrollment, a process that offers a modicum of choice: An application places the child's name in a lottery.
24_37	0.0	Only a handful of families get into their schools of choice, but the lottery takes certain ZIP codes, a previously enrolled sibling and ethnic balance into account.
24_38	0.125	In their search, the Castlemans uncovered an alternative school that many of their peers had overlooked.
24_39	0.0	``San Francisco Community Alternative School sits in the middle of San Francisco's working-class stew,'' Castleman says.
24_40	0.0	``It's ethnically and economically diverse.
24_41	0.0	It's not everybody's first choice, due to location and no after-school care.
24_42	0.0	We were delighted to receive our letter of acceptance without having to contend with the arduous appeal process''.
24_43	0.0	Ginny Gjedsted and her husband, Al, did not fare well in the open-enrollment lottery.
24_44	0.0	They also were reluctant to gamble on an appeal, so they enrolled their two daughters in an ecclesiastical girls' school.
24_45	0.0	Within a year, however, they moved them to a private, secular, coed school.
24_46	0.0	``The rhetoric and the reality of the prestigious girls' institution didn't match,'' Gjedsted says.
24_47	0.0	By the time the Gjedsteds' third child entered preschool, tuition for three hovered around $30,000.
24_48	0.0	``It's a hefty chunk of our salaries, but I can't quibble with the education,'' she says.

24_50	0.5	Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs and author of ``Charter Schools: Creating Hope and Opportunity in American Education'' (Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1996), thinks public schools have failed to help many youngsters reach their potential.
24_51	0.08333333333333333	Nathan, who also co-founded the charter-school movement, says the cards are stacked against children's being steered toward their highest potential.
24_52	0.0	``Achievement and accountability are not emphasized,'' he says.
24_53	0.0	``Schools receive no extra federal or state monies for parent participation or high test scores _ many innovative educators feel stifled''.
24_54	0.0	Nathan cites numerous examples throughout his book of teachers' successes which have been marginalized, their ideas ignored or challenged.
24_55	0.0	In 1991, Nathan helped spearhead the Minnesota charter-school movement, a reform in public education that has spread to 29 states.
24_56	0.9166666666666666	Charters are public schools in which teachers, parents and community members work together to decide on educational programs and curricula.
24_57	1.0	As public schools, receiving tax money, they are accountable to the state, as well as to the parents and the community, for academic results.
24_58	0.9166666666666666	But they operate independently of most district and state regulations, cutting through bureaucratic red tape that may hinder other public schools.
24_59	0.0	Not every parent feels the need for such innovations as charter schools, open enrollment or lotteries.

24_66	1.5714285714285714	``People don't understand the relationship between the polls and public schools''.
24_67	0.0	Last year, Portland followed a growing trend: Like one in four local districts nationwide, its voters rejected higher property taxes _ a boost for property owners, but a blow for schools, which are funded by federal money and local property taxes.
24_68	0.0	Fiscal cuts often mean fewer enrichment programs and more leaky roofs.
24_69	0.0	The educational schism isn't likely to disappear anytime soon.
24_70	0.0	More choice, not less, is the wave of the future.
24_71	0.0	These dichotomies have taught me to prioritize and become proactive in my search.

24_73	0.0	I've become accustomed to asking questions, talking to principals and networking with other parents.
24_74	0.0	But even so, the process isn't simple.
