2_21	0.15004478	In 1971, wolves were placed on the endangered species list.
2_22	0.10925244	Since then, wolves have been reintroduced in some western states and now number about 5,000, Smith said. &QL;
3_0	0.28571132	The federal government is preparing to announce that the gray wolf _ which was once nearly shot, trapped and poisoned out of existence in the lower 48 states _ is abundant enough in a few places that it no longer uniformly needs the strict protection afforded the country's most endangered species.
3_1	0.3801443	The Fish and Wildlife Service plans this month to propose dropping the wolf a significant notch under the Endangered Species Act, from endangered to threatened, in all but a small part of its range.
3_2	0.12171208	The change would mean that, in most areas, wolves that kill livestock or otherwise pose a threat to human affairs could be chased away or shot by government agents.
3_3	0.12619739	It also represents the first step toward eventually turning over management of the species, Canis lupus, in many places to state wildlife agencies.
3_4	0.11732419	Just about anything having to do with the wolf, which has been both reviled and revered through much of human history, generates fierce debate, and the proposed change in its status is no different.
3_5	0.11373943	Some conservation groups say the forthcoming plan would relax protections too soon and would declare victory before wolves have recolonized broad parts of their old range.
3_6	0.14240628	Many ranchers and conservative private groups, though, say the laws shielding wolves wrongly limit property owners' rights.
3_7	0.15384481	Wildlife officials acknowledge that, in part, the proposed change _ by allowing shooting of livestock raiders _ is intended to assuage opponents of wolf restoration, including ranchers and their allies in Congress.
3_8	0.12673666	But they argue that the relaxation of rules would be a net benefit for the species by diminishing the tendency of frustrated property owners to resort to illegal, uncontrolled killing of wolves.
3_9	0.1853061	Most significantly, the federal scientists said, the proposed change signals their confidence that the comeback of the wolf, although limited to less than 5 percent of its former range in this country, constitutes an important ecological success story _ like that of the American alligator, peregrine falcon and bald eagle before it.
3_10	0.32958075	They say that the lower 48 states had only about 400 wolves in 1973, when the Endangered Species Act was passed _ almost all of them in Minnesota or Michigan.

3_24	0.11732171	But in some places, there are signs that wolves are becoming an accepted feature of the landscape outside of parks and preserves, and conflicts are shifting from whether they should be there to how they should be dealt with.
3_25	0.046663536	Some Montana ranchers have figured out high-tech ways of driving them away instead of resorting to high-powered rifles and a strategy popularly known as ``shoot, shovel and shut up''.

3_28	0.16199148	In Minnesota and parts of Wisconsin and Michigan, wolves are so abundant _ some have dens just 50 miles from Minneapolis _ that they could theoretically be removed entirely from the endangered list.
3_29	0.14641025	The only impediment lies in Minnesota, which has yet to follow the other two states and create its own wolf management program _ a prerequisite if federal protection is to be ended.

3_32	0.14013803	Under the agency's classification scheme, the only place wolves would remain endangered would be portions of southern Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, where efforts to bolster a particularly rare subspecies have faltered, wildlife officials say.
3_33	0.14342168	As drafts of the new wolf classification proposal have circulated, private conservation groups, scientists, ranchers and others with an interest in the animal have begun lobbying for changes and girding for hearings and _ inevitably _ lawsuits.

3_36	0.13145357	OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn The tug of war now is between those who want wolves restored to broader parts of their range, including the southern Rockies and the Northeast, and those who say that the existing numbers are sufficient.
3_37	0.1598984	The Endangered Species Act includes much flexibility on this point, containing no clear guidance on how much of a species' original range needs to be restored before it is declared saved.
3_38	0.15298956	A recent draft of the proposal was provided to a reporter by someone outside the Fish and Wildlife Service.
3_39	0.10540747	Officials at the agency said that almost all of the draft's major points would be reflected in the final version.
3_40	0.21011544	Under the plan, wolf habitat in the lower 48 states would be divided into four regions, with separate recovery plans for each.
3_41	0.050995145	The western Great Lakes region would encompass Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota and South Dakota.
3_42	0.14443646	The western region would be Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and parts of northern New Mexico and Arizona.
3_43	0.14252963	The southwestern region, the only one where wolves would remain endangered, would include some parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Texas.
3_44	0.10208083	The northeastern region would be New York, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine.
3_45	0.14485553	Wolves have not been seen in the Adirondacks in 100 years and only two possible sightings have been made in Maine, which is considered the likeliest spot for any future reintroduction effort.
3_46	0.14491881	But federal wildlife officials said they were not even sure what kind of wolves inhabited the Northeast, with some genetic studies suggesting that they were red wolves, a different species altogether.
3_47	0.1001126	In part because of those questions, no recovery effort is likely in the Northeast for many years, officials said.
3_48	0.18197847	In the rest of the contiguous states, the proposal says, wolves are never likely to be seen again, and thus in these areas _ 30 states in all _ the animals will be dropped from the list entirely, leaving any future decisions about restoration up to state officials.
3_49	0.12968038	Criticism of the impending plan is particularly acute in Colorado, where private wildlife groups have banded together into a coalition aimed at trying to replicate in the southern Rockies the successes with wolf introduction in Yellowstone National Park and Idaho.
3_50	0.096850758	Tina Arapkiles, a regional representative for the Sierra Club in Boulder, Colo.
3_51	0.12063833	, said the Fish and Wildlife Service was trying to wrap things up before the job was done.
3_52	0.14421908	``Their own studies said that over 1,000 wolves could exist in 11 of the national forests in Colorado alone,'' Arapkiles said.
3_53	0.090162079	Private land owners, including Ted Turner, the media tycoon, have offered expansive tracts of land, rich in elk and other prey, that could serve as wolf habitat, she added.
3_54	0.096946654	``To ignore that kind of potential is foolhardy,'' Arapkiles said.
3_55	0.23047934	But federal wildlife officials are standing by their conclusions, saying that the federal list of endangered species is the ecological equivalent of a hospital's intensive care unit, and that wolves are clearly ready for the recovery room.
3_56	0.21194652	Ron Refsnider, a wolf biologist for the wildlife agency based in Minnesota and the main author of the classification proposal, said there was still plenty of work to do to nurture the wolves living in the northern Rockies and especially in the Southwest.
3_57	0.12436683	``At best, those wolves have a tiny toehold on the landscape,'' Refsnider said, referring to areas along the Mexican border that could support the Mexican subspecies.
3_58	0.10127995	Right now, he said, fewer than two dozen wolves roam there.
3_59	0.10704326	Any significant new federal programs to expand the range of wolves, he said, would come at the expense of other species that might be just as important ecologically, but that do not have the mystique and high profile of a legendary predator.

4_0	0.26253956	WASHINGTON _ The Interior Department will announce on Monday that it is considering the relaxation of federal protection for gray wolves in the Rocky Mountains and near the Great Lakes, because these wolf populations are increasingly safe from extinction.
4_1	0.34430582	Department officials said they believed it was time to remove about 2,500 wolves in Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin from the list of those animals protected under the Endangered Species Act, turning over to the states the authority to manage the wolves.
4_2	0.16386802	Much smaller populations in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho could be reclassified from endangered to the less-dire category of threatened, giving wildlife officials greater flexibility in controlling those wolves and managing their habitat as their numbers increase.
4_3	0.20426037	The move is part of a broad program by the Clinton administration to emphasize the successes of the Endangered Species Act by taking species off the protected list as their numbers increase.
4_4	0.21563343	Officials said they believed that wolves might again roam the Adirondacks of New York and the forests of northern Maine, and said they would study what level of protection to give wolves in the Northeast, where today there are few, if any.
4_5	0.18668933	Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called the new plan a step forward for the wolves, which were once widely reviled and hunted almost to extinction.

5_2	0.17819403	Despite a quartet of unsolved wolf killings, two disappearances and three recaptures, the second year of a controversial wolf reintroduction experiment will see more wolves than ever this winter _ perhaps as many as 17.

5_4	0.21451101	``My goal is to make these wolves as wild as possible, and keep them wild,'' said Diane Boyd-Heger, Mexican wolf biologist for the Arizona Game and Fish Department.
5_5	0.11028324	All the wolves released this winter sport bright orange, pink or yellow markings on their fur and their radio-location collars, an attempt to prevent hunters from mistaking them for coyotes.

6_0	0.19305678	DENVER (AP) --A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that hundreds of transplanted Canadian wolves can remain in the northern Rockies, a decision environmentalists hailed as a boon for species recovery efforts nationwide.
6_1	0.098043707	The 10th U.S.
6_2	0.1987334	Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 1997 decision by a Wyoming federal judge who ruled that a government wolf reintroduction program in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho was illegal.
6_3	0.16501969	Ranchers and state farm bureaus oppose the 5-year-old program because they say the wolves endanger livestock.
6_4	0.11946455	They also claim that the program is unnecessary because there is already a viable wolf population in the area.
6_5	0.10164452	The government and environmental groups deny that, and say there may be only a few lone native wolves.
6_6	0.085319493	The groups suing over the program, the American Farm Bureau Federation and state chapters in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, employed an unusual tactic.
6_7	0.32207924	They pointed out that while native wolves are covered by the Endangered Species Act, the reintroduced wolves are considered part of an ``experimental population'' and can be shot if they threaten livestock.
6_8	0.27110868	The farm groups said the reintroduction program violates the Endangered Species Act by providing different protections to the native and the reintroduced wolves.
6_9	0.14759616	But the appeals court said the 1973 Endangered Species Act and a section added by Congress in 1982 were intended to allow the Interior Department flexibility in its approaches to the goals of preserving and recovering threatened animals.
6_10	0.093283194	The appeals court said a limit to that flexibility ``ignores biological reality and misconstrues the larger purpose'' of the law.
6_11	0.17958044	Environmental groups that joined Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and other government agencies in the appeal of the Wyoming ruling said Thursday's decision sets an important precedent.
6_12	0.23576959	``The practical effect is that the wolves are here to stay,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of the National Wildlife Federation, adding that the decision has ``enormous significance nationwide''.
6_13	0.24917514	Van Putten said there is a thriving population of about 300 wolves in Yellowstone and central Idaho as a result of the reintroduction program.
6_14	0.11620508	Babbitt called the decision ``a ringing endorsement to our wolf reintroduction program''.

7_10	0.11322854	Since the wolf was an endangered species, the place of her death was treated as a crime scene.
7_11	0.11697352	It's against the law to kill a member of an endangered species.
7_12	0.093586951	The wolf's remains were sent to experts for examination.

7_15	0.093997821	When it was determined that probably wasn't the case, Phelps said, other biologists were allowed to examine the scene.
7_16	0.1080924	It appears, Phelps said, the lion had killed the elk calf and was challenged by the wolf.
7_17	0.088734	``A pack of wolves can challenge a lion,'' he said, ``but usually an individual wolf wouldn't do that _ especially a small female like that''.

8_1	0.11064834	The latest wolf death has environmentalists calling for FBI intervention, while some ranchers say now is a good time to abandon the experiment.
8_2	0.37726159	A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called the latest killing ``incomprehensible,'' and she repeated Babbitt's vow last week that the wolf reintroduction program _ and the goal of returning at least 100 Mexican wolves to the wild in the next decade _ will continue.

8_12	0.1147536	Government biologists found the dead wolf Monday.
8_13	0.18446682	Barbara Marks, a rancher and spokeswoman for the Arizona Cattlemen's Association, said now is a good time to end the program, since all the wolves have been rounded up and none is running wild.
8_14	0.10944552	``How much money do they have to spend before they admit that it's a failure, for the wolves and for the community?
8_15	0.1637489	It's been a cruel experiment,'' said Marks, who lives in the isolated Blue Primitive Area, which has been the primary wolf release area.
8_16	0.25258151	In contrast, Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity, said the federal government should increase the reward leading to the arrest of the wolf killers to $50,000 and begin releasing wolves in the Gila and Aldo Leopold wilderness areas in New Mexico as well as the Blue.
8_17	0.12720484	Cattle ranching, Suckling said, should be phased out in all three areas; the government should close unneeded roads in the Apache and Gila national forests, and provide full wilderness status, which would ban mechanized vehicles, to the Blue range; and ranchers should drop their federal lawsuit challenging the wolf releases.
8_18	0.089385895	``They (ranchers) may not have pulled the actual trigger.
8_19	0.093646209	But by creating this anti-wolf climate up there, they have encouraged whoever did it,'' Suckling said.
8_20	0.10864672	Two leaders of Santa Fe environmental groups _ Pat Wolff of New West Research, and Sam Hitt of Forest Guardians _ said the federal government has failed to fully investigate information they have collected that they say points to wolf bounties of up to $35,000 being offered by an as yet unidentified man from Catron County, N.M.
8_21	0.18532318	They said a tape recording they obtained of a federal prison inmate in Tucson indicates a wolf bounty was being offered by someone affiliated with the New Mexico ranching groups.
8_22	0.18200233	``That's laughable,'' said Caren Cowen, executive secretary of the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association.
8_23	0.091760297	``Patricia Wolff has really gone off the deep end this time.
8_24	0.089007029	``We are pursuing our case through the courts.

8_26	0.14812174	Both Marks and Cowen said it is doubtful ranchers are the killers because they not only would risk fines under the Endangered Species Act of $100,000 and a year in prison, but they also would risk losing their right to graze livestock on public lands.
8_27	0.18302028	Hitt, of Forest Guardians, also has called on Babbitt to bring in the FBI, saying the law enforcement officers of the Fish and Wildlife Service are prone to intimidation by ranchers and not backed up by their superiors.
8_28	0.10577941	Babbitt said more federal officers are already assigned to the case and there is no need to involve the FBI, but if the help of other federal agencies is needed, he will call for it.
8_29	0.19420945	Of the 13 wolves brought to the wild this year, five were shot, three were recaptured for their own protection, one is missing and presumed dead, and four remain.

9_3	0.22450809	The second was a message for those who in recent weeks have gunned down three of the rare lobos, including the mother of the first wolf pup born in the wilds of Arizona in half a century.
9_4	0.11701165	``The wolf is here to stay,'' said the former Arizona governor.
9_5	0.2839597	Babbitt returned to the same rocky ridge where in January he took part in the release of the first 11 wolves into the wilds of the Southwest in nearly three decades.
9_6	0.096990444	``It's just incomprehensible that people would view this (wolf) as a threat, and that they would resort to this kind of violence,'' he said.
9_7	0.121979	Although sheep and cattle ranchers feared their herds would be decimated, the wolves have not killed any livestock.
9_8	0.13069651	A reward of $30,000 is posted for information leading to the arrest of the wolf killers.
9_9	0.12460274	The killing of an endangered animal can result in a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.
9_10	0.21301419	The wolves are being returned to the wild in an effort to increase their numbers, remove them from the list of species in danger of extinction and put back a predator into the Southwest ecosystems that will help ensure populations of other animals are kept in check.
9_11	0.10791886	Babbitt met Monday morning in Albuquerque with state and federal law enforcement officers from Arizona and New Mexico, and he promised to provide whatever resources are needed to bring the killer or killers to justice.
9_12	0.17199336	And he promised to return again this winter, when four additional wolf packs are planned to be released, part of a multiyear plan to eventually have more than 100 wild wolves scattered over 5,000 square miles of some of the most rugged land along the Arizona-New Mexico line.
9_13	0.11129712	Babbitt also left open the possibility that a federal investigation may not be over for a Tucson man who killed the first wolf in April _ a controversial shooting that was ruled an act of self-defense.
9_14	0.13305099	He said decisions in the case involving retired postal worker Richard Humphrey are up to law enforcement agents.
9_15	0.092789989	But when pressed for whether the case may be reopened, Babbitt said, ``I'd just rather not comment on it''.
9_16	0.10090878	The interior secretary, who heads the U.S.
9_17	0.11987093	Fish and Wildlife Service, said there is no evidence that Humphrey or any member of his family was under attack.
9_18	0.1252497	And he said it remains true that there is no documented case of a healthy wild wolf in North America this century ever attacking a human being.
9_19	0.13172333	``I don't think the facts support any inference that the wolf was anything other than an animal that happened to be in the neighborhood,'' Babbitt said.
9_20	0.13935164	G.J. of Tucson, a hunting enthusiast who has acted as a spokesman for Humphrey, said he believes it is possible that the three wolves shot in August, October and earlier this month may also have been killed legitimately.
9_21	0.10595681	``It may well be that several people had a run-in with the wolves similar to Humphrey, and are afraid to turn themselves in after witnessing his public crucifixion,'' said Sagi, the former editor of a newsletter called ``Outdoor News''.
9_22	0.092281368	Sagi said he closed shop because of the harassment he's suffered while sticking up for Humphrey.

10_1	0.18841708	(AP) --A pack of Mexican gray wolves that repeatedly harassed or attacked cattle in eastern Arizona is being relocated.
10_2	0.14226765	Wildlife officials have tracked the pack --an adult male and female, a female yearling and an unknown number of pups -- for two weeks, following complaints from ranchers in the Apache National Forest.
10_3	0.069742268	The adult male and the yearling were recently captured and officials hope to catch the adult female and her pups and relocate the pack to an area free of livestock.
10_4	0.14770806	Officials heading the federal reintroduction program hope to intercede before the pups get used to livestock as a food source, instead of deer, elk and other wildlife.

10_9	0.14380143	Bob Dyson, a spokesman for the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, said there is speculation that pups may have seen, if not participated, in the calf killing.

11_2	0.097222561	It is true, in the big cities on the plains, they have heard of ``rare''.
11_3	0.019053946	Also in Gardiner (population under 1,000), at Red's Blue Goose Saloon and Barbeque, they know what rare means.
11_4	0.097911545	You can get cool rare, warm rare and medium rare at Red's.
11_5	0.11799595	A few miles south, down in the park, the wolves are thriving on a diet of extremely rare elk chops.
11_6	0.10084722	Forget everything you learned on television about wolves.
11_7	0.091765062	They do not have small litters of pups in Yellowstone.
11_8	0.089917364	It is not just the Alpha female who gets to have pups.
11_9	0.12745536	There are packs of wolves in Yellowstone where every female has had a litter this year, and some of them have had as many as eight and 10 pups.
11_10	0.11715325	This is unheard of, but so is putting a couple of dozen wolves out in the middle of a few hundred thousand elk who have, apparently, forgotten what wolves are and what wolves do.
11_11	0.090498716	Irven DeVore, a distinguished primatologist (the study of apes and other beings like you and me) at Harvard University hooked up with some mammalogists (wolves and elks and also you and me) to visit Yellowstone last winter and had the privilege, if not necessarily the pleasure, of watching a few wolves eat an elk.
11_12	0.096741511	``That elk had no idea,'' he remarked, ``that these wolves weren't just oversized coyotes.
11_13	0.098350188	There wasn't a chase.
11_14	0.088800705	They just walked up to that elk and ate it''.
11_15	0.094408691	Finding a large carnivore in Yellowstone is not as easy as it was in the days when people fed the bears at the roadside.
11_16	0.081311789	Grizzly bear sightings are remarkable, and a grizzly that stays in view of one of the park's paved roads will stop traffic in both directions for a couple of miles.
11_17	0.080469329	Wolves have the same effect, but they move around more than grizzlies and seldom stay long enough to attract more than a few hundred automotive naturalists before moving off into the woods or over the ridgeline, out of sight.
11_18	0.090044798	The bears don't move as much, for a variety of reasons, but mainly because the grizzly bear can do whatever it darn well pleases.
11_19	0.096334472	With a long day to make a short drive, it seemed like a sensible idea to put away the fishing tackle (Yellowstone, on a bad day, is still the best trout fishing country in the Lower 48) and make a small attempt to find a wolf.
11_20	0.082693634	It is not a good idea to make a major expedition, the price of disappointment increases with the effort expended, whether it's fly-fishing or wolf-watching.
11_21	0.098237841	The best country for wolves this summer had been the Yellowstone River valley below the falls and over on a tributary, the Lamar River basin.
11_22	0.09180828	The reason has more to do with human ability than actual wolf presence.
11_23	0.09255454	The lower Yellowstone and Lamar valleys are less traveled by automobiles, and the landscape is prairie-like for the most part, not forested.
11_24	0.095160193	You can see a wolf a lot easier through clear air than through lodgepole pine trees.
11_25	0.10966706	The plan (even when you're relaxed, it doesn't hurt to have a plan) was simple, just head for the Lamar Valley between the Tower-Roosevelt intersection and where the country pinches in around the road at Soda Butte, park the car, walk up the hillside until you had a sweeping view of the valley, and get out the binoculars and start looking for wolves along the treeline and in the swales where they would be out of sight of the highway but visible to the brave, solitary, resourceful amateur mammalogist, moi.
11_26	0.089568782	Even with a plan, it is good to be flexible.
11_27	0.072948649	Less than halfway from Gardiner to the place I had in mind, the Lamar Valley near Slough Creek Road, I noticed a road sign for something called Blacktail Plateau Drive.
11_28	0.088153967	It was a one-way dirt road, six miles in length, a second sign explained.
11_29	0.083357055	No problem.
11_30	0.081690635	The day was young, and a six mile dirt-road detour doesn't slow you down much in a park that has a 45-mile-per-hour speed limit on the most open roads.
11_31	0.092312606	And halfway down the dirt, a very large coyote ran across the road in front of the car.
11_32	0.091749339	That is what my brain said: ``Big coyote''.
11_33	0.094205842	Like the elk, I hadn't seen a wolf in my life.
11_34	0.099598946	Well, unlike the elk, I'd seen a couple running around a cage in the London Zoo.
11_35	0.098035278	Then the brain took a timeout: too huge around.
11_36	0.098656739	Too tall.

11_39	0.096398815	A series of ``toos'' added up to wolf.
11_40	0.053981655	So, taking a lifetime of wildlife watching experience in hand, I parked the car off the road, got the binoculars, and started scanning the ridgeline toward which my wolf had disappeared.
11_41	0.092745976	He (she, it, whatever) would have to come up out of the low country and cross that ridge, that's what the well-trained brain said.

11_43	0.092420349	This is what happens in Yellowstone when anyone sees anyone else peering through lenses at the distant vistas.
11_44	0.10537697	``Wolf,'' I whispered.
11_45	0.093487277	``Went that way''.
11_46	0.092708139	A few minutes later, I felt a gentle nudge.
11_47	0.095126231	``Wolf,'' the man said in a conversational tone.

11_50	0.10409367	Behind you''.
11_51	0.090483686	A long way behind, two or three football fields away, up on a bench were wolves.
11_52	0.098662104	And suddenly, the brain also remarked that those hadn't been dogs barking, those were wolves having a discussion about where to go to eat what.
11_53	0.10510513	We watched wolves for an hour.
11_54	0.086018126	A couple disappeared, one at a time, over a more distant ridge line.
11_55	0.097162063	The remaining two did interesting wolf things.

11_60	0.087913029	They ignored each other.
11_61	0.089205567	They sat around together.
11_62	0.091783383	It was not as good as watching them eat an elk, I suppose, but it was enormously satisfying.
11_63	0.086378113	In the entire hour, no more than four cars stopped to not dance with the wolves but to peer at them through binoculars, spotting scopes, and long camera lenses.
11_64	0.090780887	It was a civil, polite, small crowd.
11_65	0.092488453	Newcomers would be advised exactly where to look (to the naked eye, the wolves were the size of poppy seeds on the other side of the kitchen table, so to speak).
11_66	0.078574818	We departed, one by one, newcomers arrived, one by one, and I am sure that as long as the wolves were visible, someone was there to watch them do their wolf act.

13_32	0.13726398	At the same time, federal officials plan to release at least one wolf pack near Bear Valley, within a quarter-mile of spring calving areas.
13_33	0.094985935	``All they (wolves) have to do is find one stillborn calf, and they'll be right on them,'' said Marks, who worked throughout the summer to scare wolves away from his cattle.

13_39	0.12268913	But the use of acclimation pens has led to accusations by ranchers that the wolves _ which were raised in zoos and other captive breeding facilities _ are too dependent on humans bringing them food.
13_40	0.1716176	Ranchers say that the wolves starved when they weren't fed road-kill and that the wolves are attracted by the sound of automobiles.

13_42	0.09645963	The wolves, he said, are afraid of people, but don't seem to move far enough away to keep from being shot.
13_43	0.1398298	As part of the ongoing reintroduction experiment, biologists plan to release one or two pairs of wolves _ possibly by helicopter _ directly into the Blue Range Primitive Area, a roadless zone where mechanized vehicles are prohibited.

13_46	0.10184224	If these wolves are shot to death, it could only be by someone who purposely wanted wolves dead.
13_47	0.09672269	Because most mammals are colorblind, the markings will not affect the wolves' ability to hunt.

14_0	0.13364211	The Clinton Administration's trademark new approach to enforcing the Endangered Species Act on millions of acres of private lands has often relied on shaky science, a broad new study has found.
14_1	0.12275764	The draft study, performed by 119 independent scientists with National Science Foundation funding, highlights scientific weaknesses in more than 200 Habitat Conservation Plans, which the administration has fequently substituted for bans on disturbing species protected by the Act.
14_2	0.11832308	The plans are agreements between landowners and the federal government.
14_3	0.092820501	They allow the landowners to develop, mine, log _ or otherwise use _ their property.
14_4	0.096969214	In return, the landowners agree to make habitat improvements that lessen the harm to the endangered plants or animals.
14_5	0.14665594	The plans have reshaped the way the Endangered Species Act is enforced on about 5 million acres of state and private land, and they're spreading rapidly.
14_6	0.1077984	The areas covered by the habitat conservation plans range from suburban sage-scrub brush of gnatcatchers in Southern California to the red-cockaded woodpecker's longleaf pine forests in North Carolina.
14_7	0.10865352	Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said he welcomed the study as ``innovative'' and ``helpful''.
14_8	0.094310444	He said it is spurring his agency to rewrite guidelines for habitat planning.
14_9	0.098583862	Overall, the study concludes that the plans often lack scientific support for conclusions that they would help at-risk species.
14_10	0.087785537	Plans commonly fail to assess how many protected plants or animals would be disturbed, show how this would affect the species' survival, or prescribe monitoring that will indicate how the species actually fare, the study says.
14_11	0.14199193	The problems stem, in part, from a lack of available scientific data, according to the study, which also says that the estimates of the plans' impact on senstivie species are, at times, ``very close to a guess''.
14_12	0.079385663	The Clinton administration contends the plans get owners of private land, the site of 80 percent of endangered species habitat, to preserve or improve habitat that otherwise might be lost.
14_13	0.092817083	And large landowners, especially timber companies in the Northwest, have come to enthusiastically embrace the plans.
14_14	0.067508415	They have negotiated or are working on agreements that would effect about 11 million acres in Washington, Oregon California, Idaho and Montana.
14_15	0.093594528	That land includes one quarter of non-federal commercial timberland in the region.
14_16	0.090789969	In recent years, the plans have drawn mounting criticism from environmental groups and some conservation biologists.
14_17	0.10108654	A draft of the new study, obtained by the Post-Intelligencer, supported some of those complaints.
14_18	0.10359824	It found: _ No estimates regarding the number of at-risk plants or animals killed or disrupted by the authorized plans were done for about two-thirds of the species covered.
14_19	0.10735728	_ Inadequate assessment of the impact of those losses on the species' survival was ``especially common''.
14_20	0.17606231	_ Almost two-thirds of the plans fail to show that the improvements minimize damage to the species as much as is practicable, as the Endangered Species Act requires.
14_21	0.099449348	_ Less than 10 percent of the plans ``had clear monitoring programs that were sufficient for evaluating success''.
14_22	0.10864469	_ About 25 percent of the plans fail to assess whether habitat is currently sufficient to support recovery of the species or what cumulative impacts would result from piecemeal loss of habitat.
14_23	0.09290821	_ The agency has been negotiating plans that last as long as 100 years, with guarantees that no further concessions will be asked, without regard to uncertainties about whether they will provide adequate species protection.
14_24	0.11269339	Laverne Smith, chief of Interior's Division of Endangered Species, declined to respond to any of the draft's specific criticisms.
14_25	0.090846685	She said a formal response is being drafted.
14_26	0.096282593	The study, which eclipses previous habitat planning reviews in both depth and scope, was coordinated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at the University of California at Santa Barbara with financial assistance from the National Science Foundation and the American Institute for Biological Sciences.
14_27	0.064906495	The scientists from eight universities evaluated 208 of 227 habitat plans, with an in-depth look at 43 of them.
14_28	0.094230709	Though still subject to revisions, the draft study expands on findings reported in December.
14_29	0.094006923	At that time, Peter Kareiva, the University of Washington ecologist who supervised the study, said, ``There are a huge number of Habitat Conservatin Plans (HCPs) that probably should not have been written''.
14_30	0.092985756	Kareiva could not be reached for comment on the latest version of the report.
14_31	0.072222335	The White House announced in February it intends to improve HCP guidelines.
14_32	0.090190548	Interior Department officials have been working on language to require plans to have clear monitoring programs, measurable biological goals and more public review.
14_33	0.065514137	And, where information is lacking, the government is seeking shorter duration and more clauses that would force landowners to tighten safeguards if new species problems developed.
14_34	0.10419534	In a recent interview, Babbitt dismissed many of the problems as necessary growing pains for a new program.
14_35	0.093176946	``Obviously, this stuff is all new and we're cutting it out of whole cloth,'' Babbitt said.
14_36	0.084567663	``We've got a couple hundred HCPs.
14_37	0.08717453	Now, what we have to do is go back and look at all of them and see if there are lessons we can learn''.
14_38	0.096153244	Federal officials noted that the plans cannot be delayed for perfect data and are negotiated compromises, not pure science.
14_39	0.092352737	The study follows mounting criticism from other quarters.
14_40	0.089738865	In 1996, 167 scientists complained about the plans' lack of independent scientific review and warned they ``have the potential to become habitat giveaways that contribute to, rather than alleviate, threats to listed species and their habitats''.
14_41	0.092377278	Several environmental groups and members of congress have also raised concerns.
14_42	0.091761326	``Giving it all away'' is what a coalition of Northwest environmental groups last year called a review of the plans.
14_43	0.089282933	One notable exception to the environmental group critics is Michael Bean of the Environmental Defense Fund, a highly regarded expert on on U.S. wildlife law.
14_44	0.096696433	Bean agrees that some of the plans are ``lousy,'' but says they can produce net gains.
14_45	0.075587286	``HCPs have the potential to produce results that are far better than we could otherwise expect,'' he said, especially where human intervention is needed to restore habitat or combat an invasive exotic species.
15_0	0.34367098	Calling it a success story on a par with the comeback of the bald eagle, federal wildlife officials announced Tuesday that the gray wolf, hunted nearly to extinction a century ago, has rebounded enough to no longer be considered an endangered species in most of the country.
15_1	0.12594242	The wolves, which once roamed from Canada to Mexico, have been stalked for centuries like no other animal, starting in 1630, when the Massachusetts Bay Colony paid a month's salary for each one killed.
15_2	0.11568782	By the time they received federal protection in 1973 there were only a few hundred left.
15_3	0.32534057	But nowadays, with more than 3,500 wolves living in eight states, US Fish and Wildlife Service officials said it is time to ease the tough nationwide protections they have enjoyed under the federal Endangered Species Act.
15_4	0.24889531	``Wolves are a living symbol of the regard Americans have for things wild,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, announcing the proposal to reclassify wolves from endangered to threatened in the Northeast and two other regions and to strip them of all federal protection in 30 states.
15_5	0.11420831	Endangered species get more legal protection than threatened species.
15_6	0.13641553	Babbitt's optimism may seem odd in New England, where there are so few wolves that a single sighting is big news, and environmentalists are pushing a controversial plan to import wolves to replenish the stock in Maine or New Hampshire.
15_7	0.17136706	However, some federal officials believe reduced protections for wolves may actually improve prospects for reintroducing them here by easing private land owners' fears that the wolf's arrival would trigger serious limits on the use of their land.
15_8	0.10613674	But activists who have been pushing to bring the wolf back to the Northeast rejected that logic.
15_9	0.17332067	They called Babbitt's plan to ``downlist'' protections for wolves a concession to the ranchers, sheep farmers and land owners who see wolves as a hazard to their businesses.
15_10	0.20250601	Changing the wolves from endangered to threatened ``is a purely political move with no biological basis whatsoever,'' said Michael Kellett, executive director of Restore the North Woods, which supports reintroduction of wolves in the Northeast.
15_11	0.094856394	``We're going to urge people to support the strongest recovery plan possible, and to oppose the downlisting''.
15_12	0.26686508	Currently, wolves are considered endangered in all of the lower 48 states except Minnesota.
15_13	0.10276545	They would remain so in the Southwest under Babbitt's proposal, which would be final a year from now after public hearings.
15_14	0.096150886	Even if wolves are downlisted to threatened, it would still be illegal to shoot them.
15_15	0.087925739	If the proposal survives the public debate ahead, it would signify an extraordinary compromise between critics and supporters of wolf recovery.
15_16	0.11632255	Critics have included private property groups and many states, including New Hampshire where the legislature approved a bill last year banning wolf reintroduction there.
15_17	0.12321296	On the other side, environmental groups have played on the wolf's charisma to build support for reintroducing the animal.
15_18	0.13726537	The compromise is evident in the Service's plan to involve critics and supporters in writing the recovery plan, the document that will guide efforts to build up wolf populations.
15_19	0.17277889	And, under a special rule included in the proposal for the Northeast, wolves that kill livestock or otherwise threaten people and property could be shot or relocated.
15_20	0.10879543	Such concessions are intended to appease landowners and legislators alike, who may fear the federal government even more than the wolves.
15_21	0.21025222	``This would give us quite a bit more flexibility,'' said Paul Nickerson, chief of the Fish and Wildlife Service's Northeast regional endangered species office.
15_22	0.11346932	``Unlike other areas of the country, where there is a great deal of public land, whatever recovery we do here will occur on private land, with the full cooperation of private landowners''.
15_23	0.16896283	To the timber industry, which owns millions of acres in the four states and has been uneasy about wolf recovery, such overtures are welcome.
15_24	0.11117486	They are nervous that wolves may wander into Maine from Canada, potentially triggering all sorts of efforts to protect the animals at their expense.
15_25	0.14859967	So far, although animals believed to be wolves have been shot in Maine in 1993 and 1996, there is no documented evidence of a current population.
15_26	0.089473458	Timber industry officials particularly praised the idea of helping to write a recovery plan which spelled out what logging and other activities can take place in potential wolf habitat.
15_27	0.12718524	``Because of the many restrictions that often follow Endangered Species Act listings, it'd be a stretch to say our members would be thankful if wolves actually do show up in Maine,'' said Andrew Kekacs, a spokesman for the Maine Forest Products Council.
15_28	0.08856943	``But if they do, at least we'd know that we're not doing anything in our forest practices that's incompatible with them.''

16_1	0.076644925	_ Last spring, Bobby Fite peered down the sight of his.22 magnum rifle at what he thought was a coyote stalking two newborn calves near his house here.
16_2	0.14720632	``I threw that scope on her, then I saw that box on her, and I thought, man, that's one of them wolves,'' Fite, a rancher, said, recalling how he lowered his rifle after he realized that the predator in his pasture was a Mexican gray wolf, or lobo.
16_3	0.15497708	Newly reintroduced after ranchers exterminated them half a century ago from the high timberlands of eastern Arizona, today's lobos wear radio collars that allow them to be tracked by biologists.

16_5	0.19280433	Of the first batch of 11 released in March, five were shot, two are missing and presumed dead, and the rest had to be recaptured for their safety while biologists reworked the program.

16_8	0.087470289	The radio collars were also painted, orange for males, pink for females.
16_9	0.1105913	The paint should not interfere with the wolves' mating habits, because the animals are color blind.
16_10	0.091828053	But some environmentalists grumble that, even though the intent is to protect the wolves, marking them this way is the equivalent of painting fluorescent targets on their backsides.
16_11	0.17776785	The paint is to help hunters distinguish Mexican wolves, one of the smallest wolf subspecies in North America, from coyotes, the garden-variety predators of the West.

16_17	0.15264949	After the rash of wolf shootings in the fall, wildlife officials angrily called the killings ``sabotage''.
16_18	0.091485038	But now they say it appears that errors by hunters may account for most of the shootings.
16_19	0.18774433	Aware that many local ranchers were hostile to the release of the wolves, biologists worked early this year to monitor the animals and remove them from areas with sheep and cows.
16_20	0.13018929	They also educated ranchers about the penalty for intentionally killing a Mexican wolf, an endangered animal, on public land: a fine of up to $100,000 and a jail term of up to one year.
16_21	0.088944085	The efforts appeared at first to be successful.

16_23	0.16025236	``If the ranchers wanted to shoot wolves, they would have shot them in April, May, and June, when the wolves were in town, in calving pastures, among sheep, among horses,'' said Diane Boyd-Heger, a wolf biologist for the Arizona Game and Fish Department, who has directed the introduction program.
16_24	0.10016249	``The local people had plenty of opportunities to shoot these wolves.

16_27	0.14647865	Before the season began, wildlife officials had mailed brochures explaining the wolf-recovery program to the 6,000 hunters who had permits to hunt dear, elk, bear and mountain lions in the wolf area.

16_35	0.12838762	But in this economically depressed corner of the state, many people see the wolves as another blow imposed by outsiders to a rural economy already hurt by dramatic reductions in timber harvests from public lands and in the number of cows that ranchers can have graze on public lands.

19_1	0.099882527	While there are corridors of natural habitat through which wolves from southern Quebec might move into Maine, the study found, many barriers inhibit their passage, most importantly legal hunting and trapping, which have long been a way of life in that region of Canada.

19_6	0.094978291	This could create a hybrid population in which the wolf gene pool would eventually be swamped, defeating the very purpose of recolonization.
19_7	0.10403944	Artificially reintroducing intact wolf packs might overcome that difficulty, some scientists believe, since packs tend to kill coyotes rather than breed with them.
19_8	0.14855297	Conservation organizations, led by the Washington-based Defenders of Wildlife, have been pressing for the re-establishment of timber wolves in northern New England or the Adirondacks or both, where they were once plentiful but have been extinct for about a century.

19_21	0.12750135	From the standpoint of conserving biological diversity, the basic rationale for re-establishing wolves in the Northeast could be strengthened by recent genetic studies by Canadian scientists.
19_22	0.17697772	Their findings, not yet published, suggest that the timber wolf of eastern Canada and formerly of the eastern United States, long considered a subspecies of gray wolf, is in fact a separate species and may be more closely related to the red wolf than the gray.

19_24	0.099044156	For instance, wolves prey on moose, which are too big for coyotes.
19_25	0.10962374	Moose have flourished in northern New England, both because there are no predators and because logging has created ideal second-growth habitat for them.

19_34	0.13631156	Ms. Fascione said that for her, the possibility of interbreeding between wolves and coyotes was the biggest concern about the success of wolf restoration in the Northeast.
19_35	0.15900884	Her organization, which has been instrumental in the Northern Rockies wolf restoration, is completing its own two-part study of restoration in the Northeast.
19_36	0.12375262	An earlier study sponsored by the Wildlife Conservation Society, in 1997, concluded that the Adirondacks were too removed from Canadian wolf packs for any natural recolonization to take place.
19_37	0.10581825	It also found that the Adirondacks had little more than half the area needed to sustain a wolf population.
19_38	0.11795381	If wolves were put into the Adirondacks, Weber said in a recent interview, they would probably expand into more of upstate New York and neighboring New England.
19_39	0.078127932	The 1997 study found that northern New England was a better bet than the Adirondacks for both natural colonization and for providing sufficiently extensive habitat.
19_40	0.083145111	It also identified two possible corridors near Quebec City along which wolves could disperse from Quebec into Maine.
19_41	0.096353056	The authors of that study said, however, that further investigation would be required to determine whether wolves were actually likely to move along the corridors.
19_42	0.090723731	The new study found that highways, railroads and the St.
19_43	0.084289288	Lawrence River posed formidable barriers across these corridors.
19_44	0.096864334	It also concluded that intensive hunting and snaring, coupled with negative attitudes toward wolves, would further inhibit their spread.
19_45	0.14365716	Moreover, the study found, hunting and trapping had reduced the wolf population of southern Quebec enough to lessen the pressure on wolves to migrate to the United States.
19_46	0.14433802	The authors said that natural colonization remained a possibility if Canada and the United States worked together to protect wolves in the dispersal corridors.
19_47	0.14629379	It also noted that any reintroduction of wolves to the northeastern United States would require Canadian cooperation, since the wolves would probably spread into New Brunswick.

21_27	0.11351203	In the Endangered Species Act, Congress did not define the term ``population''; therefore, the appellate court reasoned, ``Congress deliberately left the resolution of this type of management/conservation issue to the Department (of the Interior)''.
21_28	0.15404074	And federal wildlife biologists define a wolf ``population'' as at least two wild breeding pairs that raise at least two young in an area for the previous two years.
21_29	0.19282263	There is no evidence that a naturally occurring wolf population existed in Yellowstone or central Idaho prior to the introduction of the gray wolves.
21_30	0.14651771	Therefore, concluded the appellate court, on that question, the Department of the Interior did not violate the Endangered Species Act.
21_31	0.18030414	The appellate court wasted little time on the issue of ``de facto `delisting''' of wolves already in the area, which Downes found in violation of the Endangered Species Act.
21_32	0.10707775	The appellate court wrote: ``We believe this holding unnecessarily limits the administrative discretion and flexibility Congress intentionally incorporated into section 10(j) (of the ESA), ignores biological reality, and misconstrues the larger purposes of the Endangered Species Act''.
21_33	0.093800131	The court explains further: ``It is not difficult to imagine that sound population management practices tailored to the biological circumstances of a particular species could facilitate a more effective and efficient species-wide recovery, even if the process renders some individual animals more vulnerable.
21_34	0.09059809	... Congress left such decisions to the department.

22_0	0.37446751	Experimental restoration of the gray wolf to Montana, Idaho and Wyoming has been so successful since 1995, federal officials say, that the first steps toward a single, integrated wolf population in the Northern Rockies have now been taken.
22_1	0.22477238	In the Yellowstone area, where wolves have been most visible to wildlife enthusiasts, there are now about 110 adult wolves and roughly 60 newborn pups organized into 11 or 12 packs, said Edward E.
22_2	0.30258849	Bangs, a biologist with the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service who heads the Northern Rockies recovery program.
22_3	0.067281512	The wilderness of central Idaho is home to at least 12 packs with about 115 adults and 60 to 65 pups.
22_4	0.12172179	Canadian wolves were introduced to these two areas in 1995 and 1996, and natural reproduction has steadily expanded their populations since then.
22_5	0.13411042	In addition, 8 packs with about 60 adults and some 50 pups now inhabit northwestern Montana as a result of natural southward expansion of wolves from Canada that began in the mid-1980s.
22_6	0.12078371	About 10 percent of the wolves die each year from various causes, including starvation, predation by mountain lions, auto collisions, avalanches, old age and gunshots.
22_7	0.11142064	Most of the latter killings were done legally, after wolves preyed on livestock.
22_8	0.1150597	Just as significant as their numbers is the fact that in at least two instances, wolves from different populations have mated, making a genetic connection that could be the foundation for a single Rockies population.
22_9	0.14829388	And for the first time since the reintroductions, wolves have taken up territories well outside Yellowstone Park in the last year.
22_10	0.07560583	One pack each has established itself near Cody, Dubois and Jackson, all in Wyoming, some 50 miles from the park boundary.
22_11	0.089707787	The Jackson pack has adopted the National Elk Refuge as its winter hunting ground.
22_12	0.10288198	One could sit in Jackson this winter, ``sipping your latte and watching nature at work'' as the wolves hunted down elk, Bangs said.
22_13	0.14026717	In another ecological milestone, he said, one Yellowstone pack has learned to attack and kill bison in the park and is now something of a bison specialist.
22_14	0.11515709	The Yellowstone wolves generally have concentrated on the park's abundant elk population.
22_15	0.11466574	From 1995 through 1998, 80 cattle, 190 sheep and 12 dogs were confirmed victims of the Northern Rockies wolves.
22_16	0.18909439	Nearly $70,000 in compensation was paid to the affected owners from a fund maintained by the Defenders of Wildlife, according to a report by Bangs and others in the current issue of the Wildlife Society Bulletin.
22_17	0.21143629	Forty-seven wolves were moved after depredations, and 43 marauding wolves have been killed.
22_18	0.072695875	By comparison, according to the report, livestock producers in Montana alone lose an average of 142,000 sheep and 86,000 cattle, valued at $45 million year, to all causes each year.
22_19	0.2866772	A federal court has decided that the rules under which reintroduced wolves can be killed violate the Endangered Species Act and has ordered all the wolves removed from Central Idaho and Yellowstone.
22_20	0.087449488	The case is now on appeal.
22_21	0.10735577	As a practical matter, Bangs said, the wolves are now so numerous and well-established that removing them would be a problem.
22_22	0.10551027	``You could remove all the wolves,'' he said, ``but you couldn't catch them all alive''.
22_23	0.12729749	Many of the wolves born after the initial reintroductions are not wearing radio collars and would be hard to find.
22_24	0.090035466	``To recapture all of them would be very difficult,'' Bangs said.
22_25	0.2105082	If the restoration program survives the court challenge, the Northern Rockies wolf population can be removed from protection under the Endangered Species Act when there have been at least 100 wolves and 10 packs in each of the three recovery areas.
22_26	0.092111265	``We are dad-gum close to the countdown'' to that day, said Bangs.
23_0	0.28668565	At the end of November, after bullets had felled 5 animals, biologists recaptured the last free-roaming survivor of 11 Mexican wolves released with fanfare just eight months earlier in Arizona's Apache National Forest, bringing a temporary halt to a celebrated 20-year cooperative program between the United States and Mexico to restore this distinctive subspecies of the gray wolf, which became extinct in the wild in 1977.
23_1	0.31672641	By the end of the year biologists, who have bred from just 5 animals a total of 150 wolves with the ultimate goal of having 100 in the wild and 240 in captivity, had begun reintroducing the wolves into the wild again.
23_2	0.096999583	But whether they can achieve their goal, and at what cost to the wolves, remain open questions.
23_3	0.1728532	Long practiced as a way to replace stocks for hunting and fishing, captive breeding came to be seen in the 1970s as a panacea for species teetering on the edge of extinction.
23_4	0.12980903	Zoos began to promote themselves as latter-day Noah's Arks, capable of preserving stable, genetically sound populations of rare animals until the world was ready to welcome them back to a reconstructed nature, be it a century or more in the future.
23_5	0.2441366	In the 1970s and 80s, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service collected not only Mexican wolves but also red wolves, California condors, and black-footed ferrets from the wild in order to restore their populations through captive breeding, in cooperation with zoos, and then return them to their native habitats.
23_6	0.10752137	Similar programs were begun for species in other parts of the world while advances in reproductive technologies inspired plans for preserving frozen embryos and sperm in high-technology gene banks.
23_7	0.16123155	In 1994 the World Conservation Union's captive breeding specialist group suggested that the world's zoos could breed and maintain as many as 2,000 endangered species of vertebrates.
23_8	0.12283708	The recent developments with the Mexican wolf and those three other high-profile rescue programs have underscored the perils and promise of reintroducing captive bred animals.
23_9	0.13921662	The program to restore red wolves suffered a major setback last fall when officials removed the remnants of a group of some 30 animals that had been reintroduced into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee for lack of sufficient prey.
23_10	0.15969586	With one free-ranging population of nearly 100 animals in eastern North Carolina, project leaders are seeking suitable habitat for future releases, but blocks of more than 170,000 acres with minimal risk of conflicts with human activities and sufficient prey for wolves are scarce in the Southeastern United States.
23_11	0.18166557	On the other hand, biologists estimate that there are as many as 56 condors now riding thermal currents over Southern California and adjacent areas _ a remarkable recovery for the huge carrion eater that became extinct in the wild in 1987.
23_12	0.085184155	And the black-footed ferret, which nearly vanished from the Earth a decade ago, is producing a bumper crop of kits in and out of captivity, primarily in South Dakota, Montana, and a large breeding operation in Wyoming.
23_13	0.095619583	But the condor and black-footed ferret remain vulnerable.
23_14	0.16371324	Although they have bred well in captivity, none of the released condors has yet reproduced in the wild, and they are particularly sensitive to lead, which litters the landscape and is toxic to them in small doses.
23_15	0.059594531	Across the West, a plague is obliterating black-tailed prairie dogs, the black-footed ferrets' sole food source.
23_16	0.098015618	Even without the plague, habitat is being lost at an alarming rate to development and prairie-dog eradication programs.
23_17	0.20392968	Peter Gober, a United States Fish and Wildlife Service biologist in Pierre, S.D., said, ``I don't expect the ferret ever to be recovered to the point where it can be downlisted from endangered to threatened''.
23_18	0.075131146	Indeed, despite the sometimes spectacular achievements of these programs, captive breeding has come under fire in recent years as a costly, often futile exercise that does little to address the underlying problems, especially habitat loss and fragmentation, not to mention poaching and pollutants, that are pushing species toward extinction.
23_19	0.10244039	Collectively, the condor, wolf and ferret programs have already cost more than $50 million.
23_20	0.11216757	A five-year, $2.3 million effort initiated by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association to establish a captive breeding program for the Sumatran rhinoceros collapsed in 1993 without producing a single birth or protecting any wild rhinos.

23_23	0.10337382	Critics also maintain that the reintroduction process is wasteful of individual animals, many of which die because they do not know how to live outside a cage.
23_24	0.087399462	Other problems include a lack of space and resources for preserving populations of animals indefinitely, the development of behavioral problems in some species, and inbreeding among captive animals that can lead to genetic abnormalities and other health problems.
23_25	0.11596895	Efforts to breed some species, including clouded leopards, wooly monkeys, African wild dogs, Sumatran rhinos, and the Micronesian kingfisher, have faltered.

23_30	0.15521726	In 1994, Benjamin Beck, associate director of the National Zoological Park in Washington, and three collaborators found that of 145 documented reintroductions in this century involving 115 species, only 16 (11 percent) had produced populations that were sustaining themselves in the wild without human assistance, and only half of those were endangered species.

24_0	0.22748778	WASHINGTON (AP) --The government proposed Tuesday to reduce federal protection of endangered gray wolves, saying they had successfully recovered from near extinction but acknowledging more could die as a result of the change.
24_1	0.26498583	The Interior Department proposal would classify most of the wolves --all those except the Mexican gray wolf in the Southwest -- as threatened rather than endangered.
24_2	0.091931691	That means authorities would have greater leeway in developing management plans that take into account concerns from private landowners.
24_3	0.32026006	The small population of Mexican gray wolves recently introduced to parts of New Mexico and Arizona --only 22 wolves -- would remain endangered because they continue to be under the threat of extinction, officials said.
24_4	0.17482933	Jamie Rappaport Clark, director of the U.S.
24_5	0.50432761	Fish and Wildlife Service, said the recovery of the gray wolf --also known as the timber wolf in some parts of the country -- was ''an endangered species success story''.
24_6	0.1279396	But she said the increase in the number of wolves will allow her agency to ''structure wolf recovery to meet the needs of the species and those of the people''.
24_7	0.14593686	While wolves may be given somewhat lower levels of protection, the increased flexibility provided by reclassifying them as ''threatened'' may make it easier for wolf populations to expand into areas in which they currently are not found, federal wolf experts said.
24_8	0.12860446	Those include vast areas of the West and even parts of New England, they said.
24_9	0.15303245	For example, the less restrictive designation might convince landowners in the Northeast --where currently there are no wolves known to exist, despite ideal habitat for the animal -- to accept future wolf recovery plans from Maine to upstate New York, officials said.
24_10	0.21604395	But as threatened --a less protective designation under the federal Endangered Species Act -- some wolves also may be captured or killed if they threaten livestock or fall under another less restrictive provision of a formal wolf management plan.
24_11	0.13367964	The gray wolf is currently classified as endangered throughout the country except in Alaska and in Minnesota --where it has a ''threatened'' classification.
24_12	0.30442539	But the recovery of the wolves has been impressive across the northern tier of the country from Michigan to Minnesota and in the northern Rocky Mountains where the animals were reintroduced in Yellowstone National Park in 1995.
24_13	0.23039914	Virtually extinct in the lower 48 states in the 1950s, today there are 2,445 wolves in Minnesota and a total of nearly 500 in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
24_14	0.28640369	The reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone has resulted in more than 300 wolves in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.
24_15	0.096122164	''We made the right choice to...
24_16	0.19416716	bring these animals back from the brink of extinction,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, in announcing that the animals have rebounded enough to warrant reclassification.
24_17	0.15843043	The new proposal brought mixed response from conservation groups with some praising the move and others expressing concern that the lesser protection might endanger attempts to expand the wolf's range.
24_18	0.092113604	''It's a mixture of good news and bad,'' said Bob Ferris of Defenders of Wildlife.
24_19	0.15917186	He said he wasn't opposed to the reclassification, but was concerned that the government ''is not considering any further recovery areas'' and that some wolves could lose federal protection entirely.
24_20	0.22822081	The National Wildlife Federation said while the proposal ''reflects the success of wolf recovery programs,'' it ''falls far short of a bolder vision for recovery'' of wolves in the West.
24_21	0.09064985	Under the proposal, the U.S.
24_22	0.23014418	Fish and Wildlife Service would establish four distinct population segments, based on the primary ranges in which the wolves are found or are expected to migrate.
24_23	0.20927083	The wolves would be removed from all Endangered Species protection in all or part of 30 states where wolf introduction is unlikely.
