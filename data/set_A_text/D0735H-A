1_0	0.20709995	WASHINGTON (AP) --The government proposed Tuesday to reduce federal protection of endangered gray wolves, saying they had successfully recovered from near extinction but acknowledging more could die as a result of the change.
1_1	0.36655748	The Interior Department proposal would classify most of the wolves --all those except the Mexican gray wolf in the Southwest -- as threatened rather than endangered.
1_2	0.079157689	That means authorities would have greater leeway in developing management plans that take into account concerns from private landowners.
1_3	0.25311902	The small population of Mexican gray wolves recently introduced to parts of New Mexico and Arizona --only 22 wolves -- would remain endangered because they continue to be under the threat of extinction, officials said.
1_4	0.23144772	Jamie Rappaport Clark, director of the U.S.
1_5	0.46336525	Fish and Wildlife Service, said the recovery of the gray wolf --also known as the timber wolf in some parts of the country -- was ''an endangered species success story''.
1_6	0.19768918	But she said the increase in the number of wolves will allow her agency to ''structure wolf recovery to meet the needs of the species and those of the people''.
1_7	0.13110765	While wolves may be given somewhat lower levels of protection, the increased flexibility provided by reclassifying them as ''threatened'' may make it easier for wolf populations to expand into areas in which they currently are not found, federal wolf experts said.
1_8	0.16789726	Those include vast areas of the West and even parts of New England, they said.
1_9	0.13379353	For example, the less restrictive designation might convince landowners in the Northeast --where currently there are no wolves known to exist, despite ideal habitat for the animal -- to accept future wolf recovery plans from Maine to upstate New York, officials said.
1_10	0.18149487	But as threatened --a less protective designation under the federal Endangered Species Act -- some wolves also may be captured or killed if they threaten livestock or fall under another less restrictive provision of a formal wolf management plan.
1_11	0.14422254	The gray wolf is currently classified as endangered throughout the country except in Alaska and in Minnesota --where it has a ''threatened'' classification.
1_12	0.25713455	But the recovery of the wolves has been impressive across the northern tier of the country from Michigan to Minnesota and in the northern Rocky Mountains where the animals were reintroduced in Yellowstone National Park in 1995.
1_13	0.18769234	Virtually extinct in the lower 48 states in the 1950s, today there are 2,445 wolves in Minnesota and a total of nearly 500 in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
1_14	0.31980057	The reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone has resulted in more than 300 wolves in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.
1_15	0.074334932	''We made the right choice to...
1_16	0.16870877	bring these animals back from the brink of extinction,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, in announcing that the animals have rebounded enough to warrant reclassification.
1_17	0.14941404	The new proposal brought mixed response from conservation groups with some praising the move and others expressing concern that the lesser protection might endanger attempts to expand the wolf's range.
1_18	0.088377339	''It's a mixture of good news and bad,'' said Bob Ferris of Defenders of Wildlife.
1_19	0.1828057	He said he wasn't opposed to the reclassification, but was concerned that the government ''is not considering any further recovery areas'' and that some wolves could lose federal protection entirely.
1_20	0.21405932	The National Wildlife Federation said while the proposal ''reflects the success of wolf recovery programs,'' it ''falls far short of a bolder vision for recovery'' of wolves in the West.
1_21	0.041283414	Under the proposal, the U.S.
1_22	0.22785856	Fish and Wildlife Service would establish four distinct population segments, based on the primary ranges in which the wolves are found or are expected to migrate.
1_23	0.22806908	The wolves would be removed from all Endangered Species protection in all or part of 30 states where wolf introduction is unlikely.

2_0	0.16406755	DENVER (AP) --A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that hundreds of transplanted Canadian wolves can remain in the northern Rockies, a decision environmentalists hailed as a boon for species recovery efforts nationwide.
2_1	0.024461436	The 10th U.S.
2_2	0.1512094	Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 1997 decision by a Wyoming federal judge who ruled that a government wolf reintroduction program in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho was illegal.
2_3	0.26280781	Ranchers and state farm bureaus oppose the 5-year-old program because they say the wolves endanger livestock.
2_4	0.23908818	They also claim that the program is unnecessary because there is already a viable wolf population in the area.
2_5	0.12045622	The government and environmental groups deny that, and say there may be only a few lone native wolves.
2_6	0.088406497	The groups suing over the program, the American Farm Bureau Federation and state chapters in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, employed an unusual tactic.
2_7	0.29887899	They pointed out that while native wolves are covered by the Endangered Species Act, the reintroduced wolves are considered part of an ``experimental population'' and can be shot if they threaten livestock.
2_8	0.31885543	The farm groups said the reintroduction program violates the Endangered Species Act by providing different protections to the native and the reintroduced wolves.
2_9	0.12421991	But the appeals court said the 1973 Endangered Species Act and a section added by Congress in 1982 were intended to allow the Interior Department flexibility in its approaches to the goals of preserving and recovering threatened animals.
2_10	0.097523589	The appeals court said a limit to that flexibility ``ignores biological reality and misconstrues the larger purpose'' of the law.
2_11	0.1586023	Environmental groups that joined Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and other government agencies in the appeal of the Wyoming ruling said Thursday's decision sets an important precedent.
2_12	0.22670732	``The practical effect is that the wolves are here to stay,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of the National Wildlife Federation, adding that the decision has ``enormous significance nationwide''.
2_13	0.24294199	Van Putten said there is a thriving population of about 300 wolves in Yellowstone and central Idaho as a result of the reintroduction program.
2_14	0.1386557	Babbitt called the decision ``a ringing endorsement to our wolf reintroduction program''.

3_19	0.20300972	There also are those who believe that the wolves were mistaken for coyotes, even though wolves are nearly three times the size of coyotes.
3_20	0.089141404	Among those are Jess Carey, a former Catron County sheriff and gun shop owner from Reserve, N.M., who was subpoenaed last month by a federal grand jury investigating the wolf killings.

3_23	0.17141681	Although the Fish and Wildlife Service says they have no suspects, Carey said he was handed a piece of paper _ with his name on it _ that listed the suspects in the wolf killings.
3_24	0.10784944	``I knew each and every one of these people who bought these guns, and not one of them was capable of shooting any wolves,'' Carey said.
3_25	0.075952611	Asked how he could be so sure, he said, ``Because everyone of those people are law-abiding citizens.
3_26	0.085854454	And they're not going to go out here and shoot a wolf''.
3_27	0.15012849	For many, the wolves represent the latest intrusion by environmentalists and federal land managers.
3_28	0.095449688	Timber production has fallen throughout Arizona and New Mexico as federal land managers move to comply with federal court orders in lawsuits brought by environmentalists aimed as saving other threatened and endangered wildlife such as the Mexican spotted owl.
3_29	0.095260466	Falling copper prices also are forcing layoffs of hundreds of miners in New Mexico.
3_30	0.09366638	And ranchers are under pressure to cut back their herds in areas where federal land managers move to restore rivers and streams damaged by decades of overgrazing livestock.
3_31	0.090391232	Bill Marks, for example, has cut his herds in half in recent years, and he faces more cuts next year.
3_32	0.13708548	At the same time, federal officials plan to release at least one wolf pack near Bear Valley, within a quarter-mile of spring calving areas.
3_33	0.099001413	``All they (wolves) have to do is find one stillborn calf, and they'll be right on them,'' said Marks, who worked throughout the summer to scare wolves away from his cattle.
3_34	0.18589341	``This is the kind of cooperation I'm getting,'' Marks said of the releases planned near his ranch in the Blue Range Primitive Area.
3_35	0.17804335	Prior to their release into the wild, wolves have been put in acclimation pens that ring the Primitive Area.
3_36	0.11602063	After several weeks, they are released into the forest.
3_37	0.11400244	Four more wolves currently in such pens will be released today.
3_38	0.14460867	And at least two more wolf packs will be released from acclimation pens in coming months.
3_39	0.13121314	But the use of acclimation pens has led to accusations by ranchers that the wolves _ which were raised in zoos and other captive breeding facilities _ are too dependent on humans bringing them food.
3_40	0.32865872	Ranchers say that the wolves starved when they weren't fed road-kill and that the wolves are attracted by the sound of automobiles.
3_41	0.17843927	Dave Parsons, Mexican wolf recovery leader for the Fish and Wildlife Service, said wolves have learned on their own to hunt wild game _ mostly elk, which compete with cattle for forage.
3_42	0.11520396	The wolves, he said, are afraid of people, but don't seem to move far enough away to keep from being shot.
3_43	0.13592299	As part of the ongoing reintroduction experiment, biologists plan to release one or two pairs of wolves _ possibly by helicopter _ directly into the Blue Range Primitive Area, a roadless zone where mechanized vehicles are prohibited.
3_44	0.13647474	No pens are allowed to be built inside the Primitive Area, and wolves released there will be forced to fend for themselves right from the start.
3_45	0.10842672	Meanwhile, to avoid confusing them with coyotes, federal officials are releasing the wolves today with brightly colored radio collars and brightly painted markings on their hips.
3_46	0.13829337	If these wolves are shot to death, it could only be by someone who purposely wanted wolves dead.
3_47	0.11832044	Because most mammals are colorblind, the markings will not affect the wolves' ability to hunt.
3_48	0.10628953	But the new wolf-painting effort was criticized Thursday by Peter Galvin, conservation biologist for the Tucson-based Southwest Center for Biological Diversity.
3_49	0.20140386	Instead, he believes coyote hunting should be outlawed in the wolf recovery area.

3_51	0.091546157	Many believe that killing coyotes means more deer, elk and antelope fawns will survive each spring.
3_52	0.098441478	But biological studies show that no matter how many coyotes are killed, they reproduce rapidly, and quickly fill every ecological niche available.
3_53	0.216699	Ironically, recent studies of wolves in Yellowstone National Park show the one way to effectively remove coyotes is the reintroduction of wolves.

4_0	0.23109226	WASHINGTON _ The Interior Department will announce on Monday that it is considering the relaxation of federal protection for gray wolves in the Rocky Mountains and near the Great Lakes, because these wolf populations are increasingly safe from extinction.
4_1	0.30738481	Department officials said they believed it was time to remove about 2,500 wolves in Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin from the list of those animals protected under the Endangered Species Act, turning over to the states the authority to manage the wolves.
4_2	0.13729791	Much smaller populations in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho could be reclassified from endangered to the less-dire category of threatened, giving wildlife officials greater flexibility in controlling those wolves and managing their habitat as their numbers increase.
4_3	0.23885175	The move is part of a broad program by the Clinton administration to emphasize the successes of the Endangered Species Act by taking species off the protected list as their numbers increase.
4_4	0.18392287	Officials said they believed that wolves might again roam the Adirondacks of New York and the forests of northern Maine, and said they would study what level of protection to give wolves in the Northeast, where today there are few, if any.
4_5	0.23560408	Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called the new plan a step forward for the wolves, which were once widely reviled and hunted almost to extinction.
4_6	0.071339265	The rugged canines with the haunting howl have loped through primeval forests just as they prowl the human psyche in myth, folk tale and nursery rhyme.
4_7	0.099825914	Today, they have recaptured a revered status among conservation groups, reflecting their important ecological role as a top predator.
4_8	0.13650132	In interviews, Babbitt and Jamie Rappaport Clark, the director of the U.S.
4_9	0.1358247	Fish and Wildlife Service, said the changes would not lessen the likelihood that wolf packs would continue to thrive and to extend into new territories.
4_10	0.1000912	Babbitt plans to explain the policies on Monday while visiting a wildlife science center in Minnesota where the animals are held captive to help rebuild their numbers.
4_11	0.13696259	The new policy will not affect the protection of wolves that were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho, reproducing successfully, even though these populations might be reclassified from endangered to threatened.
4_12	0.23188055	Nor will the plan change the status of Mexican gray wolves, a subspecies being reintroduced to the Southwest, or of red wolves in the Southeast.
4_13	0.16513777	Gray wolves in Alaska have never been listed as endangered or threatened.
4_14	0.077118502	Formal proposals will be published in a few months.
4_15	0.14002085	The changes in the wolves' legal status are not likely to occur before 1999, but officials said the department's intentions were unlikely to change.
4_16	0.066053426	``I think it is important to acknowledge success,'' Babbitt said.
4_17	0.15867751	``One reason the Endangered Species Act was in question was the opponents were saying it did not work''.
4_18	0.14278144	The department's proposals for managing wolves have long been contentious, but this time some conservation groups are willing to support easing the protection.
4_19	0.23827629	``We think it is the right thing for the wolves, at the right time,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of the National Wildlife Foundation.
4_20	0.24723523	``It is the way the Endangered Species Act was designed to work''.
4_21	0.19619898	Proponents of relaxing the protections for wolves say that the change will make it easier to convince farmers and ranchers that the wolves can expand into new areas without threatening their livelihoods.

4_23	0.15768568	A population of wolves listed as threatened or not listed for the law's protections at all may be managed under state or Federal plans that allow some wolves to be killed and some of their habitat destroyed, as long as helping the species recover remains the overall objective.
4_24	0.14709909	When the population is classified as endangered, tighter protections apply and people who oppose the spread of wolves are more likely to resist reintroduction.
4_25	0.33053725	The Interior Department has listed gray wolves as an endangered species through most of the lower 48 states since 1973, when the Endangered Species Act was passed.

7_2	0.15070727	It is true, in the big cities on the plains, they have heard of ``rare''.
7_3	0.057570436	Also in Gardiner (population under 1,000), at Red's Blue Goose Saloon and Barbeque, they know what rare means.
7_4	0.06579913	You can get cool rare, warm rare and medium rare at Red's.
7_5	0.22418377	A few miles south, down in the park, the wolves are thriving on a diet of extremely rare elk chops.
7_6	0.093474733	Forget everything you learned on television about wolves.
7_7	0.077021314	They do not have small litters of pups in Yellowstone.
7_8	0.055491731	It is not just the Alpha female who gets to have pups.
7_9	0.18538522	There are packs of wolves in Yellowstone where every female has had a litter this year, and some of them have had as many as eight and 10 pups.
7_10	0.1267656	This is unheard of, but so is putting a couple of dozen wolves out in the middle of a few hundred thousand elk who have, apparently, forgotten what wolves are and what wolves do.
7_11	0.070743668	Irven DeVore, a distinguished primatologist (the study of apes and other beings like you and me) at Harvard University hooked up with some mammalogists (wolves and elks and also you and me) to visit Yellowstone last winter and had the privilege, if not necessarily the pleasure, of watching a few wolves eat an elk.
7_12	0.11028718	``That elk had no idea,'' he remarked, ``that these wolves weren't just oversized coyotes.
7_13	0.054579468	There wasn't a chase.
7_14	0.053440283	They just walked up to that elk and ate it''.
7_15	0.10182919	Finding a large carnivore in Yellowstone is not as easy as it was in the days when people fed the bears at the roadside.
7_16	0.071768436	Grizzly bear sightings are remarkable, and a grizzly that stays in view of one of the park's paved roads will stop traffic in both directions for a couple of miles.
7_17	0.083545208	Wolves have the same effect, but they move around more than grizzlies and seldom stay long enough to attract more than a few hundred automotive naturalists before moving off into the woods or over the ridgeline, out of sight.
7_18	0.08058579	The bears don't move as much, for a variety of reasons, but mainly because the grizzly bear can do whatever it darn well pleases.
7_19	0.074318171	With a long day to make a short drive, it seemed like a sensible idea to put away the fishing tackle (Yellowstone, on a bad day, is still the best trout fishing country in the Lower 48) and make a small attempt to find a wolf.
7_20	0.083948722	It is not a good idea to make a major expedition, the price of disappointment increases with the effort expended, whether it's fly-fishing or wolf-watching.
7_21	0.097371291	The best country for wolves this summer had been the Yellowstone River valley below the falls and over on a tributary, the Lamar River basin.
7_22	0.08157042	The reason has more to do with human ability than actual wolf presence.
7_23	0.1081373	The lower Yellowstone and Lamar valleys are less traveled by automobiles, and the landscape is prairie-like for the most part, not forested.
7_24	0.092254399	You can see a wolf a lot easier through clear air than through lodgepole pine trees.
7_25	0.084008651	The plan (even when you're relaxed, it doesn't hurt to have a plan) was simple, just head for the Lamar Valley between the Tower-Roosevelt intersection and where the country pinches in around the road at Soda Butte, park the car, walk up the hillside until you had a sweeping view of the valley, and get out the binoculars and start looking for wolves along the treeline and in the swales where they would be out of sight of the highway but visible to the brave, solitary, resourceful amateur mammalogist, moi.
7_26	0.068279591	Even with a plan, it is good to be flexible.
7_27	0.067632241	Less than halfway from Gardiner to the place I had in mind, the Lamar Valley near Slough Creek Road, I noticed a road sign for something called Blacktail Plateau Drive.
7_28	0.085064378	It was a one-way dirt road, six miles in length, a second sign explained.
7_29	0.025054064	No problem.
7_30	0.077504942	The day was young, and a six mile dirt-road detour doesn't slow you down much in a park that has a 45-mile-per-hour speed limit on the most open roads.
7_31	0.082948505	And halfway down the dirt, a very large coyote ran across the road in front of the car.
7_32	0.065231931	That is what my brain said: ``Big coyote''.
7_33	0.088280914	Like the elk, I hadn't seen a wolf in my life.
7_34	0.075058873	Well, unlike the elk, I'd seen a couple running around a cage in the London Zoo.
7_35	0.090382272	Then the brain took a timeout: too huge around.

7_40	0.087295182	So, taking a lifetime of wildlife watching experience in hand, I parked the car off the road, got the binoculars, and started scanning the ridgeline toward which my wolf had disappeared.
7_41	0.083148662	He (she, it, whatever) would have to come up out of the low country and cross that ridge, that's what the well-trained brain said.
7_42	0.072960942	Another vehicle stopped, and a man and a woman got out with their binoculars.
7_43	0.076770896	This is what happens in Yellowstone when anyone sees anyone else peering through lenses at the distant vistas.
7_44	0.063448518	``Wolf,'' I whispered.
7_45	0.035140281	``Went that way''.
7_46	0.066573685	A few minutes later, I felt a gentle nudge.
7_47	0.085817658	``Wolf,'' the man said in a conversational tone.

7_51	0.11520347	A long way behind, two or three football fields away, up on a bench were wolves.
7_52	0.098539445	And suddenly, the brain also remarked that those hadn't been dogs barking, those were wolves having a discussion about where to go to eat what.
7_53	0.12648827	We watched wolves for an hour.
7_54	0.086309812	A couple disappeared, one at a time, over a more distant ridge line.
7_55	0.080661549	The remaining two did interesting wolf things.

7_62	0.077544555	It was not as good as watching them eat an elk, I suppose, but it was enormously satisfying.
7_63	0.089945132	In the entire hour, no more than four cars stopped to not dance with the wolves but to peer at them through binoculars, spotting scopes, and long camera lenses.

8_0	0.21813728	At the end of November, after bullets had felled 5 animals, biologists recaptured the last free-roaming survivor of 11 Mexican wolves released with fanfare just eight months earlier in Arizona's Apache National Forest, bringing a temporary halt to a celebrated 20-year cooperative program between the United States and Mexico to restore this distinctive subspecies of the gray wolf, which became extinct in the wild in 1977.
8_1	0.23054408	By the end of the year biologists, who have bred from just 5 animals a total of 150 wolves with the ultimate goal of having 100 in the wild and 240 in captivity, had begun reintroducing the wolves into the wild again.
8_2	0.14683019	But whether they can achieve their goal, and at what cost to the wolves, remain open questions.
8_3	0.15972652	Long practiced as a way to replace stocks for hunting and fishing, captive breeding came to be seen in the 1970s as a panacea for species teetering on the edge of extinction.

8_5	0.16980042	In the 1970s and 80s, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service collected not only Mexican wolves but also red wolves, California condors, and black-footed ferrets from the wild in order to restore their populations through captive breeding, in cooperation with zoos, and then return them to their native habitats.
8_6	0.095793624	Similar programs were begun for species in other parts of the world while advances in reproductive technologies inspired plans for preserving frozen embryos and sperm in high-technology gene banks.
8_7	0.11995868	In 1994 the World Conservation Union's captive breeding specialist group suggested that the world's zoos could breed and maintain as many as 2,000 endangered species of vertebrates.
8_8	0.11840255	The recent developments with the Mexican wolf and those three other high-profile rescue programs have underscored the perils and promise of reintroducing captive bred animals.
8_9	0.1140831	The program to restore red wolves suffered a major setback last fall when officials removed the remnants of a group of some 30 animals that had been reintroduced into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee for lack of sufficient prey.
8_10	0.12040613	With one free-ranging population of nearly 100 animals in eastern North Carolina, project leaders are seeking suitable habitat for future releases, but blocks of more than 170,000 acres with minimal risk of conflicts with human activities and sufficient prey for wolves are scarce in the Southeastern United States.
8_11	0.12235344	On the other hand, biologists estimate that there are as many as 56 condors now riding thermal currents over Southern California and adjacent areas _ a remarkable recovery for the huge carrion eater that became extinct in the wild in 1987.
8_12	0.086714719	And the black-footed ferret, which nearly vanished from the Earth a decade ago, is producing a bumper crop of kits in and out of captivity, primarily in South Dakota, Montana, and a large breeding operation in Wyoming.
8_13	0.059694576	But the condor and black-footed ferret remain vulnerable.
8_14	0.1195635	Although they have bred well in captivity, none of the released condors has yet reproduced in the wild, and they are particularly sensitive to lead, which litters the landscape and is toxic to them in small doses.

8_16	0.085893562	Even without the plague, habitat is being lost at an alarming rate to development and prairie-dog eradication programs.
8_17	0.14458091	Peter Gober, a United States Fish and Wildlife Service biologist in Pierre, S.D., said, ``I don't expect the ferret ever to be recovered to the point where it can be downlisted from endangered to threatened''.
8_18	0.09359573	Indeed, despite the sometimes spectacular achievements of these programs, captive breeding has come under fire in recent years as a costly, often futile exercise that does little to address the underlying problems, especially habitat loss and fragmentation, not to mention poaching and pollutants, that are pushing species toward extinction.

8_24	0.10376623	Other problems include a lack of space and resources for preserving populations of animals indefinitely, the development of behavioral problems in some species, and inbreeding among captive animals that can lead to genetic abnormalities and other health problems.

10_0	0.1678651	(UNDATED) _ Under crystal skies, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt carried two burdens Monday into the pine-studded forests of eastern Arizona.
10_1	0.041432963	One was a heavy steel cage.
10_2	0.44587567	Inside was one of two endangered Mexican gray wolves delivered Monday to the wilds of the Apache and Gila national forests.
10_3	0.18977917	The second was a message for those who in recent weeks have gunned down three of the rare lobos, including the mother of the first wolf pup born in the wilds of Arizona in half a century.
10_4	0.16043779	``The wolf is here to stay,'' said the former Arizona governor.
10_5	0.24765491	Babbitt returned to the same rocky ridge where in January he took part in the release of the first 11 wolves into the wilds of the Southwest in nearly three decades.
10_6	0.094564974	``It's just incomprehensible that people would view this (wolf) as a threat, and that they would resort to this kind of violence,'' he said.
10_7	0.17991717	Although sheep and cattle ranchers feared their herds would be decimated, the wolves have not killed any livestock.
10_8	0.23265892	A reward of $30,000 is posted for information leading to the arrest of the wolf killers.
10_9	0.16780832	The killing of an endangered animal can result in a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.
10_10	0.18282883	The wolves are being returned to the wild in an effort to increase their numbers, remove them from the list of species in danger of extinction and put back a predator into the Southwest ecosystems that will help ensure populations of other animals are kept in check.
10_11	0.099209825	Babbitt met Monday morning in Albuquerque with state and federal law enforcement officers from Arizona and New Mexico, and he promised to provide whatever resources are needed to bring the killer or killers to justice.
10_12	0.15170831	And he promised to return again this winter, when four additional wolf packs are planned to be released, part of a multiyear plan to eventually have more than 100 wild wolves scattered over 5,000 square miles of some of the most rugged land along the Arizona-New Mexico line.
10_13	0.11007044	Babbitt also left open the possibility that a federal investigation may not be over for a Tucson man who killed the first wolf in April _ a controversial shooting that was ruled an act of self-defense.
10_14	0.13141446	He said decisions in the case involving retired postal worker Richard Humphrey are up to law enforcement agents.
10_15	0.080259078	But when pressed for whether the case may be reopened, Babbitt said, ``I'd just rather not comment on it''.
10_16	0.092577091	The interior secretary, who heads the U.S.
10_17	0.16325296	Fish and Wildlife Service, said there is no evidence that Humphrey or any member of his family was under attack.
10_18	0.13500336	And he said it remains true that there is no documented case of a healthy wild wolf in North America this century ever attacking a human being.
10_19	0.17649421	``I don't think the facts support any inference that the wolf was anything other than an animal that happened to be in the neighborhood,'' Babbitt said.
10_20	0.13302938	G.J. of Tucson, a hunting enthusiast who has acted as a spokesman for Humphrey, said he believes it is possible that the three wolves shot in August, October and earlier this month may also have been killed legitimately.
10_21	0.1036846	``It may well be that several people had a run-in with the wolves similar to Humphrey, and are afraid to turn themselves in after witnessing his public crucifixion,'' said Sagi, the former editor of a newsletter called ``Outdoor News''.
10_22	0.08338606	Sagi said he closed shop because of the harassment he's suffered while sticking up for Humphrey.
10_23	0.13025394	Still, Sagi said whoever killed the wolves recently should consult an attorney and turn themselves in to the authorities.
10_24	0.10721398	``Whether a series of accidents or deliberate sabotage, one thing is for sure: The recent killings are a monolithic catastrophe in the effort to reintroduce the Mexican gray wolf, and speak volumes about the need for coalition building in this and any federal effort that potentially impacts recreation and property rights,'' Sagi said.
10_25	0.1310128	Babbitt said the wolf program goes beyond building bridges with the local community.

11_0	0.18356319	You might have read last week about an endangered Mexican gray wolf that was found dead in the White Mountains near the carcass of an elk calf.
11_1	0.31558681	The wolves, raised in captivity, are a recent reintroduction to Arizona, an attempt to re-establish the wolf.
11_2	0.28507819	Unfortunately, this small female was the mother of the only pup born in the wild that still was there.
11_3	0.18404643	Biologists may try to provide food for the motherless pup and attempt to keep it in the wild.
11_4	0.054817514	An alternative would be to capture it and raise it in captivity.

11_7	0.31627293	Fish and Wildlife Service won't prosecute the camper.
11_8	0.091982855	But the death of the female wolf seems more compelling because it apparently happened during a conflict with another predator _ namely a mountain lion, perhaps the most formidable killer in the state.
11_9	0.070868832	But before the confrontation could be figured out completely, federal agents had to determine whether a crime had been committed.
11_10	0.21698164	Since the wolf was an endangered species, the place of her death was treated as a crime scene.
11_11	0.18966001	It's against the law to kill a member of an endangered species.
11_12	0.078718732	The wolf's remains were sent to experts for examination.
11_13	0.037347303	``A chunk of its side was ripped out, which could have been consistent with being shot with a high-powered rifle,'' said &UR; John &UR; Phelps, furbearer specialist for the Arizona Game and Fish Department.
11_14	0.031271521	``That was the first thought''.
11_15	0.078258249	When it was determined that probably wasn't the case, Phelps said, other biologists were allowed to examine the scene.
11_16	0.17477912	It appears, Phelps said, the lion had killed the elk calf and was challenged by the wolf.
11_17	0.082837709	``A pack of wolves can challenge a lion,'' he said, ``but usually an individual wolf wouldn't do that _ especially a small female like that''.
11_18	0.11283593	Perhaps it should have been, but taking out this wolf was no easy task for the lion, according to Phelps.
11_19	0.083174312	``The whole hillside was torn up,'' he said.
11_20	0.050527842	``There apparently was a pretty good fight.

11_22	0.10877802	This was a small wolf, but it put up a good fight.
11_23	0.15845449	This was not typical of a lion kill''.
11_24	0.3555246	Some of the wolves have shown signs of their inexperience in the wild.
11_25	0.069327586	There have been reports that some have shown little fear of humans.
11_26	0.10677339	There was speculation that the dead wolf, probably having never encountered a lion, didn't know how formidable this foe would be.
11_27	0.034282165	But she obviously was aggressive.
11_28	0.12661601	``That's the kind of wolf you'd like out there (if the species is going to re-establish itself),'' Phelps said.

12_1	0.20020381	(AP) --A pack of Mexican gray wolves that repeatedly harassed or attacked cattle in eastern Arizona is being relocated.
12_2	0.11712027	Wildlife officials have tracked the pack --an adult male and female, a female yearling and an unknown number of pups -- for two weeks, following complaints from ranchers in the Apache National Forest.
12_3	0.090230075	The adult male and the yearling were recently captured and officials hope to catch the adult female and her pups and relocate the pack to an area free of livestock.
12_4	0.13656794	Officials heading the federal reintroduction program hope to intercede before the pups get used to livestock as a food source, instead of deer, elk and other wildlife.
12_5	0.077101584	``They tried an experiment in that location and it didn't work and they're responding,'' said C.B.
12_6	0.19379696	Lane, director of natural resources for the Arizona Cattlemen's Association, which opposes the reintroduction program.
12_7	0.09480981	``It gives us a good feeling that the government does understand that there's more to life than just where the wildlife are''.
12_8	0.14337486	On Thursday, federal wildlife officials said they have confirmed two attacks on calves, including a death Sunday.
12_9	0.13402347	Bob Dyson, a spokesman for the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, said there is speculation that pups may have seen, if not participated, in the calf killing.
12_10	0.12083763	Federal officials said there have been other instances where wolves chased cattle but were driven off by people.
12_11	0.23436494	Mexican gray wolves are native to Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico but were shot, poisoned and trapped to near extinction by the 1970s.
12_12	0.3216378	Five packs with more than two dozen wolves are in eastern Arizona's wilderness as part of the reintroduction program.
12_13	0.15571138	Five captive-born wolves released last year were killed and others were re-captured.
13_0	0.23169068	The federal government is preparing to announce that the gray wolf _ which was once nearly shot, trapped and poisoned out of existence in the lower 48 states _ is abundant enough in a few places that it no longer uniformly needs the strict protection afforded the country's most endangered species.
13_1	0.34343372	The Fish and Wildlife Service plans this month to propose dropping the wolf a significant notch under the Endangered Species Act, from endangered to threatened, in all but a small part of its range.
13_2	0.15806119	The change would mean that, in most areas, wolves that kill livestock or otherwise pose a threat to human affairs could be chased away or shot by government agents.
13_3	0.1621334	It also represents the first step toward eventually turning over management of the species, Canis lupus, in many places to state wildlife agencies.
13_4	0.14509434	Just about anything having to do with the wolf, which has been both reviled and revered through much of human history, generates fierce debate, and the proposed change in its status is no different.
13_5	0.1512689	Some conservation groups say the forthcoming plan would relax protections too soon and would declare victory before wolves have recolonized broad parts of their old range.
13_6	0.16636629	Many ranchers and conservative private groups, though, say the laws shielding wolves wrongly limit property owners' rights.
13_7	0.12853566	Wildlife officials acknowledge that, in part, the proposed change _ by allowing shooting of livestock raiders _ is intended to assuage opponents of wolf restoration, including ranchers and their allies in Congress.
13_8	0.15506567	But they argue that the relaxation of rules would be a net benefit for the species by diminishing the tendency of frustrated property owners to resort to illegal, uncontrolled killing of wolves.
13_9	0.13631308	Most significantly, the federal scientists said, the proposed change signals their confidence that the comeback of the wolf, although limited to less than 5 percent of its former range in this country, constitutes an important ecological success story _ like that of the American alligator, peregrine falcon and bald eagle before it.
13_10	0.2606645	They say that the lower 48 states had only about 400 wolves in 1973, when the Endangered Species Act was passed _ almost all of them in Minnesota or Michigan.
13_11	0.12349489	Now more than 3,500 animals roam parts of eight states.
13_12	0.070493834	Thousands more live in Alaska, Canada and parts of Europe.
13_13	0.11822911	``The question of the next decade, will not be how to save the wolf, but rather how best to manage the animal,'' according to a recent status report written by Dr.

13_16	0.10042203	From coast to coast, conservation and property rights groups, ranchers and wildlife watchers still heatedly debate the possible reintroduction of a predator that is a first cousin of man's best friend but also is an age-old antagonist.
13_17	0.16087768	Last year, New Hampshire's Legislature approved a bill banning the reintroduction of wolves.
13_18	0.13003362	Oregon's congressional delegation has repeatedly introduced language that would limit wolf protections or bar even the natural migration of wolves from adjacent states.
13_19	0.14395526	Two wolves wandered into Oregon in the last year from experimental packs transplanted into central Idaho.
13_20	0.13553044	One was captured and sent home by federal officials and the other was killed by a car.
13_21	0.18039684	Environmental groups hailed the dispersing wolves as pioneers returning the call of the wild to the state after a 50-year absence.
13_22	0.087382638	Ranching groups said the state was well rid of them and did not need them back.
13_23	0.092734309	``We have excessive numbers of cougars, coyotes and bears that take a heavy toll on the other wildlife and livestock and we simply cannot add another predator,'' said Sharon Beck, a past president of the Oregon Cattlemen's Association.
13_24	0.12549888	But in some places, there are signs that wolves are becoming an accepted feature of the landscape outside of parks and preserves, and conflicts are shifting from whether they should be there to how they should be dealt with.
13_25	0.087434246	Some Montana ranchers have figured out high-tech ways of driving them away instead of resorting to high-powered rifles and a strategy popularly known as ``shoot, shovel and shut up''.
13_26	0.12973061	On his 4,000-acre ranch in Montana's Bitterroot Valley, Tom Ruffatto recently installed loud alarms that are triggered by the radio tracking collars used to monitor most of the area's wolf packs.
13_27	0.10546493	Ruffatto's project was partly paid for by Defenders of Wildlife, a private group that also writes checks to cover livestock losses from wolf attacks.
13_28	0.14324171	In Minnesota and parts of Wisconsin and Michigan, wolves are so abundant _ some have dens just 50 miles from Minneapolis _ that they could theoretically be removed entirely from the endangered list.
13_29	0.13487005	The only impediment lies in Minnesota, which has yet to follow the other two states and create its own wolf management program _ a prerequisite if federal protection is to be ended.
13_30	0.10184112	``No matter what is done in Minnesota, there's no way of threatening the wolf there anymore,'' said Mech (pronounced MEECH).
13_31	0.08211691	``I can't conceive of anything, excluding poison, that would endanger this population''.
13_32	0.13407879	Under the agency's classification scheme, the only place wolves would remain endangered would be portions of southern Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, where efforts to bolster a particularly rare subspecies have faltered, wildlife officials say.
13_33	0.12889174	As drafts of the new wolf classification proposal have circulated, private conservation groups, scientists, ranchers and others with an interest in the animal have begun lobbying for changes and girding for hearings and _ inevitably _ lawsuits.
13_34	0.092977533	Once it is formally released, the proposed classification change will be the subject of four months of public comment _ twice the required length _ and eight months of internal discussions and possible changes before it becomes a rule.

13_36	0.12020568	OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn The tug of war now is between those who want wolves restored to broader parts of their range, including the southern Rockies and the Northeast, and those who say that the existing numbers are sufficient.
13_37	0.15341222	The Endangered Species Act includes much flexibility on this point, containing no clear guidance on how much of a species' original range needs to be restored before it is declared saved.
13_38	0.25083001	A recent draft of the proposal was provided to a reporter by someone outside the Fish and Wildlife Service.
13_39	0.11896448	Officials at the agency said that almost all of the draft's major points would be reflected in the final version.
13_40	0.18555381	Under the plan, wolf habitat in the lower 48 states would be divided into four regions, with separate recovery plans for each.
13_41	0.088535223	The western Great Lakes region would encompass Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota and South Dakota.
13_42	0.12785739	The western region would be Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and parts of northern New Mexico and Arizona.
13_43	0.16802877	The southwestern region, the only one where wolves would remain endangered, would include some parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Texas.
13_44	0.098783171	The northeastern region would be New York, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine.
13_45	0.12901695	Wolves have not been seen in the Adirondacks in 100 years and only two possible sightings have been made in Maine, which is considered the likeliest spot for any future reintroduction effort.
13_46	0.1579228	But federal wildlife officials said they were not even sure what kind of wolves inhabited the Northeast, with some genetic studies suggesting that they were red wolves, a different species altogether.
13_47	0.10371643	In part because of those questions, no recovery effort is likely in the Northeast for many years, officials said.
13_48	0.16357297	In the rest of the contiguous states, the proposal says, wolves are never likely to be seen again, and thus in these areas _ 30 states in all _ the animals will be dropped from the list entirely, leaving any future decisions about restoration up to state officials.
13_49	0.12003814	Criticism of the impending plan is particularly acute in Colorado, where private wildlife groups have banded together into a coalition aimed at trying to replicate in the southern Rockies the successes with wolf introduction in Yellowstone National Park and Idaho.
13_50	0.092265825	Tina Arapkiles, a regional representative for the Sierra Club in Boulder, Colo.
13_51	0.17389983	, said the Fish and Wildlife Service was trying to wrap things up before the job was done.
13_52	0.13035673	``Their own studies said that over 1,000 wolves could exist in 11 of the national forests in Colorado alone,'' Arapkiles said.
13_53	0.096716712	Private land owners, including Ted Turner, the media tycoon, have offered expansive tracts of land, rich in elk and other prey, that could serve as wolf habitat, she added.
13_54	0.078982996	``To ignore that kind of potential is foolhardy,'' Arapkiles said.
13_55	0.21429546	But federal wildlife officials are standing by their conclusions, saying that the federal list of endangered species is the ecological equivalent of a hospital's intensive care unit, and that wolves are clearly ready for the recovery room.
13_56	0.1931425	Ron Refsnider, a wolf biologist for the wildlife agency based in Minnesota and the main author of the classification proposal, said there was still plenty of work to do to nurture the wolves living in the northern Rockies and especially in the Southwest.
13_57	0.12145808	``At best, those wolves have a tiny toehold on the landscape,'' Refsnider said, referring to areas along the Mexican border that could support the Mexican subspecies.
13_58	0.12022616	Right now, he said, fewer than two dozen wolves roam there.
13_59	0.10962073	Any significant new federal programs to expand the range of wolves, he said, would come at the expense of other species that might be just as important ecologically, but that do not have the mystique and high profile of a legendary predator.
13_60	0.087260066	``There was no intention that the act should be providing long-term care for these species,'' Refsnider said.
13_61	0.08687239	``The intent is to pull them back from the brink for the foreseeable future and turn them over to normal management agencies.

18_0	0.14734876	The Clinton Administration's trademark new approach to enforcing the Endangered Species Act on millions of acres of private lands has often relied on shaky science, a broad new study has found.
18_1	0.10439411	The draft study, performed by 119 independent scientists with National Science Foundation funding, highlights scientific weaknesses in more than 200 Habitat Conservation Plans, which the administration has fequently substituted for bans on disturbing species protected by the Act.
18_2	0.23686359	The plans are agreements between landowners and the federal government.
18_3	0.081721973	They allow the landowners to develop, mine, log _ or otherwise use _ their property.
18_4	0.10744976	In return, the landowners agree to make habitat improvements that lessen the harm to the endangered plants or animals.
18_5	0.12870045	The plans have reshaped the way the Endangered Species Act is enforced on about 5 million acres of state and private land, and they're spreading rapidly.
18_6	0.087991099	The areas covered by the habitat conservation plans range from suburban sage-scrub brush of gnatcatchers in Southern California to the red-cockaded woodpecker's longleaf pine forests in North Carolina.
18_7	0.13112737	Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said he welcomed the study as ``innovative'' and ``helpful''.
18_8	0.078988658	He said it is spurring his agency to rewrite guidelines for habitat planning.
18_9	0.10756678	Overall, the study concludes that the plans often lack scientific support for conclusions that they would help at-risk species.
18_10	0.099529659	Plans commonly fail to assess how many protected plants or animals would be disturbed, show how this would affect the species' survival, or prescribe monitoring that will indicate how the species actually fare, the study says.
18_11	0.12149987	The problems stem, in part, from a lack of available scientific data, according to the study, which also says that the estimates of the plans' impact on senstivie species are, at times, ``very close to a guess''.
18_12	0.088739018	The Clinton administration contends the plans get owners of private land, the site of 80 percent of endangered species habitat, to preserve or improve habitat that otherwise might be lost.

18_17	0.1134975	A draft of the new study, obtained by the Post-Intelligencer, supported some of those complaints.
18_18	0.10984425	It found: _ No estimates regarding the number of at-risk plants or animals killed or disrupted by the authorized plans were done for about two-thirds of the species covered.
18_19	0.12103408	_ Inadequate assessment of the impact of those losses on the species' survival was ``especially common''.
18_20	0.21897947	_ Almost two-thirds of the plans fail to show that the improvements minimize damage to the species as much as is practicable, as the Endangered Species Act requires.
18_21	0.11384355	_ Less than 10 percent of the plans ``had clear monitoring programs that were sufficient for evaluating success''.
18_22	0.10685739	_ About 25 percent of the plans fail to assess whether habitat is currently sufficient to support recovery of the species or what cumulative impacts would result from piecemeal loss of habitat.
18_23	0.097451423	_ The agency has been negotiating plans that last as long as 100 years, with guarantees that no further concessions will be asked, without regard to uncertainties about whether they will provide adequate species protection.

19_0	0.17244789	Timber wolves from Canada are unlikely to recolonize the northeastern United States on their own, leaving the politically more contentious course of deliberate reintroduction as the best strategy for restoring the wild wolf's howl to the region, a new study sponsored by New York's Wildlife Conservation Society has found.
19_1	0.10550308	While there are corridors of natural habitat through which wolves from southern Quebec might move into Maine, the study found, many barriers inhibit their passage, most importantly legal hunting and trapping, which have long been a way of life in that region of Canada.
19_2	0.1633385	``It's a pretty intense gantlet they would have to run'' to survive in numbers sufficient to establish a permanent population in the United States, said Dr.

19_4	0.19887836	Weber was one of four authors of the study, which appears in the current issue of the Wildlife Society Bulletin, a scientific journal.
19_5	0.13472522	Even if a few lone wolves were to succeed in filtering into the northeastern states, the study found, they might well mate with the region's abundant coyotes.
19_6	0.090756843	This could create a hybrid population in which the wolf gene pool would eventually be swamped, defeating the very purpose of recolonization.
19_7	0.12485138	Artificially reintroducing intact wolf packs might overcome that difficulty, some scientists believe, since packs tend to kill coyotes rather than breed with them.
19_8	0.12758465	Conservation organizations, led by the Washington-based Defenders of Wildlife, have been pressing for the re-establishment of timber wolves in northern New England or the Adirondacks or both, where they were once plentiful but have been extinct for about a century.
19_9	0.10752601	The new study ``says what we have felt all along, that natural colonization probably isn't highly likely,'' said Nina Fascione, the director of species conservation for the Defenders of Wildlife.
19_10	0.15545067	Although wolves are plentiful in Canada and Alaska, several species of them have long been legally protected as endangered or threatened in the contiguous 48 states, where populations numbering in the thousands were hunted to the verge of extinction, or beyond, well into the 20th century.
19_11	0.22419729	Today, gray wolves are on the rebound in two former American strongholds, the Northern Rockies and the upper Great Lakes.
19_12	0.10961619	More than 30 packs totaling 400 to 500 wolves now inhabit large areas of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, mostly because wolves artificially introduced from western Canada in 1995 and 1996 have rapidly reproduced.
19_13	0.10831583	Some 2,500 wolves now live in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, where they always lived.
19_14	0.13825166	The Midwestern and Western wolves are doing so well, in fact, that federal officials plan to remove the Great Lakes population from the protected list soon and hope they will be able to follow with the newly re-established Northern Rockies population in two or three years.
19_15	0.21131386	The Mexican wolf is also being restored to the Southwest, albeit with much difficulty, and the red wolf has been re-established in the Southeast.
19_16	0.36948614	As a result of these efforts, according to the new study and others, the wolf population of the United States outside Alaska has doubled and the wolf's range has nearly tripled.
19_17	0.14575152	Now federal officials are turning their attention to the Northeast.
19_18	0.23739068	After the plan to reclassify some wolves under the Endangered Species Act is published in the Federal Register for public comment, perhaps next month, the U.S.
19_19	0.23766777	Fish and Wildlife Service will begin putting together a recovery plan for wolves in the Northeast, said Paul Nickerson, a wildlife biologist who heads the agency's regional office of endangered species in Hadley, Mass.
19_20	0.062737003	All recovery options will be considered, he said.
19_21	0.13218943	From the standpoint of conserving biological diversity, the basic rationale for re-establishing wolves in the Northeast could be strengthened by recent genetic studies by Canadian scientists.
19_22	0.15536641	Their findings, not yet published, suggest that the timber wolf of eastern Canada and formerly of the eastern United States, long considered a subspecies of gray wolf, is in fact a separate species and may be more closely related to the red wolf than the gray.
19_23	0.18986831	Proponents of wolf recovery say that restoring wolves would help to re-establish natural ecological relationships long sundered in the Northeast.
19_24	0.10828704	For instance, wolves prey on moose, which are too big for coyotes.
19_25	0.10859284	Moose have flourished in northern New England, both because there are no predators and because logging has created ideal second-growth habitat for them.
19_26	0.025844697	(STORY CAN END HERE.
19_27	0.10033068	OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) nn Wolves, which along with cougars were historically the region's top predators, might restore some natural equilibrium with moose, say the advocates, just as they might help control runaway deer and beaver populations.
19_28	0.14837093	In addition, the carcasses of animals killed by wolves provide food for scavengers that are essential elements of a complete ecosystem.
19_29	0.12166356	Moreover, wolves have acquired a certain cachet, as their new popularity in Yellowstone testifies, and proponents say they bring in tourist dollars.
19_30	0.13449931	But opponents, as they did in the West, argue that wolves would prey on livestock.
19_31	0.15338524	There have been some attacks in the West, and owners of the livestock have been compensated from a special fund set up by the Defenders of Wildlife.
19_32	0.15689446	In Idaho and around Yellowstone, owners are allowed under federal rules to shoot wolves they see attacking livestock, and some have been legally killed.
19_33	0.13973304	Some opponents also fear that wolves might attack people, but experts on wolves say that they strongly fear humans and avoid them.
19_34	0.1485227	Ms. Fascione said that for her, the possibility of interbreeding between wolves and coyotes was the biggest concern about the success of wolf restoration in the Northeast.
19_35	0.1819643	Her organization, which has been instrumental in the Northern Rockies wolf restoration, is completing its own two-part study of restoration in the Northeast.
19_36	0.12073646	An earlier study sponsored by the Wildlife Conservation Society, in 1997, concluded that the Adirondacks were too removed from Canadian wolf packs for any natural recolonization to take place.
19_37	0.13941181	It also found that the Adirondacks had little more than half the area needed to sustain a wolf population.
19_38	0.12857842	If wolves were put into the Adirondacks, Weber said in a recent interview, they would probably expand into more of upstate New York and neighboring New England.
19_39	0.08903995	The 1997 study found that northern New England was a better bet than the Adirondacks for both natural colonization and for providing sufficiently extensive habitat.
19_40	0.11649094	It also identified two possible corridors near Quebec City along which wolves could disperse from Quebec into Maine.
19_41	0.10048541	The authors of that study said, however, that further investigation would be required to determine whether wolves were actually likely to move along the corridors.
19_42	0.071486948	The new study found that highways, railroads and the St.
19_43	0.097143096	Lawrence River posed formidable barriers across these corridors.
19_44	0.10467656	It also concluded that intensive hunting and snaring, coupled with negative attitudes toward wolves, would further inhibit their spread.
19_45	0.14627736	Moreover, the study found, hunting and trapping had reduced the wolf population of southern Quebec enough to lessen the pressure on wolves to migrate to the United States.
19_46	0.16422121	The authors said that natural colonization remained a possibility if Canada and the United States worked together to protect wolves in the dispersal corridors.
19_47	0.17975553	It also noted that any reintroduction of wolves to the northeastern United States would require Canadian cooperation, since the wolves would probably spread into New Brunswick.

24_0	0.32024342	Experimental restoration of the gray wolf to Montana, Idaho and Wyoming has been so successful since 1995, federal officials say, that the first steps toward a single, integrated wolf population in the Northern Rockies have now been taken.
24_1	0.17833291	In the Yellowstone area, where wolves have been most visible to wildlife enthusiasts, there are now about 110 adult wolves and roughly 60 newborn pups organized into 11 or 12 packs, said Edward E.

24_3	0.075863351	The wilderness of central Idaho is home to at least 12 packs with about 115 adults and 60 to 65 pups.
24_4	0.13660896	Canadian wolves were introduced to these two areas in 1995 and 1996, and natural reproduction has steadily expanded their populations since then.
24_5	0.10962609	In addition, 8 packs with about 60 adults and some 50 pups now inhabit northwestern Montana as a result of natural southward expansion of wolves from Canada that began in the mid-1980s.
24_6	0.10555515	About 10 percent of the wolves die each year from various causes, including starvation, predation by mountain lions, auto collisions, avalanches, old age and gunshots.
24_7	0.16330909	Most of the latter killings were done legally, after wolves preyed on livestock.
24_8	0.11731372	Just as significant as their numbers is the fact that in at least two instances, wolves from different populations have mated, making a genetic connection that could be the foundation for a single Rockies population.
24_9	0.19932333	And for the first time since the reintroductions, wolves have taken up territories well outside Yellowstone Park in the last year.
24_10	0.091190551	One pack each has established itself near Cody, Dubois and Jackson, all in Wyoming, some 50 miles from the park boundary.

24_14	0.13853299	The Yellowstone wolves generally have concentrated on the park's abundant elk population.
24_15	0.11266804	From 1995 through 1998, 80 cattle, 190 sheep and 12 dogs were confirmed victims of the Northern Rockies wolves.

24_18	0.088988838	By comparison, according to the report, livestock producers in Montana alone lose an average of 142,000 sheep and 86,000 cattle, valued at $45 million year, to all causes each year.
24_19	0.27693255	A federal court has decided that the rules under which reintroduced wolves can be killed violate the Endangered Species Act and has ordered all the wolves removed from Central Idaho and Yellowstone.
24_20	0.044409614	The case is now on appeal.
24_21	0.14142241	As a practical matter, Bangs said, the wolves are now so numerous and well-established that removing them would be a problem.
24_22	0.11646841	``You could remove all the wolves,'' he said, ``but you couldn't catch them all alive''.
24_23	0.17527965	Many of the wolves born after the initial reintroductions are not wearing radio collars and would be hard to find.
24_24	0.064842536	``To recapture all of them would be very difficult,'' Bangs said.
24_25	0.20014264	If the restoration program survives the court challenge, the Northern Rockies wolf population can be removed from protection under the Endangered Species Act when there have been at least 100 wolves and 10 packs in each of the three recovery areas.
