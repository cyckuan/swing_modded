2_8	0.0	Many couples in search of a child are already depleted, emotionally and financially, by drawn-out fertility treatments.
2_9	0.0	Still, they will pay $15,000 to $20,000 on average, even if they have to mortgage their futures, to find their babies.

2_12	0.0	Adoption is, in a rough analogy to organ transplants, a legal transfer not subject to purchase or bidding.
2_13	0.14285714285714285	Nowhere in the United States is it legal to sell a child, and few say it should be.

2_33	0.0	They might, in an independent adoption, locate a woman in their own state who has minimal expenses and is certain she wants to place her child; without any legal or medical complications, the total cost might be several thousand dollars.
2_34	0.0	Placements by state agencies often cost nothing.

2_36	0.0	These gray-market placements, which usually involve questionable payments to birth mothers and the brokers who find them, have prompted much legislation and public attention; still, they are a tiny percentage of adoptions.
2_37	0.0	Finally, the stamp of the marketplace is apparent in one troubling fact: In the baby bazaar, with children of varying colors, cultures and conditions, something resembling a price schedule has emerged.

2_46	0.0	At the same time, according to a rough estimate by the adoption council, about 1 million families are seeking to adopt.
2_47	0.4	The old-line agencies tried to adapt by letting birth mothers choose adoptive parents.
2_48	0.125	But in the late 1970s, would-be parents began defecting to lawyers who could help them adopt independently if they _ or the lawyers _ could find a birth mother directly.

9_1	0.4090909090909091	The treaty, called the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoptions, is considered by adoption professionals and politicians active on the issue to be the most ambitious effort ever attempted to reform adoption, streamline the process, and weed out corruption worldwide.

9_5	0.5	``The lack of ratification was going to have disastrous consequences for all Americans who are interested in international adoptions''.
9_6	0.4	Among its major provisions, the treaty would: establish the first global standards intended to protect children from being sold and improve procedures for finding them homes; prevent coercion of birth parents by unscrupulous practitioners who want their children; and set guidelines to cut red tape and otherwise steamline the process for adoptive parents.
9_7	0.0625	Sources on Capitol Hill and within the US adoption community predicted enactment of the implementing legislation and of the treaty itself could be completed before Congress adjourns for its August recess.
9_8	0.0	US ratification was delayed partly because the process is lengthy, but also because some American politicians wanted to amend the agreement in ways that were so controversial that they stalled its consideration.
9_9	0.04	In recent months, as a carefully crafted compromise draft of the implementing legislation appeared close to passage, one lawmaker in the Senate and one in the House threatened to use parliamentary maneuvers to prevent the treaty's ratification if their concerns weren't addressed.

9_12	0.0	Smith finally gave his okay to the House measure after it some changes that appear to give him some of what he wanted.
9_13	0.4166666666666667	The implementing language requires each ratifying country to establish a ``central authority'' to deal with international adoptions.
9_14	0.25	The revision obtained by Smith dictates that the US central authority will notify American practitioners of the criteria set by other countries for prospective adoptive parents.
9_15	0.8333333333333334	Because China and some other nations are averse to adoption of their children by gay and single adults, many would-be parents could be excluded.
9_16	0.0	But there's a loophole: The ``sending'' country would have to formally notify the US central authority of any restrictions _ which may not happen because it's in the interest of those countries to find families for thousands of orphaned and homeless children.

9_19	0.0	... The deal is done''.

9_21	0.3125	Many if not most states, however, would probably leave such undertakings to the State Department _ which currently has jurisdiction over international adoptions and would be the home of America's central authority.
9_22	0.0	The other revision obtained by Brownback, who with his wife adopted a daughter from China last December, was to insert language giving extra time for small and medium agencies to meet the treaty's standards and gain accreditation.

9_27	0.36363636363636365	The most important immediate result, according to nearly everyone interviewed, is that nations with concerns about American adoption practices _ most pointedly Russia and Romania, which have recently halted the adoption of their children _ will be reassured about the US commitment to reform.
