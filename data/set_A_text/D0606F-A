1_4	0.39285714285714285	Greenhouse gas emissions - blamed for global warming - may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century, a new scientific study predicted recently.
1_5	0.35714285714285715	Using recent technological advances in climate modelling and new scientific research on ice and oceans, Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist at the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund, made three predictions on the impact of climate change on the Antarctic Ice Sheet.
1_6	0.2962962962962963	In two of the three scenarios, complete melting would raise global sea level by an average four to six metres, causing major coastal flooding worldwide, Oppenheimer wrote in the latest issue of the scientific journal Nature'.
1_7	0.2	In the other scenario, the internal ice shifting within the ice sheet could cause the melting to slow down.
1_8	0.08695652173913043	With its 3.8 million cubic kilometers of ice at the South Pole, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet posed the 'most immediate threat of a large sea-level rise, owing to its potential instability,'' Oppenheimer said.
1_9	0.42857142857142855	Changes in ocean temperature and circulation expected to accompany global warming could disintegrate the large ice sheet, as early as next century, he said.
1_10	0.35	The West Antarctic Ice Sheet first attracted widespread attention 30 years ago when scientists suggested that global warming caused by greenhouse gases might cause its disintegration.
1_11	0.09523809523809523	Greenhouse gas emissions - including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
1_12	0.1111111111111111	In 1995 an international panel of scientists that advises the United Nations on the issue, predicted that the average global temperatures could heat up between one and 3.5 degrees Celsius during the next century.
1_13	0.0	Last year, scientists declared 1997 the warmest year on record, and the fact that nine of the past 11 years set new records for warm temperatures bolstered the view that greenhouse emissions were raising the average temperature.
1_14	0.26666666666666666	Over time, these increases could cause changes in climate, including the increased frequency and intensity of storms, floods, heat waves, and droughts, the scientists said.
1_15	0.047619047619047616	To deal with this threat 38 industrialised countries agreed at a conference last December in Kyoto, Japan to reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gases by about six percent overall between 2008 and 2012.
1_16	0.4482758620689655	While countries work out the details of the Kyoto agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that the lack of scientific understanding of the effects of global warming on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet limits the ability to predict the risk of the collapse' or melting'.
1_17	0.2631578947368421	But Oppenheimer warned that, as countries begin to formulate global warming policies, 'the potential hazards from the collapse of the ice sheet is too large and irreversible'' to be considered at a later date.
1_18	0.36363636363636365	Conflicting scientific views on the effect global warming would have on ice caps had confused the issue, Oppenheimer said.
1_19	0.09090909090909091	Until recently, scientific studies argued that the West Ice Sheet and Antarctica as a whole were growing not disintegrating or melting.
1_20	0.5384615384615384	Similarly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that over the past century Antarctica did not cause sea-levels to rise at all.
1_21	0.0	Yet, recent studies had found high melting rates under the floating ice, he added.
1_22	0.125	In combination with other findings of shrinking icebergs, these new melting rates exceeded the estimated growth of the ice in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.
1_23	0.125	Oppenheimer pointed to studies made of two ice shelves to the north of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that had been disintegrating for several decades, possibly because of local atmospheric warming.
1_24	0.1	While most scientists agreed that the ice sheet was shrinking, they disagreed on how fast it will melt and what the consequences would be.
1_25	0.25	In an effort to simplify the controversy, Oppenheimer produced what he believed would be the three most probable effects of global warming on this relatively unstable sheet of ice.
1_26	0.11764705882352941	Each of the three most likely possibilities varied according to how fast the West Antarctic Ice Sheet responded to the melting and disintegration of various glaciers and ice shelves in the area.
1_27	0.5714285714285714	Using the climate change predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel and the continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions, Oppenheimer predicted that in two of the possible scenarios sea levels would rise four to six metres.
1_28	0.0	While most of the sea-level increase would occur beyond the twenty-first century for several hundreds of years, the process could begin in as early as 50 years.
1_29	0.0	Some reports said the process already had begun.
1_30	0.07692307692307693	In the other scenario, Oppenheimer believed that internal ice shifting within the ice sheet possibly could cause the melting to slow down.

8_1	1.1	Is the Arctic a key to the way in which global warming might be translated into region-by-region climatic changes?
8_2	0.2	The answer, many experts believe, may depend on how much fresh water flows into the North Atlantic Ocean as a result of melting Arctic ice and the runoff from an increase in Northern Hemisphere precipitation that some scientists say is already resulting from global warming.
8_3	0.05	The theory behind this view holds that the climate of the North Atlantic region, including Europe and eastern North America, is controlled by great ocean currents that transport heat northward from the tropics.
8_4	0.0	This oceanic conveyor belt is set in motion when saltier, and therefore heavier, surface water sinks to the deep ocean in the vicinity of southern Greenland.
8_5	0.0	It is replaced by warm water from the tropics that warms the North Atlantic region.
8_6	0.1111111111111111	Without it, the relatively mild climate of England, for instance, might be as cold as that of northern Canada.
8_7	0.0	The worry is that a great influx of fresh water from the thawing Arctic might dilute the salty current and so either halt or weaken the heat-bearing conveyor belt.
8_8	0.0	This could result in a sudden, long-term drop in the North Atlantic region's temperature, a climatic disruption that would probably reverberate around the hemisphere by altering large-scale atmospheric circulation.
8_9	0.0	Last week, scientists reported that the current did indeed weaken or stop at least twice in the past, plunging the region, which each time had been warming, into cold comparable to that of an ice age.
8_10	0.0	Other researchers, focusing on the present, last week produced the latest in a lengthening string of studies documenting the thawing of the vast sheet of ice that covers the far northern seas, a potential source of fresh water that, once it melts, could help weaken the heat conveyor.
8_11	0.0	A third research group, using computerized simulations of the ocean-atmosphere system, concluded that the present-day thawing of Northern Hemisphere sea ice could not be explained by natural causes.
8_12	0.3	The most obvious possible cause, they said, is global warming produced by heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide, which result from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas.
8_13	0.0	And they said the rate of sea-ice melting was likely to increase in the decades ahead if emissions of the heat-trapping gases continued at today's rates.
8_14	0.0	Sudden influxes of fresh water from the Arctic appear to have shut down or weakened the oceanic heat conveyor twice in the relatively recent geological past, according to a study reported in the current issue of Nature by Dr.
8_15	0.0	Carsten Ruhlemann of the University of Bremen, Germany, and colleagues.

14_2	0.07692307692307693	The scientists said at a news conference that warmer ocean waters in the Pacific has caused a much higher mortality rate among salmon.

14_5	0.26666666666666666	but these are the sort of events we expect from global warming,'' said David Welch, head of the salmon research project for the Canadian National Department of Fisheries.
14_6	0.5555555555555556	Welch, who is based in British Columbia, said he is convinced that ocean warming reflects broader climate change and raises the possibility of ``large-scale potential changes in the marine ecosystem''.
14_7	0.0	While scientists agree the oceans have become warmer, the reasons remain in dispute.
14_8	0.5	Some scientists argue it reflects broader climate change as a result of heat trapping pollution, but others say it simply reflects cyclical temperature changes, including the El Nino phenomenon.
14_9	0.0	Whatever the reason, higher ocean temperatures already have had dramatic impact on Pacific salmon fisheries, the two biologists said at a news conference sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund and the Marine Conservation Biology Institute.
14_10	0.0	Welch cited as clear evidence of concern the dramatic decline in Alaska's Pacific salmon population in 1997 and again last year.

14_12	0.0	And the in-river mortality rate among salmon returning to spawn soared to 76 percent in 1997, he said.
14_13	0.07142857142857142	Welch attributed the smaller fish and high death rate to the warmer ocean waters that, he said, sapped the salmon of their energy and strength.
14_14	0.0	``We're starting to see a very troubling perspective on this,'' he said.
14_15	0.045454545454545456	The biologists said the high sea temperatures in 1997 and 1998 produced a rate bloom of phytoplankton in the northern Pacific waters typical of waters closer to the equator, causing changes in the food chain.
14_16	0.0	The reduced size of returning salmon and the decrease in overall numbers ``suggests large-scale starvation,'' they said.
14_17	0.5	Welch said that if the warming continues as part of a broader global climate change, the salmon as a species may be forced northward into the Bering Sea, abandoning their traditional Pacific habitat.
14_18	0.0	While that may still be 40 or 50 years in the future, ``the early stages are already here,'' he argued.
14_19	0.45	As for those who argue that the sea temperature rise may only be cyclical, Welch said that the last El Nino was the strongest ever recorded and the frequency of El Nino events has increased, suggesting a broader climate change.

21_0	0.21212121212121213	WASHINGTON, June 13 (Xinhua) --Global warming in the 21st century will likely cause drastic changes in the climate of the United States, including potentially severe droughts, increased risk of flood, mass migrations of species, and widespread erosion of coastal zones, a new federal report released this week says.
21_1	0.5	The report, Climate Change Impacts on the United States: The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, provides the most detailed look ever at the possible impacts of global warming on the United States over the next 100 years.
21_2	0.0	Among its key findings, the report indicates that continued growth in worldwide emissions is likely to increase average temperatures across the United States by 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100.
21_3	0.04	Impacts such as heavier precipitation and increased drought will vary widely from region to region, and some natural ecosystems, such as alpine meadows, coral reefs, coastal wetlands and Alaskan permafrost, are likely to deteriorate further and some may disappear entirely, says the report.
21_4	0.0	Changes in rain and snowfall patterns could affect the availability of fresh water, and crop productivity is likely to rise nationally due to the fertilizing effect of more carbon dioxide in the air, although regional cropping patterns may change significantly.
21_5	0.05	Yet "for the nation as a whole, direct economic impacts are likely to be modest," concludes the report, which is based on computer models and historical data, and "American society would likely be able to adapt to most of the impacts".
21_6	0.0	The program was authorized by Congress in 1990 and carried out by nine federal agencies.
21_7	0.0	The analysis was based largely on two computer simulations of future climate that often produce very different or even antithetical results.
22_0	0.3181818181818182	BUENOS AIRES, October 30 (Xinhua) --The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Wildlife Foundation of Argentina (WFA) on Friday called for the saving of forests and jungles, which are in danger because of the climate change.
22_1	0.0	The WWF and WFA experts told the press here that all the measures to increase the energy efficiency must be taken and less contaminating sources of energy should be used as a final solution to the problem.
22_2	0.0	All the countries, especially the industrialized ones, must commit themselves to take more stringent measures to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions, they added.
22_3	0.0	The press conference was attended by Nigel Dudley, WWF independent consultant, and WFA Director Javier Corcuera.
22_4	0.8461538461538461	Dudley said that the climate change or global warming up threatens the wellbeing of all mankind, and that the climate change impacts are more evident every day in all the world.
22_5	0.7	He said there exist possibilities of the destroying of the forests, because they cannot follow the rhythm of the rapid climate change.
