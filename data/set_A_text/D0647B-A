1_0	0.28	WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration moved forcefully Monday to end the drama over Elian Gonzalez as officials took steps to take custody of the 6-year-old boy from his relatives in Miami as early as Thursday and return him to his father in Cuba.
1_1	0.05263157894736842	At the same time, a federal appeals court in Atlanta said it would hear arguments in the case during the week of May 8, an action that may make it more difficult for the Justice Department to put its plan into effect.
1_2	0.5384615384615384	Justice Department officials laid the groundwork for taking control of Elian by asserting that the boy's Miami relatives had failed to comply with a government request to say explicitly that they would not block his return to his father Cuba if they lost their court fight.
1_3	0.25	As a result, the officials said, they were considering revoking an earlier decision allowing Elian to live with the relatives in Miami who have cared for him since he was rescued at sea in November.
1_4	1.05	Officials scheduled a meeting early Tuesday morning at the regional offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami with the lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives to try to resolve the situation.
1_5	0.23529411764705882	But Justice Department officials warned that they would insist on an unambiguous statement from the relatives that if they lost the legal appeals they would not obstruct efforts to return Elian to his father.

1_14	0.18181818181818182	But Kline said the agency would agree to that only if the relatives said clearly they would send Elian back three days after they lost in the appeals court unless they obtained an injunction from a court allowing them to file an expedited appeal with the Supreme Court.
1_15	0.6666666666666666	Kline also demanded that Elian's family in Miami agree to an expedited schedule of arguments before the appeals court that would have the case argued and ready for a decision by April 4.

2_1	0.0	It now appears he could go home as early as next week.
2_2	0.3888888888888889	The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta unanimously rejected a request by the relatives for reconsideration of a three-judge panel's decision three weeks ago.
2_3	0.5263157894736842	The panel had upheld the US Immigration and Naturalization Service's refusal to allow an asylum hearing for Elian, saying only the child's father could make such a request.
2_4	0.4	The relatives' sole remaining opportunity for an appeal is to the US Supreme Court.
2_5	0.15	But the justices in Washington are widely seen as unlikely to accept the case if they are asked to do so, both because there is no indication of previous judicial error and because the three-judge panel cited a Supreme Court ruling as the rationale for its own decision.

2_14	0.0	The word ``not'' appeared in oversized and boldfaced type.
2_15	0.5294117647058824	Reaction to Friday's development was muted, especially compared to the intense and sometimes raucous response previous legal defeats for Elian's relatives have prompted.
2_16	0.48148148148148145	The Cuban-American community in southern Florida appeared quiet, and there was no hint of gloating from anyone on the winning side ``We are pleased that the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has acted unanimously in denying the motion for rehearing,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said in Washington.
2_17	0.0	``Now that the court has conclusively upheld our decision, I am hopeful that this father and son will soon be able to move on with their lives together''.
2_18	1.3636363636363635	Greg Craig, the attorney for Elian's father, released a short statement that relayed the same sentiments.
2_19	0.09090909090909091	It said, in part: ``We believe that the INS decision to recognize the right of Juan Miguel Gonzalez to speak for his son Elian is consistent with the rule of law and our nation's core values and traditions.
2_20	0.0	We are gratified that the 11th Circuit was unanimous in its decision to affirm those values and those traditions''.
2_21	0.0	Craig added that the elder Miguel and his family, who have been living in suburban Washington awaiting a final disposition of the case, ``look forward to resuming a normal life''.
2_22	0.8333333333333334	Elian has been in his father's custody since April 22, when federal agents forcibly removed him from the home of his great uncle and cousins in the Little Havana section of Miami.
2_23	0.36363636363636365	His relatives, who have lost every judicial decision in their effort to prevent his return to Cuba, had argued that all 12 judges on the 11th Circuit should rehear the case because the three-judge panel drawn from their ranks had erred in its ruling.
