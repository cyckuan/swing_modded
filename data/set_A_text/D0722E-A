0_0	0.12342731	The moment of truth is fast approaching in the politicized quarrel over a national missile defense.
0_1	0.1196449	President Clinton has said he will decide this summer whether to build a phased system to protect against several dozen long-range missiles.
0_2	0.14378179	Russian President Vladimir Putin, after pocketing the Duma's ratification of START II and passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, has warned that if the United States withdraws from the 1972 ABM Treaty to build the missile defense, ``We will withdraw not only from the START II treaty, but from the whole system of treaties on limitation and control of strategic and conventional weapons''.
0_3	0.097013559	The stakes could not be greater.
0_4	0.12465476	The $60 billion system contemplated by Clinton risks undoing nuclear weapons cooperation with Moscow and might also compel Beijing to expand and modernize China's basic deterrent force of about 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.
0_5	0.087453131	What would follow, arms control specialists fear, would be a chain reaction of nuclear weapons proliferation.
0_6	0.078433848	India would probably not be able to resist pressure to deploy its nuclear missiles and match a Chinese build-up, and Pakistan would be almost certain to follow suit.
0_7	0.093711933	Even Japan could be tempted to use its stockpile of fissile material to join the Asian nuclear-weapons club.
0_8	0.13873476	The argument for national missile defense is more compelling than was President Reagan's old ``star wars'' concept.
0_9	0.11317198	Instead of trying to defend the United States against the full panoply of Soviet rocketry _ a clearly impossible task _ the system would be a defense against only one or two missiles fired by a rogue state such as North Korea or Libya.
0_10	0.099425443	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said that the system would not and could not be a defense against Russia and therefore would not upset the deterrent value of the mutually assured destruction concept.
0_11	0.10783953	Three of the four criteria Clinton has said he will consider when making his decision on the system are: the scope of the threat to be countered, the effect on nonproliferation, and the cost.
0_12	0.096116182	The first cannot be accurately calculated.
0_13	0.090870612	No one knows what rogue states might conceive of, and those in favor of the system suggest it could act as a deterrent.
0_14	0.098206733	The effect on nonproliferation could be dire, but it ultimately depends on how the project is presented.
0_15	0.1213538	As for cost, the government has already squandered about $60 billion in the vain pursuit of the ``star wars'' vision of missile defense that Ronald Reagan was willing to fund.
0_16	0.1004184	Members of the current Joint Chiefs of Staff, who are unenthusiastic about the latest proposal for a missile defense system, have to worry that other, more tangible military needs may get short shrift if the politically driven system is funded for the coming decade.
0_17	0.081483934	Clinton's fourth criterion is technological feasibility.
0_18	0.10511716	Independent scientists and weapons designers who have analyzed the system say it can be overcome, relatively cheaply, by countermeasures that are readily available to any state capable of deploying a long-range ballistic missile.
0_19	0.08835331	Chemical or biological agents could be delivered in warheads that release large numbers of bomblets, or submunitions, that would overwhelm the interceptors of the system.
0_20	0.084353679	Nuclear warheads inside mylar balloons could be hidden among hundreds of similar balloons serving as decoys.
0_21	0.11927196	The sensors of the current missile defense system are not able to distinguish decoy balloons from those that contain nuclear warheads.
0_22	0.094547553	Moreover, the system that Clinton is to decide on this summer has not been tested against realistic countermeasures.
0_23	0.10036971	There is no evidence that the first phase of the system, planned to become operational in 2005, could cope with decoys or simple cooling shrouds on incoming warheads.
0_24	0.089887397	Plus, there have been no real-world tests to determine whether the full system, scheduled to be completed about 2010, could distinguish an empty radar-reflecting balloon from one with a nuclear warhead in it.
0_25	0.096140649	In addition, a missile launched against the United States would be easily tracked from its point of origin, and there would be no doubt from whence it came.
0_26	0.092068388	A nation making such an attack could expect instant destruction.
0_27	0.12907441	No presidential decision to deploy a national missile defense should be taken until the system proves, in tests analyzed by disinterested scientists, that it cannot be defeated by countermeasures that must be anticipated from any state capable of delivering a ballistic missile to these shores.
0_28	0.16615943	Perhaps in the years to come, a workable national missile defense system will be developed.
0_29	0.11780259	But there is no such thing in existence today, and an unworkable national missile defense system threatens to make Americans less, not more, secure from long-range missiles.
0_30	0.12193945	The true challenges of creating a national missile defense should be debated in the coming presidential campaign.
0_31	0.089202343	Research should continue on missile defense, and a commission of distinguished, independent scientists should be established to assess future tests against real-world countermeasures.
0_32	0.1139885	But for the present, national missile defense is simply not a viable defense option.

6_0	0.29766411	WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's proposed national missile defense system could be fooled by simple decoys or other countermeasures easily within the grasp of any nation able to launch a nuclear warhead at the United States, a team of prominent scientists said Tuesday.
6_1	0.12863818	The scientists, including several who have served in the past on Defense Department research panels, said that the government should delay any decision on whether to proceed with a missile-defense network, which is expected to cost $30 billion.
6_2	0.14812185	``We could see a lot of ways to get around this system and we presumed that if a country was able to mount a missile attack against the United States it was also able to use these well-known countermeasures to confuse or overwhelm this system,'' said Andrew Sessler of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
6_3	0.072810357	The study by 11 physicists and engineers was done by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Union of Concerned Scientists.
6_4	0.1426341	The scientists based their calculations on nonclassified information describing the complete missile defense system from the Pentagon and other agencies.
6_5	0.14327225	The scientists questioned why the Pentagon is waiting until 2005 _ at least five years after President Clinton has said that he will decide whether to put such a system into operation _ to test whether its system would be fooled by realistic countermeasures.
6_6	0.14316924	The initial proposed system of 100 anti-missile missiles, ground radar and satellites is meant to protect the nation from a limited nuclear attack or an accidental launching.
6_7	0.10059911	In their report, the scientists argued that if the North Koreans were sophisticated enough to build an intercontinental ballistic missile that could threaten the United States, they were clever enough to use countermeasures such as balloon decoys or an aluminum shield that could cool a nuclear warhead and thereby deceive an interceptor.
6_8	0.25370111	The Pentagon called the study's findings premature, saying that the missile defense system is in the early development stage and that the main focus for now remains hitting a target, not defeating countermeasures.
6_9	0.16159982	``It's a prototype and you have to walk before you run,'' said Mike Biddle, spokesman at the National Missile Defense Office.
6_10	0.14228231	In two preliminary tests of the system, the anti-missile missile or kill vehicle was able to hit a mock warhead only once.
6_11	0.12579184	As a result, the Pentagon has delayed a third test until June before Clinton decides whether to approve the system.
6_12	0.12393817	``We are arguing to defer the decision until there has been more research and development, and tests of various systems using real world conditions,'' said Lisbeth Gronlund, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
6_13	0.12081977	The panel studied several potential methods that an enemy might use to defeat the missile shield, including shiny mylar plastic balloons, like the kind sold in grocery stores, which the scientists said could easily fool the defense system.
6_14	0.087654765	A government intelligence report made public last September acknowledged that emerging missile states were capable of using decoys.
6_15	0.13450254	But Biddle said that, based on classified intelligence information, the Pentagon is confident that the defense system will work against against any challenges or countermeasures that could be mustered by the year 2005.
6_16	0.16261471	The scientists said that a missile defense system might also be confused if an enemy enclosed a warhead in an aluminum shield cooled by liquid nitrogen, foiling the heat-seeking sensors on the anti-missile missiles sent to destroy the warhead.

12_6	0.25388329	A land-based national missile defense system, under study by the Clinton administration, would cost an estimated $10.5 billion to build and, if approved, wouldn't be deployed until 2005.
12_7	0.078050045	The 77-page Heritage report concluded that a sea-based system to defend U.S. cities and shores from enemy missiles would cost less than $8 billion and take only about four years to deploy.
12_8	0.1382611	The system would include 650 missile interceptors on the Navy's 22 Aegis cruisers and destroyers now on patrol around the world as well as space-based sensors to detect incoming missiles and relay tracking data.
12_9	0.17987575	A Pentagon report, however, has estimated it would cost $19 billion to expand the Navy's Aegis fleet to become roving missile defense systems to protect the 50 U.S. states as well as American troops overseas.

12_13	0.099621812	But it could take up to 10 years to perfect a system for shooting a missile out of the sky.
12_14	0.10196282	In fact, major technological hurdles have prevented the Navy, the Air Force and the Army from actually building a system that can defend against anything but short-range and slow-moving cruise missiles.
12_15	0.11724931	It could take years before scientists and the defense industry build a system capable of striking a high-altitude, intercontinental missile.
12_16	0.33200309	The Clinton administration hasn't decided to deploy a national missile defense system, partly because it would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow.

13_0	0.21012382	WASHINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) --The United States Defense Department on Thursday awarded a research and development contract to Seattle's Boeing Co.
13_1	0.17093313	to coordinate a missile-defense system, Defense Secretary William Cohen announced.
13_2	0.26462539	Under the 1.6 billion dollar contract, Boeing will design, develop, test and integrate a variety of components for a space-age "National Missile Defense" (NMD) to guard the nation against ballistic missile attack.
13_3	0.13278952	During the research, Boeing will design a system of ground-based interceptor missiles and space-based satellites for missile launch detection and communications.

13_5	0.10409379	If the system works, the Pentagon could make a decision to deploy it in 2003.
13_6	0.12018179	The Pentagon said the value of the contract could eventually reach 5.2 billion dollars if the system works and moves towards deployment.
13_7	0.089450722	The NMD, emerging from former U.S. president Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" program, is to stop a smaller or accidental attack by another country against the United States.
13_8	0.16336249	The United States has spent billions of dollars on nuclear missile defense since Reagan put up his plan more than a decade ago, but little success has been achieved.
13_9	0.17185023	The U.S. military is also trying to develop an even more limited Theater Missile Defense (TMD) program to protect troops and bases from missile attack around the world.
13_10	0.091673828	But that program has experienced four successive failures.
13_11	0.25414662	However, Cohen said the United States was making "great progress" towards solving the technological problems involved in producing a national missile defense system.

14_1	0.13531898	Defense Department announced Thursday that it will skip a planned third test of an anti-missile missile.
14_2	0.1900097	The decision gives the Army a tentative go-ahead to move into the next phase of development of the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system that is the centerpiece of the Pentagon's effort to provide missile protection abroad for U.S. and allied troops and their staging areas.
14_3	0.18145369	The main reason for moving ahead with THAAD after two successes instead of three is to force the missile contractor, Lockheed Martin, to focus on the missile interceptor that will actually be fielded, rather than the prototype used thus far, said Peter Franklin, deputy director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
14_4	0.10574402	Franklin said the two successful tests this summer have "proven" that the missile works.
14_5	0.21858744	Critics, however, said after the second successful test in August that the THAAD system should be tested against faster, more capable missiles than the Hera rockets used in testing at White Sands Missile Range.
14_6	0.086874181	He said a final decision will be made next year on beginning the next phase of the project, in which Lockheed Martin will translate the design work done thus far into a missile that will enter initial low-rate production.
14_7	0.14436058	The Pentagon is scheduled to begin fielding the THAAD system in 2007.
14_8	0.096771409	Franklin did not say whether skipping the final flight test will enable it to be fielded earlier than that.
14_9	0.18619047	The Defense Department has spent about 4 billion U.S. dollars on THAAD so far.
14_10	0.10418505	Skipping the final flight test will save 15 million U.S. dollars.
14_11	0.097332075	Last year, the Pentagon said it would require Lockheed Martin to validate its design by scoring three successful intercepts.

18_8	0.13667559	Several independent scientists questioned the importance of Monday's tests and said that until the missile system was tested against targets that more closely simulate those in war, the results were going to be misleading.
18_9	0.14478862	``You've got to test against realistic targets that actively try to evade the defense system _ simulate real world targets _ and not just hit missiles on a test range,'' said Tom Collina, director of the arms control program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Washington watchdog group.
