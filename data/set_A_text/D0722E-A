0_0	0.2651632	The moment of truth is fast approaching in the politicized quarrel over a national missile defense.
0_1	0.15602891	President Clinton has said he will decide this summer whether to build a phased system to protect against several dozen long-range missiles.
0_2	0.11009266	Russian President Vladimir Putin, after pocketing the Duma's ratification of START II and passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, has warned that if the United States withdraws from the 1972 ABM Treaty to build the missile defense, ``We will withdraw not only from the START II treaty, but from the whole system of treaties on limitation and control of strategic and conventional weapons''.
0_3	0.0863368	The stakes could not be greater.
0_4	0.098423828	The $60 billion system contemplated by Clinton risks undoing nuclear weapons cooperation with Moscow and might also compel Beijing to expand and modernize China's basic deterrent force of about 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.
0_5	0.076493497	What would follow, arms control specialists fear, would be a chain reaction of nuclear weapons proliferation.
0_6	0.076726111	India would probably not be able to resist pressure to deploy its nuclear missiles and match a Chinese build-up, and Pakistan would be almost certain to follow suit.
0_7	0.081701254	Even Japan could be tempted to use its stockpile of fissile material to join the Asian nuclear-weapons club.
0_8	0.16780975	The argument for national missile defense is more compelling than was President Reagan's old ``star wars'' concept.
0_9	0.095555965	Instead of trying to defend the United States against the full panoply of Soviet rocketry _ a clearly impossible task _ the system would be a defense against only one or two missiles fired by a rogue state such as North Korea or Libya.
0_10	0.090110047	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said that the system would not and could not be a defense against Russia and therefore would not upset the deterrent value of the mutually assured destruction concept.
0_11	0.10146242	Three of the four criteria Clinton has said he will consider when making his decision on the system are: the scope of the threat to be countered, the effect on nonproliferation, and the cost.
0_12	0.08653686	The first cannot be accurately calculated.
0_13	0.082733143	No one knows what rogue states might conceive of, and those in favor of the system suggest it could act as a deterrent.
0_14	0.098324445	The effect on nonproliferation could be dire, but it ultimately depends on how the project is presented.
0_15	0.10725356	As for cost, the government has already squandered about $60 billion in the vain pursuit of the ``star wars'' vision of missile defense that Ronald Reagan was willing to fund.
0_16	0.09666702	Members of the current Joint Chiefs of Staff, who are unenthusiastic about the latest proposal for a missile defense system, have to worry that other, more tangible military needs may get short shrift if the politically driven system is funded for the coming decade.
0_17	0.08396553	Clinton's fourth criterion is technological feasibility.
0_18	0.098686403	Independent scientists and weapons designers who have analyzed the system say it can be overcome, relatively cheaply, by countermeasures that are readily available to any state capable of deploying a long-range ballistic missile.
0_19	0.08870805	Chemical or biological agents could be delivered in warheads that release large numbers of bomblets, or submunitions, that would overwhelm the interceptors of the system.
0_20	0.095295673	Nuclear warheads inside mylar balloons could be hidden among hundreds of similar balloons serving as decoys.
0_21	0.16398307	The sensors of the current missile defense system are not able to distinguish decoy balloons from those that contain nuclear warheads.
0_22	0.10926955	Moreover, the system that Clinton is to decide on this summer has not been tested against realistic countermeasures.
0_23	0.093623348	There is no evidence that the first phase of the system, planned to become operational in 2005, could cope with decoys or simple cooling shrouds on incoming warheads.
0_24	0.089443247	Plus, there have been no real-world tests to determine whether the full system, scheduled to be completed about 2010, could distinguish an empty radar-reflecting balloon from one with a nuclear warhead in it.
0_25	0.094769823	In addition, a missile launched against the United States would be easily tracked from its point of origin, and there would be no doubt from whence it came.
0_26	0.093802316	A nation making such an attack could expect instant destruction.
0_27	0.12139645	No presidential decision to deploy a national missile defense should be taken until the system proves, in tests analyzed by disinterested scientists, that it cannot be defeated by countermeasures that must be anticipated from any state capable of delivering a ballistic missile to these shores.
0_28	0.34217847	Perhaps in the years to come, a workable national missile defense system will be developed.
0_29	0.12240544	But there is no such thing in existence today, and an unworkable national missile defense system threatens to make Americans less, not more, secure from long-range missiles.
0_30	0.16510015	The true challenges of creating a national missile defense should be debated in the coming presidential campaign.
0_31	0.091799978	Research should continue on missile defense, and a commission of distinguished, independent scientists should be established to assess future tests against real-world countermeasures.
0_32	0.16986696	But for the present, national missile defense is simply not a viable defense option.

6_0	0.20290838	WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's proposed national missile defense system could be fooled by simple decoys or other countermeasures easily within the grasp of any nation able to launch a nuclear warhead at the United States, a team of prominent scientists said Tuesday.
6_1	0.096318722	The scientists, including several who have served in the past on Defense Department research panels, said that the government should delay any decision on whether to proceed with a missile-defense network, which is expected to cost $30 billion.

6_3	0.073391943	The study by 11 physicists and engineers was done by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Union of Concerned Scientists.
6_4	0.15706767	The scientists based their calculations on nonclassified information describing the complete missile defense system from the Pentagon and other agencies.
6_5	0.092039542	The scientists questioned why the Pentagon is waiting until 2005 _ at least five years after President Clinton has said that he will decide whether to put such a system into operation _ to test whether its system would be fooled by realistic countermeasures.
6_6	0.094090463	The initial proposed system of 100 anti-missile missiles, ground radar and satellites is meant to protect the nation from a limited nuclear attack or an accidental launching.
6_7	0.083661997	In their report, the scientists argued that if the North Koreans were sophisticated enough to build an intercontinental ballistic missile that could threaten the United States, they were clever enough to use countermeasures such as balloon decoys or an aluminum shield that could cool a nuclear warhead and thereby deceive an interceptor.
6_8	0.15804792	The Pentagon called the study's findings premature, saying that the missile defense system is in the early development stage and that the main focus for now remains hitting a target, not defeating countermeasures.

6_10	0.15681252	In two preliminary tests of the system, the anti-missile missile or kill vehicle was able to hit a mock warhead only once.
6_11	0.12451167	As a result, the Pentagon has delayed a third test until June before Clinton decides whether to approve the system.
6_12	0.090638173	``We are arguing to defer the decision until there has been more research and development, and tests of various systems using real world conditions,'' said Lisbeth Gronlund, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
6_13	0.089758728	The panel studied several potential methods that an enemy might use to defeat the missile shield, including shiny mylar plastic balloons, like the kind sold in grocery stores, which the scientists said could easily fool the defense system.
6_14	0.088941445	A government intelligence report made public last September acknowledged that emerging missile states were capable of using decoys.
6_15	0.092937097	But Biddle said that, based on classified intelligence information, the Pentagon is confident that the defense system will work against against any challenges or countermeasures that could be mustered by the year 2005.
6_16	0.10271355	The scientists said that a missile defense system might also be confused if an enemy enclosed a warhead in an aluminum shield cooled by liquid nitrogen, foiling the heat-seeking sensors on the anti-missile missiles sent to destroy the warhead.

14_1	0.18991982	Defense Department announced Thursday that it will skip a planned third test of an anti-missile missile.
14_2	0.11627274	The decision gives the Army a tentative go-ahead to move into the next phase of development of the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system that is the centerpiece of the Pentagon's effort to provide missile protection abroad for U.S. and allied troops and their staging areas.
14_3	0.11167978	The main reason for moving ahead with THAAD after two successes instead of three is to force the missile contractor, Lockheed Martin, to focus on the missile interceptor that will actually be fielded, rather than the prototype used thus far, said Peter Franklin, deputy director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
14_4	0.13231301	Franklin said the two successful tests this summer have "proven" that the missile works.
14_5	0.1363402	Critics, however, said after the second successful test in August that the THAAD system should be tested against faster, more capable missiles than the Hera rockets used in testing at White Sands Missile Range.
14_6	0.084906012	He said a final decision will be made next year on beginning the next phase of the project, in which Lockheed Martin will translate the design work done thus far into a missile that will enter initial low-rate production.
14_7	0.11945798	The Pentagon is scheduled to begin fielding the THAAD system in 2007.
14_8	0.089429653	Franklin did not say whether skipping the final flight test will enable it to be fielded earlier than that.
