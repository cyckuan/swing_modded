0_0	0.15990048	WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) --A U.S. anti-missile missile failed Monday for the sixth time to hit a flying target, a defense official said.
0_1	0.17281653	It was not immediately known why the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense missile failed to intercept the target missile Monday morning, said Bob Hunt, spokesman for the Army program executive office for air and missile defense in Huntsville, Alabama State.
0_2	0.093615296	"The telemetry data is still coming in and they're still analyzing it," Hunt said.
0_3	0.16757669	The test was the ninth in a series of 13 flight tests for the THAAD missile program and the sixth attempt at intercepting a missile.
0_4	0.17330788	The system has cost 3.8 billion U.S. dollars so far.
1_0	0.12589894	WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) --The U.S.
1_1	0.18283801	Defense Department announced Thursday that it will skip a planned third test of an anti-missile missile.
1_2	0.12731393	The decision gives the Army a tentative go-ahead to move into the next phase of development of the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system that is the centerpiece of the Pentagon's effort to provide missile protection abroad for U.S. and allied troops and their staging areas.
1_3	0.12324708	The main reason for moving ahead with THAAD after two successes instead of three is to force the missile contractor, Lockheed Martin, to focus on the missile interceptor that will actually be fielded, rather than the prototype used thus far, said Peter Franklin, deputy director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
1_4	0.11042495	Franklin said the two successful tests this summer have "proven" that the missile works.
1_5	0.14822119	Critics, however, said after the second successful test in August that the THAAD system should be tested against faster, more capable missiles than the Hera rockets used in testing at White Sands Missile Range.
1_6	0.087562036	He said a final decision will be made next year on beginning the next phase of the project, in which Lockheed Martin will translate the design work done thus far into a missile that will enter initial low-rate production.
1_7	0.12209734	The Pentagon is scheduled to begin fielding the THAAD system in 2007.
1_8	0.081360647	Franklin did not say whether skipping the final flight test will enable it to be fielded earlier than that.
1_9	0.15510547	The Defense Department has spent about 4 billion U.S. dollars on THAAD so far.
1_10	0.088881916	Skipping the final flight test will save 15 million U.S. dollars.
1_11	0.085798072	Last year, the Pentagon said it would require Lockheed Martin to validate its design by scoring three successful intercepts.
1_12	0.091422719	The missile had failed in its first six attempts to shoot down a mock warhead, but it recorded its first success on June 10 this year, followed by another August 2.
2_0	0.15205852	WASHINGTON, May 25 (Xinhua) --The U.S.
2_1	0.10425186	Army scratched Tuesday's test flight of an antimissile missile because of a problem with the one that was to serve as its target.
2_2	0.24304411	The Hera target missile --a modified Minuteman 2 -- was fired from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico State of the United States.
2_3	0.2328575	The Army had planned to launch a Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile to knock the target missile out of the sky.
2_4	0.10386115	It was not immediately known what the problem was, said Jim Eckles, a White Sands Missile Range spokesman.
2_5	0.11626588	The THAAD missile had failed in six previous flights to hit flying targets.
2_6	0.17891216	The system has cost at least 3.8 billion U.S. dollars.
2_7	0.10527455	The Defense Department charged Lockheed Martin Corporation, the maker of the antimissile system, a 15-million-U.S.-dollar penalty for not achieving a hit during a March 29 test as required by its 15 billion U.S. dollars contract.
2_8	0.10037206	The THAAD is designed to strike enemy missiles fired from at least 800 miles away _ the kinds of weapons nations such as Iran, North Korea and Pakistan are developing, raising the threat to U.S. troops and allies overseas.
2_9	0.13646182	The antimissile missile has technology that is the most sophisticated military weaponry, and it would contribute to development of a system that could protect the United States.
3_0	0.25531067	The moment of truth is fast approaching in the politicized quarrel over a national missile defense.
3_1	0.16774125	President Clinton has said he will decide this summer whether to build a phased system to protect against several dozen long-range missiles.
3_2	0.11229745	Russian President Vladimir Putin, after pocketing the Duma's ratification of START II and passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, has warned that if the United States withdraws from the 1972 ABM Treaty to build the missile defense, ``We will withdraw not only from the START II treaty, but from the whole system of treaties on limitation and control of strategic and conventional weapons''.
3_3	0.044640763	The stakes could not be greater.
3_4	0.092883972	The $60 billion system contemplated by Clinton risks undoing nuclear weapons cooperation with Moscow and might also compel Beijing to expand and modernize China's basic deterrent force of about 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.
3_5	0.077754492	What would follow, arms control specialists fear, would be a chain reaction of nuclear weapons proliferation.
3_6	0.086479999	India would probably not be able to resist pressure to deploy its nuclear missiles and match a Chinese build-up, and Pakistan would be almost certain to follow suit.
3_7	0.077931832	Even Japan could be tempted to use its stockpile of fissile material to join the Asian nuclear-weapons club.
3_8	0.17812413	The argument for national missile defense is more compelling than was President Reagan's old ``star wars'' concept.
3_9	0.093380973	Instead of trying to defend the United States against the full panoply of Soviet rocketry _ a clearly impossible task _ the system would be a defense against only one or two missiles fired by a rogue state such as North Korea or Libya.
3_10	0.096127251	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said that the system would not and could not be a defense against Russia and therefore would not upset the deterrent value of the mutually assured destruction concept.
3_11	0.11134193	Three of the four criteria Clinton has said he will consider when making his decision on the system are: the scope of the threat to be countered, the effect on nonproliferation, and the cost.
3_12	0.068993512	The first cannot be accurately calculated.
3_13	0.080663023	No one knows what rogue states might conceive of, and those in favor of the system suggest it could act as a deterrent.
3_14	0.08954123	The effect on nonproliferation could be dire, but it ultimately depends on how the project is presented.
3_15	0.10908508	As for cost, the government has already squandered about $60 billion in the vain pursuit of the ``star wars'' vision of missile defense that Ronald Reagan was willing to fund.
3_16	0.093701054	Members of the current Joint Chiefs of Staff, who are unenthusiastic about the latest proposal for a missile defense system, have to worry that other, more tangible military needs may get short shrift if the politically driven system is funded for the coming decade.
3_17	0.081941929	Clinton's fourth criterion is technological feasibility.
3_18	0.098689836	Independent scientists and weapons designers who have analyzed the system say it can be overcome, relatively cheaply, by countermeasures that are readily available to any state capable of deploying a long-range ballistic missile.
3_19	0.090081581	Chemical or biological agents could be delivered in warheads that release large numbers of bomblets, or submunitions, that would overwhelm the interceptors of the system.
3_20	0.089975734	Nuclear warheads inside mylar balloons could be hidden among hundreds of similar balloons serving as decoys.
3_21	0.16733219	The sensors of the current missile defense system are not able to distinguish decoy balloons from those that contain nuclear warheads.
3_22	0.098538197	Moreover, the system that Clinton is to decide on this summer has not been tested against realistic countermeasures.
3_23	0.099191231	There is no evidence that the first phase of the system, planned to become operational in 2005, could cope with decoys or simple cooling shrouds on incoming warheads.
3_24	0.081982234	Plus, there have been no real-world tests to determine whether the full system, scheduled to be completed about 2010, could distinguish an empty radar-reflecting balloon from one with a nuclear warhead in it.
3_25	0.10483684	In addition, a missile launched against the United States would be easily tracked from its point of origin, and there would be no doubt from whence it came.
3_26	0.069555951	A nation making such an attack could expect instant destruction.
3_27	0.12249487	No presidential decision to deploy a national missile defense should be taken until the system proves, in tests analyzed by disinterested scientists, that it cannot be defeated by countermeasures that must be anticipated from any state capable of delivering a ballistic missile to these shores.
3_28	0.32941639	Perhaps in the years to come, a workable national missile defense system will be developed.
3_29	0.13311048	But there is no such thing in existence today, and an unworkable national missile defense system threatens to make Americans less, not more, secure from long-range missiles.
3_30	0.16013106	The true challenges of creating a national missile defense should be debated in the coming presidential campaign.
3_31	0.10040266	Research should continue on missile defense, and a commission of distinguished, independent scientists should be established to assess future tests against real-world countermeasures.
3_32	0.14913432	But for the present, national missile defense is simply not a viable defense option.
4_0	0.24739755	LONDON (AP) --Britain should push the United States to halt plans for its national missile defense system, a parliament committee on foreign affairs recommended Tuesday.
4_1	0.32833409	The missile defense program is a $60 billion system that would allow the United States to destroy incoming warheads.
4_2	0.1147906	Critics of the system argue that the program would increase Britain's vulnerability to attack without offering coverage by the U.S. defensive screen.
4_3	0.08754862	The Foreign Affairs Committee into Weapons of Mass Destruction recommended that the government urge the United States ''to seek other ways of reducing the threats it perceives,'' rather than try the missile shield.
4_4	0.11549926	The bi-partisan committee in its report said it was not convinced that the missile defense program ''represents an appropriate response to the proliferation problems faced by the international community''.
4_5	0.11466054	It also questioned the program's feasibility, noting that two out of three tests on the system didn't work.
4_6	0.085369423	The lawmakers also warned that Russia and China opposed the program, which could be ''dangerously destabilizing''.
4_7	0.23268306	The Pentagon has set a target date of 2005 for having a national missile defense ready for use.
5_0	0.33288845	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) --Iran's weekend test of a long-range missile underscored the need for a U.S. national missile defense system, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Monday.
5_1	0.15061537	Iran tested its Shahab-3 ballistic missile, with a range of 800 miles, on Saturday.
5_2	0.072124986	Tehran is developing a longer-range Shahab-4, which it claims will be used to carry satellites into space and not for military purposes.
5_3	0.18725865	The test ''is one of the reasons why it is important for the United States to undertake to research, develop and potentially deploy a national missile defense system that would provide protection against countries such as Iran posing a threat to the United States,'' Cohen said on the last day of a three-day visit to Australia.
5_4	0.3072614	U.S. defense authorities are developing a multibillion dollar national missile defense system, but Washington has not yet approved its deployment.
5_5	0.18133851	The United States also would look to Australia to play a role in the missile defense system if and when it is approved, Cohen said.
5_6	0.084468976	Australian Defense Minister John Moore said Australia would consider a request for participation if the system gets the go-ahead.
5_7	0.099531319	But that expectation could prove unfounded if the opposition Labor Party wins federal elections expected by late next year.

5_11	0.086112876	Moore said the agreement would be of particular benefit to Australia's troubled fleet of six Collins Class submarines, which have been plagued by technical problems ranging from periscope malfunctions to excessive noise and vibration, as well as problems in computer defense systems.
6_0	0.29484851	WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) --The United States will restructure its ballistic missile defense (BMD) programs and place its highest priority on developing the next generation of Patriot missile defense system and lower tier Navy anti-missile system, the Pentagon said today.
6_1	0.068825554	The restructure decision came after a six-month study of BMD programs led by U.S.

7_0	0.19561001	WASHINGTON (AP) --The Clinton administration has selected Alaska as the likely first site for its proposed anti-ballistic missile defense network.
7_1	0.16603441	State Department spokesman James Rubin, who announced the decision Wednesday, said the administration won't decide whether to deploy a missile defense until next summer.

7_6	0.092360079	Defense Secretary William Cohen also is expected to discuss the issue with his Russian counterpart on a trip to Moscow next Monday and Tuesday.
7_7	0.081556541	Russia, hard pressed financially to create its own anti-missile defense, is reluctant to make the change.
7_8	0.12252347	But the United States wants to modify the treaty so it can build a limited defense against attack by rogue states, such as North Korea.
7_9	0.14644587	``The president has made some decisions that will enable us to begin engaging Russia now on changes on the ABM treaty that would be necessary if we seek to deploy a limited national missile defense system,'' Rubin said.
7_10	0.10434591	President Boris Yeltsin agreed in June to discuss ABM modifications, but Russian officials continue to insist that an anti-missile defense system in the United States would tilt the strategic balance and start a new arms race.

8_0	0.19345823	WASHINGTON (AP) --It would be far cheaper and quicker to deploy a sea-based national missile defense system than to build one on land as envisioned by the Clinton administration, a group of conservative defense analysts said in a report Wednesday.
8_1	0.072075741	``We need to act now,'' declared Henry Cooper Jr.
8_2	0.098473722	, chairman of the Heritage Foundation study and former director of Pentagon anti-missile programs during the Bush administration.
8_3	0.11970965	Cooper listed the growing ballistic missile threat from countries such as North Korea and Iran as a reason for ``urgency'' on the matter.
8_4	0.13080838	The Heritage Commission on Missile Defense, which included 14 retired officers and defense and political officials who served mostly in Republican administrations, accused the current White House of failing to make missile defense a national priority.
8_5	0.12952425	President Clinton, however, is seeking a major increase in spending for national missile defense, urging Congress to approve $6.6 billion over the next five years for program development.
8_6	0.16973657	A land-based national missile defense system, under study by the Clinton administration, would cost an estimated $10.5 billion to build and, if approved, wouldn't be deployed until 2005.
8_7	0.088846759	The 77-page Heritage report concluded that a sea-based system to defend U.S. cities and shores from enemy missiles would cost less than $8 billion and take only about four years to deploy.
8_8	0.099012331	The system would include 650 missile interceptors on the Navy's 22 Aegis cruisers and destroyers now on patrol around the world as well as space-based sensors to detect incoming missiles and relay tracking data.
8_9	0.12621946	A Pentagon report, however, has estimated it would cost $19 billion to expand the Navy's Aegis fleet to become roving missile defense systems to protect the 50 U.S. states as well as American troops overseas.

22_0	0.2222403	WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's proposed national missile defense system could be fooled by simple decoys or other countermeasures easily within the grasp of any nation able to launch a nuclear warhead at the United States, a team of prominent scientists said Tuesday.

22_4	0.15917454	The scientists based their calculations on nonclassified information describing the complete missile defense system from the Pentagon and other agencies.
22_5	0.10323334	The scientists questioned why the Pentagon is waiting until 2005 _ at least five years after President Clinton has said that he will decide whether to put such a system into operation _ to test whether its system would be fooled by realistic countermeasures.

22_7	0.0901947	In their report, the scientists argued that if the North Koreans were sophisticated enough to build an intercontinental ballistic missile that could threaten the United States, they were clever enough to use countermeasures such as balloon decoys or an aluminum shield that could cool a nuclear warhead and thereby deceive an interceptor.
22_8	0.17677063	The Pentagon called the study's findings premature, saying that the missile defense system is in the early development stage and that the main focus for now remains hitting a target, not defeating countermeasures.
