14_3	0.38095238095238093	Tang said the verdict was a violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration intended to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition to Chinese rule, so he also will complain to British officials and international rights groups.

16_1	0.45	The gang got its start years ago by robbing jewelry stores in Hong Kong, then retreating across the Chinese border to hide here because the local police were either too inept or corrupt to care.
16_2	0.5	The gang's most spectacular crime came in 1996, police now say, by kidnapping the son of one of Hong Kong's richest businessmen and getting away with a staggering $125 million in ransom.

16_4	0.6875	Big Spender, whose real name is Cheung Tze-keung, may have been the most wanted man in Hong Kong, but in this part of China he became a folk hero for his apparent invincibility.

16_10	0.4782608695652174	The gang's downfall is the latest chapter in the curious evolution of lawlessness that straddles the border between Hong Kong and Guangdong province, an area with a rich history of secret societies, pirates and criminal intrigue.

16_30	0.0	He had served 18 months in prison, apparently leaving him with such serious grievances against the prison authorities that his gang was suspected when a bulldozer suddenly demolished a prison guard house one night.
