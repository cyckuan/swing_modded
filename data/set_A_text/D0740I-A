2_0	0.11876457	BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland is optimistic that China will soon grant a Swiss-based balloon team permission to overfly the country in its quest for the first nonstop round- the-world flight, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said Monday.
2_1	0.11566654	The Breitling Orbiter 3 team said last week it had to postpone its attempt due to Chinese irritation over the failure of rivals Steve Fossett, Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand to respect previously agreed conditions.

4_0	0.24285069	Achieving what promoters called the last great milestone of aviation, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones joined legends like the Wright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh with Saturday's completion of the first manned round-the-world balloon flight.
4_1	0.065502666	At 4:54 a.m.
4_2	0.15951588	EST Saturday, the two balloonists crossed the line of longitude from which they had departed on March 1 at Chateau D'Oex, Switzerland, officially earning them the long-sought title of the first balloon circumnavigation of the globe, as well as a $1 million prize.
4_3	0.097050177	The pair hoped to land at about dawn Sunday in Egypt, unless their dwindling fuel supply forces them to come down earlier.
4_4	0.10869593	Speaking to his ground crew in Switzerland, Piccard acknowledged that much of the achievement was due to forces far beyond the pilots' control.
4_5	0.060993386	``We're really grateful for the invisible hand that guided us through all obstacles,'' he said.
4_6	0.082787661	Piccard, a 41-year-old Swiss psychiatrist, is the latest in a family of explorers and record-setters.
4_7	0.088463064	It was Auguste Piccard, his grandfather, who in 1931 became the first human to reach the stratosphere, the first to see the earth's curvature firsthand, and the inventor of the pressurized cabin, which opened up the frontier of aviation to regular passenger travel.
4_8	0.088291682	And it was his father, Jacques, who in 1960 set a record that still stands Sunday for the deepest ocean dive, taking the bathyscaphe Trieste nearly 7 miles deep in the Pacific Ocean's Mariana Trench.
4_9	0.089923584	In addition to his illustrious forebears, Piccard grew up among astronauts as his father worked for the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
4_10	0.090180849	``During my childhood, I have seen a lot of adventurers, and this gave me the wish to explore something on this beautiful earth,'' Piccard said two years ago, just before making the first of his three attempts at the record.
4_11	0.095917346	Despite the millions of dollars spent by each team for equipment and the support crews needed for such voyages, success hinged on a combination of luck, politics and fortitude.
4_12	0.092869847	At least two previous attempts that might have had a chance at succeeding were stymied by failure to get overflight permission from China and Libya, forcing them to divert into less favorable wind patterns.
4_13	0.089318585	This flight, too, was forced to detour to honor China's requirement to stay south of 26 degrees latitude, but was still able to stay in the high-speed jetstream needed to propel it to the finish line.
4_14	0.083860739	There has been an intense but friendly informal competition for the round-the-world title since 1993, using innovative balloon designs.
4_15	0.093085611	While one record after another was set for distance traveled and for time aloft, all these earlier efforts ended up being thwarted by bad weather, technical malfunctions, or political obstacles.
4_16	0.094315156	But in the process, the design of high-tech versions of the venerable Rozier balloon has progressed enormously, bringing aviation's oldest design straight into the space age.
4_17	0.094196469	Satellite navigation systems monitor the balloons' positions, satellite communications keep them in touch with their control centers, and satellite weather monitoring provides the guidance essential to success _ and survival.
4_18	0.093554327	Even the most high-tech balloon is still at the mercy of the winds, its only means of control being to rise or fall in order to catch the winds that seem to be going in the most promising direction.
4_19	0.099204879	It was the invention of the modern Rozier balloon that made the feat possible, by using modern lightweight plastics for the balloon itself and by combining the advantages of the two principal types of balloons: helium and hot air.
4_20	0.089759635	Helium's advantage is that it requires no fuel to maintain its lifting power; its drawback is that as it expands from the sun's heat, it threatens to tear a balloon apart and must be vented, depleting its supply.
4_21	0.092377265	Hot air can provide lifting power whenever it is needed, but only by carrying huge fuel supplies to heat the air; when the fuel runs out, the balloon comes down.
4_22	0.092040937	But a Rozier combines both, taking advantage of helium's lift during daylight, and supplementing it at night with hot air.
4_23	0.097037618	While there is no obvious practical benefit from this spectacular feat, the technological advances in balloon design engendered by the competition may well end up benefiting scientific research.
4_24	0.092704602	Scientists already use unpiloted high-altitude balloons extensively to conduct some kinds of environmental monitoring and astronomical studies that require a perch high above most of the atmosphere.
4_25	0.10784587	Fellow balloonist Richard Branson, whose latest attempt to circle the world ended with a landing off Hawaii last Christmas because of bad weather ahead, immediately sent his congratulatious to the rival team Saturday, calling it a ``magnificent achievement''.
4_26	0.073300342	For the adventurers themselves, the achievement still hadn't quite sunk in.
4_27	0.078673409	``We are having great difficulty realizing our dreams have come true,'' Piccard said.
4_28	0.038996109	``We are with the angels.''
5_0	0.23814516	Having floated some 20,000 miles over Europe, Africa, Asia, the Pacific Ocean and Central America, the Breitling Orbiter 3 headed into the home stretch over the Atlantic Ocean Wednesday in its bid to become the first balloon to circle the world nonstop.
5_1	0.21959968	The prospect that the Breitling's crew, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, may succeed where all others have failed seemed more promising with each passing hour.
5_2	0.15636792	The Breitling ground team in Geneva forecast that the huge Swiss-registered balloon would complete its circuit of the Earth on Saturday, somewhere in North Africa.
5_3	0.12109181	As the Breitling balloon entered its 18th day aloft, however, the two pilots were complaining of exhaustion and said they were worried that the propane used in the balloon's burners might run out before the craft reached the finish line: 9.27 degrees west longitude.
5_4	0.094110733	But the team spokeswoman in Geneva, Monika Pieren, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that if wind directions and speeds correspond to the meteorological forecasts, the balloon would have enough propane to safely reach Mauritania and the goal line before fuel runs out.
5_5	0.096988297	The balloonists will try to avoid landing in Algeria or Libya, where they are uncertain of the political climate.
5_6	0.070687406	A ditching at sea has not been ruled out.
5_7	0.11567273	When the balloon took off from Chateau-d'Oex, Switzerland, it initially flew southwestward, reaching 9.27 degrees west longitude before catching a favorable jet stream and heading eastward around the world.
5_8	0.065238348	Thus, 9.27 degrees west longitude represents the finish line.
5_9	0.13375615	If the Breitling team makes it, they will enter the record books as winners of the last great goal of ballooning.
5_10	0.085160584	Many have tried before them but all have fallen far short, including the roughly 20 attempts made during the last decade alone.
