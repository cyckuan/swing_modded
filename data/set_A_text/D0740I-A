2_1	0.28645703	If all goes as planned, Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard and British adventurer Brian Jones will conquer one of the last great challenges in aviation on Saturday.
2_2	0.11090893	On Friday, their 180-foot-high Breitling Orbiter 3 was more than halfway across the Atlantic, being swept along by a jet stream at up to 100 mph.

2_5	0.090441768	At that point, the balloonists are expected to be above Mauritania, on Africa's northwest coast.
2_6	0.080474493	They plan to push on, over Algeria and Libya to Egypt, where they believe it will be easier to land and where Jones has long dreamed of ending the odyssey.
2_7	0.074224871	But if they're too tired, they will drift down in Mali, flight director Alan Noble said.
2_8	0.077640386	``If they want to put down in some part of the desert surrounded by lions, jackals and other dangerous animals, then we will do it,'' Noble said.
2_9	0.079250444	``But what we would dearly like to do is to get them down in Egypt near the pyramids''.
2_10	0.080537464	Piccard broke into tears when controllers told him there should be enough fuel and that weather conditions were right for a landing in Egypt --a total journey of 29,206 miles.
2_11	0.081872442	In a satellite telephone linkup, Piccard said he was using self-hypnosis to calm himself and cope with tension that has accumulated during the 19-day odyssey.

2_20	0.095878562	There the pilots developed breathing problems and got the shivers as their small cabin chilled to 46 degrees.
2_21	0.078470191	``We were very stressed and very cold,'' Piccard recounted.
2_22	0.1071134	``But now it's all going well again and we've put it behind us as a bad dream''.

4_1	0.087382794	At 4:54 a.m.
4_2	0.14904452	EST Saturday, the two balloonists crossed the line of longitude from which they had departed on March 1 at Chateau D'Oex, Switzerland, officially earning them the long-sought title of the first balloon circumnavigation of the globe, as well as a $1 million prize.
4_3	0.086852366	The pair hoped to land at about dawn Sunday in Egypt, unless their dwindling fuel supply forces them to come down earlier.
4_4	0.10313701	Speaking to his ground crew in Switzerland, Piccard acknowledged that much of the achievement was due to forces far beyond the pilots' control.
4_5	0.073477907	``We're really grateful for the invisible hand that guided us through all obstacles,'' he said.
4_6	0.091284763	Piccard, a 41-year-old Swiss psychiatrist, is the latest in a family of explorers and record-setters.
4_7	0.081794509	It was Auguste Piccard, his grandfather, who in 1931 became the first human to reach the stratosphere, the first to see the earth's curvature firsthand, and the inventor of the pressurized cabin, which opened up the frontier of aviation to regular passenger travel.
4_8	0.080855556	And it was his father, Jacques, who in 1960 set a record that still stands Sunday for the deepest ocean dive, taking the bathyscaphe Trieste nearly 7 miles deep in the Pacific Ocean's Mariana Trench.
4_9	0.078940599	In addition to his illustrious forebears, Piccard grew up among astronauts as his father worked for the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
4_10	0.080805125	``During my childhood, I have seen a lot of adventurers, and this gave me the wish to explore something on this beautiful earth,'' Piccard said two years ago, just before making the first of his three attempts at the record.
4_11	0.085129489	Despite the millions of dollars spent by each team for equipment and the support crews needed for such voyages, success hinged on a combination of luck, politics and fortitude.
4_12	0.086722371	At least two previous attempts that might have had a chance at succeeding were stymied by failure to get overflight permission from China and Libya, forcing them to divert into less favorable wind patterns.
4_13	0.085713392	This flight, too, was forced to detour to honor China's requirement to stay south of 26 degrees latitude, but was still able to stay in the high-speed jetstream needed to propel it to the finish line.
4_14	0.087851778	There has been an intense but friendly informal competition for the round-the-world title since 1993, using innovative balloon designs.
4_15	0.090515164	While one record after another was set for distance traveled and for time aloft, all these earlier efforts ended up being thwarted by bad weather, technical malfunctions, or political obstacles.
4_16	0.090047548	But in the process, the design of high-tech versions of the venerable Rozier balloon has progressed enormously, bringing aviation's oldest design straight into the space age.
4_17	0.089809642	Satellite navigation systems monitor the balloons' positions, satellite communications keep them in touch with their control centers, and satellite weather monitoring provides the guidance essential to success _ and survival.
4_18	0.0904465	Even the most high-tech balloon is still at the mercy of the winds, its only means of control being to rise or fall in order to catch the winds that seem to be going in the most promising direction.
4_19	0.095300041	It was the invention of the modern Rozier balloon that made the feat possible, by using modern lightweight plastics for the balloon itself and by combining the advantages of the two principal types of balloons: helium and hot air.
4_20	0.0932405	Helium's advantage is that it requires no fuel to maintain its lifting power; its drawback is that as it expands from the sun's heat, it threatens to tear a balloon apart and must be vented, depleting its supply.
4_21	0.089729645	Hot air can provide lifting power whenever it is needed, but only by carrying huge fuel supplies to heat the air; when the fuel runs out, the balloon comes down.
4_22	0.09082918	But a Rozier combines both, taking advantage of helium's lift during daylight, and supplementing it at night with hot air.
4_23	0.09576214	While there is no obvious practical benefit from this spectacular feat, the technological advances in balloon design engendered by the competition may well end up benefiting scientific research.
4_24	0.091332818	Scientists already use unpiloted high-altitude balloons extensively to conduct some kinds of environmental monitoring and astronomical studies that require a perch high above most of the atmosphere.
4_25	0.10071663	Fellow balloonist Richard Branson, whose latest attempt to circle the world ended with a landing off Hawaii last Christmas because of bad weather ahead, immediately sent his congratulatious to the rival team Saturday, calling it a ``magnificent achievement''.

23_0	0.22667207	Having floated some 20,000 miles over Europe, Africa, Asia, the Pacific Ocean and Central America, the Breitling Orbiter 3 headed into the home stretch over the Atlantic Ocean Wednesday in its bid to become the first balloon to circle the world nonstop.
23_1	0.19406491	The prospect that the Breitling's crew, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, may succeed where all others have failed seemed more promising with each passing hour.
23_2	0.15012334	The Breitling ground team in Geneva forecast that the huge Swiss-registered balloon would complete its circuit of the Earth on Saturday, somewhere in North Africa.
23_3	0.11366608	As the Breitling balloon entered its 18th day aloft, however, the two pilots were complaining of exhaustion and said they were worried that the propane used in the balloon's burners might run out before the craft reached the finish line: 9.27 degrees west longitude.
23_4	0.087665162	But the team spokeswoman in Geneva, Monika Pieren, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that if wind directions and speeds correspond to the meteorological forecasts, the balloon would have enough propane to safely reach Mauritania and the goal line before fuel runs out.
23_5	0.10685067	The balloonists will try to avoid landing in Algeria or Libya, where they are uncertain of the political climate.
23_6	0.083608456	A ditching at sea has not been ruled out.
23_7	0.11299131	When the balloon took off from Chateau-d'Oex, Switzerland, it initially flew southwestward, reaching 9.27 degrees west longitude before catching a favorable jet stream and heading eastward around the world.

23_19	0.090442033	Worst of all, some of the nations along the round-the-world track did not open their airspace to balloons and had to be avoided.

23_21	0.097511799	Sometimes the balloon crawled at 20 miles an hour, but in stretches where the crew could exploit jet streams, the Breitling sped at more than 100 miles an hour.
23_22	0.088136145	On two occasions, prompted partly by the need to scrape ice off burners and partly to escape the bad-smelling air inside the crew capsule, the balloonists ventured outside their pressurized crew compartment into the frigid, thin air above 20,000 feet.
