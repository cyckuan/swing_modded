0_0	0.13043478260869565	WASHINGTON _ When the House Judiciary Committee holds a hearing Tuesday on the consequences of lying under oath, Republicans will try to show that there is a double standard for President Clinton, while Democrats will say that perjury, while serious, is not an impeachable offense.
0_1	0.0	The witnesses each side plans to call _ six by the Republicans and five by the Democrats _ in the full committee's second, and perhaps, final hearing before voting on articles of impeachment against Clinton reflect the two sides' competing strategies, aides said Friday.
0_2	0.125	``In the hearing,'' a Republican committee aide said, ``we'll be looking at perjury and its consequences, and whether is it tenable for a nation to have two different standards for lying under oath: one for the president and one for everyone else''.
0_3	0.21428571428571427	Tuesday, Republicans intend to call two federal judges, two retired military officers and two convicted perjurers.

0_13	0.0	The judges will speak to the effects of perjury on the judicial system; the military officers on the corrosive effect of lying on the armed forces' strict code, and convicted perjurers about the personal price paid for lying, a Republican aide said.
0_14	1.1428571428571428	Democrats, meanwhile, intend to show that perjury in this case is a peripheral issue.
0_15	0.0	``No Democrat has alleged that perjury is not a serious legal matter, only that perjury in these circumstances, given the underlying allegations against the president, does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense,'' said James Jordan, a spokesman for committee Democrats.
0_16	0.0	Democrats have invited Leon Higginbotham, a retired judge in the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, and Elliot Richardson, who in 1973 resigned as attorney general rather than carry out Nixon's order to dismiss Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox.

2_3	0.09090909090909091	None of these individual acts, even many of President Clinton's harshest critics say, are impeachable offenses.
2_4	0.1875	Instead, the case for impeachment is a winding legal staircase, which must be understood step by step, according to those who believe that Clinton's actions must lead to his removal from office.
2_5	0.07142857142857142	The heart of the case against the president is the allegation that Clinton lied before the grand jury when he said his testimony in an earlier civil case was truthful.
2_6	0.0	Moreover, Clinton tried to obstruct justice and hide his relationship with former intern Monica S.
2_7	0.0	Lewinsky, according to the impeachment articles approved last month by the House.
2_8	0.0	To those who believe Clinton should be ousted, the evidence is so overwhelming they can't understand why the public backs Clinton or why the Senate seems likely to acquit him.
2_9	0.0	``The evidence is very clear,'' said Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, one of the 13 House ``managers'' slated to present the case against Clinton in the Senate impeachment trial.
2_10	0.0	``He committed the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice, and it is very clear these are impeachable offenses.
2_11	0.0	It is an incredible thought that we would let the president remain in office if the senators came to the same conclusion that I have''.
2_12	0.0	McCollum, like several other House managers, said he views the upcoming trial as a last chance to convince the public that the case against Clinton has nothing to do with partisanship, but instead is based on irrefutable evidence and the mandates of the Constitution.
2_13	0.0	What follows is an attempt to explain the case against Clinton, according to interviews with House managers and based on the array of evidence from independent counsel Kenneth W.
2_14	0.0	Starr and the House Judiciary Committee.
2_15	0.0	The case revolves around two impeachment articles approved Dec.
2_16	0.0	19 by the House, finding that Clinton committed perjury before the grand jury and obstructed justice.
2_17	0.0	--erjury. While the House rejected an impeachment article that said Clinton lied in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, it approved an article that said Clinton lied about many of the same facts before the federal grand jury.
2_18	0.0625	This has complicated matters for the House managers because in order to prove that Clinton lied before the grand jury, it must be established that Clinton lied in the civil case.
2_19	0.0	``The burden of proof is higher,'' said Representative James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, a House manager who is slated to deliver the opening statement in the Senate trial Thursday.
2_20	0.0	``We have to prove he lied twice''.
2_21	0.0	But Sensenbrenner said it is clear the lie occurred in both cases.
2_22	0.125	The lie, according to the Starr report and the House Judiciary Committee, is that Clinton repeatedly denied having a sexual relationship with Lewinsky in the civil case.
2_23	0.2	Or, as the impeachment article puts it, Clinton made ``prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony in a Federal civil rights action brought against him''.
2_24	0.0	Clinton's defense, according to his lawyers, is that the definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case did not include oral sex.
2_25	1.0	However, impeachment backers said even if that is true, Clinton made other false statements during his testimony.
2_26	0.07142857142857142	For example, Clinton denied touching private parts of Lewinsky's body, which Lewinsky testified did occur.
2_27	0.0	That has led Democratic critics such as Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts to say that the case against Clinton is based on where he touched Lewinsky.
2_28	0.0	But Sensenbrenner said such complaints are ludicrous, arguing there is ample proof that Clinton and Lewinsky agreed to cover up their relationship.
2_29	0.0	Significantly, the Republican counsel for the House Judiciary Committee, David Schippers, has said Clinton and Lewinsky were alone on at least 21 occasions.
2_30	0.0	``They had at least 11 personal sexual encounters, excluding phone sex _ three in 1995, five in 1996 and at least three in 1997,'' Schippers said.
2_31	0.0	``They had at least 55 telephone conversations, some of which, at least 17, involved phone sex.
2_32	0.0	The president gave Ms.
2_33	0.0	Lewinsky 24 presents, and Ms.
2_34	0.0	Lewinsky gave the president 40 presents''.
2_35	0.0	Yet Clinton gave a very different explanation under oath for a deposition in the Jones case: ``Q.
2_36	0.0	At any time were you and Monica Lewinsky alone together in the Oval Office''?
2_37	0.0	``A. I don't recall, but as I said, when she worked at the legislative affairs office, they always had somebody there on the weekends.
2_38	0.0	I typically worked some on the weekends.
2_39	0.0	Sometimes they'd bring me things on the weekends.
2_40	0.0	She _ it seems to me she brought things to me once or twice on the weekends''.
2_41	0.0	At another point in the Jones deposition, Clinton said: ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.
2_42	0.0	I've never had an affair with her''.
2_43	0.0	When Clinton was asked to explain these answers in his grand jury testimony, he blamed the Jones attorneys for failing to ask precise questions.
2_44	0.0	He explained that his answers were based partly on the tense of the questions.
2_45	0.0	Clinton said, ``In the language I used, I said, there's nothing going on between us.
2_46	0.0	That was true.
2_47	0.0	I said I did not have sex with her as I defined it.
2_48	0.0	That was true''.
2_49	0.0	Asked why he denied being alone with Lewinsky, Clinton explained, ``there were a lot of times when we were alone, but I never really thought we were''.
2_50	0.0	To this day, Clinton has not explicitly acknowledged having an affair or sexual relations with Lewinsky.
2_51	0.0	During his grand jury testimony, he acknowledged having an inappropriate relationship with her, and he has said publicly that he has sinned.
2_52	0.16666666666666666	But he has not said that he lied in the civil case or before the grand jury.
2_53	0.0	The House prosecutors, however, argue that Clinton's lies are self-evident and occurred under oath.
2_54	0.0	Still, some Democrats have said that even if the worst is true _ that Clinton committed perjury before the grand jury _ that is not necessarily an impeachable offense.
2_55	0.0	Senator Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat, has said he might be able to vote for acquittal of the president even if he is convinced that Clinton committed perjury.
2_56	0.0	To Sensenbrenner and other House managers, such reasoning makes no sense.
2_57	0.0	Sensenbrenner noted that the Constitution says a president should be impeached for ``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors''.
2_58	0.3333333333333333	Under the federal criminal code, Sensenbrenner said, ``the penalty for perjury is higher than for bribery''.
2_59	0.0	As a result, he said, perjury falls into the category of other high crimes.
2_60	0.0	Thus, Sensenbrenner said, Clinton must convicted.
2_61	0.0	--bstruction of justice.
2_62	0.0	The second article of impeachment says Clinton conspired with others to ``impede, cover up and conceal the existence of evidence and testimony'' in the Jones case.
2_63	0.06666666666666667	The article gives seven examples, including the president's effort to get Lewinsky to sign a sworn affidavit denying that they had a sexual relationship.
2_64	0.0	The article also says Clinton tried to keep Lewinsky quiet by trying to get her a job and by lying himself in the Jones case.
2_65	0.0	Clinton's chief defense is to quote the following testimony from Lewinsky: ``I would just like to say that no one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my silence''.
2_66	0.0	But whenever the White House quotes this line, it neglects to supply the rest of the testimony, in which Lewinsky said: ``The best way to explain how I feel what happened was, you know, no one asked or encouraged me to lie, but no one discouraged me either''.
2_67	0.0	It is the discrepancy between these two quotes from Lewinsky that has led the House managers to conclude that her testimony before the Senate is crucial.
2_68	0.0	The president's fate could turn on whether she had an ``understanding'' with Clinton to lie about their relationship, as impeachment backers have charged.
2_69	0.0	McCollum said it is incorrect to assume that Clinton can escape conviction in the Senate.
2_70	0.0	If the House managers are able to present their case, with witnesses in an open session of the Senate, then many skeptical Democratic senators might be swayed to vote for conviction, McCollum said.
2_71	0.0	``I think if we make a compelling case, it is likely there will be surprises,'' McCollum said.
2_72	0.0	``I wouldn't predict it will end in acquittal.''

6_3	0.0	``For the sake of the nation, I ask you to come forward, admit that you lied under oath and indicate that you are prepared to face the consequences of your actions,'' Representative Bob Franks, a New Jersey Republican, wrote Clinton recently, suggesting such a move would lead him to oppose impeachment.
6_4	0.0	But Clinton aides fear a trap.
6_5	0.0	If Clinton makes such a statement, they fear, then other Republicans might seize on it as a rationale for impeachment, and a prosecutor might use it to indict Clinton after he leaves office.
6_6	0.0	All of this raises two key questions: Did Clinton commit perjury?
6_7	0.0	And if he did, is that an impeachable act?
6_8	0.0	The answers may well determine the president's fate.
6_9	0.07692307692307693	Many Republicans say it is obvious that Clinton committed perjury, noting that he flatly denied any sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
6_10	0.0	But the president's lawyers respond that Clinton's sworn statement in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit was far short of perjury.
6_11	0.0	White House counsel Charles Ruff Wednesday once again refused to say that Clinton lied, saying instead that ``the president engaged in an exercise, a hallmark of which was a desire to be as little help to people on the other side of the Jones case as he could''.
6_12	0.0	Ruff said that while Clinton may have walked ``up to the line'' of lying, he was being truthful ``in his mind'' and ``that is the heart and soul of perjury''.
6_13	0.0	That is significant because perjury is known as a crime of intent.
6_14	0.0	Perjury can only be proven if a prosecutor can show the defendant intended to lie.
6_15	0.0	But while White House aides believed Ruff's argument against perjury was stellar, it may not be enough.
6_16	0.0	The reality is that House members can vote for impeachment even if they don't think Clinton committed perjury in the legal sense, just as they can vote against impeachment even if they think Clinton did commit perjury.
6_17	0.3333333333333333	That is because impeachment is a political act, not a court case.
6_18	0.06666666666666667	``Both sides of that coin are at work here,'' said former federal prosecutor Joseph diGenova, a Republican who believes there is ``no question'' Clinton committed perjury.

6_21	0.0	This is the question for the House''.
6_22	0.0	While Independent Counsel Kenneth W.
6_23	0.0	Starr has suggested there are several instances of possible perjury, the main question is whether Clinton lied under oath when he said he did not have sex with Lewinsky.
6_24	0.0	Clinton has said that his statement was ``legally accurate'' because the definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case was limited.
6_25	0.0	While Clinton has never directly said that his statement was accurate because he had oral sex with Lewinsky, that is the rationale put forward by Clinton's lawyers.
6_26	0.0	Oral sex was not included in the definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case.
6_27	0.0	But Republicans who believe that Clinton committed perjury noted that Clinton did engage in sexual activities with Lewinsky that were included in the definition.
6_28	0.045454545454545456	For example, sexual relations was defined in the Jones case as including ``contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person''.
6_29	0.0	The Starr report says Clinton did have such contact with Lewinsky and lied about it.
6_30	0.0	``According to Ms.
6_31	0.0	Lewinsky, the president touched her breasts and genitalia, which means that his conduct met the Jones definition of sexual relations,'' the Starr report said.
6_32	0.0	If true, that would fall within the definition of sexual relations in the Jones case.
6_33	0.0	The president has not directly addressed this assertion by Lewinsky.
6_34	0.0	Instead, Clinton's lawyers have said that Clinton can't be charged with perjury based on the testimony of a single contradictory witness.
6_35	0.0	Since only Lewinsky and Clinton witnessed their encounters, there is no way for a third party to corroborate the extent of their contact.
6_36	0.7272727272727273	As a result, some Democrats have said the perjury case against the president comes down to whether Clinton touched Lewinsky in a certain manner.
6_37	0.0	Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, has mockingly noted the difference between the famous Watergate-era question _ What did the president know and when did he know it?
6_38	0.0	_ and the current question of ``What did the president touch and when did he touch it''?
6_39	0.0	Wednesday, Frank said that he believed the president lied when he said in the deposition that he couldn't remember being alone with Lewinsky.
6_40	0.0	But if Clinton did lie, Frank said, then he was alone with Lewinsky.
6_41	0.0	And if he was alone with her, Frank continued, then no one else could corroborate ``who touched what'' and thus no one else could say whether Clinton committed perjury.
6_42	0.0	But Republicans disagreed.
6_43	0.0	Representative Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican, said Lewinsky talked to seven other people about her contact with Clinton.
6_44	0.0	``No matter what anyone else says, to me that is corroboration,'' McCollum said.
6_45	0.0	Even if Clinton did lie in the deposition, Democratic Representative Martin Meehan of Massachusetts said, that does not necessarily mean he committed perjury.
6_46	0.0	Meehan said that because Clinton did not believe he was lying, and because the statements were immaterial to the Jones case, the legal standard of perjury was not met.
6_47	0.0	Nonetheless, Meehan said in an interview that Clinton should reconsider his refusal to say that he lied.
6_48	0.0	Meehan said that in addition to Representative Bob Franks of New Jersey, a crucial number of swing-vote Republicans might oppose impeachment if Clinton were to admit he lied.

23_20	0.05555555555555555	District Judge Orinda Evans believed the federal sentencing guidelines called for Holland to receive lenient treatment because he committed perjury in a civil _ and not a criminal _ proceeding.

23_22	0.05263157894736842	In his ruling that directed Evans to re-sentence Holland without leniency with regard to the perjured testimony, Tjoflat noted that Holland ``wilfully made material statements under oath that he knew were false.

24_0	0.0	WASHINGTON _ Thomas Penfield Jackson seems a natural as a judge.
24_1	0.0	He's a big man, white haired, avuncular.
24_2	0.0	But he did not seem a clear natural for the Microsoft trial.
24_3	0.0	Jackson is hardly a technophile; he has been known to write opinions longhand.
24_4	0.0	And while the fast moving world of technology demanded an equally fast-paced trial, Jackson got in trouble once for allowing a trial to go on too long _ so long, in fact, that the Court of Appeals ordered him to rule.
24_5	0.0	But lawyers said he administered the Microsoft trial brilliantly.
24_6	0.0	It was by far the most prominent, and probably the most important trial of his career.
24_7	0.0	And he got through it winning plaudits from both sides for the innovative procedures that allowed testimony to be completed in less than a year, when most major antitrust trials have typically run on for nearly a decade.
24_8	0.07692307692307693	What is more, as the trial proceeded, his knowledge of the computer industry grew; he asked more and more technical questions that demonstrated an ever firmer grasp.
24_9	0.0	Jackson once told a group of reporters who happened to share a cab with him toward the end of the trial that he tried hard to sit Sphinx-like on the bench, so no one could read anything into his expressions.
24_10	0.0	But at that one thing, at least, he failed.
24_11	0.0	Anyone watching could see when he was bored, when he was captivated by the testimony, when he was angry and when he was amused.
24_12	0.0	Some judges put on expressions deliberately, to manipulate the audience.
24_13	0.0	But Jackson seemed guileless.
24_14	0.0	While he cautioned that no one should read anything into his questions, comments, smirks and shrugs, the tenor of his behavior usually left little doubt that Microsoft was not winning the day, or the trial.
24_15	0.0	His findings of fact bore that out.
24_16	0.0	And given his history, it is clear that he prepared them with attention and care.
24_17	0.0	The Court of Appeals rebuked him last year by overturning a previous ruling in a related Microsoft case.
24_18	0.0	That was hardly the judge's only reproval from the higher court.
24_19	0.0	But his findings of fact are almost bulletproof by their very nature.
24_20	0.125	Appeals courts essentially have no standing to question his judgments about the credibility of the testimony before him.
24_21	0.0	And if, as expected, the conclusions of law and verdict hew closely to these findings of fact, the judge's eventual ruling is more likely to withstand appeals.
24_22	0.0	Thomas Penfield Jackson was born in 1937 and grew up in Kensington, Md.
24_23	0.0	, a pleasant, leafy, middle-class suburb of Washington with Victorian homes and its own sense of community.
24_24	0.0	His father, Thomas Searing Jackson, was a prominent Washington lawyer who started his own firm, Jackson &AMP; Campbell.
24_25	0.0	Jackson attended St.
24_26	0.0	Albans prep school in the early grades, on a choir scholarship.
24_27	0.0	But when his voice changed, St.
24_28	0.0	Albans yanked the scholarship and demanded full tuition.
24_29	0.0	So Jackson was transferred to a first-class public high school in Montgomery County, Md.
24_30	0.0	There he played football and was editor of the school newspaper.
24_31	0.0	He has said he once toyed with becoming a journalist.
24_32	0.0	Jackson spent his undergraduate years at Dartmouth, creating a lifelong affiliation with the school.
24_33	0.0	In fact, for several years he headed Dartmouth's alumni association in Washington.
24_34	0.23076923076923078	After graduation, he spent three years in the Navy, most of it aboard a destroyer in the Mediterranean, and then attended Harvard Law School.
24_35	0.0	Soon after, he joined his father's firm as a civil and criminal litigator.
24_36	0.0	Among other cases, he defended several medical organizations charged with malpractice and was often described as a tenacious litigator.
24_37	0.0	Along the way, he became politically active in Montgomery County, an area so heavily Democratic that Republicans like Jackson were ciphers.
24_38	0.0	But the flip side was that it was easy for Republicans to stand out and be noticed, as Jackson was.
24_39	0.0	He came to the attention of the Committee to Re-elect President Nixon, which he served as a lawyer in 1972 _ and avoided any taint from Watergate.
24_40	0.0	In 1980, his name was mentioned for a possible appointment to the District of Columbia Superior Court or the U.S.
24_41	0.0	Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
24_42	0.0	But he was not chosen, and some lawyers at the time said he was not selected because of his membership in the Chevy Chase Country Club, which accepted no black members.
24_43	0.0	Whether or not that was the reason, his membership was probably viewed as impolitic for a judge presiding over trials of District residents, most of whom were black.
24_44	0.0	But that rejection turned out to be a blessing.
24_45	0.0	The Reagan White House clearly did not care about the club membership.
24_46	0.09090909090909091	And two years later, in 1982, President Reagan appointed him to a better position, on the U.S.
24_47	0.0	District Court.
24_48	0.0	Like every judge in that courthouse, he has presided over his share of interesting and important cases, including the 1988 trial of Michael K.
24_49	0.13333333333333333	Deaver, the former top Reagan aide who was convicted of lying under oath during an investigation of whether he had improperly lobbied former White House associates.
24_50	0.08333333333333333	But his most prominent case, before Microsoft, was the trial of the mayor of Washington, Marion Barry, on drug and perjury charges.
24_51	0.0	As in the Microsoft trial, he often interrupted the lawyers to ask witnesses questions of his own.
24_52	0.0	Rasheeda Moore, the former model who was used to lure Barry to a hotel room where he was videotaped smoking crack, referred several times on the tape to ``Jell-O''.
24_53	0.0	Spectators and reporters wondered if that was a code word for drugs, but neither the prosecution nor the defense thought to ask.
24_54	0.0	So Jackson spoke up to ask: Was Jell-O a secret word for drugs?
24_55	0.0	``No, unh-unh,'' Ms.
24_56	0.0	Moore replied; she was merely talking about dessert.
24_57	0.0	Jackson may not have believed that.
24_58	0.0	In fact he had trouble with the trial.
24_59	0.0	Shortly after it ended, he complained in a speech to the Harvard Law Forum that he thought ``four jurors were determined to acquit regardless of the facts,'' adding that ``they obviously did not tell the truth during jury selection when questioned about possible bias''.
24_60	0.0	Jackson went on to say that the government had put on a very strong case.
24_61	0.0	In 1995, the local paper Legal Times sent a reporter to spend a day in his courtroom, to check stories floating around that he was slow-moving.
24_62	0.0	The reporter wrote that he took a two-hour lunch and three ``10-minute'' breaks that each lasted half an hour.
24_63	0.0	All in all, the judge had spent 3 hours and 4 minutes on the bench, the reporter wrote, while his breaks lasted 3 hours and 46 minutes.
24_64	0.0	During the Microsoft trial, the judge scheduled a 90-minute lunch break every day that usually lasted about 110 minutes.
24_65	0.0	And he had regular breaks mid-morning and mid-afternoon, each of which lasted about 20 minutes.
24_66	0.0	Trial opened at 10 a.m. and generally adjourned for the day about 4:20, though sometimes it went as late as 5 p.m.
24_67	0.0	So, generally, Jackson spent about four hours on the bench, three hours on breaks.
24_68	0.14285714285714285	And given the highly technical nature of the testimony, that was probably as much as he or anyone else could handle.
24_69	0.0	No one complained.
24_70	0.0	nn While on the bench, he gave the lawyers for both sides great leeway to conduct their examinations as they chose, usually overruling objections and only occasionally prodding the lawyers to hurry up when he thought the examinations were plodding along in a way that was of little use to him.
24_71	0.0	This was appropriate since he was hearing the case without a jury.
24_72	0.0	In his spare time, Jackson sails on the Chesapeake Bay and reads, both fiction and nonfiction.
24_73	0.0	He has been married three times and has two grown daughters and two granddaughters.
24_74	0.0	His wife, Pat, is director of development at Sidwell Friends, a prep school in Washington.
24_75	0.0	The Microsoft trial, of course, gave the judge more exposure, more attention in the press, than he had ever had before.
24_76	0.0	He plainly was not comfortable with that.
24_77	0.6	In 1997 he wrote a commentary for a judicial conference that showed his view of the news media.
24_78	0.0	``The relationship between a potentially newsworthy case and the press is roughly comparable to the relationship between a healthy organism and an infectious disease,'' he wrote, adding: ``The press, like all infectious diseases, is a predator.
24_79	0.0	It will feed on whatever it can find, including the host if its appetite is not sated.''
