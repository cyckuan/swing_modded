6_0	0.09302325581395349	The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, March 7: Two successive presidents, George Bush and Bill Clinton, have promised to stop the steady erosion of the nation's wetlands _ the 100 million or so acres of swamps, marshes and fens that help prevent floods, filter harmful pollutants, provide habitat for endangered species and nourish tiny organisms essential to the food chain.
6_1	0.0	They have succeeded in beating back the big threats, including efforts by former Vice President Dan Quayle and, later, the Contract With America Republicans to transfer millions of these valuable acres to private interests almost overnight.
6_2	0.47058823529411764	But they have been less successful in persuading the Army Corps of Engineers, which actually regulates wetlands, to take a harder line on developers and others who covet wetlands for commercial purposes.
6_3	0.1875	Monday, however, the Corps announced new and stricter regulations that will make it much harder for developers to keep chewing up the country's wetlands in small bites.
6_4	0.0	The rules would require developers to secure a permit from the Corps for all projects affecting a half-acre of wetlands or more, down from the current minimum of three acres.
6_5	0.0	This change could make a big difference.
6_6	0.875	Though precise figures are elusive, wetlands are disappearing at a rate of about 70,000 to 100,000 acres a year, many of them lost to development on small parcels.
6_7	0.0	Regionally, the rules should benefit New York City's watershed, where thousands of acres essential to the purity of the city's water supply are threatened by small-scale development.
6_8	0.11764705882352941	The new rules reflect steady pressure from the Clinton administration and from the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that took the Corps to court.
6_9	0.058823529411764705	The rules also represent the Corps' second effort to soften the impact of an arcane but ecologically destructive rule known as Nationwide Permit 26.
6_10	0.05	Until three years ago, in the interests of administrative efficiency, Permit 26 had allowed the Corps to grant automatic permits to construction projects that affected less than 10 acres of wetlands.
6_11	0.0	In December 1996 the Corps dropped that limit to three acres.
6_12	0.625	But even these stricter standards have allowed the disappearance of 20,000 or more acres a year.
6_13	0.0	Several important steps remain.
6_14	0.0	Developers and contractors have denounced the new rules, and the administration must be ready to resist legislative attempts to overturn them.
6_15	0.0	Second, the Corps itself is under a heavy obligation to enforce the new rules in a fair-minded but hard-nosed way.
6_16	0.0	This will require careful scrutiny of thousands of individual development proposals that the Corps could ignore under the old rules.
6_17	0.0	The administration should make sure the Corps gets the money it needs for these additional enforcement responsibilities.
6_18	0.0	But for now, anyone who worries about wetlands has reason to cheer.

7_0	0.43333333333333335	Despite President Clinton's promise to stop the destruction of the nation's wetlands, the US Army Corps of Engineers is rapidly retreating from enforcing the main law that protects streams, swamps, and marshes from filling and development, a review of the Corps' records indicates.
7_1	0.20833333333333334	The Corps, one of two main federal agencies charged with protecting wetlands, has slashed inspections for possible violations by 40 percent since 1992, and in 1998 rejected only 3.2 percent of permit applications for major wetland projects.
7_2	0.0	In 1992, the Corps turned down 8.8 percent of such applications, according to the documents.
7_3	0.10714285714285714	Beset by Congressional budget freezes as well as a headquarters goal of greater fairness to developers, Corps employees say they feel pressured to process applications quickly and, in at least one field office, they received a memo urging them to avoid time-consuming, costly enforcement actions.
7_4	0.0	Even in New England, regarded as one of the more vigilant Corps offices, the Corps regulatory budget has been frozen at $4.7 million since 1995, forcing staff reductions from 67 to 55.
7_5	0.0	During that period, wetland-filling applications increased by 8 percent as the region's economy prospered.
7_6	0.3333333333333333	Senior Corps officials acknowledge that inspections and enforcement actions have dropped, but they say that partly reflects a society becoming sensitive to the need to protect wetlands, so there are fewer attempts to damage them.
7_7	0.038461538461538464	In addition, they say the cutbacks reflect five years of budget freezes that have reduced the Corps regulatory staff from 1,150 to 1,050, forcing the agency to be more efficient, avoiding minor issues and allowing state regulators to do more.
7_8	0.11764705882352941	``We believe we've substantially increased environmental protection over the past 10 years,'' said John Studet, chief of the headquarters regulatory branch of the Corps.
7_9	0.0	&QL; &QL; Employees critical &QL; &QL; But Corps employees say the agency has become so averse to enforcing regulations _ and so quick to issue permits _ that it has become a paper tiger easy to take advantage of.
7_10	0.0	``The Corps is withdrawing its presence in enforcement,'' said Magi Shapiro of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, who quit the Corps' Richmond office in 1996 rather than approve developments she felt should have been turned down.

7_13	0.047619047619047616	Grady McCallie, wetland ecologist for the National Wildlife Federation, said the Corps' enforcement decline could spell doom for thousands of acres of wetlands, especially in states that do not have strong enforcement programs.

7_21	0.7307692307692307	The administration, however, puts modest resources into the two agencies charged with protecting wetlands that exist: the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, which together share responsibility for enforcing the federal Clean Water Act that governs wetland development.
7_22	0.0	The EPA has only 26 people nationwide in its technical wetland enforcement division, including one full-time employee based in Boston.
7_23	0.05	At the Corps, Clinton has repeatedly asked for $11 million more for regulation of wetlands than the $106 million approved by Congress this year, a reflection of conservatives' belief that the Corps is often an obstacle to development.
7_24	0.0	However, even if the White House received more money, Clinton does not plan to beef up enforcement significantly.
7_25	0.0	Almost half of the extra money would fund a new appeal system to allow businesses and individuals to challenge Corps decisions.
7_26	0.0	Compounding the Corps' budget problems, the agency is far less comfortable in the enforcer role than the EPA.
7_27	0.2916666666666667	The Corps, best known as the builder of public works and flood control projects, objected to regulating wetlands when the Clean Water Act passed in 1972 and, in recent years, the agency seldom goes to court because of a violation.
7_28	0.0	Now, in addition to few fines and lawsuits, the Corps has also cut back on other kinds of enforcement, according to the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility review.
7_29	0.11764705882352941	Orders to restore illegally damaged wetlands have fallen from 283 to 109 since 1992, while field inspections have dropped from 8,149 to 5,141 in the same period.

7_31	0.0	``What's the use of getting a permit if people can do it without a permit''?
7_32	0.0	A memo for Corps employees in Salt Lake City, obtained by the whistleblowers, even issued guidelines for what enforcement cases to avoid.
7_33	0.1111111111111111	According to the memo, Corps officials ``will normally do nothing further'' if they cannot determine from the office that a reported violation is substantial.
7_34	0.0	Even with some major violations, the memo urges the Corps to ``end its involvement with the case'' if another agency will not take over.
7_35	0.03333333333333333	&QL; &QL; Work overload &QL; &QL; New England Corps officials received no such memo, but the office has eliminated its separate enforcement division and begun transferring more cases to the EPA Boston office, which is overwhelmed with more than 200 tips a year to be investigated by one full-time and one part-time staff member.
7_36	0.0	But Studet of the Corps said the workload shift to the EPA makes sense because the EPA has broader enforcement powers, a bigger legal team, and a formal agreement with the Corps to handle prosecution of flagrant cases.
7_37	0.0	More generally, Studet says critics' fixation on enforcement overlooks big improvements at the Corps.
7_38	0.047619047619047616	For instance, he said the Corps has toughened regulations since 1996, requiring that wetland damage as small as one-third of an acre receive a Corps permit, three times smaller than the previous minimum size.
7_39	0.3333333333333333	He also said the Corps has greatly increased the requirement that developers offset damage to wetlands by creating new ones.
7_40	0.3076923076923077	Last year, the Corps ordered 47,000 acres of new wetlands, which is more than the 31,000 acres they allowed to be damaged.
7_41	0.875	``The (Clinton) goal is 100,000 acres gain by 2005.
7_42	0.0	Our part of that is that we believe we should continue to administer the program so we have no net loss'' of wetlands, Studet said.
7_43	0.0	However, researchers have cast doubt on the value of wetlands created by developers: A University of Massachusetts study shows half of them fail.

7_45	0.0	&QL; &QL; Criticism of Corps &QL; &QL; Officials at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility said the underlying problem is that the Corps is so afraid of controversy it bends over backward for powerful industries.
7_46	0.0	Even in the Concord office of the Corps, which the whistleblowers agree is more vigilant than others, they found evidence of yielding to political pressure.
7_47	0.04	Whistleblowers point to an internal Corps memo in which one Corps official boasted that the agency has done little to slow the rapid growth of the powerful cranberry industry in Maine, which has lobbied Congress for easier rules to allow flooding wetlands for the crop.

22_1	0.07142857142857142	_ Cranberry farmers have been quietly expanding into more and more unregulated acreage, even as they have sought federal approval to use sensitive wetlands, environmental groups assert.

22_13	0.0	Those expansions had added as much as 400 acres to the state's cranberry inventory in recent years, he conceded, which would put the total at about 3,900 acres.
