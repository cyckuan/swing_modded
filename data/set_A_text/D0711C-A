0_0	0.35806075	WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) --The Justice Department has renewed its scrutiny of alleged antitrust violations by the software giant Microsoft Corp.
0_1	0.10835662	, U.S. newspapers reported today.
0_2	0.11842007	A Justice Department spokesman confirmed Thursday that "we have an ongoing investigation and it's continuing".
0_3	0.062697171	Netscape Communication Corp.
0_4	0.28979441	, Microsoft's major rival in the U.S. market for software, wrote to the Justice Department last month asking regulators to examine possible antitrust violations in the marketing and distribution of Microsoft's Internet Explorer software.
0_5	0.11867502	It said that Microsoft was unfairly offering computer makers financial "inducements" for giving Microsoft's Internet software an exclusive place on their computers, or for making Netscape's product "far less accessible to users".
0_6	0.073270202	But Microsoft dismissed those claims as "wide and untrue".
0_7	0.079018926	Microsoft Senior Vice President William H.
0_8	0.15036694	Neukom said Thursday that "the facts will show that Microsoft is competing vigorously and legally".
0_9	0.13598955	Microsoft, based in Redmond of Washington, has been the focus of antitrust investigations in the past years.
0_10	0.22226926	Last year, the Justice Department opposed Microsoft's planned 2-billion-dollar purchase of Intuit Inc.
0_11	0.10930562	, maker of Quicken personal finance software, and Microsoft had to pay Intuit 46.2 million dollars for the trouble.
0_12	0.098562464	The U.S. government has strengthened its antitrust efforts in recent years as the market competitions are more and more fierce and complicated.
1_0	0.24470628	WASHINGTON _ Microsoft filed an unexpected brief with a federal judge on Monday that quoted from a 5-year-old government legal document in which the Justice Department argued that breaking up Microsoft would be ``against the public interest'' and ``dangerous to the economy's welfare''.
1_1	0.52931162	The document was part of the public record from an older antitrust case against Microsoft, the Justice Department's first suit against the company.
1_2	0.20823794	The nine-page brief gives Microsoft the final word before a hearing on Wednesday but risks irritating the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, who did not ask for another filing from Microsoft when he laid out the schedule for the remedy phase of the case.
1_3	0.23344882	Under the schedule set by Jackson in April, the Justice Department and 17 states filed a brief with the court on April 28 asking the judge to break Microsoft into two companies as the remedy for the illegal behavior found in the long antitrust trial.
1_4	0.092630374	Then, 12 days later, Microsoft responded with its own proposal, a short list of narrow restrictions on its behavior, while denouncing the government's plan.
1_5	0.25988519	Last Wednesday, the Justice Department filed a reply to Microsoft's brief, saying the company's proposal was ``a cosmetic remedy'' of no real worth.
1_6	0.04788718	That was to have been the last filing.
1_7	0.22634619	But a Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, said the company ``believes it is appropriate for the company to have a reply to focus on a few issues raised in the government's last brief''.
1_8	0.12462964	While citing the old Justice Department documents, Microsoft also repeated several legal arguments it had made previously.
1_9	0.17994843	Among them, the company stated that the courts have never broken up a company for antitrust violations; all of the previous breakups have been a result of settlements of antitrust suits.
1_10	0.13084005	``For all its sophistry in discussing the case law, the government fails to identify a single precedent for its radical breakup proposal,'' Microsoft wrote.
1_11	0.24324598	The Justice Department did not respond to Microsoft's filing, but a lawyer who is close to the government's current case said it ``relies on statements made before Microsoft had engaged in the numerous illegal acts found in the current case''.
1_12	0.36246687	The legal document quoted in the Microsoft brief was taken from the court record of the Justice Department's first antitrust suit against Microsoft, which was resolved in 1995.
1_13	0.10680068	That case was settled when Microsoft accepted several behavioral restrictions.
1_14	0.097538594	Under a law known as the Tunney Act, any settlement of an antitrust suit must be put up for public comment before the judge can decide whether to approve it.
1_15	0.12140472	And much of the industry comment then was disparaging; executives called the proposed settlement inadequate and argued that Microsoft ought to be broken up instead.
1_16	0.20905247	Responding to those public comments, the Justice Department filed the brief Microsoft quoted Monday.
1_17	0.1060401	In it the government's economist then, Kenneth J.
1_18	0.10817969	Arrow of Stanford University, wrote that breakup remedies ``designed to return the market to equilibrium'' are ``likely to be of the form of penalizing whatever firm happens to be leading, Microsoft in this case''.
1_19	0.15387388	On Monday, the lawyer who is close to the government's case said, ``That Microsoft repeatedly violated the law after the previous proceeding demonstrates why structural relief is necessary now.''
2_0	0.26285066	Microsoft Corp.'s massive defeat in its federal antitrust suit leaves the company facing perhaps the most severe crisis in its 25-year history.
2_1	0.24474826	Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's holding that Microsoft is a monopoly that abused its power and harmed consumers raises the possibility that the US Justice Department might demand the corporate equivalent of the death penalty _ the dismantling of Microsoft _ after the manner of Standard Oil Co.'s 1911 breakup.
2_2	0.28476942	Joel Klein, antitrust chief at the Justice Department, Friday would not rule out this Draconian penalty.
2_3	0.089865079	But even if Microsoft avoids action of this magnitude, years of tough legal battles lie ahead, with a potential to sap the firm's ability to keep up with its competitors.
2_4	0.090791883	And those competitors can use Friday's ruling to make life even tougher for Microsoft.
2_5	0.19458688	Antitrust experts say the findings of fact can be used by dozens of Microsoft's competitors as the basis of their own private antitrust actions against the company.
2_6	0.11956443	``It's really a disaster for Microsoft,'' said Thane Scott, head of the antitrust practice at Boston law firm Palmer &AMP; Dodge.
2_7	0.095303582	``Based on these documents alone, anybody who feels he's been harmed by Microsoft can walk into a court and get a jury trial.
2_8	0.086554101	.. . If you're a company like Microsoft, the last place you want to be is in front of a jury''.
2_9	0.079910925	Lisa Wood, of Boston law firm Nutter McClennen &AMP; Fish, said the danger of private suits based on Friday's ruling is so severe that it practically ensures Microsoft will fight to the bitter end, rather than settle.
2_10	0.079159683	``To stop now and not finish could leave Microsoft exposed to private litigation,'' said Wood, who chairs a committee on antitrust law for the American Bar Association.
2_11	0.15560762	Wood predicted that Microsoft will soldier on, taking up the next phase of the case in an effort to recoup its loss.
2_12	0.16194395	In the next phase, the findings of law, Jackson will apply antitrust law to the facts he has settled upon.
2_13	0.095891114	Microsoft will have to argue that even if the facts are accepted as true, they don't constitute a violation of law.
2_14	0.15980055	Scott says the government's nearly total victory on findings of fact bodes ill for Microsoft in the next phase of the trial, and even reduces the likelihood of a successful appeal.
2_15	0.12717973	Microsoft has had some success before federal appellate courts.
2_16	0.17927392	An attempt last year to have the company held in contempt of court for violating an earlier consent decree was rejected by an appeals court, which ruled that Microsoft had a right to add Internet browsing capabilities to its operating system _ one of the key issues in dispute in the antitrust case.
2_17	0.19389805	But Scott says the sweeping rejection of Microsoft's view of the case will bear weight with the appeals court.
2_18	0.055204332	``They have an uphill battle on appeal,'' he said.
2_19	0.066932926	``The facts have been decided against them rather severely''.
2_20	0.12192836	Still, it seems unlikely Microsoft can now simply settle the case, not only because of the threat of private lawsuits but because the government is now in a position to make very tough demands.
2_21	0.30016421	Besides, 19 state attorneys general are involved in the suit, as well as the federal government.
2_22	0.059619939	Microsoft would have to satisfy them all.
2_23	0.091291816	``It's difficult to settle a case when there's blood in the water,'' said Scott, ``and this result does that''.
2_24	0.099641847	Charles Ferguson, who sold Vermeer Technologies in Cambridge, Mass.
2_25	0.30139155	to Microsoft in 1997, is a harsh critic of the company.
2_26	0.077578858	``I think they're going to fight to the death,'' Ferguson said.
2_27	0.091180362	``It's their whole culture''.
2_28	0.11856571	Meanwhile, Jackson's ruling could have an impact on other cases already pending against Microsoft.
2_29	0.074701868	The firm is still fighting against rival Sun Microsystems Inc.
2_30	0.11899374	in federal court.
2_31	0.094333138	At issue is whether Microsoft violated Sun's copyright to the Java computing system, which allows programmers to write programs that can run on many different types of computers.
2_32	0.11533759	An appeals court in August overturned an injunction against Microsoft, but Sun is seeking to have that injunction reinstated.
2_33	0.16032124	If this weren't enough for Microsoft, the company faces another antitrust shootout in a case that has attracted far less attention but could be equally devastating to Microsoft's future.
2_34	-0.011263813	Caldera Systems Inc.
2_35	0.19126659	, an Orem, Utah, maker of Linux software, filed an antitrust case against Microsoft in 1996.
2_36	0.12400222	The case involves DR-DOS, an operating system once sold by Novell Inc.
2_37	0.076297154	as an alternative to an early Microsoft product, MS-DOS.
2_38	0.08397752	Caldera chief executive Ray Noorda formerly ran Novell, and he bought DR-DOS from Novell in order to pursue a court case against Microsoft.
2_39	0.095481368	Noorda believes that during the early 1990s, Microsoft used its market power to stamp out DR-DOS and keep it from gaining a foothold in the operating systems market.
2_40	0.086275086	If Caldera wins, it could obtain damages running into the billions of dollars.
2_41	0.13603328	On Thursday, a federal judge in Salt Lake City threw out an effort by Microsoft to have key charges in the case dismissed.
2_42	0.10182767	The judge ruled that the Caldera-Microsoft case will go to trial in January.
2_43	0.1142061	Unlike the Justice Department case, the Caldera matter will be decided by a jury chosen from Caldera's back yard _ a daunting prospect for Microsoft .
3_0	0.24223809	The government and Microsoft have been summoned to Chicago on Tuesday for their first round of settlement talks under Richard Posner, the federal appeals court judge who has been selected as a mediator, according to a person close to the antitrust case.
3_1	0.1112305	The mediation talks themselves, under court rules, are secret deliberations.
3_2	0.074825221	Besides Posner, who is chief judge of the 7th U.S.
3_3	0.36256816	Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, the meeting will include lawyers representing Microsoft and the Justice Department and 19 states suing the company.
3_4	0.090062521	Posner, regarded as both an antitrust expert and a brilliant jurist, is expected to quickly assess the chances of any settlement between the two sharply divided sides.
3_5	0.21348979	In a meeting last Thursday, Thomas Penfield Jackson, the trial judge for the Microsoft case, told lawyers for the two sides that he had asked Posner to mediate.
3_6	0.088437665	At the time, Jackson noted, ``I don't think he is going to be prepared to waste a whole lot of time if it looks from the outset that it's not promising''.
3_7	0.10453501	If a settlement is reached, it will most likely happen in the next two months or not at all, according to another person close to the case.
3_8	0.074336228	``By the end of January, or it won't happen,'' he said.
3_9	0.073348294	Posner is serving as a mediator, not an arbiter, for the settlement talks.
3_10	0.17550578	There have been sporadic settlement talks between Microsoft and the government stretching back to before the suit was filed in May 1998.
3_11	0.061972894	Yet the previous efforts stalled.
3_12	0.080111109	Antitrust experts expect that Posner will try to deliver a sobering helping of reality to both sides.
3_13	0.10815343	They predict he will tell the government and states that their hand is as strong as it will ever be, while telling Microsoft to settle before it is hit with a final ruling that it violated the law, which could sharply increase its vulnerability to class-action lawsuits.
3_14	0.16300377	Final oral arguments in the case are scheduled for Feb.

4_0	0.17517359	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) --The trial of Caldera Inc.'s antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp.
4_1	0.04730531	has been postponed from June until next January.
4_2	0.087264781	U.S. District Judge Dee Benson on Thursday postponed the trial until Jan.
4_3	0.30764529	17 after Microsoft said its key attorneys were enmeshed in the federal antitrust action against Microsoft in Washington, D.C.
4_4	0.14029359	Meanwhile, Microsoft has launched a new attack, arguing Caldera has not uncovered evidence to support its claims that Microsoft has used illegal marketing and licensing tactics.
4_5	0.073925923	Caldera, a small firm based in Orem, contends Microsoft deliberately destroyed the public's demand for DR-DOS, a program that enables computers to perform basic functions.
4_6	0.12784582	One of Caldera's expert witnesses calculated the company's damages at $1.6 billion.
4_7	0.085930176	New Microsoft filings allege internal memos show DR-DOS's own developers knew they had a flawed product and poor technical support for frustrated consumers.
4_8	0.089293934	``Right now we are Microsoft's biggest endorser,'' a DR-DOS adviser wrote in 1992.
4_9	0.091059739	``(The) majority of all the irate individuals I speak with say that they are going back to Microsoft because at least they provide support''.
4_10	0.075650979	The filings are aimed at sharply limiting Caldera's claims at trial.
4_11	0.09538099	Caldera President Bryan Sparks said Caldera's response to Microsoft's arguments will be filed next month.
4_12	0.069012794	``We feel we have evidence to refute every one of them,'' he said.
4_13	0.048334509	In court Thursday, Caldera attorney Stephen J.
4_14	0.081027378	Hill asked Benson to go forward with the trial in June, or postpone it only until August.
4_15	0.10064452	For Caldera to sue Microsoft is ``a David vs.
4_16	0.10224585	Goliath situation,'' Hill said.
4_17	0.09605181	``The longer (the litigation) goes, the more it costs''.
4_18	0.1697115	Microsoft attorney James Jardine says key Microsoft lawyers will need time to prepare for the Caldera trial once the federal antitrust case concludes.
4_19	0.10650304	Rulings on Microsoft's new filings likely will require written opinions and will determine the scope of the trial, Benson said.
4_20	0.078597037	Those decisions will not be completed until May, only weeks before the scheduled trial, he noted.
4_21	0.083268336	DR-DOS was created by Digital Research Inc.
4_22	0.082523465	and later purchased by Novell Inc.
4_23	0.090309999	, which halted the program's development in 1994.
4_24	0.099591248	Caldera acquired DR-DOS in 1996, along with the right to sue over Microsoft's alleged efforts to quash it.
4_25	0.13657246	DR-DOS competed with Microsoft's MS-DOS.
5_0	0.16864437	The testimony last week of Garry Norris of IBM supplied some of the most absorbing moments so far in the Microsoft trial.
5_1	0.13636512	His litany of accusations was lengthy and specific _ threats and enticements to not compete against the Microsoft Corp.
5_2	0.056346635	delivered at meeting after meeting.
5_3	0.077928464	His charges were fleshed out with the dates, places and names, and backed up by his handwritten notes.
5_4	0.14706354	Norris, who negotiated with Microsoft on behalf of IBM's personal computer business from 1995 to 1997, was the first representative of a PC maker to testify for the government.
5_5	0.20984054	David Boies, the lead trial lawyer for the Justice Department, said the Norris testimony put a ``vivid human face'' on what he called ``some of the most important evidence in the case''.
5_6	0.14613232	Yet antitrust experts say that the Norris testimony was not a knockout punch on its own and that its legal power may hinge on earlier testimony, in closed sessions, on the prices Microsoft charges PC makers for its Windows operating system.
5_7	0.10139143	Big, powerful and itself long a target of government antitrust suits, IBM was an imperfect object of sympathy as the representative witness for PC makers.
5_8	0.13577016	Ever since IBM selected Microsoft to supply the operating system for the first IBM PC in 1981, IBM has been out-hustled and outsmarted by Microsoft in the PC business _ not the sort of behavior the nation's antitrust laws were meant to prohibit.
5_9	0.13183264	The government, of course, had recognized that IBM's size, reach and complicated history with Microsoft could be used by Microsoft's lawyers to try to undercut its contentions.
5_10	0.10975409	For months, the Justice Department had urged other major computer makers to take the stand _ and it pushed particularly hard for Ted Waitt, the chairman of Gateway Inc.
5_11	0.067921279	, who ultimately decided against it.
5_12	0.10011988	Microsoft's defense, antitrust experts say, may be that IBM was told it would pay a higher price for Windows unless it agreed to ``reduce, drop or eliminate'' shipments of OS/2, IBM's competing operating system.
5_13	0.078259683	On its face, such an invitation to a competitor to reduce competition would be an antitrust violation, even if the offer were rejected.
5_14	0.10217455	But the legal standard in such cases, established in a 1984 ruling involving American Airlines, is that the evidence be ``uniquely unequivocal'' _ in the airline case, the evidence was a tape-recorded offer to jointly raise fares.
5_15	0.064230764	With Microsoft, there is no such clear-cut evidence.
5_16	0.089883307	The contract proposals presented in court were a series of suggested discounts on the price of Windows if IBM agreed to certain promotion and marketing efforts on behalf of Windows.
5_17	0.09700467	No Microsoft contract offer, Norris conceded, stated specifically that IBM must ``drop or eliminate'' OS/2.
5_18	0.13409585	But he insisted that the overall effect of the Microsoft terms would be to ``kill OS/2 in the markeplace''.
5_19	0.11883426	Still, antitrust experts note, it is certainly legal for Microsoft to offer a distributor _ as the IBM PC business was _ incentives to aggressively distribute its product.
5_20	0.093673618	If accepting those incentives means featuring Microsoft's Windows over OS/2 _ made by another unit of IBM _ that is mainly a business decision for IBM to make, they say.
5_21	0.18002518	IBM turned down the Microsoft proposal.
5_22	0.1315822	A shrewdly devised offer by Microsoft perhaps, but antitrust experts say it was probably not a violation.
5_23	0.12877862	``It will be very difficult for the government to prevail on the OS/2 allegations,'' said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University.
5_24	0.091333751	The Norris testimony, however, went well beyond the OS/2 charge.
5_25	0.12250386	He asserted that Microsoft repeatedly offered IBM better terms and prices for Windows if it favored Microsoft products ranging from so-called office productivity applications to its Internet browsing software.
5_26	0.094210149	When IBM rejected those proposals, Norris said, Microsoft charged IBM more for Windows than it charged other major PC makers.
5_27	0.13901203	``The strongest Norris testimony was when he recounted the incidents of IBM not using other Microsoft software and then getting punished on the price of Windows,'' said Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, who is a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division.
5_28	0.085335944	Microsoft insists there is no evidence that IBM paid a higher price for Windows than its competitors.
5_29	0.054417531	The exception was the Compaq Computer Corp.
5_30	0.09901141	, which received a significantly lower price, Microsoft says, because it shared in the costs of developing Windows 95 _ a straightforward business rationale for different terms, says Microsoft, not punishment meted out by a monopolist.
5_31	0.12898079	But the government introduced an IBM document that cast doubt on Microsoft's statement.
5_32	0.087483512	The document, an internal memo, said IBM believed it paid $5 to $15 more for each copy of Windows it loaded on its machines than did Compaq, Hewlett-Packard or Dell Computer.
5_33	0.087685181	``IBM,'' the May 1997 document stated, ``currently pays a higher royalty than our leading competitors''.
5_34	0.14405888	Much of the detailed, company-by-company information on the prices to makers for Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system was submitted in previous testimony.
5_35	0.13838322	To protect confidential commercial information, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson took that testimony in closed sessions.
5_36	0.11854908	If the industry pricing information shows that IBM was paying more than comparable PC makers, the Norris testimony may add more legal ammunition to the government's case.
5_37	0.11561427	``To the extent the Norris testimony fits into the pattern of Microsoft threats and punishment, it is another piece in the puzzle,'' Litan, the former Justice Department official, said.
6_0	0.20154921	After a yearlong antitrust investigation, Japan's Fair Trade Commission told Microsoft Corp.
6_1	0.1811238	Friday to change permanently one of its marketing practices and pointedly warned the company to watch its step in the Internet browser market.
6_2	0.14168976	But despite the reprimand, the Japanese antitrust agency also stated that Microsoft's business practices ``cannot be immediately found to have tended to impede fair competition'' in the market for browser software in Japan.
6_3	0.14035751	Microsoft focused on that finding Friday as evidence that a major industrial nation had investigated many of the same practices as those in dispute in the Microsoft trial in Washington and had not found an anticompetitive effect.
6_4	0.085154586	``The finding in Japan is potentially quite interesting from an American standpoint because the Japanese investigators looked at the same kinds of things that are at issue in Washington,'' said Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel for international affairs.
6_5	0.12668319	Microsoft also announced Friday that the South Korean Fair Trade Commission had informed the company two months ago that its investigation of Microsoft, begun in November 1997, was concluded and that no further review was expected.
6_6	0.31074603	There is no direct link between the several overseas investigations of Microsoft and the antitrust case being heard in Washington, where the Justice Department and 20 states have sued Microsoft.
6_7	0.19322126	Antitrust experts said that most countries still investigating Microsoft's practices were taking a wait-and-see stance toward the company, pending the outcome of the major U.S. antitrust case.
6_8	0.090747192	Karel van Miert, the European commissioner in charge of competition policy, said recently that the European Commission was ``closely watching'' the trial in Washington, so for the present, there was no reason to devote more resources to the European investigation.
6_9	0.087744538	``Waiting itself is a kind of helpful coordination among nations,'' said Eleanor M.
6_10	0.088664881	Fox, a professor at the New York University Law School.
6_11	0.093612223	``And I certainly wouldn't draw the inference from the Japanese Fair Trade Commission's statement that Microsoft is off the hook in Japan at all''.
6_12	0.090470623	The Japanese investigation of Microsoft began in October 1997, but accelerated sharply on the morning of Jan.
6_13	0.096142726	13 when 20 uniformed police officers swept into Microsoft's offices in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo.
6_14	0.069104957	The investigation was stepped up after Joel I.
6_15	0.28888539	Klein, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, visited Japan in December.
6_16	0.15698253	But in response to a Senate question on the matter, the Justice Department said that Klein had not encouraged Japan ``to take action of any kind against Microsoft''.
6_17	0.11018762	The Japanese antitrust agency did find that Microsoft had been engaging in an unfair trade practice by bundling its Excel spreadsheet and Word text program in sales to personal computer makers.
6_18	0.095202502	Microsoft began bundling the two products for sales to PC makers three years ago, after a Japanese rival, Justsystem Corp.
6_19	0.067294296	, did the same thing.
6_20	0.097254742	Microsoft said it began making it easier for PC makers in Japan to load the two products separately in April, though most PC companies still preferred the bundled offering.
6_21	0.08725284	Microsoft says it has no plans to challenge the Japanese agency's order, which the fair trade commission terms a ``recommendation.''
7_0	1.4447329	Microsoft Corp.
7_1	0.20568813	, whose business practices are being challenged by the government in a major antitrust case, suffered a legal setback on another front Tuesday when a federal judge in California ordered the company to stop shipping Internet software that violates its contract with a rival, Sun Microsystems Inc.
7_2	0.16705975	The impact that the order, a preliminary injunction in a private law suit in California, will have on the government's case is uncertain.
7_3	0.20923505	But the allegations in the government's antitrust suit do include the practices that are at the heart of the breach-of-contract case Sun filed against Microsoft last October _ namely, that Microsoft is trying to ``pollute'' Sun's Internet programming language, called Java, by modifying it.
7_4	0.32421635	The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft in the antitrust case say that this is part of a pattern of illegal practices by the software giant intended to protect and extend its tight grip on the market for personal computer software.
7_5	0.092683516	If Sun's Java became an industry-standard, the government asserts, it could pose a serious challenge to Microsoft.
7_6	0.13062119	And in the California case, Sun had argued that by altering the Java programming language, Microsoft had violated a contract the two companies had signed.
7_7	0.12013063	Judge Ronald Whyte in the U.S.
7_8	0.09491776	District Court in San Jose ordered Microsoft to stop the practice and gave it 90 days to make its Internet software entirely compatible with Sun's Java, as it had agreed to do when it signed a technology licensing agreement with Sun.
7_9	0.18321923	The California ruling is badly timed for Microsoft, but the spillover, if any, to the antitrust case in Washington is difficult to determine.
7_10	0.20941711	``The Justice Department will argue that a breach of contract is part of the pattern of bad acts by Microsoft and of its intent to monopolize,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division.
7_11	0.10053018	``It helps the atmospherics of the government's case, but it's not clear beyond that what the effect will be''.
7_12	0.091524339	The ruling Tuesday is a preliminary injuction, noted Litan, and the Sun-Microsoft trial is not scheduled to begin until next year.
7_13	0.21558572	Meanwhile, the antitrust trial is already well under way, and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is expected to rule early next year.
7_14	0.15181292	``If there was a final ruling in the contract case, it would have far more direct impact on the antitrust case,'' said Litan, who is now at the Brookings Institution.
7_15	0.11588744	The California ruling, industry analysts say, is not likely to have a significant impact on Microsoft's business anytime soon _ though it does raise questions about the company's strategy of trying to influence the industry to accept Microsoft's version of Internet software standards.
7_16	0.09239138	``Because the judge gave it 90 days to comply, there is no business interruption for Microsoft,'' said Richard Sherlund, an analyst for Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.
7_17	0.070133109	``Microsoft does not have to pull products out of distribution''.
7_18	0.17919552	But, Sherlund noted, the ruling does ``rein Microsoft in, and it clearly comes at an awkward time for the company, given the antitrust case.''
8_0	0.25704893	Legal experts gave the judge in the Microsoft case high marks Thursday for his handling of the case, saying he took some risks but grounded his ruling in fundamental principles governing fair competition.
8_1	0.29953251	They said the actions of the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, had made it more difficult for Microsoft to suggest that the computer industry ought to be given more leeway than traditional businesses under antitrust law.
8_2	0.082842212	``It reminds people that there are antitrust laws out there,'' said George A.
8_3	0.14139123	Hay, a professor of antitrust law at Cornell Law School.
8_4	0.068928192	``It is a useful reminder that there are rules and just because you are big you can't do whatever you want''.
8_5	0.13746028	The risks for Jackson in the ruling, the legal experts said, included his decision to deny Microsoft new hearings on whether to break up the company or impose some lesser remedy after he had decided it abused its monopoly power.
8_6	0.068126618	Some experts said appeals courts might overturn that decision and could order new hearings.
8_7	0.10515199	But several antitrust experts said the judge made efforts throughout the case to tie his decisions to traditional views of antitrust law, which is based on the principle that aggressive competition is encouraged, but not when it crosses the line into efforts to hamper competitors' abilities to make new products or market existing ones.
8_8	0.149561	The judge said in an earlier ruling that Microsoft had maintained its dominance by keeping ``an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune''.
8_9	0.17773114	Some of the experts said the judge's emphasis on traditional antitrust principles, like rules against intimidation by monopolies, could blunt Microsoft's public efforts to suggest that the Justice Department was overstepping the appropriate bounds of antitrust enforcement.
8_10	0.1770517	The company has suggested that the suit was an anti-capitalist attack that would be harmful not just to Microsoft.
8_11	0.10127072	The company's chairman, Bill Gates, said it was an ``unwarranted intrusion'' into ``a marketplace that has been an engine of economic growth for America''.
8_12	0.11938521	Microsoft used the rapid change of the new software industry as an argument to suggest that Jackson should view the case differently than he might have viewed a case against a smokestack company, said Charles J.
8_13	0.10480128	Goetz, an expert on antitrust law at the University of Virginia School of Law.
8_14	0.093756231	Goetz praised Jackson for refusing to be drawn into that approach and focusing on Microsoft's competitive style.
8_15	0.15984164	``There has been an attempt by Microsoft, to a large extent successful with the public,'' Goetz said, ``to distinguish this case from traditional antitrust cases because it is in the high-tech field''.
8_16	0.080204173	``But mere fast change is not the issue,'' Goetz continued.
8_17	0.12338824	``What this case was about was that other companies appeared to be coming up with a `better mousetrap,' and Microsoft was charged with engaging in very costly attempts to try to prevent competition from those products''.
8_18	0.1095856	Einer Elhauge, a professor of antitrust law at Harvard Law School, said Jackson's decision on Wednesday had to be viewed in the context of his earlier findings, like holding that Microsoft intimidated competitors and made efforts at collusion.
8_19	0.092028099	``It is very hard to second-guess him,'' Elhauge said, ``and it is going to be very hard for an appeals court to second-guess him'' on his factual findings.
8_20	0.090679786	If those findings are accepted, Elhauge said, the conclusion to order a breakup appears ``entirely sensible'' under legal precedents.
8_21	0.087386435	Lesser remedies like orders to monopoly companies to cease abusive tactics have proved difficult to police, he said.
8_22	0.14492225	Several experts said one of Jackson's legally risky decisions was his treatment of Microsoft's Windows operating system and its Web browser as two separate products that it had illegally tied together.
8_23	0.093483535	Under antitrust rules, a company that has a dominant product, like a salt packing machine in an early case, cannot take advantage of its dominance by requiring customers to buy another product, like raw salt, to get the popular product.
8_24	0.094240005	But if, as Microsoft urged, its Web browser should more correctly have been viewed as an innovation that enhanced Windows, portions of Jackson's ruling might be vulnerable on appeal.
8_25	0.36320551	It was on that issue that the federal appeals court in Washington overruled Jackson in an earlier phase of the company's battle with the government.
8_26	0.092425097	Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School, said the decision that Windows and the browser were two products illegally tied together could be vulnerable in an appeal.
8_27	0.093534792	But even on that subject, Moglen said, Jackson made extensive efforts to portray his approach as consistent with the law.
8_28	0.089084604	``He was as orthodox on antitrust issues as he could possibly be,'' Moglen said, adding that he thought Jackson had worked to try to protect the decisions from being overturned.
8_29	0.16543968	Several of the legal experts said Thursday that they saw little support for Microsoft's suggestion that the judge was relying on antitrust concepts that are out of step with the fast-moving computer business.
8_30	0.109336	They said that the computer age might require adjustments to some antitrust concepts, like the question of whether an operating system and a Web browser are really separate products.
8_31	0.094949565	But, some of them said, evidence of intimidation or efforts at collusion are the heart of the legal system's effort to keep commercial markets competitive.
8_32	0.093459832	Elhauge of Harvard said the company's sense that it was the victim of an injustice was a familiar defense.
8_33	0.1303229	``Every industry, as it is growing,'' he said, ``seems surprised that the antitrust law applies to it.''

11_0	0.29843412	WASHINGTON _ In its closing argument in the Microsoft trial, the government said Tuesday that it is ``simply impossible to imagine'' that the company will not be found to have violated the nation's antitrust laws, based on the mountains of courtroom evidence.
11_1	1.2407644	The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft Corp.
11_2	0.27841692	, antitrust experts say, were playing a stong hand after Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued findings of fact last November that supported the government's version of the case in nearly every respect.
11_3	0.12923431	Yet Jackson has not yet issued his conclusions of law, which are expected sometime in the next few months.
11_4	0.068626707	Tuesday's presentations were the final attempt by both sides to try to influence Jackson's thinking.
11_5	0.17346578	Settlement talks, mediated by Richard Posner, chief judge of the federal appeals court in Chicago, are continuing, but the two sides remain divided.
11_6	0.11854089	Tuesday's courtroom statements _ uncompromising attacks from each side _ only seemed to underline the gap between the government and Microsoft.
11_7	0.20695679	At one point, David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer, said Microsoft's business strategy was based on trying to ``bribe and coerce'' other companies in the computer industry.
11_8	0.10714621	His counterpart, John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, dismissed one of Boies' arguments as ``entirely wrong''.
11_9	0.12950446	The government, according to most antitrust experts, is sitting on a big lead, while Microsoft is trying to limit its losses in Jackson's court and planning to fare better on appeal.
11_10	0.083370762	In its courtroom presentation Tuesday, Microsoft seemed to have elements of a loss-limitation strategy.
11_11	0.18993733	Warden began by saying that Microsoft ``respectfully disagreed'' with a large part of the judge's findings of fact.
11_12	0.093984108	He then went on to tell Jackson that his ruling might well shape the ground rules for competition in the high-tech economy.
11_13	0.25518675	The Microsoft case, Warden noted, focuses on the company's ``fights with competitors in a highly competitive, fast-moving industry''.
11_14	0.091494199	And antitrust doctrine, he observed, encourages competition even when that rough-and-tumble competition hurts a company's rivals.
11_15	0.095182129	``The law should not be rewritten to prevent Microsoft, or any other company, from competing aggressively,'' Warden said.
11_16	0.19413472	In the government's view, Microsoft is trying to change the subject with such arguments.
11_17	0.11042337	Fierce competition is one thing, the government says, but the voluminous record including volumes of e-mail, internal Microsoft documents and witness testimony show Microsoft to have been an arm-twisting monopolist, whose corporate behavior stifled competition and harmed consumers.
11_18	0.15262661	Boies opened his remarks by stressing that the Supreme Court has long recognized that antitrust cases are ``especially fact-based cases''.
11_19	0.11739462	And throughout his presentation, he repeatedly made reference to the judge's findings of fact, which sided so emphatically with the government, using phrases like ``the court has found,'' ``the evidence shows'' and ``Microsoft's own witnesses and documents show''.
11_20	0.098372364	And what that evidence showed, said Kevin O'Connor, an assistant attorney general for Wisconsin, who represented the states, was that ``Microsoft has used virtually every tool of the monopolist's trade _ attempted collusion, exclusionary contracts, tying, predation _ in a coordinated scheme to eliminate threats to its monopoly.''

13_0	0.16052729	WASHINGTON _ Justice Department lawyers savored a resounding victory Friday evening in their case against Microsoft, a victory that one official attributed not to any brilliant strategy but to the simple truth.
13_1	0.1861036	``This is a great day for American consumers,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said, declaring herself pleased that the court had agreed with the government.
13_2	0.10645817	``This case is about the protection of innovation, competition and the consumers' right to choose the products they want,'' Reno said.
13_3	0.16583513	``Facts are stubborn things,'' said Joel Klein, head of the antitrust division, exulting in a 207-page decision that found for the government on virtually every important point.
13_4	0.1041456	Asked if he thought Microsoft had made any strategic errors during the trial, Klein responded that ``theatrics are always interesting, and there were some fun moments in this trial.
13_5	0.085248101	I think this case was about the evidence''.
13_6	0.30802337	Klein's comments notwithstanding, the Justice Department's lead lawyer in the Microsoft case, David Boies, is one of the most highly regarded litigators in the country.
13_7	0.062245064	At first, Boies shied away from the microphone.
13_8	0.061378968	``I had my shot in the courtroom,'' Boies said, smiling broadly.

13_11	0.10910015	``Go ahead''.
13_12	0.083057706	Then Boies indicated that he, too, thought the outcome had less to do with strategy and more to do with facts.
13_13	0.059154519	``In some senses, this is not a surprise,'' he said.
13_14	0.066303861	``In a lot of ways, this is exactly what the evidence showed''.
13_15	0.10243182	Pronouncing himself ``enormously pleased'' with the decision, Klein said it showed that ``in America, no person and no company is above the law''.
13_16	0.19425259	Blumenthal had some of the harshest words for Microsoft, asserting that the opinion by federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had portrayed ``a predator that has misused its monopolistic power''.
13_17	0.13869099	Some of the most damning evidence against Microsoft was furnished by Microsoft itself, Blumenthal said, in its internal e-mail and other records that proved the company is a monopoly determined to remain a monopoly.
13_18	0.089949489	Blumenthal recalled that, early on, he had likened the suit to D-Day in its complexity and far-reaching implications.
13_19	0.067703737	``Today, we have established a solid beachhead,'' he said.
13_20	0.14258136	Like Klein, Blumenthal said he would not rule out any remedy to break up Microsoft's hold on the software industry.
13_21	0.16570425	But Klein deflected a question to compare the case against Microsoft to another landmark antitrust case, the one that reconfigured the nationwide telephone system.
13_22	0.072330038	Blumenthal of Connecticut called antitrust law ``the Magna Carta of consumer protection''.
13_23	0.09159324	``I would wager that these findings of fact will be used in law school classes around the country to demonstrate what happens when the antitrust laws are flagrantly violated,'' Blumenthal went on.
13_24	0.11733484	Klein saw another reason to hold up the Microsoft case as an example.
13_25	0.1138593	Only about a year and a half elapsed from the start of the case to Friday's decision _ lightning speed for such a complex case, by the usual standards of the law.

14_1	0.14053991	is expected to introduce documents this week intended to contradict testimony by an IBM executive who said Microsoft would offer the computer maker a favorable price on its Windows operating system only if IBM agreed to ``eliminate or drop'' its competing operating system, OS/2.
14_2	0.14633908	The allegation was made last month by Garry Norris, a manager who negotiated with Microsoft for IBM's personal computer business, is scheduled to take the stand Monday as witness for the government.
14_3	0.10052098	In a pretrial deposition in May, Norris testified that Microsoft managers repeatedly made a proposal linking the price of Windows paid by IBM's personal computer division and its agreement to drop OS/2 from its machines.
14_4	0.091252688	He specifically mentioned the proposal being made by Mark Baber, who oversaw Microsoft's relationship with IBM's P.C. business.
14_5	0.12701444	But Baber, who has since retired from Microsoft, said Sunday that it was ``absolutely not the case'' that Microsoft proposed a lower Windows price in return for an agreement by IBM to drop OS/2 from its PC's.
14_6	0.11762481	In addition, Baber said he worked on the Microsoft effort in 1994 and 1995 to try to repair the strained relationship between the two companies.
14_7	0.087824378	That effort, he said, included drafting a document in 1994 called the ``IBM-Microsoft Alliance Proposal''.
14_8	0.096478847	That document, he said, called for IBM to promote Microsoft's software on IBM personal computers, but specifically included language that noted any Microsoft-IBM agreement did not exclude IBM from also offering and promoting ``products offered by other divisions of IBM''.
14_9	0.085201626	Microsoft declined to comment on documents it may introduce in court during the cross-examination of Norris.
14_10	0.10762371	But Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said, ``We believe that we will be able to show convincingly in court that the Microsoft-IBM discussions leading up to the introduction of Windows 95 were normal, though complicated, business negotiations, and that Microsoft did not try to get IBM to drop or eliminate OS/2.
14_11	0.062802801	Yes, we have documents that we believe show that''.
14_12	0.0916631	The effort to forge a closer relationship with IBM, which would have included a more favorable price for Windows, foundered mainly because IBM balked at close cooperation with Microsoft, according to Baber.
14_13	0.25164686	The testimony and cross-examination of Norris will focus on a crucial allegation in the antitrust suit against Microsoft by the Justice Department and 19 states _ that Microsoft uses the price it charges PC makers for its industry-standard Windows operating system to insure that they promote Microsoft software over competing software.
14_14	0.06231175	Microsoft fiercely denies the allegation.
14_15	0.10999965	IBM was the last major PC maker to sign a Windows 95 license agreement with Microsoft and, Norris said in his deposition that IBM did pay significantly more for Windows 95 than did a major IBM rival in the PC business, the Compaq Computer Corp.
14_16	0.087530394	He also testified that its Windows price rose very sharply, with IBM paying $9 a copy for the earlier version, Windows 3.1, and more than $45 for Windows 95.
14_17	0.09015614	Baber said IBM's price for Windows 3.1 was unusually low because, dating back to their days of close cooperation in software, IBM had shared in the development costs.
14_18	0.074089522	Compaq's price for Windows 3.1, he noted, was about $20 a copy.
14_19	0.08759349	The Windows 95 price paid by Compaq, Baber said, was several dollars lower than IBM's price.
14_20	0.094974362	But that, he insisted, was mainly because Compaq had made a broad agreement with Microsoft, which included providing customer support for Windows and writing software to make printers and other hardware work well with Windows.
15_0	0.26484482	WASHINGTON _ After reviewing a last-ditch settlement proposal offered by Microsoft Friday night, lawyers for the government concluded that it was inadequate to settle the landmark antitrust case against the software giant, officials said Saturday afternoon.
15_1	0.23088165	Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has told both sides that, barring a settlement, he will issue a verdict in the case as soon as Tuesday, and no one doubts that he will find Microsoft in broad violation of antitrust law.
15_2	0.10985272	Jackson met with lawyers for both sides Tuesday and gave them a week to settle the case before he issued a verdict.
15_3	0.054889822	The two sides had been talking for almost four months.
15_4	0.29966004	As a result, on Friday evening Microsoft faxed a several-page settlement offer to the Justice Department and the 19 state attorneys general who are suing Microsoft.
15_5	0.069684186	It included so much technical detail that it took lawyers hours to decipher it.
15_6	0.089617018	But in the end, one official said, ``it wasn't nearly enough''.
15_7	0.1238046	If government officials had concluded that the proposal was, in their view, serious and comprehensive, they would have met over the weekend in Chicago with Microsoft lawyers and the mediator in the case, Richard A.
15_8	0.15420722	Posner, chief judge of the U.S.
15_9	0.10764339	Court of Appeals there.
15_10	0.071098757	But two officials said no new talks had been scheduled.
15_11	0.13591661	It remains possible that Microsoft will offer a new or modified proposal in the next two days.
15_12	0.078638152	But short of that, the ongoing settlement talks, which started Nov.
15_13	0.029944904	30, are likely to collapse.
15_14	0.16813591	None of the state or federal officials involved with the suit would discuss the settlement proposal, and Microsoft declined to comment.
15_15	0.12833882	If, as expected, Jackson rules in favor of the government this week, he will also set out the procedures and schedule for remedy hearings.
15_16	0.090378914	In those hearings, the federal and state governments will propose the remedies, or penalties, they want to impose.
15_17	0.12592981	Between now and then, they face one of the most difficult tasks in the case: forging agreement between the federal government and 19 state attorneys general on an appropriate remedy.
16_0	0.31898799	A Harvard legal scholar told the judge in the Microsoft antitrust case Tuesday that the company's decision to bundle its Web browser into the Windows operating system had ``obvious benefits'' to computer programmers and consumers.
16_1	0.11006622	But he then proceeded to provide a legally innovative road map for determining that the bundling strategy violated the law.
16_2	0.21049972	The court filing, written by Laurence Lessig, a legal scholar and software expert, came at the request of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
16_3	0.12722362	It offers a 45-page analysis of one issue: how antitrust law on product ``tying'' should apply to the case.
16_4	0.077636076	The intellectually wide-ranging document, antitrust experts say, will probably provide each side with some legal ammunition.
16_5	0.1996836	The Lessig brief had been eagerly awaited by the government, Microsoft and antitrust experts.
16_6	0.1149553	Unlike other filings, it is not an advocate's brief, amplifying the arguments of one side or the other, though Microsoft protested his participation in the case.
16_7	0.091577934	Lessig, a professor at Harvard law school and a fellow of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, did not come to a single conclusion in his friend-of-the-court brief.
16_8	0.13988972	Instead, he stated that if a 1998 appeals court ruling in a related case applies in this suit as well, then Microsoft did not engage in illegal tying.
16_9	0.13620647	But Lessig said that if the 1998 case did not apply _ and he raises doubts that it does _ Microsoft might well have violated the law.
16_10	0.084903653	A company is guilty of illegal tying if it makes consumers accept a second product as a condition of buying a market-leading product.
16_11	0.37014819	The Justice Department and 19 states assert that Microsoft did precisely that by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system.
16_12	0.10383201	Microsoft asserts that the browser is not a separate product but an ``integrated feature'' of Windows.
16_13	0.1259662	In 1998, a federal appeals court ruled that Microsoft was free to bundle its browser with Windows as long as it could make a ``plausible claim'' that bundling had some benefit to consumers.
16_14	0.10046774	But Lessig noted that the court was ruling on a ``consent decree,'' essentially a contractual agreement between the federal prosecutor and a potential defendant, so there was ``no reason to read an opinion interpreting a consent decree as interpreting the contours of antitrust law''.
16_15	0.089822536	At one point, he observed that how tying law applies to software was ``unsettled'' and added that the 1998 ruling was ``just one, if prominent, manifestation of this uncertainty''.
16_16	0.091818071	Later, Lessig suggested that tying doctrine had a hard time dealing with software, since the relevant case law tended to deal with physical products like cars and tires.
16_17	0.097910641	If given a chance at a software tying case, Lessig added, ``it is my view that there is a significant probability that the Supreme Court will modify current doctrine''.
16_18	0.12867035	``Both sides'' in the Microsoft case, he wrote, ``are too quick, however, to minimize the difficulty of how tying law properly applies to software products''.
16_19	0.094886493	Lessig then suggests a different antitrust test for software _ that government or courts should not worry about bundling unless a dominant company engages in what he calls ``strategic bundling''.
16_20	0.085601178	``The aim of any antitrust inquiry,'' he wrote, ``should be whether the particular bundle is a strategic bundle, aiming at anticompetitive ends, not whether the bundle achieves its interlinkage through contract or software''.
16_21	0.14533004	Some antitrust experts say the Lessig brief may give Jackson the legal blueprint he needs for concluding that Microsoft did violate tying law.
16_22	0.092191255	``Lessig's brief supplies the judge with a sensible rationale for finding there were two products and a tying violation,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school.
16_23	0.10368315	``But that is not to say that Judge Jackson will do that or, if his ruling is appealed, that the appeals court will buy it.''

18_0	0.34457297	WASHINGTON _ The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case agreed Thursday morning to delay his final ruling for about a week, giving the Justice Department time to reply to Microsoft's proposal, filed Wednesday, to revise the government's break up plan.
18_1	0.32527816	U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had planned to issue his final ruling, widely expected to call for a breakup of the company, Thursday or Friday.
18_2	0.32529254	But the Justice Department asked him Thursday for an opportunity to reply to Microsoft's comments on the government's remedy proposal.
18_3	0.14378966	Jackson gave the government until Monday to respond, and Microsoft until Wednesday to file a counter response.
18_4	0.15723259	In court on May 24, John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, said the company wanted an opportunity to ``comment on the form of the proposed decree prior to its entry''.
18_5	0.11183167	Lawyers interpreted that to mean that Microsoft did not intend to make substantive changes.
18_6	0.19386913	But in fact, the company's response heavily revised the government proposal _ gutting it, in the view of some government officials.

19_0	0.21087047	WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) --A U.S. federal judge ordered Wednesday Microsoft Corp.
19_1	0.14115739	to be split in two separate companies to correct antitrust violations.
19_2	0.28871087	District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has gone along with the government recommendation that the software giant be split in two, one that would sell operating systems, and another that would develop and market Microsoft's popular Office software and Internet properties.
19_3	0.077958348	If the judgment is upheld, it would be the harshest antitrust penalty leveled against a U.S. corporation since AT&AMP;T agreed to spin off the "baby bell" regional phone companies in 1982.
19_4	0.091979892	"Microsoft, as it is presently organized and led, is unwilling to accept the notion that it broke the law or accede to an order amending its conduct," Jackson said in his 23-page remedy order.
19_5	0.22108955	"Microsoft has proved untrustworthy in the past," Jackson said, citing its failure to comply with a court ruling earlier in the 1990s that preceded the antitrust case.

21_2	0.21934238	The Software and Information Industry Association, formerly known as the Software Publishers Association, filed a friend-of-the-court brief in February on behalf of the Justice Department, arguing that Microsoft had a monopoly in personal computer operating systems and used it to expand its market power.
21_3	0.15254829	In a letter to the trade group Tuesday, Robert Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating officer, said he was resigning because the company believed that the software trade association had become totally focused on the antitrust issue and that its efforts on other policy issues have ``regrettably withered away''.
21_4	0.10963804	Herbold noted that the ``SPA and SIIA management have worked directly against Microsoft on competition issues''.
21_5	0.086864051	But, he said, ``As long as the organization was also accomplishing at least some other useful goals for the industry as a whole, we thought it made sense for Microsoft to remain a member, despite this area of disagreement''.

22_16	0.15052635	At the same time, the judge ruled that Microsoft's marketing arrangements with other companies to promote its Web browser at Netscape's expense did not have sufficient effect to violate the law.
