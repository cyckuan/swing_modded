1_12	0.088226175	``If they succeed on the merits...

1_15	0.095068884	It included the pay among $2.2 million spent in the current trial on such experts.
1_16	0.088708905	The department also revealed it has spent $194,140 for public relations, including $147,381 for publishing court documents and other information about the case on its Internet site.

2_0	0.28598004	Legal experts gave the judge in the Microsoft case high marks Thursday for his handling of the case, saying he took some risks but grounded his ruling in fundamental principles governing fair competition.
2_1	0.32402697	They said the actions of the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, had made it more difficult for Microsoft to suggest that the computer industry ought to be given more leeway than traditional businesses under antitrust law.
2_2	0.095198834	``It reminds people that there are antitrust laws out there,'' said George A.
2_3	0.11640673	Hay, a professor of antitrust law at Cornell Law School.
2_4	0.090411756	``It is a useful reminder that there are rules and just because you are big you can't do whatever you want''.
2_5	0.16861636	The risks for Jackson in the ruling, the legal experts said, included his decision to deny Microsoft new hearings on whether to break up the company or impose some lesser remedy after he had decided it abused its monopoly power.
2_6	0.091444967	Some experts said appeals courts might overturn that decision and could order new hearings.
2_7	0.13104187	But several antitrust experts said the judge made efforts throughout the case to tie his decisions to traditional views of antitrust law, which is based on the principle that aggressive competition is encouraged, but not when it crosses the line into efforts to hamper competitors' abilities to make new products or market existing ones.
2_8	0.12444708	The judge said in an earlier ruling that Microsoft had maintained its dominance by keeping ``an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune''.
2_9	0.2172235	Some of the experts said the judge's emphasis on traditional antitrust principles, like rules against intimidation by monopolies, could blunt Microsoft's public efforts to suggest that the Justice Department was overstepping the appropriate bounds of antitrust enforcement.
2_10	0.10596773	The company has suggested that the suit was an anti-capitalist attack that would be harmful not just to Microsoft.
2_11	0.093197492	The company's chairman, Bill Gates, said it was an ``unwarranted intrusion'' into ``a marketplace that has been an engine of economic growth for America''.
2_12	0.12467265	Microsoft used the rapid change of the new software industry as an argument to suggest that Jackson should view the case differently than he might have viewed a case against a smokestack company, said Charles J.
2_13	0.097544049	Goetz, an expert on antitrust law at the University of Virginia School of Law.
2_14	0.088360476	Goetz praised Jackson for refusing to be drawn into that approach and focusing on Microsoft's competitive style.
2_15	0.1789903	``There has been an attempt by Microsoft, to a large extent successful with the public,'' Goetz said, ``to distinguish this case from traditional antitrust cases because it is in the high-tech field''.
2_16	0.09519231	``But mere fast change is not the issue,'' Goetz continued.
2_17	0.12233967	``What this case was about was that other companies appeared to be coming up with a `better mousetrap,' and Microsoft was charged with engaging in very costly attempts to try to prevent competition from those products''.
2_18	0.1267188	Einer Elhauge, a professor of antitrust law at Harvard Law School, said Jackson's decision on Wednesday had to be viewed in the context of his earlier findings, like holding that Microsoft intimidated competitors and made efforts at collusion.
2_19	0.090399731	``It is very hard to second-guess him,'' Elhauge said, ``and it is going to be very hard for an appeals court to second-guess him'' on his factual findings.
2_20	0.079706988	If those findings are accepted, Elhauge said, the conclusion to order a breakup appears ``entirely sensible'' under legal precedents.
2_21	0.091794506	Lesser remedies like orders to monopoly companies to cease abusive tactics have proved difficult to police, he said.
2_22	0.15922257	Several experts said one of Jackson's legally risky decisions was his treatment of Microsoft's Windows operating system and its Web browser as two separate products that it had illegally tied together.
2_23	0.087677203	Under antitrust rules, a company that has a dominant product, like a salt packing machine in an early case, cannot take advantage of its dominance by requiring customers to buy another product, like raw salt, to get the popular product.
2_24	0.095415467	But if, as Microsoft urged, its Web browser should more correctly have been viewed as an innovation that enhanced Windows, portions of Jackson's ruling might be vulnerable on appeal.
2_25	0.30015051	It was on that issue that the federal appeals court in Washington overruled Jackson in an earlier phase of the company's battle with the government.
2_26	0.087865717	Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School, said the decision that Windows and the browser were two products illegally tied together could be vulnerable in an appeal.
2_27	0.097118034	But even on that subject, Moglen said, Jackson made extensive efforts to portray his approach as consistent with the law.
2_28	0.079278374	``He was as orthodox on antitrust issues as he could possibly be,'' Moglen said, adding that he thought Jackson had worked to try to protect the decisions from being overturned.
2_29	0.15862567	Several of the legal experts said Thursday that they saw little support for Microsoft's suggestion that the judge was relying on antitrust concepts that are out of step with the fast-moving computer business.
2_30	0.1052407	They said that the computer age might require adjustments to some antitrust concepts, like the question of whether an operating system and a Web browser are really separate products.
2_31	0.092672513	But, some of them said, evidence of intimidation or efforts at collusion are the heart of the legal system's effort to keep commercial markets competitive.
2_32	0.095495423	Elhauge of Harvard said the company's sense that it was the victim of an injustice was a familiar defense.
2_33	0.11440178	``Every industry, as it is growing,'' he said, ``seems surprised that the antitrust law applies to it.''

3_14	0.092485689	Hill asked Benson to go forward with the trial in June, or postpone it only until August.

4_0	0.17094849	WASHINGTON _ Justice Department lawyers savored a resounding victory Friday evening in their case against Microsoft, a victory that one official attributed not to any brilliant strategy but to the simple truth.
4_1	0.18421174	``This is a great day for American consumers,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said, declaring herself pleased that the court had agreed with the government.
4_2	0.09692567	``This case is about the protection of innovation, competition and the consumers' right to choose the products they want,'' Reno said.
4_3	0.17601592	``Facts are stubborn things,'' said Joel Klein, head of the antitrust division, exulting in a 207-page decision that found for the government on virtually every important point.
4_4	0.091903896	Asked if he thought Microsoft had made any strategic errors during the trial, Klein responded that ``theatrics are always interesting, and there were some fun moments in this trial.
4_5	0.093832133	I think this case was about the evidence''.
4_6	0.31782335	Klein's comments notwithstanding, the Justice Department's lead lawyer in the Microsoft case, David Boies, is one of the most highly regarded litigators in the country.
4_7	0.0960249	At first, Boies shied away from the microphone.
4_8	0.0897508	``I had my shot in the courtroom,'' Boies said, smiling broadly.
4_9	0.15102416	But Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general for Connecticut who worked closely with the Justice Department, encouraged Boies to say something.
4_10	0.086953221	``You're the man,'' Blumenthal said.
4_11	0.064735396	``Go ahead''.
4_12	0.096380538	Then Boies indicated that he, too, thought the outcome had less to do with strategy and more to do with facts.
4_13	0.090189889	``In some senses, this is not a surprise,'' he said.
4_14	0.089582107	``In a lot of ways, this is exactly what the evidence showed''.
4_15	0.090782857	Pronouncing himself ``enormously pleased'' with the decision, Klein said it showed that ``in America, no person and no company is above the law''.
4_16	0.2037313	Blumenthal had some of the harshest words for Microsoft, asserting that the opinion by federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had portrayed ``a predator that has misused its monopolistic power''.
4_17	0.14636765	Some of the most damning evidence against Microsoft was furnished by Microsoft itself, Blumenthal said, in its internal e-mail and other records that proved the company is a monopoly determined to remain a monopoly.
4_18	0.077476352	Blumenthal recalled that, early on, he had likened the suit to D-Day in its complexity and far-reaching implications.
4_19	0.093204193	``Today, we have established a solid beachhead,'' he said.
4_20	0.11148171	Like Klein, Blumenthal said he would not rule out any remedy to break up Microsoft's hold on the software industry.
4_21	0.15541663	But Klein deflected a question to compare the case against Microsoft to another landmark antitrust case, the one that reconfigured the nationwide telephone system.
4_22	0.092841163	Blumenthal of Connecticut called antitrust law ``the Magna Carta of consumer protection''.
4_23	0.097846195	``I would wager that these findings of fact will be used in law school classes around the country to demonstrate what happens when the antitrust laws are flagrantly violated,'' Blumenthal went on.
4_24	0.10477977	Klein saw another reason to hold up the Microsoft case as an example.
4_25	0.10783288	Only about a year and a half elapsed from the start of the case to Friday's decision _ lightning speed for such a complex case, by the usual standards of the law.
4_26	0.08127608	California's attorney general, Bill Lockyer, said he expected the decision to ``unleash powerful engines of innovation and consumer benefit''.
4_27	0.092377533	``California is so impacted by the colossus of Microsoft, and so many businesses were impacted and felt that their competitive opportunities were smothered,'' Lockyer said.
4_28	0.083914969	``Silicon Valley is cautiously cheering,'' Lockyer said.

5_0	0.30695115	WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) --A U.S. federal judge ordered Wednesday Microsoft Corp.
5_1	0.099766392	to be split in two separate companies to correct antitrust violations.
5_2	0.37296006	District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has gone along with the government recommendation that the software giant be split in two, one that would sell operating systems, and another that would develop and market Microsoft's popular Office software and Internet properties.
5_3	0.060230585	If the judgment is upheld, it would be the harshest antitrust penalty leveled against a U.S. corporation since AT&AMP;T agreed to spin off the "baby bell" regional phone companies in 1982.
5_4	0.088736885	"Microsoft, as it is presently organized and led, is unwilling to accept the notion that it broke the law or accede to an order amending its conduct," Jackson said in his 23-page remedy order.
5_5	0.26535809	"Microsoft has proved untrustworthy in the past," Jackson said, citing its failure to comply with a court ruling earlier in the 1990s that preceded the antitrust case.
5_6	0.15983879	Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said immediately after the ruling that, as expected, the company would appeal.
5_7	0.091630071	"We have a very strong appeal," Gates said.
5_8	0.08002552	Since its 1975 founding, Microsoft has grown to become the world's most valuable software company with annual revenues of over 20 billion U.S. dollars a year.
5_9	0.065264983	With 60 foreign offices and its software used around the world, a breakup would eventually affect computer users worldwide.
5_10	0.089039299	The U.S.
5_11	0.32532441	Justice Department and 17 of the states that sued Microsoft proposed the split after Jackson concluded on April 3 that the firm violated U.S. antitrust law.
5_12	0.15890056	The government says that splitting Microsoft would prevent the Windows system, that runs on over 80 percent of personal computers, from being used to force companies and consumers to use other Microsoft products.
5_13	0.20262227	Breakup of the company could also encourage development of alternative operating systems and prompt versions of programs like Microsoft Office to run on those systems, the government says.
5_14	0.10108863	Microsoft, which expects to win on appeal, says a breakup would harm consumers by preventing it from developing integrated products.
5_15	0.16471116	The company's appeal could bypass the normal appeals court process and go straight to the Supreme Court under a mechanism available in major antitrust cases.
5_16	0.095643615	But several legal experts said they believed the high court would decline to receive the case on an expedited basis.
6_0	0.19116574	Microsoft Corp.'s massive defeat in its federal antitrust suit leaves the company facing perhaps the most severe crisis in its 25-year history.
6_1	0.30405626	Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's holding that Microsoft is a monopoly that abused its power and harmed consumers raises the possibility that the US Justice Department might demand the corporate equivalent of the death penalty _ the dismantling of Microsoft _ after the manner of Standard Oil Co.'s 1911 breakup.
6_2	0.17421417	Joel Klein, antitrust chief at the Justice Department, Friday would not rule out this Draconian penalty.
6_3	0.074795292	But even if Microsoft avoids action of this magnitude, years of tough legal battles lie ahead, with a potential to sap the firm's ability to keep up with its competitors.
6_4	0.093702652	And those competitors can use Friday's ruling to make life even tougher for Microsoft.
6_5	0.13062434	Antitrust experts say the findings of fact can be used by dozens of Microsoft's competitors as the basis of their own private antitrust actions against the company.
6_6	0.14027008	``It's really a disaster for Microsoft,'' said Thane Scott, head of the antitrust practice at Boston law firm Palmer &AMP; Dodge.
6_7	0.079593021	``Based on these documents alone, anybody who feels he's been harmed by Microsoft can walk into a court and get a jury trial.
6_8	0.093595618	.. . If you're a company like Microsoft, the last place you want to be is in front of a jury''.
6_9	0.090510456	Lisa Wood, of Boston law firm Nutter McClennen &AMP; Fish, said the danger of private suits based on Friday's ruling is so severe that it practically ensures Microsoft will fight to the bitter end, rather than settle.
6_10	0.061217203	``To stop now and not finish could leave Microsoft exposed to private litigation,'' said Wood, who chairs a committee on antitrust law for the American Bar Association.
6_11	0.1197957	Wood predicted that Microsoft will soldier on, taking up the next phase of the case in an effort to recoup its loss.
6_12	0.11670052	In the next phase, the findings of law, Jackson will apply antitrust law to the facts he has settled upon.
6_13	0.095947488	Microsoft will have to argue that even if the facts are accepted as true, they don't constitute a violation of law.
6_14	0.16579465	Scott says the government's nearly total victory on findings of fact bodes ill for Microsoft in the next phase of the trial, and even reduces the likelihood of a successful appeal.
6_15	0.11501691	Microsoft has had some success before federal appellate courts.
6_16	0.2163875	An attempt last year to have the company held in contempt of court for violating an earlier consent decree was rejected by an appeals court, which ruled that Microsoft had a right to add Internet browsing capabilities to its operating system _ one of the key issues in dispute in the antitrust case.
6_17	0.13346212	But Scott says the sweeping rejection of Microsoft's view of the case will bear weight with the appeals court.
6_18	0.090526933	``They have an uphill battle on appeal,'' he said.
6_19	0.092347829	``The facts have been decided against them rather severely''.
6_20	0.11176889	Still, it seems unlikely Microsoft can now simply settle the case, not only because of the threat of private lawsuits but because the government is now in a position to make very tough demands.
6_21	0.25268445	Besides, 19 state attorneys general are involved in the suit, as well as the federal government.
6_22	0.090487304	Microsoft would have to satisfy them all.
6_23	0.082782458	``It's difficult to settle a case when there's blood in the water,'' said Scott, ``and this result does that''.

7_1	0.10146628	But he then proceeded to provide a legally innovative road map for determining that the bundling strategy violated the law.
7_2	0.2259954	The court filing, written by Laurence Lessig, a legal scholar and software expert, came at the request of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
7_3	0.10869734	It offers a 45-page analysis of one issue: how antitrust law on product ``tying'' should apply to the case.
7_4	0.094116758	The intellectually wide-ranging document, antitrust experts say, will probably provide each side with some legal ammunition.
7_5	0.12298445	The Lessig brief had been eagerly awaited by the government, Microsoft and antitrust experts.
7_6	0.10336184	Unlike other filings, it is not an advocate's brief, amplifying the arguments of one side or the other, though Microsoft protested his participation in the case.
7_7	0.090512253	Lessig, a professor at Harvard law school and a fellow of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, did not come to a single conclusion in his friend-of-the-court brief.
7_8	0.16885972	Instead, he stated that if a 1998 appeals court ruling in a related case applies in this suit as well, then Microsoft did not engage in illegal tying.
7_9	0.13392995	But Lessig said that if the 1998 case did not apply _ and he raises doubts that it does _ Microsoft might well have violated the law.
7_10	0.091530827	A company is guilty of illegal tying if it makes consumers accept a second product as a condition of buying a market-leading product.
7_11	0.4254224	The Justice Department and 19 states assert that Microsoft did precisely that by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system.
7_12	0.10591604	Microsoft asserts that the browser is not a separate product but an ``integrated feature'' of Windows.
7_13	0.14432479	In 1998, a federal appeals court ruled that Microsoft was free to bundle its browser with Windows as long as it could make a ``plausible claim'' that bundling had some benefit to consumers.
7_14	0.10807953	But Lessig noted that the court was ruling on a ``consent decree,'' essentially a contractual agreement between the federal prosecutor and a potential defendant, so there was ``no reason to read an opinion interpreting a consent decree as interpreting the contours of antitrust law''.
7_15	0.091430621	At one point, he observed that how tying law applies to software was ``unsettled'' and added that the 1998 ruling was ``just one, if prominent, manifestation of this uncertainty''.
7_16	0.059948615	Later, Lessig suggested that tying doctrine had a hard time dealing with software, since the relevant case law tended to deal with physical products like cars and tires.
7_17	0.099742794	If given a chance at a software tying case, Lessig added, ``it is my view that there is a significant probability that the Supreme Court will modify current doctrine''.
7_18	0.12532599	``Both sides'' in the Microsoft case, he wrote, ``are too quick, however, to minimize the difficulty of how tying law properly applies to software products''.
7_19	0.088979246	Lessig then suggests a different antitrust test for software _ that government or courts should not worry about bundling unless a dominant company engages in what he calls ``strategic bundling''.
7_20	0.073282827	``The aim of any antitrust inquiry,'' he wrote, ``should be whether the particular bundle is a strategic bundle, aiming at anticompetitive ends, not whether the bundle achieves its interlinkage through contract or software''.
7_21	0.14411967	Some antitrust experts say the Lessig brief may give Jackson the legal blueprint he needs for concluding that Microsoft did violate tying law.
7_22	0.087122876	``Lessig's brief supplies the judge with a sensible rationale for finding there were two products and a tying violation,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school.
7_23	0.10050767	``But that is not to say that Judge Jackson will do that or, if his ruling is appealed, that the appeals court will buy it.''

8_2	0.29804811	The Software and Information Industry Association, formerly known as the Software Publishers Association, filed a friend-of-the-court brief in February on behalf of the Justice Department, arguing that Microsoft had a monopoly in personal computer operating systems and used it to expand its market power.
8_3	0.21090864	In a letter to the trade group Tuesday, Robert Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating officer, said he was resigning because the company believed that the software trade association had become totally focused on the antitrust issue and that its efforts on other policy issues have ``regrettably withered away''.
8_4	0.1035691	Herbold noted that the ``SPA and SIIA management have worked directly against Microsoft on competition issues''.
8_5	0.079761801	But, he said, ``As long as the organization was also accomplishing at least some other useful goals for the industry as a whole, we thought it made sense for Microsoft to remain a member, despite this area of disagreement''.
8_6	0.10218559	Herbold, a member of the association's board, added that Microsoft had come to believe that was no longer true.
8_7	0.083617642	In a fiery reply, Ken Wasch, the group's president, said that by quitting, ``Microsoft has again proven that their tactics resemble that of a schoolyard bully''.
8_8	0.17917477	Since the trade group's board voted two years ago to support the government in the antitrust case, Wasch said its relationship with Microsoft had been ``a difficult one, much like the U.S. relationship with China''.

9_0	0.30448588	WASHINGTON _ Microsoft filed an unexpected brief with a federal judge on Monday that quoted from a 5-year-old government legal document in which the Justice Department argued that breaking up Microsoft would be ``against the public interest'' and ``dangerous to the economy's welfare''.
9_1	0.27963472	The document was part of the public record from an older antitrust case against Microsoft, the Justice Department's first suit against the company.
9_2	0.27445794	The nine-page brief gives Microsoft the final word before a hearing on Wednesday but risks irritating the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, who did not ask for another filing from Microsoft when he laid out the schedule for the remedy phase of the case.
9_3	0.31313063	Under the schedule set by Jackson in April, the Justice Department and 17 states filed a brief with the court on April 28 asking the judge to break Microsoft into two companies as the remedy for the illegal behavior found in the long antitrust trial.
9_4	0.095454344	Then, 12 days later, Microsoft responded with its own proposal, a short list of narrow restrictions on its behavior, while denouncing the government's plan.
9_5	0.27097468	Last Wednesday, the Justice Department filed a reply to Microsoft's brief, saying the company's proposal was ``a cosmetic remedy'' of no real worth.
9_6	0.088349639	That was to have been the last filing.
9_7	0.22714267	But a Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, said the company ``believes it is appropriate for the company to have a reply to focus on a few issues raised in the government's last brief''.
9_8	0.116115	While citing the old Justice Department documents, Microsoft also repeated several legal arguments it had made previously.
9_9	0.16700468	Among them, the company stated that the courts have never broken up a company for antitrust violations; all of the previous breakups have been a result of settlements of antitrust suits.
9_10	0.1514242	``For all its sophistry in discussing the case law, the government fails to identify a single precedent for its radical breakup proposal,'' Microsoft wrote.
9_11	0.28616296	The Justice Department did not respond to Microsoft's filing, but a lawyer who is close to the government's current case said it ``relies on statements made before Microsoft had engaged in the numerous illegal acts found in the current case''.
9_12	0.37880597	The legal document quoted in the Microsoft brief was taken from the court record of the Justice Department's first antitrust suit against Microsoft, which was resolved in 1995.
9_13	0.11191673	That case was settled when Microsoft accepted several behavioral restrictions.
9_14	0.093748907	Under a law known as the Tunney Act, any settlement of an antitrust suit must be put up for public comment before the judge can decide whether to approve it.
9_15	0.11822103	And much of the industry comment then was disparaging; executives called the proposed settlement inadequate and argued that Microsoft ought to be broken up instead.
9_16	0.19936767	Responding to those public comments, the Justice Department filed the brief Microsoft quoted Monday.
9_17	0.11861422	In it the government's economist then, Kenneth J.
9_18	0.11928527	Arrow of Stanford University, wrote that breakup remedies ``designed to return the market to equilibrium'' are ``likely to be of the form of penalizing whatever firm happens to be leading, Microsoft in this case''.
9_19	0.17412491	On Monday, the lawyer who is close to the government's case said, ``That Microsoft repeatedly violated the law after the previous proceeding demonstrates why structural relief is necessary now.''

10_1	0.18676929	violated the nation's antitrust laws through predatory and anticompetitive behavior and kept ``an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune,'' a federal judge ruled Monday.
10_2	0.41178519	The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S.
10_3	0.24314062	District Court, sided with the government on the most important points in its exhaustive antitrust suit, though he surprised lawyers on both sides by ruling for Microsoft in one area.
10_4	0.40168808	The Justice Department and the 19 states pressing the suit contended that Microsoft had hurt consumers by stifling competition in the software marketplace, particularly at the expense of the Netscape browser.
10_5	0.13750948	Jackson's findings of fact in the case, issued in November, overwhelmingly supported that view.
10_6	0.11171761	Several experts said that Monday's ruling, applying the antitrust laws to those findings, laid the foundation for a powerful remedy.
10_7	0.091032885	That will be decided in a separate proceeding to begin within a few weeks.
10_8	0.1337529	Options range from imposing restrictions on Microsoft's conduct to breaking up the company.
10_9	0.14379821	Senior government officials familiar with the views of the state and federal officers who are pursuing the case said that many were interested in requesting a breakup, though no decision had been made.
10_10	0.077392392	The ruling came just 48 hours after settlement talks collapsed.
10_11	0.052849159	On Saturday a court-appointed mediator announced that despite four months of mediation and after consideration of almost 20 drafts of a settlement offer, the gulf between the two sides remained unbridgeable.
10_12	0.088973511	Jackson issued his judgment at 5 p.m., after the stock markets had closed.
10_13	0.12763216	But reacting to the failure of the settlement talks and in anticipation of the judgment, Microsoft's stock plunged Monday, losing almost 14 percent of its value.
10_14	0.072259827	That helped fuel a broad decline in the Nasdaq composite index, which fell 8 percent.
10_15	0.16371878	In his 43-page conclusions of law, Jackson's final judgment on the evidence, the judge wrote that ``the court concludes that Microsoft maintained its monopoly power by anticompetitive means and attempted to monopolize the Web browser market,'' as well as ``unlawfully tying its Web browser to its operating system'' _ all in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
10_16	0.16008509	At the same time, the judge ruled that Microsoft's marketing arrangements with other companies to promote its Web browser at Netscape's expense did not have sufficient effect to violate the law.
10_17	0.0889334	Microsoft seemed to take little solace from prevailing on that point.
10_18	0.22833739	Bill Gates, the company's chairman, did not even refer to the one judgment in the company's favor when he announced that Microsoft would appeal.
10_19	0.073182196	``This ruling turns on its head the reality that consumers know _ that our software has helped make PCs more accessible and more affordable to millions,'' Gates said.
10_20	0.091077643	``We believe we have a strong case on appeal.''
11_0	0.40543329	WASHINGTON _ The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case agreed Thursday morning to delay his final ruling for about a week, giving the Justice Department time to reply to Microsoft's proposal, filed Wednesday, to revise the government's break up plan.
11_1	0.38751273	U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had planned to issue his final ruling, widely expected to call for a breakup of the company, Thursday or Friday.
11_2	0.19965575	But the Justice Department asked him Thursday for an opportunity to reply to Microsoft's comments on the government's remedy proposal.
11_3	0.12364592	Jackson gave the government until Monday to respond, and Microsoft until Wednesday to file a counter response.
11_4	0.17566709	In court on May 24, John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, said the company wanted an opportunity to ``comment on the form of the proposed decree prior to its entry''.
11_5	0.10223592	Lawyers interpreted that to mean that Microsoft did not intend to make substantive changes.
11_6	0.19042842	But in fact, the company's response heavily revised the government proposal _ gutting it, in the view of some government officials.
11_7	0.48783744	The Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general proposed to break Microsoft into two companies.
11_8	0.087105099	One would hold the Windows operating systems, the other everything else, including the Office suite of programs like Word for word processing and Excel for spreadsheet calculations.
11_9	0.083467302	The proposal would also put in place almost immediately a wide range of remedies intended to modify Microsoft's conduct while the breakup is being carried out.
11_10	0.091304097	Microsoft's comments would delay all of the remedies and heavily modify most of them.
12_0	0.18509366	In its antitrust trial, the Microsoft Corp.
12_1	0.20714685	is expected to introduce documents this week intended to contradict testimony by an IBM executive who said Microsoft would offer the computer maker a favorable price on its Windows operating system only if IBM agreed to ``eliminate or drop'' its competing operating system, OS/2.
12_2	0.19771883	The allegation was made last month by Garry Norris, a manager who negotiated with Microsoft for IBM's personal computer business, is scheduled to take the stand Monday as witness for the government.
12_3	0.13720865	In a pretrial deposition in May, Norris testified that Microsoft managers repeatedly made a proposal linking the price of Windows paid by IBM's personal computer division and its agreement to drop OS/2 from its machines.
12_4	0.081739388	He specifically mentioned the proposal being made by Mark Baber, who oversaw Microsoft's relationship with IBM's P.C. business.
12_5	0.19215051	But Baber, who has since retired from Microsoft, said Sunday that it was ``absolutely not the case'' that Microsoft proposed a lower Windows price in return for an agreement by IBM to drop OS/2 from its PC's.
12_6	0.16232944	In addition, Baber said he worked on the Microsoft effort in 1994 and 1995 to try to repair the strained relationship between the two companies.
12_7	0.081711958	That effort, he said, included drafting a document in 1994 called the ``IBM-Microsoft Alliance Proposal''.
12_8	0.11126514	That document, he said, called for IBM to promote Microsoft's software on IBM personal computers, but specifically included language that noted any Microsoft-IBM agreement did not exclude IBM from also offering and promoting ``products offered by other divisions of IBM''.
12_9	0.099008401	Microsoft declined to comment on documents it may introduce in court during the cross-examination of Norris.
12_10	0.14332106	But Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said, ``We believe that we will be able to show convincingly in court that the Microsoft-IBM discussions leading up to the introduction of Windows 95 were normal, though complicated, business negotiations, and that Microsoft did not try to get IBM to drop or eliminate OS/2.
12_11	0.090271256	Yes, we have documents that we believe show that''.
12_12	0.076445343	The effort to forge a closer relationship with IBM, which would have included a more favorable price for Windows, foundered mainly because IBM balked at close cooperation with Microsoft, according to Baber.
12_13	0.34741508	The testimony and cross-examination of Norris will focus on a crucial allegation in the antitrust suit against Microsoft by the Justice Department and 19 states _ that Microsoft uses the price it charges PC makers for its industry-standard Windows operating system to insure that they promote Microsoft software over competing software.
12_14	0.10898767	Microsoft fiercely denies the allegation.
12_15	0.14856227	IBM was the last major PC maker to sign a Windows 95 license agreement with Microsoft and, Norris said in his deposition that IBM did pay significantly more for Windows 95 than did a major IBM rival in the PC business, the Compaq Computer Corp.
12_16	0.095506615	He also testified that its Windows price rose very sharply, with IBM paying $9 a copy for the earlier version, Windows 3.1, and more than $45 for Windows 95.
12_17	0.10259971	Baber said IBM's price for Windows 3.1 was unusually low because, dating back to their days of close cooperation in software, IBM had shared in the development costs.
12_18	0.095476651	Compaq's price for Windows 3.1, he noted, was about $20 a copy.
12_19	0.044336308	The Windows 95 price paid by Compaq, Baber said, was several dollars lower than IBM's price.
12_20	0.11145299	But that, he insisted, was mainly because Compaq had made a broad agreement with Microsoft, which included providing customer support for Windows and writing software to make printers and other hardware work well with Windows.
13_0	0.31610954	WASHINGTON _ After reviewing a last-ditch settlement proposal offered by Microsoft Friday night, lawyers for the government concluded that it was inadequate to settle the landmark antitrust case against the software giant, officials said Saturday afternoon.
13_1	0.28550157	Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has told both sides that, barring a settlement, he will issue a verdict in the case as soon as Tuesday, and no one doubts that he will find Microsoft in broad violation of antitrust law.
13_2	0.087044258	Jackson met with lawyers for both sides Tuesday and gave them a week to settle the case before he issued a verdict.
13_3	0.090477994	The two sides had been talking for almost four months.
13_4	0.34769463	As a result, on Friday evening Microsoft faxed a several-page settlement offer to the Justice Department and the 19 state attorneys general who are suing Microsoft.
13_5	0.092533076	It included so much technical detail that it took lawyers hours to decipher it.
13_6	0.086665244	But in the end, one official said, ``it wasn't nearly enough''.
13_7	0.1391189	If government officials had concluded that the proposal was, in their view, serious and comprehensive, they would have met over the weekend in Chicago with Microsoft lawyers and the mediator in the case, Richard A.

13_11	0.10302132	It remains possible that Microsoft will offer a new or modified proposal in the next two days.
13_12	0.091808802	But short of that, the ongoing settlement talks, which started Nov.
13_13	0.086522542	30, are likely to collapse.
13_14	0.1351844	None of the state or federal officials involved with the suit would discuss the settlement proposal, and Microsoft declined to comment.
13_15	0.11195639	If, as expected, Jackson rules in favor of the government this week, he will also set out the procedures and schedule for remedy hearings.
13_16	0.095087102	In those hearings, the federal and state governments will propose the remedies, or penalties, they want to impose.
13_17	0.11976624	Between now and then, they face one of the most difficult tasks in the case: forging agreement between the federal government and 19 state attorneys general on an appropriate remedy.

14_1	0.2750314	, whose business practices are being challenged by the government in a major antitrust case, suffered a legal setback on another front Tuesday when a federal judge in California ordered the company to stop shipping Internet software that violates its contract with a rival, Sun Microsystems Inc.
14_2	0.12168192	The impact that the order, a preliminary injunction in a private law suit in California, will have on the government's case is uncertain.
14_3	0.28705443	But the allegations in the government's antitrust suit do include the practices that are at the heart of the breach-of-contract case Sun filed against Microsoft last October _ namely, that Microsoft is trying to ``pollute'' Sun's Internet programming language, called Java, by modifying it.
14_4	0.41622297	The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft in the antitrust case say that this is part of a pattern of illegal practices by the software giant intended to protect and extend its tight grip on the market for personal computer software.
14_5	0.099711957	If Sun's Java became an industry-standard, the government asserts, it could pose a serious challenge to Microsoft.
14_6	0.15121131	And in the California case, Sun had argued that by altering the Java programming language, Microsoft had violated a contract the two companies had signed.
14_7	0.13695289	Judge Ronald Whyte in the U.S.
14_8	0.090389873	District Court in San Jose ordered Microsoft to stop the practice and gave it 90 days to make its Internet software entirely compatible with Sun's Java, as it had agreed to do when it signed a technology licensing agreement with Sun.
14_9	0.16114561	The California ruling is badly timed for Microsoft, but the spillover, if any, to the antitrust case in Washington is difficult to determine.
14_10	0.26090601	``The Justice Department will argue that a breach of contract is part of the pattern of bad acts by Microsoft and of its intent to monopolize,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division.
14_11	0.097793674	``It helps the atmospherics of the government's case, but it's not clear beyond that what the effect will be''.
14_12	0.088435742	The ruling Tuesday is a preliminary injuction, noted Litan, and the Sun-Microsoft trial is not scheduled to begin until next year.
14_13	0.24748001	Meanwhile, the antitrust trial is already well under way, and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is expected to rule early next year.
14_14	0.14910565	``If there was a final ruling in the contract case, it would have far more direct impact on the antitrust case,'' said Litan, who is now at the Brookings Institution.
14_15	0.13029207	The California ruling, industry analysts say, is not likely to have a significant impact on Microsoft's business anytime soon _ though it does raise questions about the company's strategy of trying to influence the industry to accept Microsoft's version of Internet software standards.

17_4	0.24250367	One of them is entitled "Economist experts challenge underlying assumptions in government's case," quoting them as saying that the government antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft is depending on theories that are not supported by the realities of the marketplace or current economic research.
17_5	0.14129877	The other which was carried by Los Angeles Times said that Microsoft is wrongly targeted and consumers would be losers if the government wins.
17_6	0.12442237	On Tuesday, Microsoft is scheduled to release its quarterly financial results, as analysts predicted another solid, high-profit quarter.

20_0	0.3487848	WASHINGTON _ In its closing argument in the Microsoft trial, the government said Tuesday that it is ``simply impossible to imagine'' that the company will not be found to have violated the nation's antitrust laws, based on the mountains of courtroom evidence.
20_1	1.1445771	The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft Corp.
20_2	0.34903556	, antitrust experts say, were playing a stong hand after Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued findings of fact last November that supported the government's version of the case in nearly every respect.
20_3	0.1047371	Yet Jackson has not yet issued his conclusions of law, which are expected sometime in the next few months.
20_4	0.092914578	Tuesday's presentations were the final attempt by both sides to try to influence Jackson's thinking.
20_5	0.20910783	Settlement talks, mediated by Richard Posner, chief judge of the federal appeals court in Chicago, are continuing, but the two sides remain divided.
20_6	0.1035865	Tuesday's courtroom statements _ uncompromising attacks from each side _ only seemed to underline the gap between the government and Microsoft.
20_7	0.24691899	At one point, David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer, said Microsoft's business strategy was based on trying to ``bribe and coerce'' other companies in the computer industry.
20_8	0.10721829	His counterpart, John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, dismissed one of Boies' arguments as ``entirely wrong''.
20_9	0.14116997	The government, according to most antitrust experts, is sitting on a big lead, while Microsoft is trying to limit its losses in Jackson's court and planning to fare better on appeal.
20_10	0.096930933	In its courtroom presentation Tuesday, Microsoft seemed to have elements of a loss-limitation strategy.
20_11	0.15756158	Warden began by saying that Microsoft ``respectfully disagreed'' with a large part of the judge's findings of fact.
20_12	0.099355561	He then went on to tell Jackson that his ruling might well shape the ground rules for competition in the high-tech economy.
20_13	0.26180234	The Microsoft case, Warden noted, focuses on the company's ``fights with competitors in a highly competitive, fast-moving industry''.
20_14	0.094552264	And antitrust doctrine, he observed, encourages competition even when that rough-and-tumble competition hurts a company's rivals.
20_15	0.099655854	``The law should not be rewritten to prevent Microsoft, or any other company, from competing aggressively,'' Warden said.
20_16	0.11617643	In the government's view, Microsoft is trying to change the subject with such arguments.
20_17	0.1252017	Fierce competition is one thing, the government says, but the voluminous record including volumes of e-mail, internal Microsoft documents and witness testimony show Microsoft to have been an arm-twisting monopolist, whose corporate behavior stifled competition and harmed consumers.
20_18	0.14734861	Boies opened his remarks by stressing that the Supreme Court has long recognized that antitrust cases are ``especially fact-based cases''.
20_19	0.1330518	And throughout his presentation, he repeatedly made reference to the judge's findings of fact, which sided so emphatically with the government, using phrases like ``the court has found,'' ``the evidence shows'' and ``Microsoft's own witnesses and documents show''.
20_20	0.11071706	And what that evidence showed, said Kevin O'Connor, an assistant attorney general for Wisconsin, who represented the states, was that ``Microsoft has used virtually every tool of the monopolist's trade _ attempted collusion, exclusionary contracts, tying, predation _ in a coordinated scheme to eliminate threats to its monopoly.''
21_0	0.1254586	The testimony last week of Garry Norris of IBM supplied some of the most absorbing moments so far in the Microsoft trial.
21_1	0.10180354	His litany of accusations was lengthy and specific _ threats and enticements to not compete against the Microsoft Corp.
21_2	0.095937147	delivered at meeting after meeting.
21_3	0.09002763	His charges were fleshed out with the dates, places and names, and backed up by his handwritten notes.
21_4	0.1801262	Norris, who negotiated with Microsoft on behalf of IBM's personal computer business from 1995 to 1997, was the first representative of a PC maker to testify for the government.
21_5	0.24579386	David Boies, the lead trial lawyer for the Justice Department, said the Norris testimony put a ``vivid human face'' on what he called ``some of the most important evidence in the case''.
21_6	0.19745806	Yet antitrust experts say that the Norris testimony was not a knockout punch on its own and that its legal power may hinge on earlier testimony, in closed sessions, on the prices Microsoft charges PC makers for its Windows operating system.
21_7	0.08155221	Big, powerful and itself long a target of government antitrust suits, IBM was an imperfect object of sympathy as the representative witness for PC makers.
21_8	0.18849373	Ever since IBM selected Microsoft to supply the operating system for the first IBM PC in 1981, IBM has been out-hustled and outsmarted by Microsoft in the PC business _ not the sort of behavior the nation's antitrust laws were meant to prohibit.
21_9	0.11735669	The government, of course, had recognized that IBM's size, reach and complicated history with Microsoft could be used by Microsoft's lawyers to try to undercut its contentions.
21_10	0.11374755	For months, the Justice Department had urged other major computer makers to take the stand _ and it pushed particularly hard for Ted Waitt, the chairman of Gateway Inc.
21_11	0.097280288	, who ultimately decided against it.
21_12	0.11186476	Microsoft's defense, antitrust experts say, may be that IBM was told it would pay a higher price for Windows unless it agreed to ``reduce, drop or eliminate'' shipments of OS/2, IBM's competing operating system.
21_13	0.093535005	On its face, such an invitation to a competitor to reduce competition would be an antitrust violation, even if the offer were rejected.
21_14	0.10892437	But the legal standard in such cases, established in a 1984 ruling involving American Airlines, is that the evidence be ``uniquely unequivocal'' _ in the airline case, the evidence was a tape-recorded offer to jointly raise fares.
21_15	0.090508216	With Microsoft, there is no such clear-cut evidence.
21_16	0.07266655	The contract proposals presented in court were a series of suggested discounts on the price of Windows if IBM agreed to certain promotion and marketing efforts on behalf of Windows.
21_17	0.085885533	No Microsoft contract offer, Norris conceded, stated specifically that IBM must ``drop or eliminate'' OS/2.
21_18	0.10694098	But he insisted that the overall effect of the Microsoft terms would be to ``kill OS/2 in the markeplace''.
21_19	0.13010642	Still, antitrust experts note, it is certainly legal for Microsoft to offer a distributor _ as the IBM PC business was _ incentives to aggressively distribute its product.
21_20	0.071624607	If accepting those incentives means featuring Microsoft's Windows over OS/2 _ made by another unit of IBM _ that is mainly a business decision for IBM to make, they say.
21_21	0.17110534	IBM turned down the Microsoft proposal.
21_22	0.10848836	A shrewdly devised offer by Microsoft perhaps, but antitrust experts say it was probably not a violation.
21_23	0.13774272	``It will be very difficult for the government to prevail on the OS/2 allegations,'' said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University.
21_24	0.098393396	The Norris testimony, however, went well beyond the OS/2 charge.
21_25	0.13933665	He asserted that Microsoft repeatedly offered IBM better terms and prices for Windows if it favored Microsoft products ranging from so-called office productivity applications to its Internet browsing software.
21_26	0.092523294	When IBM rejected those proposals, Norris said, Microsoft charged IBM more for Windows than it charged other major PC makers.
21_27	0.16514668	``The strongest Norris testimony was when he recounted the incidents of IBM not using other Microsoft software and then getting punished on the price of Windows,'' said Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, who is a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division.
21_28	0.095902736	Microsoft insists there is no evidence that IBM paid a higher price for Windows than its competitors.
21_29	0.091453201	The exception was the Compaq Computer Corp.
21_30	0.10353376	, which received a significantly lower price, Microsoft says, because it shared in the costs of developing Windows 95 _ a straightforward business rationale for different terms, says Microsoft, not punishment meted out by a monopolist.
21_31	0.11770646	But the government introduced an IBM document that cast doubt on Microsoft's statement.
21_32	0.066486021	The document, an internal memo, said IBM believed it paid $5 to $15 more for each copy of Windows it loaded on its machines than did Compaq, Hewlett-Packard or Dell Computer.
21_33	0.062425759	``IBM,'' the May 1997 document stated, ``currently pays a higher royalty than our leading competitors''.
21_34	0.14170628	Much of the detailed, company-by-company information on the prices to makers for Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system was submitted in previous testimony.
21_35	0.15945551	To protect confidential commercial information, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson took that testimony in closed sessions.
21_36	0.1047291	If the industry pricing information shows that IBM was paying more than comparable PC makers, the Norris testimony may add more legal ammunition to the government's case.
21_37	0.1273712	``To the extent the Norris testimony fits into the pattern of Microsoft threats and punishment, it is another piece in the puzzle,'' Litan, the former Justice Department official, said.
22_0	0.21193292	After a yearlong antitrust investigation, Japan's Fair Trade Commission told Microsoft Corp.
22_1	0.13802739	Friday to change permanently one of its marketing practices and pointedly warned the company to watch its step in the Internet browser market.
22_2	0.1778392	But despite the reprimand, the Japanese antitrust agency also stated that Microsoft's business practices ``cannot be immediately found to have tended to impede fair competition'' in the market for browser software in Japan.
22_3	0.17957744	Microsoft focused on that finding Friday as evidence that a major industrial nation had investigated many of the same practices as those in dispute in the Microsoft trial in Washington and had not found an anticompetitive effect.
22_4	0.070434988	``The finding in Japan is potentially quite interesting from an American standpoint because the Japanese investigators looked at the same kinds of things that are at issue in Washington,'' said Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel for international affairs.
22_5	0.16289626	Microsoft also announced Friday that the South Korean Fair Trade Commission had informed the company two months ago that its investigation of Microsoft, begun in November 1997, was concluded and that no further review was expected.
22_6	0.38450453	There is no direct link between the several overseas investigations of Microsoft and the antitrust case being heard in Washington, where the Justice Department and 20 states have sued Microsoft.
22_7	0.21277272	Antitrust experts said that most countries still investigating Microsoft's practices were taking a wait-and-see stance toward the company, pending the outcome of the major U.S. antitrust case.
22_8	0.091337004	Karel van Miert, the European commissioner in charge of competition policy, said recently that the European Commission was ``closely watching'' the trial in Washington, so for the present, there was no reason to devote more resources to the European investigation.

22_17	0.12895505	The Japanese antitrust agency did find that Microsoft had been engaging in an unfair trade practice by bundling its Excel spreadsheet and Word text program in sales to personal computer makers.
