4_30	0.14285714285714285	They do not necessarily want to separate from Canada, but they expect their leaders to use the threat of separation as leverage to bargain with the federal government for more provincial powers.
4_31	0.26666666666666666	And so, Balthazar continued, even Quebecers who want to stay in Canada will vote for the Parti Quebecois, which officially embraces separation, to maintain this perceived advantage.
4_32	0.0	Thus, Bouchard could not necessarily count the support he wins on Monday as support for a referendum.
4_33	0.0	``Right now, a PQ victory would not translate into a future winning referendum,'' Balthazar said.
4_34	0.18181818181818182	He said he believed that Quebecers would vote for Bouchard because of the way he has managed Quebec, not because he will make it an independent nation.

4_36	0.26666666666666666	Polls indicate that voters now see Bouchard's separatist government as standing for stability while it is Charest's Liberals who represent radical change.
