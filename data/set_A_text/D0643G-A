0_0	1.3333333333333333	LONDON (AP) --After linking El Nino with illnesses such as malaria, cholera and dengue fever, scientists now have connected the climatic phenomenon with an increase in childhood diarrhea.
0_1	0.13636363636363635	The research led by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health also suggests for the first time that gradual temperature increases related to global warming could foster outbreaks of diarrhea in children living in developing nations.
0_2	0.0	Diarrhea kills as many as 3 million children under the age of 5 worldwide every year and sickens millions more, mostly in developing countries.
0_3	0.0	It normally is more prevalent during the warmer seasons but, until now, experts didn't know whether a change in temperature could play a role.
0_4	0.0	The study of 57,331 children in Lima, Peru, found that an increase in diarrhea cases between 1993 and 1997 was linked to even small rises in temperature, regardless of whether it was summer or winter.
0_5	0.0	In fact, the effect was greater in winter, even though the weather was cooler.
0_6	0.0	Overall, the study, published this week in The Lancet medical journal, found that for every 1 degree centigrade (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than normal it became, 8 percent more children arrived at a local clinic for treatment of diarrhea.
0_7	3.142857142857143	The findings were similar for the 1997-1998 El Nino period.
0_8	1.75	The number of children brought to the clinic each day that winter was double what would have been expected for that time of year had El Nino not occurred, the study found.
0_9	1.2272727272727273	El Nino, which involves the equatorial waters in the Pacific warming up, creating unusual weather patterns around the world, increased winter temperatures in Lima by about 4 degrees centigrade (about 7 degrees Fahrenheit).
0_10	1.05	A similar increase in temperatures brought on by El Nino in the summer was still connected to more diarrhea than usual, but the effect was not as strong, accounting for only a 50 percent rise in diarrhea cases, the researchers found.
0_11	0.21428571428571427	"The potential effect of global warming on disease is controversial," said William Checkley of Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins, who led the study.
0_12	0.0	"This study suggests there may be something to it for diarrhea".
0_13	0.0	It's plausible the researchers' findings could apply in countries other than Peru, said Dr.
0_14	0.0	Tony McMichael, an epidemiology professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who studies the effects of climate on disease.
0_15	0.0	"In general, a large proportion of infectious disease agents are very sensitive to slight changes in climate," said McMichael, who was not involved in the research.
0_16	0.0	"This would give us a reasonable indication of how diarrhea agents react to changes in temperature in general, whether in water or in food".
0_17	0.0	Checkley said the stronger effect in winter could be due to the fact that the types of diarrhea common in winter and summer are different.
0_18	0.0	In hot weather, diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites is more likely.
0_19	0.0	Cooler temperatures appear to enhance the transmission of viral diarrhea, he said.
0_20	0.0	When the winters are hotter than normal, it could be that children are exposed to more sources of diarrhea, including the bacterial and parasite sort.
0_21	2.1	El Nino also may prompt diarrhea-promoting behavior more common in the summer, such as more demand for water, the study said.
0_22	0.0	Dr. Olivier Fontaine, a diarrhea expert at the World Health Organization, said the observed link makes sense.
0_23	0.0	"This may be useful for developing strategies to combat the disease by intervening to prevent it," Fontaine said.
0_24	2.0	"If we can predict a change in the weather, such as when El Nino cycles around, we could have all the interventions in place before the weather changes."

1_2	0.0	The rains were heavy and long.
1_3	0.0	Camels, cows, sheep and goats all started dying of violent fevers.
1_4	0.0	Soon people, too, began to get sick.
1_5	0.2222222222222222	The disease was Rift Valley fever, caused by an obscure mosquito-borne virus.
1_6	0.0	It pops up every few years in Africa when standing water encourages mosquito eggs to hatch.
1_7	0.0	At least 89,000 people caught the disease _ about 200 died _ and animal owners reported losing up to 90 percent of their herds.
1_8	0.0	Yet catastrophic as the East African floods were, they had to jostle for the world's attention with other cases of strange weather _ with unusual occurrences of droughts, fires, rains, cold snaps and heat waves.
1_9	0.2608695652173913	Every year brings its own grab bag of such anomalies, but this year many of them could be linked to a phenomenon in the empty expanses of the equatorial Pacific _ a change in the ocean currents and winds that began in the early months of 1997 and that altered weather patterns around the world.
1_10	3.142857142857143	The change in the weather was, of course, the work of El Nino.
1_11	1.1666666666666667	By the end of 1997, El Nino had already become a celebrity of sorts _ in storm-battered California, television news programs offered a tabloid flurry of El Nino updates.
1_12	2.3	In 1998, however, El Nino's effects on the world came into full flower.
1_13	0.8	It helped make the year the hottest ever recorded.
1_14	1.2857142857142858	In addition to Rift Valley fever, El Nino has been linked to an upsurge in diseases ranging from cholera to malaria to dengue fever, in Kenya, Cambodia, Peru and other countries scattered around the globe.
1_15	0.0	Scientists are now trying to figure out how they can use this year's experiences to predict what the future will bring _ both in the next few months and in future decades.
1_16	1.2941176470588236	The good news is that they can now forecast an El Nino with some precision, and during El Nino years predict its effect on the world's weather months in advance.
1_17	1.9090909090909092	The bad news is that according to some research this latest El Nino might be a preview of the weather to come in the next century.
1_18	0.9545454545454546	In recent years, researchers have become better prepared for El Nino, thanks to the work of ocean modelers like Mark Cane and Stephen Zebiak of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
1_19	1.2222222222222223	In the mid-1980s Cane and Zebiak wanted a miniature Pacific they could play with, a simulation in which they could shut off this wind or that current to see which factors were most important to El Nino's existence.
1_20	2.090909090909091	They built a simple computer model, and almost as an afterthought they tried to use it to predict real El Ninos.
1_21	1.3125	It accurately predicted the onset of the next El Nino, in 1986; then, in the early 1990s, months in advance of each one, it predicted the onset of a string of El Ninos.
1_22	0.42857142857142855	Other scientists began building more sophisticated computer models.
1_23	0.0	By late 1996 the new models had outperformed their predecessor.
1_24	1.9090909090909092	By the time the next El Nino arrives, scientists hope to be able to give much better forecasts.
1_25	0.10526315789473684	To that end, Lamont-Doherty and Scripps Institution of Oceanography have joined forces to create the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction along New York's Hudson River.
1_26	0.0	Its 80 scientists will be dedicated to making climate predictions up to a year in advance.
1_27	0.3333333333333333	Much of their effort will have to go into making better computer models.
1_28	1.375	Rather than relying on the historical averages of El Nino's behavior, they will be trying to simulate the whole shebang, from the initial slosh of the Pacific to the downpours in Kenya.
1_29	1.2380952380952381	Ultimately, the researchers hope to take what they learn about El Nino and use it to understand trickier oscillations in other parts of the world's ocean, such as the rise and fall of sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic.
1_30	1.9090909090909092	That might make it possible to reliably predict climate many months in advance even in years without a big El Nino.
1_31	1.8461538461538463	There are signs, for example, that the power and the frequency of El Ninos may rise and fall according to vast cycles of the Pacific Ocean.
1_32	2.3333333333333335	It's clear that from decade to decade the nature of El Nino does change.
1_33	2.1	From 1885 to 1915, for example, El Ninos were powerful, but from 1915 to 1950 they were minuscule.
1_34	0.0	After 1960 they picked up again, and since the late 1970s they've been very big.
1_35	1.5714285714285714	The work of researchers, combined with El Nino's power this year, has made clear that it is far more than a matter of the occasional bad fish catch.
1_36	1.6153846153846154	El Nino represents the fickleness of a powerful ocean that can focus its energy on the world's weather with stunning swiftness.
1_37	0.0	Cane and Zebiak have recently been studying the quirkiness of the Pacific on the scale of hundreds of thousands of years.
1_38	0.0	One of the most startling things they've found is the ability of the ocean to sometimes shift abruptly into an El Nino-like pattern and then stay that way for thousands of years.
1_39	0.0	Cane speculates that by behaving this way, the Pacific may go so far as to kick the planet in and out of ice ages.
1_40	2.3333333333333335	Cane himself admits that his extrapolating from today's El Ninos to the past may be ``outrageous''.
1_41	0.0	Extrapolating into the future is even more hazardous.
1_42	1.2352941176470589	Yet it's possible, and certainly worth contemplating, that someday El Nino will stop making the occasional visits we're now used to and settle in for a long, long stay.

2_0	1.1428571428571428	Conditions like El Nino might settle in almost permanently if global warming gets bad enough, making climate disruptions such as droughts or excessive winter rain essentially the norm, a computer study suggests.
2_1	0.21052631578947367	That might happen around the year 2050 if nothing is done to control emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, said researcher Mojib Latif of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.

2_3	0.5	It happens every three to four years on average.
2_4	0.7647058823529411	It can disrupt climate around the world, producing extra rain in the southeastern United States and in Peru during the winter, while causing drought in the western Pacific, for example.
2_5	0.5	The computer simulation suggests that unrestrained global warming could set up the same kind of pattern in ocean surface temperatures, but as a more or less constant condition.
2_6	0.0	Latif and colleagues report their findings in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
2_7	0.0	Essentially, the study suggests that the Pacific would warm more in the east than the west.
2_8	0.0	That's because the western part is already so warm that with further heating it would spawn clouds that provide cooling shade, Latif said.
2_9	0.4	The El-Nino-like temperature pattern might be broken every five years or so by a strong cooling like the periodic phenomenon called La Nina, he added.

3_0	1.1363636363636365	CANBERRA, November 3 (Xinhua) --Australian scientists have uncovered a link between global warming and the increasing frequency of the El Nino weather system, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported tonight.
3_1	0.1875	The Four Corners TV program claimed scientific data were showing that a man-made permanent drought was in the offing as a result of global warming.
3_2	0.9444444444444444	Steve Wilson, a scientist of the climate modeling program at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), Australia's top national scientific research body, explained that a sophisticated computer model set up at the CSIRO laboratories showed a relationship between sea surface temperature anomalies and the warm El Nino phase.

3_5	1.4	"We'd like to do a more elaborate and longer experiment but as far as I know, we are the only group who actually found the change in the frequency of El Nino events," Hunt said.
3_6	0.3333333333333333	The program said experiments on the relationship between increasing carbon dioxide levels and global warming being done at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii supported the Australian claims.

3_9	0.96	Hunt said climate warming's affect on El Nino was complex, even showing that a gradual increase in carbon dioxide output would make the Australian continent drier, while, if the output were doubled, the effect would actually make Australia wetter.

18_4	0.375	The oceans exchange large amounts of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere each year.
18_5	0.0	Areas where water is sinking absorb the gas, those where water is rising to the surface release the gas.
18_6	1.6111111111111112	The most important of gas-releasing areas is the equatorial Pacific, where is also the home of El Nino, the quasi-biennial warming event in the surface waters of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.
18_7	0.2857142857142857	It is estimated that the equatorial Pacific Ocean is the source of 72 percent of the annual flux of carbon to the atmosphere from the equatorial oceans.
18_8	0.3	Scientists usually estimate how much carbon dioxide should be in the atmosphere by calculating how much fossil fuel is burned.
18_9	0.42857142857142855	But some 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide go unaccounted for each year.
18_10	0.2	The NOAA team's new research helps explain the lower growth in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere during those years.
18_11	1.8571428571428572	The researchers have found that reduced carbon dioxide releases in the Pacific during El Nino could account for up to a third of this "missing" carbon dioxide.
19_0	1.3125	BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) --Chinese oceanographers today expect climatic repercussions on global weather as El Nino is expected to come sometime this year or the next.
19_1	0.3684210526315789	Wang Fei, director of the Marine Environmental Protection Department of the State Oceanic Administration, issued the warning today at a press conference on this year's marine disaster forecast.
19_2	0.29411764705882354	The conclusion was made by Song Jiaxi and his colleagues with the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center in their annual marine disaster forecast report, which was released today.
19_3	1.1	El Nino phenomenon, which comes at an interval of roughly four years, refers to abnormal temperature rises in tropical waters which normally leads to global anomalies in weather and climate.
19_4	1.105263157894737	El Nino was blamed for the heavy summer rains in China, causing devastating floods in areas along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and northwest China in 1998.
20_0	0.6111111111111112	Oklahoma's catastrophic tornadoes were influenced by La Nina, the weather phenomenon 5,000 miles west of the prairie in the Pacific Ocean, scientists say.
20_1	0.0	It's part of the same widespread weather trend that dumped a record 91 feet of snow on Mount Baker in Washington this winter and triggered severe drought and wildfires in Florida.
20_2	0.18181818181818182	``The signal is there,'' said Steve Byrd, science officer for the National Weather Service in Omaha, Neb.
20_3	0.6666666666666666	``The incidence of tornadoes on the central Plains is slightly higher during La Nina''.
20_4	0.9411764705882353	La Nina refers to a large, unusually cold pool of water in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that develops every several years, and influences weather patterns around the world.
20_5	2.2	It works in reverse of the more common and better-understood El Nino, which is a warming of Pacific waters.
20_6	0.47368421052631576	La Nina has generated a stronger, colder jet stream in the upper atmosphere, while warm, wet air at lower levels has been pulled from the Gulf of Mexico into the Plains states.
20_7	0.0	This combination generated the ferocious thunderstorms that spawned dozens of twisters, including a historic F-5 tornado in Oklahoma City.
20_8	0.0	An F-5 is the most powerful tornado there is.
20_9	0.0	At least 41 people have died in Oklahoma alone as the result of the severe weather.
20_10	1.0	The current La Nina has persisted for nearly a year.
20_11	0.8571428571428571	Most La Ninas last only several months, and there are signs that this one is beginning to wane.
20_12	2.888888888888889	The weather pattern comes on the heels of an El Nino that dissipated in 1998.
20_13	2.1	Studies suggest tornadoes were reduced by as much as 24 percent in some regions during the most recent El Nino.
20_14	1.9166666666666667	El Ninos increase storm activity in California and South America while calming things down in the Atlantic and Caribbean.
20_15	0.5384615384615384	La Ninas, by contrast, reduce storms in California but stir up trouble in other parts of the country as well as in India and southeast Asia.
20_16	0.0	This spring, meteorologists in Nebraska and Iowa already have tallied 17 tornadoes --five more than normal by early May.
20_17	0.0	``We're already living up to predictions,'' Byrd said.
21_0	0.3076923076923077	LOS ANGELES --Despite predictions that La Nina would bring Los Angeles a dry winter and possibly worsen the fire season, the weather phenomenon now appears to be losing strength, according to scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
21_1	1.1428571428571428	The pool of cold Pacific water that is the heart of La Nina has shrunk to one-fourth the size it was in May, even as warm water left over from El Nino remains, said Bill Patzert, a researcher at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration laboratory in suburban Pasadena.
21_2	0.5	If La Nina dissipates before it hits Los Angeles, the area could face a more typical wet winter.
21_3	2.4545454545454546	``It's really a question at this point: Will La Nina wane as El Nino lingers''? he said.
21_4	1.619047619047619	La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold.
21_5	0.5714285714285714	Each can bring drought to some parts of the planet while drenching others with rain.
21_6	1.2916666666666667	Just two weeks ago, National Weather Service experts predicted that La Nina --a phenomenon whose effects are roughly the opposite of El Nino's -- would bring Los Angeles a slightly drier year than normal.
21_7	1.2	Don't count La Nina out yet.
21_8	0.09090909090909091	Patzert and other weather experts say the cold water pool often fluctuates in size as the phenomenon builds.
21_9	1.7058823529411764	``El Nino and La Nina are things that change slowly over time,'' said Ants Leetmaa, director of the weather service's Climate Prediction Center.
21_10	0.0	``It's pretty dangerous to look week to week''.
21_11	0.0	He said the center predicted that after rapid cooling during the summer, ocean temperatures would rebound before cooling again.
21_12	0.0	``The forecasts are still on track,'' he said.
21_13	1.588235294117647	Although the current La Nina conditions are following on the heels of last winter's El Nino, they often occur years apart and don't alternate in an orderly progression.
21_14	2.076923076923077	This summer has been unusual, with a growing La Nina sharing the ocean with remnants of the strongest El Nino on record.
21_15	1.1428571428571428	Although La Nina is already affecting rainfall in Southeast Asia, it hasn't noticeably influenced North America's weather yet, Leetmaa said Instead, it may be that warm water left over from El Nino is contributing to the formation of more tropical storms than normal in the eastern Pacific.
21_16	1.9090909090909092	``We had a hundred-year El Nino, and it really rang the Pacific's bell,'' Leetmaa said. XXX
22_0	1.2272727272727273	JERUSALEM, August 22 (Xinhua) --Israeli scientists have achieved progress in predicting the chaotic behavior of El Nino, a warming of surface water of the equatorial Pacific Ocean, through a sophisticated computer simulation.
22_1	0.09375	According to a recent report released by the Weizmann Institute of Science, the study was conducted by professor Eli Tziperman of the Weizmann Institute's Environmental Sciences and Energy Research Department, together with colleague Harvey Scher and with Stephen Zebiak and Mark Cane of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
22_2	3.0	El Nino usually occurs around December every three to six years.
22_3	0.875	It disrupts weather worldwide, causing storms, floods and droughts.
22_4	0.0	Its exact arrival, however, is extremely difficult to predict with precision because of its chaotic nature.
22_5	2.4	The scientists worked with a computer model currently used to predict El Nino events.
22_6	1.0	When they altered the values for the magnitude of deep ocean waves at a single point in the western Pacific, the model produced El Nino at regular intervals of about four years, with perfectly predictable cycles of temperature, winds and ocean currents.
22_7	1.0909090909090908	While the scientists do not propose to control the actual El Nino, they do believe that the successful control in a complex prediction model may help them better understand the crucial factors governing El Nino behavior.
22_8	1.4666666666666666	This, in turn, may improve the researchers' ability to predict El Nino events and lead to measures that could reduce their global damage.
22_9	1.1578947368421053	A particularly significant El Nino (Spanish for "The Child," referring to the infant Jesus) appears to be brewing in the equatorial Pacific right now, threatening to strike some time later this year.
23_0	1.5	On Tuesday, ``Nova'' ventures on the track of El Nino, the mysterious phenomenon that every few years rages out of the Pacific Ocean to wreak havoc around the world.
23_1	0.0	Its impact in 1997 and 1998 is fresh in memory.
23_2	1.05	What happens when El Nino strikes is lamentably clear; the puzzle of why has sent a team of scientists, the focus of Tuesday's program, patrolling the Pacific with a long line of data-collecting stations.
23_3	1.5	What the scientists know already is that El Nino disrupts normal weather patterns: Trade winds may reverse direction, sending the warm water that normally moves toward Australia and Indonesia back toward the South American coast, with infamous consequences.
23_4	1.05	In the 1982-83 El Nino, areas of Peru, which was hit first, received 30 times the normal rainfall; the flooding cost Peru some $1 billion in damages and 600 deaths.
23_5	0.0	Worldwide damage came to $13 billion and 2,000 deaths.
23_6	1.8571428571428572	Put in place in 1994, the El Nino detection system, perhaps the largest scientific instrument ever built, is kept afloat by buoys.
23_7	1.3	Constantly monitoring the Pacific's winds and waves, the system's 70 stations can come up with hints of suspicious changes and may deliver an El Nino forecast, as they did in 1997.
23_8	0.0	But what was predicted to be a minor event, as one forecaster concedes and television viewers may recall, turned out to be a ``whopper''.
23_9	0.0	A result was destruction from Africa to California, where meteorologists can be seen flying smack into the storms to measure their impact.
23_10	2.4444444444444446	It makes for quite a show, and the only sure prediction about El Nino is that it will come again.

24_1	0.84	space agency NASA said that the warm Pacific water current known as El Nino has become weaker, shrinking by at least 10 percent and falling to the level last observed in early September, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
24_2	0.0	Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory came the conclusion after analyzing the data collected from satellite last week.
24_3	2.0	Climate experts said this year's El Nino was one of the century's largest and most disruptive weather phenomena.
24_4	1.6923076923076923	However the latest data on El Nino from a NASA satellite made them conclude that El Nino has completed its second peak.
24_5	1.9090909090909092	Over the next several weeks, the El Nino current could peter out, or it may simply be pausing before gathering greater force, they said.
