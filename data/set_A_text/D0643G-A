0_0	0.55	GENEVA (AP) _ The surface of the Pacific Ocean is expected to continue cooling slowly for the rest of the year, fueling the La Nina weather phenomenon, the U.N. weather agency said Monday.
0_1	0.6153846153846154	``Weak La Nina conditions'' have started to develop, the World Meteorological Organization said in its El Nino/La Nina Update.
0_2	2.2857142857142856	La Nina, caused by a large pool of abnormally cool water in the eastern Pacific, alternates with the warming El Nino.
0_3	0.4	By October, cooler than normal surface temperatures were in evidence from the west coast of South America to well west of the International dateline, WMO said.
0_4	0.6923076923076923	The current La Nina started when surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific dropped rapidly in May and June.
0_5	1.4	The shift brought heavy rainfall and flash floods to Indonesia in August after a long drought caused by the El Nino phenomenon.
0_6	0.0	It has also brought rain to Australia.
0_7	0.6363636363636364	An increased number of hurricanes over the Atlantic ``is consistent with developing La Nina conditions,'' WMO said.
0_8	0.0	Last Sept.
0_9	0.1111111111111111	24, four Atlantic hurricanes were active at the same time, the first time this has happened this century.
0_10	2.0	El Nino is created when trade winds weaken, allowing a large mass of warm water in the western Pacific to pulse to the east along the equator toward South America.
0_11	2.4166666666666665	During El Nino, the warm water interacts with the atmosphere above it, creating a worldwide disruption in weather patterns.
0_12	1.2222222222222223	The 1997-98 El Nino, the strongest ever recorded, meant record rain in California, heavy flooding in Peru, drought in Indonesia and tornadoes and flooding in Florida.
0_13	2.5454545454545454	La Nina, Spanish for ``little girl,'' is just the opposite, with the warm conditions of El Nino returning to the west.
0_14	0.55	During La Nina, which typically lasts at least a year, dry conditions take hold of South America, Africa has alternate periods of drought and flooding and rains return to Asia.
0_15	1.5555555555555556	Because of its association with monsoon rains in south Asia, ``La Nina's impacts in that region are typically viewed as less disruptive than those of El Nino,'' the WMO report said.
0_16	0.6	``However, La Nina's relatively benign image may not be entirely appropriate,'' it cautioned.
0_17	0.2777777777777778	WMO added that uncertainty over surface temperatures in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, which contribute to changing rainfall over Africa and South America, makes an accurate forecast difficult.
0_18	0.0	But it said there are increased possibilities of below-normal rainfall in eastern Africa through next March.

1_1	1.1666666666666667	_ El Nino appears to have been an active climate force since the time human beings developed writing, a geologist theorizes in an article published Friday in the journal Science.
1_2	1.3529411764705883	The findings by a team of researchers add to a growing body of knowledge about the still mysterious El Nino, which has affected weather systems from South America to the U.S.
1_3	1.6153846153846154	Northeast. The findings could add to research into how El Nino may have influenced civilization, and what it could mean for the future of a warming planet.
1_4	0.041666666666666664	It wasn't an ancient Sumerian weather story that led Union College assistant professor Donald Rodbell to the discovery, but a 30-foot-long sample of mud taken in 1993 from Lake Pallcococha high in the Andes of Ecuador.
1_5	0.08333333333333333	The sample, originally drawn by Rodbell and colleague Geoffrey Seltzer of Syracuse University to study climate change associated with the last ice age, provided a natural archive of climactic information spanning 15,000 years.
1_6	0.0	The core, after some initial study, sat in a refrigerator for three years until researchers began taking another look at it, particularly its unusual ``zebra stripes'' of light-colored layers.
1_7	0.0	``We didn't know exactly what we had,'' Rodbell said.
1_8	2.3333333333333335	``In the back of my mind, I wondered if these patterns were somehow connected to El Nino''.
1_9	2.1666666666666665	El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean that affects wind and temperature patterns.
1_10	1.4375	While El Nino's effects have recognized for years, scientists until now have had only a few hundred years worth of written and anecdotal records to study, including when it began.
1_11	1.9090909090909092	The core gives what scientists say is the longest continuous record of El Nino activity.
1_12	1.0952380952380953	Every two to eight years, El Nino manifests itself in warm ocean currents off the western coast of South America, affecting, depending on its strength, weather systems throughout the Western Hemisphere.
1_13	0.05555555555555555	Effects include heavy rainfall in northern Peru and southern Ecuador, and unusually warm, dry conditions as far away as the northeastern United States and western tropical Pacific.
1_14	1.4666666666666666	The bands of light and dark sediment in the sample, scientists say, document El Nino's active and quiet years.
1_15	0.0	The light layers reflect non-El Nino years, marked by relatively weak rainfalls, while the dark, organically rich layers were caused by heavy downpours that washed more vegetation from upland areas into the lake.
1_16	1.75	Analysis with medical imaging technology found that El Nino appeared every two to eight years, the same frequency as today.
1_17	0.6944444444444444	The research team found that El Nino was weak to non-existent around the lake between 5,000 and 12,000 years ago, but as an accompanying article in Science notes, other new records from western Pacific corals and sediment from the Great Lakes show El Nino was in action 12,000 to 120,000 years ago.
1_18	1.6923076923076923	Scientists say that unlocking El Nino's secrets means more to humanity than knowing when to invest in umbrella stock.
1_19	0.8461538461538461	The torrential rains, according to at least one theory by archaeologist Daniel Sandweiss of the University of Maine, may have sparked temple construction and more complex civilizations, right after an El Nino lull that occurred from 5,000 to 8,000 years ago.
1_20	0.0	While that theory had been challenged, the find appears to support at least his claim that the lull occurred.
1_21	1.9230769230769231	The world was also warmer in that quiet El Nino period, further pointing to a possible relationship between El Nino and global warming.
1_22	0.8	IN December, scientists from the Woods Hole Research Laboratory in Massachusetts reported in the journal Nature that during El Nino years that bring hot, dry weather to the Amazon, Brazil's rain forest sends out more carbon dioxide gas, trapping heat in the atmosphere.
1_23	0.0	How that might play out in a world where human activity is adding to the so-called greenhouse effect remains unclear.

3_0	0.9230769230769231	WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) --Weather satellite data that detect warming in the Indian Ocean and the early signs of an El Nino in the Pacific may also give an early warning about an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in Africa, according to a study by researchers.
3_1	0.08	The study appearing Friday in the journal Science has linked the warming of Pacific and Indian Ocean waters with increased rains in Africa and the periodic outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, a mosquito-borne disease that can kill humans and animals.
3_2	0.18518518518518517	Researchers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland State of the United States and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington analyzed 50 years of weather and medical data to establish the connection between warm oceans, rains and the fever.
3_3	0.21428571428571427	"We discovered a cycle of Rift Valley Fever outbreaks that appeared to depend on rainfall," said Kenneth Linthicum of Walter Reed.
3_4	0.0	"There were large outbreaks every seven to 10 years, but the virus apparently disappears between outbreaks".
3_5	1.1666666666666667	Assaf Anyamba, a Goddard researcher who uses satellites to study the oceans, said that East Africa gets more rain during an El Nino, but that this effect, alone, is not enough to prompt a fever outbreak.
3_6	1.4705882352941178	A fever outbreak is more likely to occur when the Indian Ocean warms at the same time as there is an El Nino, a phenomenon that includes the warming of Pacific Ocean waters.
3_7	0.11764705882352941	"When the western equatorial Indian Ocean is similar to the East Pacific in sea-surface temperature, there will likely be a large-scale outbreak of Rift Valley Fever," said Anyamba.
3_8	0.36363636363636365	Researchers said their study suggests that satellite data that measures sea surface temperature, along with measurements of vegetation growth in East Africa, could pinpoint areas where Rift Valley Fever outbreaks are most likely to occur.
3_9	0.2	They said that satellite data could give a two-to-five-month warning of a Rift Valley Fever outbreak.
3_10	0.18181818181818182	This would give time to vaccinate livestock and to treat mosquito habitats with insecticides that are released upon flooding.

4_0	1.1363636363636365	CANBERRA, November 3 (Xinhua) --Australian scientists have uncovered a link between global warming and the increasing frequency of the El Nino weather system, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported tonight.
4_1	0.1875	The Four Corners TV program claimed scientific data were showing that a man-made permanent drought was in the offing as a result of global warming.
4_2	0.9444444444444444	Steve Wilson, a scientist of the climate modeling program at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), Australia's top national scientific research body, explained that a sophisticated computer model set up at the CSIRO laboratories showed a relationship between sea surface temperature anomalies and the warm El Nino phase.
4_3	1.5625	When the present levels of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide were doubled in the experiment, the number of El Ninos affecting Australia nearly doubled too, the scientist said.
4_4	0.0	Barry Hunt, leader of the research project, told the program he wanted more time to verify the model's findings.
4_5	1.4	"We'd like to do a more elaborate and longer experiment but as far as I know, we are the only group who actually found the change in the frequency of El Nino events," Hunt said.
4_6	0.3333333333333333	The program said experiments on the relationship between increasing carbon dioxide levels and global warming being done at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii supported the Australian claims.
4_7	2.3333333333333335	"It appears that we have a very good case for suggesting that the El Ninos are going to become more frequent...
4_8	1.5	and more intense and, in a few years or a decade, so we'll go into a permanent El Nino," Mauna Loa Director Russell Schneider told the program.
4_9	0.96	Hunt said climate warming's affect on El Nino was complex, even showing that a gradual increase in carbon dioxide output would make the Australian continent drier, while, if the output were doubled, the effect would actually make Australia wetter.
4_10	0.0	The model's scenario showed Australia getting drier for about 100 years at which time it would become wetter than it currently is.

5_0	1.3125	BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) --Chinese oceanographers today expect climatic repercussions on global weather as El Nino is expected to come sometime this year or the next.
5_1	0.3684210526315789	Wang Fei, director of the Marine Environmental Protection Department of the State Oceanic Administration, issued the warning today at a press conference on this year's marine disaster forecast.
5_2	0.29411764705882354	The conclusion was made by Song Jiaxi and his colleagues with the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center in their annual marine disaster forecast report, which was released today.
5_3	1.1	El Nino phenomenon, which comes at an interval of roughly four years, refers to abnormal temperature rises in tropical waters which normally leads to global anomalies in weather and climate.
5_4	1.105263157894737	El Nino was blamed for the heavy summer rains in China, causing devastating floods in areas along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and northwest China in 1998.
6_0	1.6153846153846154	LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) --Despite causing anomaly of weather and climate, the El Nino event may help cut global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean, scientists suggested Thursday.
6_1	0.0	Richard Feely and colleagues form the U.S.
6_2	1.3636363636363635	National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have found that during the El Nino years between 1991 and 1994, the release of carbon dioxide from equatorial Pacific Ocean was between 30 and 80 percent of that in 1996, a non-El Nino year.
6_3	1.5	"El Nino clearly has a marked influence on the overall carbon dioxide flux," the researchers wrote in a letter to the British science journal Nature.
6_4	0.375	The oceans exchange large amounts of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere each year.
6_5	0.0	Areas where water is sinking absorb the gas, those where water is rising to the surface release the gas.
6_6	1.6111111111111112	The most important of gas-releasing areas is the equatorial Pacific, where is also the home of El Nino, the quasi-biennial warming event in the surface waters of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.
6_7	0.2857142857142857	It is estimated that the equatorial Pacific Ocean is the source of 72 percent of the annual flux of carbon to the atmosphere from the equatorial oceans.
6_8	0.3	Scientists usually estimate how much carbon dioxide should be in the atmosphere by calculating how much fossil fuel is burned.
6_9	0.42857142857142855	But some 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide go unaccounted for each year.
6_10	0.2	The NOAA team's new research helps explain the lower growth in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere during those years.
6_11	1.8571428571428572	The researchers have found that reduced carbon dioxide releases in the Pacific during El Nino could account for up to a third of this "missing" carbon dioxide.
7_0	0.9285714285714286	DHAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) --Bangladesh is studying the effects of El Nino in order to develop a model to help farmers understand the global weather pattern when the ocean current in the Pacific coast off Peru warms up or cools down, a press report said Monday.
7_1	1.08	Bangladesh's Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization (SPARRSO) is monitoring the El Nino phenomenon, which is responsible for rains or drought world-wide, to help the country's farmers cope with its effects, SPARRSO director Dr.
7_2	0.0	A.M. Chowdhury told a recent function at the Bangladesh Institute of Strategic Studies.
7_3	0.12	Farmers needed help to chart their crop calendar to keep themselves updated with the changing mood of nature to better cope with it, and vary the sowing and planting periods, he said, adding that the model would be prepared by the SPARRSO and the Bangladesh Agriculture Research Council.
7_4	2.75	"It has become imperative in the backdrop of past performance of El Nino," the weather expert said.
7_5	0.9130434782608695	Since El Nino went 'retreating' in May, it has begun casting its eye on Bangladesh for the past few days, bringing much needed rains, he noted, adding that the reverse was likely to trigger rainfall and flooding.
7_6	0.7777777777777778	On the past effects of El Nino, he said that after it occurred in 1972-73, El Nino reversed to trigger floods in 1974, in 1982-83 it reversed into a spate of flooding, and again in 1986, El Nino led to the worst flooding when it reversed in 1987 and 1988 respectively, he said.
7_7	0.0	The phenomenon had been responsible for only 40 percent rainfall in the country in June, he said.
7_8	0.0	"Not only we had 60 percent less rainfall in June, but it also delayed the arrival of Monsoon by a month," he added.
8_0	1.5	On Tuesday, ``Nova'' ventures on the track of El Nino, the mysterious phenomenon that every few years rages out of the Pacific Ocean to wreak havoc around the world.
8_1	0.0	Its impact in 1997 and 1998 is fresh in memory.
8_2	1.05	What happens when El Nino strikes is lamentably clear; the puzzle of why has sent a team of scientists, the focus of Tuesday's program, patrolling the Pacific with a long line of data-collecting stations.
8_3	1.5	What the scientists know already is that El Nino disrupts normal weather patterns: Trade winds may reverse direction, sending the warm water that normally moves toward Australia and Indonesia back toward the South American coast, with infamous consequences.
8_4	1.05	In the 1982-83 El Nino, areas of Peru, which was hit first, received 30 times the normal rainfall; the flooding cost Peru some $1 billion in damages and 600 deaths.
8_5	0.0	Worldwide damage came to $13 billion and 2,000 deaths.
8_6	1.8571428571428572	Put in place in 1994, the El Nino detection system, perhaps the largest scientific instrument ever built, is kept afloat by buoys.
8_7	1.3	Constantly monitoring the Pacific's winds and waves, the system's 70 stations can come up with hints of suspicious changes and may deliver an El Nino forecast, as they did in 1997.
8_8	0.0	But what was predicted to be a minor event, as one forecaster concedes and television viewers may recall, turned out to be a ``whopper''.
8_9	0.0	A result was destruction from Africa to California, where meteorologists can be seen flying smack into the storms to measure their impact.

9_4	1.6153846153846154	They reached their conclusion after having studied a large amount of materials on unspots and El Nino for the last 250 years.
9_5	1.6923076923076923	"No El Nino has occurred in the last 100 years, for which records are quite complete, in a period when sunspot activity increases," Wang said.

10_9	0.2608695652173913	Every year brings its own grab bag of such anomalies, but this year many of them could be linked to a phenomenon in the empty expanses of the equatorial Pacific _ a change in the ocean currents and winds that began in the early months of 1997 and that altered weather patterns around the world.
10_10	3.142857142857143	The change in the weather was, of course, the work of El Nino.
10_11	1.1666666666666667	By the end of 1997, El Nino had already become a celebrity of sorts _ in storm-battered California, television news programs offered a tabloid flurry of El Nino updates.

20_1	1.6428571428571428	The World Meteorological Organization said the current round of El Nino ``is in its dying stages,'' but conceded there was considerable uncertainty ``about the rate of weakening''.
20_2	1.588235294117647	El Nino, a disruptive weather phenomenon that returned in 1997, has been blamed for flooding in Kenya, drought in Indonesia and heavy snow in the southwestern United States.
20_3	0.0	It has even been credited with lengthening the days on Earth by slowing its rotation.
20_4	1.411764705882353	Unlike previous episodes which lingered for years, the current El Nino ``is showing clear signs of weakening,'' said the World Meteorological Organization, a U.N. agency.
20_5	0.2	The organization's update said the four conditions typical of the weather phenomenon are becoming less pronounced.
20_6	1.0588235294117647	Those conditions are warming in the eastern Pacific Ocean; shifting of precipitation from the western to the eastern Pacific; slowing of trade winds; and changes in sea level.
20_7	3.066666666666667	El Nino causes reversals of normal weather patterns, resulting in drought in usually wet locales and flooding in arid areas.
20_8	1.0	It also helps trigger some man-made disasters.
20_9	0.0	For example, fires set by farmers and plantation owners in Indonesia in 1997 and 1998 swept through unusually dry forests, shrouding much of Southeast Asia in thick haze.
20_10	2.090909090909091	The World Meteorological Association (WMO) said it is difficult to predict just when this round of El Nino will come to an end.
20_11	1.6153846153846154	``One model has conditions moving rapidly towards normal by mid-1998, and another has El Nino lingering on towards the end of the year,'' the report stated.
20_12	1.1666666666666667	During a press conference Tuesday, the organization's secretary-general Godwin Obasi, of Nigeria, said he expected the former scenario, with El Nino tapering off by the end of this month.
20_13	0.4117647058823529	Such a development could be followed by the so-called La Nina effect, which could reverse some of the effects of the current disturbances and, in Southeast Asia, help curb some of the forest fires.
20_14	0.8571428571428571	However, the international weathermen said it's far from certain whether La Nina will occur.
20_15	0.14285714285714285	The U.N. weather agency predicts drier-than-normal conditions over Indonesia, Micronesia and southern South America during the next two months.
20_16	0.36363636363636365	Wetter conditions than usual will continue over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific and over southeastern South America.
20_17	1.2727272727272727	John Miller, chief of the environment division at WMO, told The Associated Press that the forecast was a conservative prediction that discounted the possibility of an immediate end to El Nino or a La Nina episode.
20_18	0.0	This was despite growing evidence to suggest such an occurrence, because forecasts rely on a consensus of results in the computer predictions.
21_0	2.1	WASHINGTON (AP) --For a while it seemed as though everything from tornadoes to toadstools and hailstorms to hemlines was being blamed on El Nino.
21_1	0.1111111111111111	Now, it turns out the periodic weather event produced a lot more good than bad.
21_2	0.0	That's the conclusion of climatologist Stanley A.
21_3	1.5294117647058822	Changnon, who calculated that while the 1997-98 El Nino can be blamed for 189 deaths, it also can be credited with preserving 850 lives that would have been lost in normal winter and hurricane seasons.
21_4	0.0	And its $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion in damage is far outweighed by nearly $20 billion in benefits, Changnon reports in the September issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
21_5	0.0	``If you treat it as an economic outcome for the country...
21_6	0.0	most of the country benefited,'' Changnon said.
21_7	1.7333333333333334	True, the El Nino weather phenomenon was blamed for major storms in California and, by some, for deadly tornadoes in Florida and an ice storm in the Northeast.
21_8	0.2727272727272727	But it also produced an exceptionally mild winter in most of the Northern states and blocked Atlantic Coast hurricanes.
21_9	0.0	``I figured, just watching what was happening, that it was going to be a zero-sum game but it turned out far from that,'' Changnon said in a telephone interview from his Mahomet, Ill.

21_11	1.9090909090909092	Michael Glantz, an El Nino expert at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, was skeptical.
21_12	0.0	``It's a noble attempt but I wouldn't take the numbers to the bank,'' he said.
21_13	0.0	``I'm wary of trying to cost out weather events''.
21_14	0.0	In his paper, Changnon admitted there could be up to a 30 percent variation in the costs and benefits cited, but noted that would still produce considerably more benefit than loss.
21_15	0.0	Jim O'Brien, director of the Center for Ocean-Atmosphere Prediction Studies at Florida State University, welcomed Changnon's report.
21_16	2.4444444444444446	``El Nino is a good dude for the United States,'' O'Brien said in a telephone interview.
21_17	0.5833333333333334	``In actuality, La Nina is worse for the United States, there are more hurricanes, there is an increase in tornadoes and they spread over a wider region ...
21_18	0.0	there is drought,'' he said.
21_19	2.3125	El Nino is a periodic warming of the water in the eastern Pacific Ocean, which shifts weather patterns arriving from that area and can affect the climate worldwide.
21_20	1.1	La Nina, an abnormal cooling of the Pacific sea surface, is currently taking place.
21_21	0.0	It, too, can affect the world's weather.
21_22	5.4	La Ninas sometimes occur between El Ninos.
21_23	1.4	According to Changnon, as few as 100 people died in winter cold and storms during the 1997-98 El Nino, well below the average of 850 in recent years.
21_24	0.05555555555555555	Generally mild temperatures ``greatly reduced lives lost to extreme cold,'' Changnon wrote, and there also were fewer weather-related auto accidents and deaths in winter storms.
21_25	1.9166666666666667	``El Nino's influence on the atmosphere led to the elimination of major Atlantic hurricanes during 1997,'' he added.
21_26	0.058823529411764705	That meant no lives lost compared to the average of 20 in recent years and it meant an enormous savings for home and business owners, governments and insurers.
21_27	0.0	The mild temperatures also saved businesses and homeowners millions of dollars they didn't have to spend on heating fuel, Changnon said, though that also can be calculated as a loss for utilities.
21_28	0.0	Lack of demand for heating fuel made oil a glut on the market, resulting in the price of gasoline dropping to as low as 80 cents a gallon in some parts of the country, O'Brien pointed out.
21_29	0.09523809523809523	In addition to the economic benefits of the mild winter, Changnon reported, ``Thousands went out of doors more, millions went shopping, many altered their types of recreation, and almost everyone enjoyed better health than in normal winters''.
21_30	0.0	Glantz raised the ``question of what is a normal year, which no one has defined.
21_31	0.0	No one has calculated to the U.S. the cost of weather in a normal year.
21_32	0.0	Extremes are going on every year,'' he commented.
21_33	0.0	``It's admirable that he tried to put numbers on this stuff,'' Glantz concluded, but ``it's very hard to attribute weather events.''
22_0	1.1428571428571428	Conditions like El Nino might settle in almost permanently if global warming gets bad enough, making climate disruptions such as droughts or excessive winter rain essentially the norm, a computer study suggests.
22_1	0.21052631578947367	That might happen around the year 2050 if nothing is done to control emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, said researcher Mojib Latif of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.
22_2	2.5833333333333335	El Nino is a natural phenomenon that involves a surface warming of the eastern and central Pacific Ocean around the equator.
22_3	0.5	It happens every three to four years on average.
22_4	0.7647058823529411	It can disrupt climate around the world, producing extra rain in the southeastern United States and in Peru during the winter, while causing drought in the western Pacific, for example.
22_5	0.5	The computer simulation suggests that unrestrained global warming could set up the same kind of pattern in ocean surface temperatures, but as a more or less constant condition.
22_6	0.0	Latif and colleagues report their findings in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
22_7	0.0	Essentially, the study suggests that the Pacific would warm more in the east than the west.
22_8	0.0	That's because the western part is already so warm that with further heating it would spawn clouds that provide cooling shade, Latif said.
22_9	0.4	The El-Nino-like temperature pattern might be broken every five years or so by a strong cooling like the periodic phenomenon called La Nina, he added.
22_10	0.0	But Latif said scientists have ``a long way to go'' before they can be sure the study's conclusions are correct.
22_11	0.0	Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
22_12	2.6666666666666665	, agreed it will take more study to understand how global warming might affect El Nino.
22_13	0.375	Studies have disagreed on whether the warming would produce the El-Nino-like Pacific surface temperatures, he said.
23_0	1.411764705882353	JOHANNESBURG, October 18 (Xinhua) --South African weather experts has said that the El Nino weather phenomenon is shaping to hit South Africa stronger than ever before.
23_1	1.75	Long-term forecaster Emsie Klopper said on Thursday that it was clear from current rain patterns that El Nino had arrived.
23_2	0.0	According to the Weather Bureau in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, the cold and rainy weather being experienced in most parts of the summer rainfall region in South Africa was not normal for this time of year.
23_3	0.5	It was an indication that global weather patterns were being disturbed by an El Niono event, the bureau said.
23_4	1.1818181818181819	Mike Edwards, spokesman for the bureau, said the disturbed weather patterns were proof that El Nino was having an effect on South African weather, and that earlier forecasts for dry conditions from November to March were correct.
23_5	1.15	The general El Nino forceast was that in South Africa and other countries in the Southern Hemisphere normal or above-normal rainfall would occur in the first part of the season with a drier spell in the second part of the season.
23_6	1.2352941176470589	The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry said earlier that South Africa was in a better position this year than it was when the previous serious El Nino event struck in 1982/83.
23_7	1.2352941176470589	South Africa's water storage levels at major reservoirs were the best since 1940 and there should be enough water to last through the normal duration of an El Nino event, the department said.
24_0	1.0	GENEVA, November 21 (Xinhua) --The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) held a first follow-up meeting on El Nino here today after a United Nations inter-agency task force on the phenomenon was set up on Wednesday.
24_1	1.380952380952381	The meeting will provide scientific and technical information on the current status of El Nino, as one of the major forces acting on the global climate system and with a potential to affect weather patterns in many areas of the globe.
24_2	1.6153846153846154	According to WMO, strong warm episode (El Nino) conditions have persisted in the tropical Pacific since July 1997.
24_3	0.38461538461538464	Sea surface temperatures throughout the equatorial east-central Pacific increased during April and May, when temperatures normally decrease in this region.
24_4	0.3333333333333333	During August and September, ocean surface temperatures reached near-record levels in many sections of the equatorial Pacific.
24_5	0.75	Departures from normal exceeded +4 degrees Celsius along the Equator east of 120 degrees West, and were greater than +5 degrees Celsius near the Galapagos Islands and along the coast of northern Peru, WMO says in its new publication, El Nino Update.
