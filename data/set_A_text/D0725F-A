0_1	0.062808105	These usually come from the American government rather than their own.
0_2	0.074974552	The biggest shock came in July, when the American Defense Department detected the test-flight of an Iranian rocket called the Shahab-3, whose 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) range could put Israel, and much of Saudi Arabia and Turkey, at risk.
0_3	0.087476505	Some, but not much, reassurance was provided by the later news that the Arrow-2 anti-missile missile, being developed in Israel with American help, had this month intercepted and destroyed a computer-simulated target.
0_4	0.079345577	For defense experts who are wrestling with the technical challenge of ``hitting a bullet with a bullet,'' the Arrow's success offered a ray of hope after a run of disappointments.
0_5	0.074575414	A separate, all-American effort to develop an anti-missile shield for overseas troops and bases --known as THAAD -- has been dogged by technical failures.
0_6	0.062324696	But even the Arrow's most enthusiastic advocates acknowledge that it will not provide Israel with an impenetrable shield.
0_7	0.07259095	And its success has done nothing to cool the tempers of Israeli strategists, arguing hotly about the system's price and purpose.
0_8	0.078194324	Reuven Pedatzur, an Israeli airman turned political scientist, reckons that Arrow will cost many times more than its list price of $1.6 billion, without providing any guarantee against what he says is the real threat of the next decade: the fact that some of the missiles within range of Israel will be nuclear-tipped.
0_9	0.079543835	He argues that instead of bankrupting itself with faulty shields, Israel should, if necessary, ward off the nuclear challenge by making public its own nuclear arsenal --and its willingness to use it.
0_10	0.10378053	Iran's test flight came as a nasty surprise to both America and Israel, indicating that the Iranians were at least a year further forward with developing missiles than hitherto believed.
0_11	0.085680541	Curt Weldon, a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who has championed the need for anti-missile defenses, believes the Shahab-3 may already be operational.
0_12	0.089366894	The previous, cozy assumption of defense experts that some time must elapse between testing and deployment no longer holds good.
0_13	0.082901781	Weldon also believes that as early as next year, Iran will be able to test (and presumably soon deploy) another system, the Shahab-4, with a 2,000-kilometer range that runs deep into Central Europe.
0_14	0.081152151	Yet, even for Israelis, the most troubling recent development in missile proliferation was the news on Aug.
0_15	0.081428905	31 that North Korea had launched a three-stage missile, known as the Taepo Dong, which is apparently capable of reaching the western fringes of Alaska.
0_16	0.096705897	On past experience, whatever rocket technology appears in North Korea will then spread rapidly to Pakistan and Iran.
0_17	0.078437729	There is, of course, no simple correlation between the range of a country's rockets and the fear it arouses.
0_18	0.083878177	For instance, the West is not particularly alarmed, at least for the moment, by the fact that Saudi Arabia has rockets that can go farther than any other in the region.
0_19	0.088386937	Saudi Arabia's missiles were quietly obtained, during the 1980s, from China --which, ironically, may have bought the technology from Israel.
0_20	0.10601639	The states whose arsenals keep western and Israeli security people awake at night are Iran and Iraq.
0_21	0.085609617	Although Iraq is banned under UN sanctions from deploying systems with a range of over 150 kilometers, it may have secretly saved a few of its old rockets from destruction --and might be able to rebuild a medium-range missile capacity fairly rapidly once sanctions are lifted.
0_22	0.093699702	After lobbying vigorously to stem the flow of Russian technology to Iran, Israel appears to have accepted that nothing is likely to stop the Shahab series of missiles from being developed.
0_23	0.079809526	But it stresses the point that other countries besides itself could be in Iran's sights.
0_24	0.094930838	``The threat is not only to us, but to many others in the region,'' said Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, on Sept.
0_25	0.083591275	21. He might have added that Israel is probably not even particularly high on Iran's list of concerns.
0_26	0.086108386	Iran has been impelled into missile-building by memories of its weakness during its war with Iraq in the 1980s, when it was unable to retaliate in kind to the Iraqi missiles that caused panic, and thousands of civilian deaths, among its urban population.
0_27	0.08558854	Its immediate enemy is the Taliban in Afghanistan who have threatened --albeit not all that seriously -- to deploy their Scud missiles against Iran.
0_28	0.14982518	Even so, Iran's defense minister, Adm.
0_29	0.090204537	Ali Shamkhani, is relishing the consternation that the missile test has caused.
0_30	0.092404621	``God willing, this will not be the only time that dedicated and mobilized workers of our defense industry surprise Israel's defense machinery,'' he gloated.
1_0	0.13937397	WASHINGTON _ Iran successfully tested a medium-range missile on Wednesday, a senior administration official said on Wednesday night.
1_1	0.1167776	The weapon, with a range of about 800 miles, is capable of hitting Israel and Saudi Arabia, and of altering the political and military balance of power in the Middle East, he said.
1_2	0.10553147	``This weapon would allow Iran to strike all of Israel, all of Saudi Arabia, most of Turkey and a tip of Russia,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
1_3	0.097811333	Other officials said a U.S. spy satellite had detected the test on Wednesday morning, and that intelligence experts were still poring over data from the launching of the missile, which they believe Iran bought from North Korea.
1_4	0.11446923	The officials are certain that Iran successfully tested the medium-range missile, but could not provide immediate information on the location of the launching site or the area where it landed except to say both were inside Iran's borders.
1_5	0.095957082	A former intelligence official familiar with the spread of such weapons said: ``The major reaction to this is going to be from Israel and we have to worry what action the Israelis will take, because the Israelis clearly view the Iranians as their main threat in the Middle East''.
1_6	0.24784445	Israel is the only nuclear power in the region, and its missiles are believed to be capable of striking any nation in the Middle East.
1_7	0.16378395	Iran is working on developing a nuclear warhead but is believed to be years away from building and testing such a weapon.
1_8	0.13825976	But the United States is not certain of the size or sophistication of its programs to develop weapons of mass destruction.
1_9	0.12134258	The test on Wednesday comes as the United States and Iran have been making cautious overtures toward improving relations, after a long chill.
1_10	0.077420865	Just last month, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright praised President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate who took office last summer and who has confronted considerable resistance from religious and other conservatives.
1_11	0.075173839	But Ms.
1_12	0.11667735	Albright, in a speech devoted to steps for improving relations, also called on Iran to show evidence that it was not trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.
1_13	0.11967646	The Iranian test tells the world about Iran's abilities, but not its intentions, officials said.
1_14	0.090626682	``This is a demonstration of Iran's perceived need to have the capability to threaten targets outside the immediate Persian Gulf area,'' one official said.
1_15	0.073356592	``It's now clear that they have the political commitment to seek that kind of capability''.
1_16	0.12585913	The test ``will not come as a big surprise to the Israelis,'' he said, ``because they've been following Iran's missile program very closely.
1_17	0.086673146	``And they know, and we know, that ability to test-fire a missile and the ability to develop, produce and deploy a large-scale force are two very different things.
1_18	0.075199826	It could take years for Iran to achieve that capability and we have to do our best to retard that''.
1_19	0.089290918	Present and former intelligence officials said the missile came from North Korea, which has vowed to continue selling its weapons to any nation that can provide that cash-starved regime with hard currency.
1_20	0.085756928	The official North Korean news agency issued a statement last month saying that ``our missile export is aimed at obtaining foreign money we need at present''.
1_21	0.093521678	U.S. intelligence officials say millions of dollars that Iran has paid North Korean is invested in more missile production rather than in civilian needs.
1_22	0.12110194	Iran has long sought to launch a medium-range missile, and has bought technology from Russian and China as well as North Korea.
1_23	0.0919287	Tehran's foremost goal, a senior administration official said, is not to strike its enemies but to be seen as a political and military force to be reckoned with in the Middle East.
1_24	0.062569794	``There is some prestige element here,'' he said.
1_25	0.096508369	``We have long thought that the Iranians believe that such a weapon would give them a reach inside the region, and that they believe that it serves their interests in terms of being a strong power in the Middle East''.
1_26	0.10087489	U.S. intelligence agencies have worked for years to track the development of Iran's weapons programs, and have traced shipments of technology from Russia, China and North Korea as well as attempting to learn what local military and technological capability Iran had developed.
1_27	0.091275774	The former intelligence official said that government experts had expected a test by Iran, although the launch was not expected so soon.
1_28	0.078877082	He also said that the test held political significance as well as military meaning.
1_29	0.086913793	``My guess is they purchased a very small number of these missiles, and that this is as much a political statement as anything, and that the statement is to Israel, and that statement is: `You are now vulnerable.
1_30	0.074895434	You have to take us seriously'''.
1_31	0.083954756	But he said he doubted that the Iranians meant to be belligerent toward the Saudis, saying ``They want to co-opt the Saudis, not threaten them''.

1_34	0.086979489	The Iranians have purchased technology for several ballistic missile programs in parallel, buying Russian and Chinese technology as well as North Korean technology, for many years.
1_35	0.094501204	``The important point here is that they have very little indigenous internal capability to make a real missile, and they've required extensive outside technical support,'' this former official said.
1_36	0.10158697	``But they've been willing to spend the money.
1_37	0.093114271	I'd guess the Rodong would cost $10 million,'' referring to the North Korean missile.
1_38	0.12622845	Militarily, Iran's purchase of a handful of the missiles from North Korea does not give Tehran a major war-fighting ability, he said.
1_39	0.071772957	But it proves the Iranians have passed a milestone in military technology.

1_41	0.051598439	But the Rodongs are the attention-getters''.
1_42	0.15913392	Iran has a well-established Scud missile program dating back to the war with Iraq of the 1980s.
1_43	0.088771797	That war, a U.S. intelligence analyst said on Wednesday, ``gave them the experience of using missiles as a weapon of terror, both at receiving and delivering terror''.
1_44	0.093693778	In that war both nations attacked their opponent's major cities with short range missiles and Tehran was all but evacuated at times.
1_45	0.11043499	Iraq's missile capacity has been the subject of a seven-year U.N. effort to eradicate weapons of mass destruction.
1_46	0.11681228	U.S. officials said that they were certain only that Wednesday's missile test was successful, and the missile tested was similar or perhaps identical to the Korean Rodong missile.
1_47	0.075658392	Beyond that, they were struggling on Wednesday night to analyze the meaning of the test.
1_48	0.088772902	``Whether they fired a Rodong missile themselves or whether they assembled a missile by reverse-engineering a Rodong _ either way, this is a North Korean missile with another name''.
1_49	0.018296954	said the senior official.
1_50	0.12331973	The name Iran has give the missile, he said, is the Shahab-3.

2_0	0.086061918	WASHINGTON _ After India and Pakistan, what is next?
2_1	0.12622062	While the Clinton administration tried to stop the nuclear arms race in south Asia, senior officials turned their attention Monday to the next possible nuclear hot spot.
2_2	0.14452137	Officials and independent analysts agree that Iran and Iraq are both scouring international markets for nuclear weapon materials, although Iran, the leader in the competition, appears to be several years away from having devices that work.
2_3	0.13862187	The arms buildup on the Korean peninsula is less of a concern because North Korea, beset by financial problems, has curtailed its nuclear weapons program.
2_4	0.12011486	But the officials in Washington admitted that events of the past three weeks have shown that the United States cannot prevent the rise of other nuclear states.
2_5	0.094804954	A combination of threats and rewards did not stop nuclear tests by India and Pakistan.
2_6	0.12400274	And economic sanctions will not sway Iran, which has no formal relations or trade with the United States.
2_7	0.087644276	Officials at the State Department and other agencies disagreed over the most pressing issue: how to prevent India and Pakistan from turning nuclear devices into completed weapons that can be delivered by missile.
2_8	0.087240868	While some in the administration are calling for the strongest sanctions possible, others argue that India and Pakistan need an incentive to stop their tests and join the community of nations committed to ending nuclear proliferation.
2_9	0.063180918	``We're at a loss over what to do,'' said an official familiar with the discussion.
2_10	0.078980543	``We have to show them that there's another avenue _ economic security instead of nuclear security''.
2_11	0.094517278	The debate has been complicated by federal laws requiring Clinton to impose rigid sanctions on countries that test nuclear devices.
2_12	0.074041551	The sanctions can be lifted only with the consent of both houses of Congress.
2_13	0.082514562	``Unless there are some positive steps that India and Pakistan can take to get out of the sanctions, there's no point in having sanctions,'' said Tom Collina, a director of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington.
2_14	0.086678027	At the same time, the Commerce Department argued Monday against fully applying economic sanctions against Pakistan, which said it conducted six nuclear tests last week.
2_15	0.088812083	The officials warned that the government in Islamabad would retaliate against American companies that are engaged in multi-million-dollar energy projects and other businesses in Pakistan.
