13_0	0.32079829	TEHRAN, November 25 (Xinhua) --Senior Iranian officials on Monday assured Russia that Iran will use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and will pose no harm to any countries.
13_1	0.12435045	The assurance was made by Iranian Majlis (Islamic Consultative Assembly) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri and First Deputy Speaker Hassan Rouhani in their separate meetings with visiting Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeni Adamov.
13_2	0.37878579	It has become clear to the world that Iran, a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and a member of the Nuclear Disarmament Conference, is not after stockpiling nuclear weapons, Nouri said.
13_3	0.29149395	Russia signed a contract with Iran in 1995 to complete the construction of the Bushehr nuclear plant in southern Iran, defying pressures of the United States, which has repeatedly attempted to convince Russia not to cooperate on the project.

13_7	0.19548927	No objection has been made to Israel, which has acquired nuclear weapons but refused to join the international disarmament convention, because of U.S. support for that regime, he noted.

13_10	0.23979507	In his meeting with Adamov, Rouhani said Iran is for a Middle East free of nuclear weapons within the framework of the NPT, expressing the hope that the agreements between the two countries will be implemented.
13_11	0.20097977	Adamov briefed Iranian officials on Russia's measures to complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant.
13_12	0.22946202	Since Russia is sure that Iran will use atomic energy for peaceful purposes, it resists pressures from a third country to cut cooperation with Iran, the Russian minister said.
13_13	0.10157844	Adamov, who arrived here on Saturday, said that Russian political and parliamentary officials are firmly determined to expand multi-faceted cooperation with Iran.
14_0	0.23715027	TEHRAN, July 17 (Xinhua) --Iran and Russia Friday urge all countries concerned to take "practical and urgent measures" to establish a zone free of nuclear arms in the Middle East.
14_1	0.29884548	The call was issued in a joint communique released here after two day talks between Iran and Russia on nuclear weapons, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
14_2	0.18354162	In the communique, the two countries acknowledged that the proliferation of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction constituted threat to international peace and security.
14_3	0.10033075	It said that the establishment of the nuclear-weapon-free zones, particularly in the Middle East, should be encouraged as a top priority.
14_4	0.11762388	The two sides demand the U.N. and other international organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), play a vital role in creating such zones.
14_5	0.11656205	They stressed that a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East region would considerably strengthen peace and security both at both regional and international levels.
14_6	0.15654446	Expressing concern over the existing nuclear facilities in the Middle East, the two sides urged all regional countries, prior to the establishment of a nuclear-free zone, to show thorough restraint and not to develop, produce, or test nuclear devices.
14_7	0.15212316	The communique called for the earliest possible accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of all states that have not signed it, particularly the countries in possession of nuclear facilities not subject to the IAEA safeguards.
14_8	0.19356002	Meanwhile, Tehran and Moscow reaffirmed the inalienable right of states to acquire and develop nuclear energy for peaceful purpose, saying peaceful use of nuclear energy by the NPT states under the IAEA control could not cause damage to any other country.

15_0	0.1559484	The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 24: Iran's test of a missile that can reach Israel, Saudi Arabia and Turkey is a disturbing and dangerous development.
15_1	0.11914689	Testing such an advanced weapons system, potentially capable of carrying biological, chemical and nuclear as well as conventional weapons to targets 800 miles away, heightens anxieties in an already tense Middle East.
15_2	0.10588609	It also raises new doubts about whether Iran, despite the encouraging words of its moderate President, Mohammad Khatami, is actually turning away from threatening its neighbors and from developing weapons of mass destruction, two conditions for improved relations with the United States.
15_3	0.066359136	Islamic conservatives strongly opposed to President Khatami's foreign and domestic policies still wield paramount power in Iran.
15_4	0.057859106	That was further demonstrated by the harsh sentence for corruption and mismanagement imposed Thursday on Tehran's mayor, an important Khatami ally, and the shutting down of the country's most influential pro-Khatami newspaper.

15_13	0.10397638	Syria already has missiles capable of reaching Israel; Iraqi Scuds did so during the gulf war, and now Iran may soon pose a missile threat.
15_14	0.093229642	The immediate dangers facing Israel, however, have not substantially increased, and Israel should not act precipitously.

20_2	0.049312523	The biggest shock came in July, when the American Defense Department detected the test-flight of an Iranian rocket called the Shahab-3, whose 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) range could put Israel, and much of Saudi Arabia and Turkey, at risk.
20_3	0.08142322	Some, but not much, reassurance was provided by the later news that the Arrow-2 anti-missile missile, being developed in Israel with American help, had this month intercepted and destroyed a computer-simulated target.
20_4	0.066515915	For defense experts who are wrestling with the technical challenge of ``hitting a bullet with a bullet,'' the Arrow's success offered a ray of hope after a run of disappointments.

20_7	0.085142761	And its success has done nothing to cool the tempers of Israeli strategists, arguing hotly about the system's price and purpose.
20_8	0.064893986	Reuven Pedatzur, an Israeli airman turned political scientist, reckons that Arrow will cost many times more than its list price of $1.6 billion, without providing any guarantee against what he says is the real threat of the next decade: the fact that some of the missiles within range of Israel will be nuclear-tipped.
20_9	0.055673692	He argues that instead of bankrupting itself with faulty shields, Israel should, if necessary, ward off the nuclear challenge by making public its own nuclear arsenal --and its willingness to use it.
20_10	0.10513972	Iran's test flight came as a nasty surprise to both America and Israel, indicating that the Iranians were at least a year further forward with developing missiles than hitherto believed.
20_11	0.071899523	Curt Weldon, a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who has championed the need for anti-missile defenses, believes the Shahab-3 may already be operational.
