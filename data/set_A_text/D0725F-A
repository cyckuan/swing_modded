13_1	0.085625126	The assurance was made by Iranian Majlis (Islamic Consultative Assembly) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri and First Deputy Speaker Hassan Rouhani in their separate meetings with visiting Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeni Adamov.

14_0	0.1762106	TEHRAN, July 17 (Xinhua) --Iran and Russia Friday urge all countries concerned to take "practical and urgent measures" to establish a zone free of nuclear arms in the Middle East.
14_1	0.21973524	The call was issued in a joint communique released here after two day talks between Iran and Russia on nuclear weapons, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
14_2	0.18811198	In the communique, the two countries acknowledged that the proliferation of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction constituted threat to international peace and security.
14_3	0.11599606	It said that the establishment of the nuclear-weapon-free zones, particularly in the Middle East, should be encouraged as a top priority.
14_4	0.092476638	The two sides demand the U.N. and other international organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), play a vital role in creating such zones.
14_5	0.10232231	They stressed that a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East region would considerably strengthen peace and security both at both regional and international levels.
14_6	0.11497473	Expressing concern over the existing nuclear facilities in the Middle East, the two sides urged all regional countries, prior to the establishment of a nuclear-free zone, to show thorough restraint and not to develop, produce, or test nuclear devices.
14_7	0.11273316	The communique called for the earliest possible accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of all states that have not signed it, particularly the countries in possession of nuclear facilities not subject to the IAEA safeguards.
14_8	0.13992141	Meanwhile, Tehran and Moscow reaffirmed the inalienable right of states to acquire and develop nuclear energy for peaceful purpose, saying peaceful use of nuclear energy by the NPT states under the IAEA control could not cause damage to any other country.

15_0	0.15120769	The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 24: Iran's test of a missile that can reach Israel, Saudi Arabia and Turkey is a disturbing and dangerous development.
15_1	0.10334029	Testing such an advanced weapons system, potentially capable of carrying biological, chemical and nuclear as well as conventional weapons to targets 800 miles away, heightens anxieties in an already tense Middle East.
15_2	0.096971421	It also raises new doubts about whether Iran, despite the encouraging words of its moderate President, Mohammad Khatami, is actually turning away from threatening its neighbors and from developing weapons of mass destruction, two conditions for improved relations with the United States.

15_4	0.076503692	That was further demonstrated by the harsh sentence for corruption and mismanagement imposed Thursday on Tehran's mayor, an important Khatami ally, and the shutting down of the country's most influential pro-Khatami newspaper.

20_2	0.078018887	The biggest shock came in July, when the American Defense Department detected the test-flight of an Iranian rocket called the Shahab-3, whose 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) range could put Israel, and much of Saudi Arabia and Turkey, at risk.
20_3	0.087492244	Some, but not much, reassurance was provided by the later news that the Arrow-2 anti-missile missile, being developed in Israel with American help, had this month intercepted and destroyed a computer-simulated target.

20_8	0.07555526	Reuven Pedatzur, an Israeli airman turned political scientist, reckons that Arrow will cost many times more than its list price of $1.6 billion, without providing any guarantee against what he says is the real threat of the next decade: the fact that some of the missiles within range of Israel will be nuclear-tipped.
20_9	0.078458362	He argues that instead of bankrupting itself with faulty shields, Israel should, if necessary, ward off the nuclear challenge by making public its own nuclear arsenal --and its willingness to use it.
20_10	0.096268674	Iran's test flight came as a nasty surprise to both America and Israel, indicating that the Iranians were at least a year further forward with developing missiles than hitherto believed.
20_11	0.081539049	Curt Weldon, a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who has championed the need for anti-missile defenses, believes the Shahab-3 may already be operational.
