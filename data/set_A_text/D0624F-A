0_0	1.0952380952380953	LONDON _ A long-awaited government report has found London's police force to be ``riven with pernicious and institutionalized racism'' and suggests that chief officers must accept that conclusion as a condition for keeping their commands.
0_1	0.2	The report, which surprised leaders of Britain's non-white communities with its sweep and bluntness, makes 70 recommendations for changes in police practices and social habits ``designed to usher in a fundamental transformation of Britain's race relations''.
0_2	0.0	Sir William Macpherson, a retired High Court justice who was the author of the report and chairman of the eight-month government inquiry, defined institutional racism as ``the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate professional service to people because of their color, culture or ethnic origin'' reflected, he said, in ``processes, attitudes and behavior which amounts to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping''.
0_3	0.12	His report said, ``There must be an unequivocal acceptance of the problem of institutionalized racism and its nature'' and that ``any chief police officer who feels unable to respond will find it extremely difficult to work in harmony and cooperate with the community in the way that policing by consent demands''.
0_4	0.09803921568627451	Among the recommendations were measures making individual officers liable for legal judgments of up to $800,000 for racist behavior, giving the Commission for Racial Equality statutory power to investigate the police, making racist language even in private conversations criminally punishable, changing the national schools curriculum to emphasize cultural diversity and improve race awareness and empowering the Court of Appeal to allow acquitted defendants to be tried anew if compelling new evidence comes to light.
0_5	0.4230769230769231	The judicial recommendation, in effect eliminating protection against ``double jeopardy,'' addresses the case that gave rise to the report, the 1993 killing of Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old Londoner of Jamaican parentage, by five white youths with a history of race baiting.
0_6	0.12	Three of the suspects were acquitted in 1996 in a widely faulted prosecution and cannot be tried again despite the subsequent emergence of a video tape in which they assailed blacks and demonstrated knifing techniques that bore chilling resemblances to the way Lawrence was killed.
0_7	0.19444444444444445	The inquiry into the Lawrence case and racism among the police ended in November after 69 days of hearings over an eight-month period and has taken on dramatic new life this year through a play based entirely on testimony called ``The Color of Justice'' that is playing to sellout audiences in a small West London theater and is moving to the West End in May.
