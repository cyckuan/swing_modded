1_8	0.6521739130434783	Actually, unlike ``GWTW,'' for which Selznick bent over backward to squeeze every inky drop of publicity, ``Star Wars'' was a personal project that flew below media radar for a long time before its release _ as hard as that is to believe _ and that Lucas had to shop around to get made.

1_19	0.38461538461538464	And the rerelease also served as the most successful trailer in history, whetting appetites for the May 19 opening of ``Phantom Menace''.

1_21	1.0714285714285714	The reason that ``Star Wars'' is being blamed for leading to the enshrinement of infantilization in popular culture is that it changed the stakes in a way no one dreamed of before.
1_22	0.7142857142857143	Before ``Star Wars,'' pictures aching for blockbuster status were based on well-publicized books, or spent a lot of money on movie stars and spectacle, in a sweaty-palmed attempt to get audiences away from their TVs.
1_23	1.0	Most major studios had nearly bankrupted themselves trying to produce expensive event films roughly 10 years before ``Star Wars'' was made.
1_24	1.3076923076923077	(The biggest failure, ``Cleopatra,'' was made by 20th Century Fox _ ironically, the studio that became the home of ``Star Wars'' because no one else wanted it).
1_25	0.0	Even ``Jaws'' was an example of filmmakers chasing a hit; the movie was based on a bestselling trash novel that was yellowing on everyone's beach blanket a couple of summers before the picture came out.
1_26	0.0	But ``Jaws'' hit because it crossed over to the young audience that had been avoiding Julie Andrews singing to Rock Hudson (''Darling Lili''), or Clint Eastwood singing to anybody (''Paint Your Wagon'') _ and the youth audience was the first to go see a movie again and again.
1_27	0.8823529411764706	``Star Wars'' had no big-name actors, and science fiction didn't make sense to the World War II generation that was running the film industry.

1_29	0.0	The evidence, based on the middling ratings of ``Star Trek'' _ which would also go on to become a cottage industry (a cottage the size of Belgium) _ was that people wouldn't rouse themselves to watch spaceships roar across the screen.

1_31	1.3636363636363635	``Star Wars'' also proved that, for the first time, a studio wouldn't have to wait a generation for a film to topple the No.

1_33	0.0	It took 35 years, and the arrival of ``Jaws,'' for ``GWTW'' to be removed as box-office champ.
1_34	0.75	But it took less than three years for ``Star Wars'' to unseat ``Jaws,'' and by the end of 1977, ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' was on its way to outdoing ``Star Wars'' in box-office receipts.
1_35	0.7142857142857143	It seems unfair to fault ``Star Wars'' for the laziness of the film industry, for the fact that studios suddenly wanted to find a way to make a science of what was essentially a gamble: finding a manifest-destiny hit.
1_36	0.0625	They'd forgotten that Lucas' film cost tens of millions less than the big-budget blunders featuring stars who had long since outlived their usefulness.
1_37	0.0	(Although Eastwood did go on to much larger success, he never made any money singing in his movies.

1_39	0.5357142857142857	Maybe the most important thing to note about ``Star Wars,'' along with its inclusion of comic-book storytelling elements, Joseph Campbell invocations of mythology and businesslike handling of science fiction (Lucas didn't glorify otherworldly action adventure) is that it was the first big film-generation hit.
1_40	0.6521739130434783	That is, it was the first movie to blow up by quoting other films, such as the procession at the end of ``Star Wars'' echoing Nazi documentarian Leni Riefenstahl's ``Triumph of the Will'' _ complete with the columns of soldiers moving in exactly the same pattern.

7_3	0.0	The answer is yes, but not by much.
7_4	0.9411764705882353	George Lucas, perhaps inevitably drawn back into the ``Star Wars'' gravitational field, has talked a lot about technological razzle-dazzle not being nearly as important as the characters and story.

7_11	0.5333333333333333	In short, there's a lot that's eye-filling in ``The Phantom Menace,'' but not much that's brain-filling, and nobody is going to think of it as soul food.

7_14	1.0526315789473684	Great pains were taken to make the gear in ``Phantom Menace'' look less sleek and evolved than in ``Star Wars,'' a reasonable enough decision since it takes place three decades earlier.

14_0	1.0666666666666667	LOS ANGELES (AP) --Now that a few people have actually seen the new ``Star Wars'' movie in special screenings, the hype has yielded to the buzz.
14_1	0.0	And the buzz is...
14_2	0.25	well, don't expect a masterpiece, just a really good movie with cool special effects.
14_3	0.0	In other words, a certain summer blockbuster.
14_4	1.3076923076923077	``Star Wars: Episode I --The Phantom Menace'' was screened Tuesday night in eight North American cities for movie theater executives, their families, and -- apparently -- a bundle of ``Star Wars'' fans who somehow finagled some of the prized tickets.
14_5	0.0	Almost immediately, early reviews hit cyberspace, followed by the reactions to the reviews, then the reactions to the reactions, along with all manner of claims, counterclaims, insults and soul-searching over the film, which opens nationwide May 19.
14_6	0.2	``Guys, it's a movie''! responded Tom Sherak, distribution head of 20th Century Fox, which is releasing the film for George Lucas.

14_11	0.7083333333333334	In what was titled, ``What I believe to be the FIRST review anywhere on the Internet,'' Ronald Epstein wrote on his Home Theater Forum Web site (www.hometheaterforum.com) that while he was impressed, the movie may not satisfy hard-core ``Star Wars'' fans.
14_12	0.46153846153846156	``It looks like 'Star Wars,' it smells like 'Star Wars' and it feels like 'Star Wars'.
14_13	0.25	However, is it a 'Star Wars' that we are going to walk away satisfied with?
14_14	0.0	Well ...
14_15	0.0	perhaps, but not for everyone,'' Epstein wrote.
14_16	0.04	While the early amateur critics loved the action sequences and most of the effects, including what they found to be an incredible underwater sequence, some reviewers thought the 2-hour-plus movie dragged a bit in places, that it was a little too kid-oriented and that one of the computer-generated characters, Jar Jar Binks, was annoying.
14_17	0.0	Such views, however, were quickly countered by those who, like Jerry Rhoades on Home Theater Forum, found the movie to be ``PHENOMENAL''!!!!

14_23	0.0	But another writer, going by Job21, wasn't as impressed.
14_24	0.0	``It was a dream come true at first but quickly turned into a nightmare,'' Job21 said.
14_25	0.0	That was countered by a fuselage of reaction from fans, many of whom raised doubts about whether Job even saw the movie, pointing out his review noticeably lacked the kinds of details that would suggest he was there.
14_26	0.0	As for the theater operators themselves, they gave their usual tempered thumbs-up --they praised the movie just enough to avoid losing any customers but not so much that Lucas could extract higher fees for showing the film.
14_27	0.07692307692307693	The bottom line, financially, is the early buzz --or for that matter the reactions from the professional critics who see ``Phantom'' Friday night -- won't mean a thing initially, said Paul Dergarabedian, of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations Co.

15_4	0.8421052631578947	The first ``Star Wars'' movie was inspired in part by ``The Hidden Fortress,'' a 1958 film about a warrior's journey by Kurosawa, Japan's most renowned director.
15_5	0.045454545454545456	Fans in Japan were quick to find elements of Japan's feudal warlord culture in the 1977 movie, citing everything from the design of villainous Darth Vader's costume to the samurai-style swordplay, albeit with lightsabers.
