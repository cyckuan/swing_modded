0_2	0.36363636363636365	Department of Housing and Urban Development, shows that a record number of working-poor families -- at least 5.4 million of them -- were paying more than half their income for housing or living in substandard conditions in 1997, the freshest figures available.

2_0	0.2857142857142857	Calling affordable housing a ``glaring need,'' Senator John Kerry is set to announce Tuesday a sweeping legislative proposal calling for the creation of a $2 billion-a-year National Housing Trust Fund.
2_1	0.13043478260869565	The trust, which the Massachusetts Democrat said can be funded by annual revenues of the Federal Housing Administration, would be used to help create rental housing for low- and moderate-income families, and to expand elderly housing and homeownership programs across the nation.
2_2	0.2608695652173913	The trust fund proposal to create affordable housing is the centerpiece of an address Kerry is scheduled to deliver Tuesday night at the 32nd annual dinner of the Citizens' Housing and Planning Association Inc.

2_4	0.0	A spokesman at Kerry's office said the senator, who is the ranking Democrat on the Senate's housing subcommittee, will work to build bipartisan support for the legislation to establish the trust fund, which he expects to introduce at the next session of Congress.
2_5	0.0	``The truth is, housing is the forgotten stepchild in the policy debate at the national level,'' Kerry said in a prepared statement.
2_6	0.0	He said the federal government ``has to begin to again play a more aggressive role in increasing (housing) supply''.
2_7	0.45	During the 1980s, the federal government helped build an average of 128,000 affordable housing units per year, but that number fell to just 53,000 affordable units per year in the 1990s, according to CHAPA.
2_8	0.2916666666666667	Worse, Kerry's office noted, the declining federal commitment has come at a time of soaring rents and real estate prices _ a situation that is especially acute in Massachusetts _ and in the face of a rapidly growing elderly population.
2_9	0.65	In Massachusetts, there are about 130,000 low-income families living in subsidized housing under a variety of programs, with as many as 100,000 families on waiting lists for affordable housing units, officials said.

2_15	0.0	``I think it's a realistic, practical proposal,'' he said.
2_16	0.12	The centerpiece of Kerry's plan calls for creation of a new national housing trust, set up much like the federal highway trust fund, which would take revenues generated by the FHA and reserve them for use exclusively in federal housing initiatives.

2_19	0.0	The money currently goes into the nation's general fund.
2_20	0.3	According to an outline of the proposal, many of the legislative efforts would be directed toward helping local and state governments build affordable housing and boost the rate of homeownership through an array of existing, but underfunded, programs.
2_21	0.2857142857142857	Nicholas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University and a former head of the FHA, said Kerry's proposal was a ``noteworthy'' way of addressing the shortage of affordable housing.
2_22	0.0	``He's trying to find ways to give more resources to this problem.
2_23	0.0	It's a growing problem, and it's not going to go away,'' Retsinas said.
2_24	0.35714285714285715	Under Kerry's proposal, the housing trust fund would be used to expand rental housing for families, preserve and renovate existing affordable housing, and increase subsidized housing and assisted living for elderly, whose numbers are expected to grow dramatically in the next 20 years.
2_25	0.07142857142857142	Kerry is also calling for more aid to low-income and first-time home buyers through a program of tax credits to investors in below-market second mortgages.

4_2	0.07692307692307693	Many of the payments, set years ago, are below current market levels, and increasing them may entice landlords to stay in the program, he said.

5_5	0.07142857142857142	Cuomo said the creation of 90,000 rental vouchers was especially important, because no new Section 8 vouchers have been authorized since 1994.

8_0	0.23809523809523808	WASHINGTON _ Congressional negotiators and the Clinton administration are very close to agreement on legislation that would allow public housing authorities to put more working families into apartments that in recent years have been reserved almost exclusively for the very poor.
8_1	0.7391304347826086	The change has been sought by officials in many cities who contend that large concentrations of extremely poor people in public housing projects have shattered neighborhoods, sapped their commercial vitality and left them devoid of stable families.

8_3	0.21052631578947367	The city's housing authority considers the bill a necessary first step toward creating a marketing strategy designed to encourage higher income families to move into its housing projects.
8_4	0.3888888888888889	The legislation is also expected to give housing authorities greater flexibility in setting rents on the nation's 1.2 million public housing units, authorize mayors in some cities to take over poorly run housing authorities and allow low-income people to use federal housing vouchers to help pay the costs of buying a house.
8_5	0.3181818181818182	The public housing bill has been pressed mainly by congressional Republicans over the opposition of Democrats and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who have said that the Republican bill would leave poor people without housing.

8_7	0.2777777777777778	Cuomo is also on the verge of winning enactment of two other housing measures that are likely to make it easier for congressional Democrats and the Clinton administration to accept the public housing bill.
8_8	0.7857142857142857	One would create about 15,000 new Section 8 housing vouchers, which are federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants.

8_12	0.3157894736842105	Though both of those measures would make relatively small increases in public housing resources, Cuomo contends they are important because the Republican-controlled Congress has perennially talked of cutting housing programs.
8_13	0.0	Lobbyists for housing authorities said the bill also includes a provision sought by several cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago, that would make it easier to demolish aging projects.
8_14	0.0	And housing officials across the country are pushing for the legislation because they contend it will help them bring teachers, municipal workers and other low-income working families into projects.

8_17	0.2727272727272727	New York City has historically had a much more broader mix of income groups in public housing than other large cities, and housing experts say that diversity has helped make the city's projects more livable than elsewhere.
8_18	0.20833333333333334	But New York officials say that federal rules favoring the very poor have caused the percentage of working families in the city's public housing to plummet from half of all tenant households in 1983 to a third today.
8_19	0.0	They contend that if the rules are not changed, the city's projects will become bastions of deep poverty, causing the kinds of problems that plague the nation's most notorious housing systems, like those in Chicago and Baltimore.

8_37	0.29411764705882354	On the thorniest issue, for instance _ how to bring more working families into public housing _ the proposed changes would pare back federal requirements for housing the very poor.
8_38	0.3076923076923077	But the changes would be incremental enough that they probably would not be noticed for years because turnover in most housing authorities is low and waiting lists are long.
8_39	0.0	``You're not going to see any swift changes in composition,'' said Richard Nelson, executive director of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials.
8_40	0.0	Despite the compromises, some advocates for the poor say the housing bill would still hurt very low-income families because it would reduce the number of units available to them.
8_41	0.22727272727272727	``Poor folks would almost never have an opportunity to get into public housing if the current provisions are passed,'' warned Ed Williams, a founder of the New York City Public Housing Resident Alliance, a tenant advocacy group.
8_42	0.20833333333333334	&QL; Current federal rules strictly limit the number of vacant apartments a housing authority can rent to the working poor, defined as families earning more than 50 percent of a region's median annual income.
8_43	0.0	In New York City, the limit is 25 percent.
8_44	0.42857142857142855	The federal government has also required housing authorities to give preference to the homeless, people spending more than half their income on rent, victims of domestic violence and people displaced by government action.
8_45	0.2	Those preferences were suspended last year, but remain on the books.
8_46	0.09090909090909091	The compromise bill is expected to abolish the federal preferences, allow local housing authorities to set their own preferences and increase the number of units available to working families by between 5 and 10 percent a year, negotiators said.
8_47	0.3125	The bill would not change current eligibility rules, under which public housing is available only to people earning less than 80 percent of a region's median income.
8_48	0.13043478260869565	The bill is also expected to include a provision sought by New York City that would let housing authorities set aside more units for higher income families provided they exceeded federal requirements for giving housing vouchers to the very poor.
8_49	0.10526315789473684	Cuomo is also pushing a provision that would require housing authorities to integrate higher income tenants into the lowest income projects, to prevent authorities from segregating the poorest tenants in the worst buildings.
8_50	0.0	Negotiators said the bill will probably repeal a requirement that links rent increases to increases in income, a rule that Republicans say discourages people from working.
8_51	0.0	One of the more contentious unresolved issues involves a proposal by Lazio to allow mayors or county executives to assume direct control of poorly run housing authorities, upon the permission of the housing secretary.
8_52	0.0	Housing officials and Cuomo strongly oppose the idea, and are pushing a plan that would restrict such takeovers to only the most troubled authorities.

8_54	0.0	New York City and other large housing authorities object to the proposal, warning that vicious dogs could terrorize tenants and housing police officers.
8_55	0.0	Negotiators said the bill was likely to leave the issue in the hands of local housing authorities.

12_0	0.5714285714285714	WASHINGTON _ Despite a robust economy, the number of low-income households has steadily increased over the last two decades while the pool of affordable housing has shrunk, according to a study of national housing needs released Monday.
12_1	0.47619047619047616	The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that the number of low-income earners, defined as those making $12,000 or less per year, exceeded the number of low-rent units by a 4.4 million in 1995, the latest year for which data was available.
12_2	0.13333333333333333	The impact of this gap can be seen in schools as parents shuttle between the homes of relatives trying to provide shelter for their children, and in tax bills as local communities try to cope with the social problems that afflict families under such duress, said Helen Dunlap, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
12_3	0.1875	About the only housing program that seems to win new money from Congress is ``the development of prisons,'' said Dunlap, noting that Congress has not approved new housing assistance vouchers for low-income families since 1995, when the Republican Party took control of Congress and cut additional housing assistance vouchers from the federal budget.
12_4	0.6666666666666666	The Clinton administration has sought to increase the supply of affordable housing units, requesting 103,000 new rental assistance vouchers in the 1999 budget.

16_4	0.25	Cuomo said that low-income housing was becoming less available because ``it is getting old, it is coming out of service, it is being knocked down''.
16_5	0.4444444444444444	Cuomo said that the housing difficulties for the working poor were caused by several factors, including the rising economy itself.
16_6	0.0625	In the past, building owners accepted low-income tenants whose rent was paid from their own earnings and from a government voucher program known as Section 8.
16_7	0.0	But because of the nation's rising prosperity, Cuomo said, many property owners have found that higher-income tenants have bid up the prices of the apartments beyond the poorer tenants' abilities to pay, even with the subsidies.
16_8	0.06666666666666667	Another reason, Cuomo said, was that Congress refused to approve additional Section 8 housing from 1995 through 1998, ``when we went out of the housing business''.

18_0	0.6875	WASHINGTON _ While the United States is enjoying continuing prosperity, many of the working poor have become worse off because affordable housing is harder for them to find, a federal report said Monday.
18_1	0.32142857142857145	The report, issued by Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, said that 5.4 million low-income families pay more than half their incomes for housing or live in dilapidated units, an increase of 12 percent since the economic expansion began in 1991.
18_2	0.5	``This is the highest need for affordable housing since we have been taking numbers,'' Cuomo said at a news conference at his department's headquarters.
18_3	0.25	Cuomo said that low-income housing was becoming less available because ``it is getting old, it is coming out of service, it is being knocked down''.
18_4	0.4444444444444444	Cuomo said that the housing difficulties for the working poor were caused by several factors, including the rising economy itself.
18_5	0.0625	In the past, building owners accepted low-income tenants whose rent was paid from their own earnings and from a government voucher program known as Section 8.
18_6	0.0	But because of the nation's rising prosperity, Cuomo said, many property owners have found that higher-income tenants have bid up the prices of the apartments beyond the poorer tenants' abilities to pay, even with the subsidies.
18_7	0.06666666666666667	Another reason, Cuomo said, was that Congress refused to approve additional Section 8 housing from 1995 through 1998, ``when we went out of the housing business''.
18_8	0.0	He blamed the Republicans in Congress for the lack of new Section 8 units, saying, ``We had proposals in the tens of thousands for every year, and Congress said zero''.

18_11	0.12	, acknowledged that no new vouchers had been approved by Congress in a four-year period, but he said that there were good reasons for that. A cause of Republican objections, he said, was a ``take one, take all'' provision that required landlords who accepted any families with housing vouchers to accept all families with them .
19_0	0.0	WASHINGTON _ A study of American cities by the Clinton administration says the strong national economy has left most of them in their best financial shape in decades.
19_1	0.0	But the report, ``The State of the Cities 1998,'' also finds that the nation's urban centers are still suffering from chronic problems afflicting the poor _ unemployment, inadequate housing and substandard education _ that could grow worse over the next five years as hundreds of thousands of city residents move off welfare.
19_2	0.0	To help the welfare recipients as well as the low-income wage earners they will be competing with for employment, the administration has asked Congress to approve an array of new and expanded programs as part of the 1999 fiscal year budget for what the White House calls ``the most wide-ranging budget for cities in more than a decade''.
19_3	0.1	The largest part of the request comes from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is seeking $1.8 billion in new spending beyond the appropriation of $24 billion it has received in each of the last five years.

19_7	0.0	While Congress is projecting a budget surplus of as much as $100 billion for 1999, it will not be easy for the administration to get additional money for new programs.
19_8	0.0	Among other reasons, Republicans in both houses are eager to use some of the surplus to cut taxes.
19_9	0.038461538461538464	One congressional aide familiar with the housing budget negotiations that are now under way predicted that Congress would likely authorize new spending for core programs, like additional vouchers to allow inner-city residents to live closer to jobs or transportation lines.

19_15	0.0	But those gains pale beside job growth in suburban areas, the report says, a disparity that triggers a domino effect of adverse consequences for cities.
19_16	0.0	As urban problems like crime and poor schools steadily persuade many middle-class residents to leave for the suburbs, commercial investment follows, draining cities of their job base and tax base.
19_17	0.0	The report contends that the people who are hurt most are the lowest-wage earners, who have fewer job opportunities and, often, no practical means of transportation to reach jobs in the suburbs.
19_18	0.0	The report contends that over the next five years, their ranks will increase by 353,000 as current welfare recipients join the search for work.
19_19	0.0	Citing a recent study of 74 urban areas by the conference of mayors, the administration's report says that employers are likely to find at least two applicants for the same low-paying job over the next five years, and some cities, like Cleveland; Newark, N.J., and Providence, R.I., are projecting 10 or more more.
19_20	0.15151515151515152	The administration's budget request seeks to aid those people with a holistic economic approach, using urban programs that would stimulate job growth, improve public schools and educational programs and create 100,000 new vouchers for low-income city residents so they can move closer to higher-paying jobs.

21_6	0.3684210526315789	A major part of the problem, say housing advocates and policymakers, is that wage increases have failed to keep up with steep increases in apartment and home rental rates in Massachusetts.

21_16	0.15789473684210525	The study also found that while minority home buying has helped to push the state's homeownership rate to about 62.3 percent, minority mortgage applicants still face rampant discrimination.

24_0	0.5714285714285714	Washington _ Despite a robust economy, the number of low-income households has steadily increased over the last two decades as the pool of affordable housing has shrunk, according to a study of national housing needs released Monday.
24_1	0.3333333333333333	The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that the number of low-income earners, defined as those making $12,000 per year or less, exceeded the number of low-rent units by a 4.4-million margin in 1995, the latest year for which data was available.
24_2	0.13333333333333333	The impact of this gap can be seen in schools as parents shuttle between the homes of relatives trying to provide shelter for their children and in tax bills as local communities try to cope with the social problems that afflict families under such stress, said Helen Dunlap, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
24_3	0.2	About the only housing program that seems to win new money from Congress is ``the development of prisons,'' said Dunlap, noting that Congress has not approved new housing assistance vouchers for low-income families since 1995 when Republicans took over Congress and cut additional housing assistance vouchers from the federal budget.
24_4	0.25	The Clinton Administration has requested 103,000 new rental assistance vouchers in the 1999 budget.
24_5	0.0	But it is far from certain if Congress will approve such a measure.

24_9	0.1	But critics of the rental voucher program say the federal government should not be in the housing business.
24_10	0.0	``This notion that the federal government owes everyone a house reminds me of Russia,'' said Edward Hudgins, director of regulatory studies at the Cato Institute, a conservative Washington D.C. think tank.
24_11	0.0	``I would get the federal government out of the housing business.

24_16	0.0	``Replacing failed programs with programs that work and that serve more people is the answer,'' said Lazio, who is House Speaker Newt Gingrich's point person on housing issues.

24_23	0.6	_ About three-fifths of all poor renters spent more than half of their income on rent and utilities in 1995.
24_24	0.6923076923076923	_ About 78 percent of working poor renters with children spent more than 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities.
