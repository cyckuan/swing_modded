0_0	0.55354258	NEW YORK (AP) --In a major step toward resolving health claims against the diet drug combination fen-phen, drug maker American Home Products said just 1 percent of the drug's users have opted out of a multibillion dollar settlement.
0_1	0.33416891	Nearly 6 million people took fen-phen before it was pulled from the market in 1997 due to links with serious heart problems, but just 45,000 of them have elected to refuse the $3.75 billion settlement, American Home said Thursday, adding it has decided to go ahead with the deal.

0_8	0.14116131	So far more than 9,000 suits have been filed against American Home by fen-phen users, imposing a major obstacle for the company as it tries to win back trust of investors who have seen its stock drop because of the litigation and problems with other medicines.

0_16	1.1480015	In September 1997, the drugs were removed from the market after a Mayo Clinic study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage.

0_21	0.13898387	The company said most of those who opted out of the deal aren't sick.
0_22	0.15695065	Most of the opt-outs have yet to sue American Home, raising the prospect of thousands of new suits.
0_23	0.087783551	However, the company showed little concern about this.
0_24	0.088500975	''Experience with litigation of these types suggests that such opt outs have generally weaker claims and also may be subject to statute of limitations defenses,'' American Home said in a statement.

2_2	0.30188593	American Home Products moved to settle the cases after a Mississippi jury had awarded $150 million in compensatory damages to five plaintiffs, four of whom said the drugs had caused them to develop primary pulmonary hypertension, an often fatal lung illness.
2_3	0.16476036	The Mississippi settlement touched off debate among analysts Wednesday as to whether American Home Products' merger with Warner-Lambert would be completed.
2_4	0.1953492	Pfizer has made an $82.4 hostile bid for Warner-Lambert and has shown little mercy in pointing out American Home Products' weaknesses, including the company's lingering liabilities involving fen-phen.
2_5	0.17469829	Based on Wednesday's closing stock price, Pfizer's offer for Warner-Lambert was valued at $72.4 billion, while American Home Products' bid was $51.1 billion.

2_7	0.075037476	But Pfizer wasted little time in questioning the wisdom of such a deal.

2_17	0.10607626	It's just one more reason Warner-Lambert should not merge with American Home''.
2_18	0.22645388	Analysts have expressed concern that American Home Products has yet to put its fen-phen liabilities behind it.
2_19	0.53915813	Since Pondimin, American Home Products' brand name for fenfluramine _ the ``fen'' in fen-phen _ and Redux, a similar drug, were removed from the market in September 1997, 6,500 lawsuits covering 11,000 people have been filed.
2_20	0.68772355	American Home Products agreed in October to pay $3.75 billion to settle claims that the diet drugs had been harmful.
2_21	0.098740725	Many analysts applauded the national agreement, but others thought that it did not do enough to limit the company's liabilities.
2_22	0.13508858	The agreement, which has yet to receive final approval from a federal judge, did not include primary pulmonary hypertension cases and does not prevent fen-phen users from taking their cases to court.
2_23	0.095016662	Some plaintiffs' lawyers said Wednesday that after the Mississippi jury verdict, many fen-phen sufferers would choose to pursue their claims in court.
2_24	0.16169101	``In my view, American Home Products' global settlement is now dead,'' said Ed Blizzard, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Houston who is involved in many fen-phen cases.

2_27	0.18726732	Even though American Home Products moved quickly to settle the claims, the company told analysts Wednesday that the legal environment in Mississippi was anything but ordinary.
2_28	0.15911204	American Home Products noted in a release Wednesday that even though Jefferson County, the site of the fen-phen case, had only 8,500 residents, the Circuit Court there had liability claims pending from more than 10,000 plaintiffs.
2_29	0.16611015	About 500 of the fen-phen cases filed in Mississippi were from plaintiffs who lived elsewhere, including places as far away as Maine and Hawaii, American Home Products said.
2_30	0.16690732	Louis Hoynes, American Home Products' general counsel, also told analysts that the settlement amount, which was confidential, was substantially less than $500 million, which had been cited in earlier news reports.
2_31	0.099610701	Analysts said Wednesday that the total payout for the Mississippi cases was estimated at $350 million.
2_32	0.15509289	It was unclear, though, just how many of the fen-phen plaintiffs would pursue their own cases or join the national settlement.
2_33	0.089941685	After the national agreement had been signed, many lawyers had said that it would allow many sufferers to receive a monetary award faster than if they were to go to court.
2_34	0.090077367	``Even with the Mississippi settlement, the national agreement will still go forward,'' said Stanley Chesley, a partner with Waite, Schneider, Bayless &AMP; Chesley in Cincinnati, one of the chief negotiators of the national agreement.
