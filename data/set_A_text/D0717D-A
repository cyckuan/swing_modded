0_0	0.55312222	NEW YORK (AP) --In a major step toward resolving health claims against the diet drug combination fen-phen, drug maker American Home Products said just 1 percent of the drug's users have opted out of a multibillion dollar settlement.
0_1	0.3850064	Nearly 6 million people took fen-phen before it was pulled from the market in 1997 due to links with serious heart problems, but just 45,000 of them have elected to refuse the $3.75 billion settlement, American Home said Thursday, adding it has decided to go ahead with the deal.

2_2	0.38451506	American Home Products moved to settle the cases after a Mississippi jury had awarded $150 million in compensatory damages to five plaintiffs, four of whom said the drugs had caused them to develop primary pulmonary hypertension, an often fatal lung illness.
2_3	0.17184347	The Mississippi settlement touched off debate among analysts Wednesday as to whether American Home Products' merger with Warner-Lambert would be completed.
2_4	0.25498716	Pfizer has made an $82.4 hostile bid for Warner-Lambert and has shown little mercy in pointing out American Home Products' weaknesses, including the company's lingering liabilities involving fen-phen.

2_18	0.16144488	Analysts have expressed concern that American Home Products has yet to put its fen-phen liabilities behind it.
2_19	0.55875444	Since Pondimin, American Home Products' brand name for fenfluramine _ the ``fen'' in fen-phen _ and Redux, a similar drug, were removed from the market in September 1997, 6,500 lawsuits covering 11,000 people have been filed.
2_20	0.56181662	American Home Products agreed in October to pay $3.75 billion to settle claims that the diet drugs had been harmful.
2_21	0.099652338	Many analysts applauded the national agreement, but others thought that it did not do enough to limit the company's liabilities.
2_22	0.15690668	The agreement, which has yet to receive final approval from a federal judge, did not include primary pulmonary hypertension cases and does not prevent fen-phen users from taking their cases to court.
2_23	0.095228334	Some plaintiffs' lawyers said Wednesday that after the Mississippi jury verdict, many fen-phen sufferers would choose to pursue their claims in court.

2_27	0.22200799	Even though American Home Products moved quickly to settle the claims, the company told analysts Wednesday that the legal environment in Mississippi was anything but ordinary.
2_28	0.1910075	American Home Products noted in a release Wednesday that even though Jefferson County, the site of the fen-phen case, had only 8,500 residents, the Circuit Court there had liability claims pending from more than 10,000 plaintiffs.

2_30	0.19701628	Louis Hoynes, American Home Products' general counsel, also told analysts that the settlement amount, which was confidential, was substantially less than $500 million, which had been cited in earlier news reports.
2_31	0.10056721	Analysts said Wednesday that the total payout for the Mississippi cases was estimated at $350 million.
2_32	0.11050384	It was unclear, though, just how many of the fen-phen plaintiffs would pursue their own cases or join the national settlement.
2_33	0.095474625	After the national agreement had been signed, many lawyers had said that it would allow many sufferers to receive a monetary award faster than if they were to go to court.
2_34	0.10272592	``Even with the Mississippi settlement, the national agreement will still go forward,'' said Stanley Chesley, a partner with Waite, Schneider, Bayless &AMP; Chesley in Cincinnati, one of the chief negotiators of the national agreement.
