8_0	0.1441284	HOUSTON _ The nation's first fen-phen wrongful death trial ended in Harris County state district court Tuesday with a reported settlement of $6 million to $7 million, and most jurors said afterward they would not have awarded the plaintiffs any money at all.
8_1	0.20491069	``We feel we did the best we could for the kids,'' said Sandra Stom of Friendswood, Texas, whose daughter Mary Marisa Smith, 35, died in September 1997 of complications from a rare lung disease, allegedly caused by the ``fen'' part of the diet drug combination.

8_3	0.085492817	Other plaintiffs were Smith's husband, Michael, and father, Michael Stom.
8_4	0.093276816	Attorneys involved would not discuss the settlement, which is supposed to be confidential.
8_5	0.13077563	Lawyers said two other Harris County fen-phen cases, which did not involve deaths, also settled for confidential amounts Tuesday.
8_6	0.12278446	A source who asked to remain anonymous said the Smith settlement was between $6 million and $7 million, and the three settlements were $7.5 million to $8 million.
8_7	0.18665672	The Smith case was closely watched because it could shed light on whether juries will blame American Home Products of Madison, N.J., for contributing to the death or injury of fen-phen patients.
8_8	0.35228895	About 6 million people took one form of the two types of fen drugs the company sold.

8_13	0.080578329	Company lawyers said they felt vindicated by a poll the 12 jurors and one alternate took privately after being excused by state District Judge Katie Kennedy.
8_14	0.12056437	Several jurors said that there were eight votes for American Home, three for the plaintiffs and two undecided.
8_15	0.080185953	``I'm a scientist, and I was leaning for the defense because of the science,'' said juror Dave Sawicki of Houston, 47, who works in oil and gas.
8_16	0.093514785	``There were a lot of emotional adjectives and adverbs during the trial, but I kept looking at the risk of the disease, and it was rare.

8_18	0.089533039	Juror Gaetne Pauwels, who cried during testimony describing Smith's death and the children's suffering, said she felt ``exactly the opposite''.

8_22	0.088986299	Defense attorney Paul Stallings said he found the straw vote ``interesting'' because the defense was only into its second day and the plaintiffs had two weeks to present their evidence.
8_23	0.086928649	He said the straw vote will have no bearing on what the company does in other cases.
8_24	0.096201927	Plaintiffs' attorney Graham Hill said he was surprised by the straw vote.
8_25	0.063442438	He said the outcome would have been different after jurors deliberated.
8_26	0.09088157	Hill said that before the settlement was reached, Kennedy had allowed into evidence a memo written by a top FDA official saying the company had manipulated the agency, reversing her prior ruling keeping it out.
8_27	0.11164017	The judge, he said, also allowed evidence that the company threatened to sue a pharmacy that tried to warn customers about the drug's possible risks with a boxed warning on its pharmacy envelopes.
8_28	0.16474878	A top American Home official testified Monday that the risks of the fen drug that Smith took outweighed the benefits if taken longer than three months.
8_29	0.041114186	Smith took it for year.
8_30	0.14016461	No jury has yet deliberated on a fen-phen case, and the Smith case was the furthest any such case has progressed.

8_34	0.1602491	Smith, who weighed about 270 pounds, took the drug fenfluramine, brand named Pondimin, and phentermine for about a year and lost 70 pounds.
8_35	0.082627962	Her prescribing doctor, Leo Borrell, was also sued, but he was dismissed by the plaintiffs last week.
8_36	0.099198708	Smith died of a blood infection caused by a catheter used to pump in a drug to widen her pulmonary blood vessels, which the suit said had become constricted by Pondimin.
8_37	0.21374202	Plaintiffs' attorneys have said that about 5 percent of the fen-phen cases involve similar constrictions, called primary pulmonary hypertension.
8_38	0.12820679	Most of the fen-phen cases allege heart-valve leakage problems, while others claim ``neurotoxicity,'' which has various symptoms, such as fatigue and headaches.
8_39	0.11799657	A 1996 European study said long-term users of prescription diet drugs had a 23-fold greater risk than the general public of incurring primary pulmonary hypertension.
8_40	0.14217935	But even for long-term diet drug users, the annual risk was low, estimated to be 23 to 46 per million users, and there is no widely accepted biological mechanism linking the drugs to the disease.
8_41	0.55204484	The two fen drugs sold by American Home Products were Pondimin and Redux, or dexfenfluramine.
8_42	0.2049515	Smith's attorneys claimed that for much of the early 1990s, American Home Products greatly underreported the associations of Pondimin with primary pulmonary hypertension to get FDA approval of Redux in 1996.
8_43	0.20309874	Until 1997, Pondimin's label said the drug had been associated with four cases of the disease and one death.
8_44	0.081169306	Company officials testified that they were aware of at least five associations as of 1991 and 62 associations and 11 deaths in 1996.
8_45	0.098047475	In the trial, company officials conceded the label was inaccurate, but said the FDA knew about all the reported associations and had never demanded it be changed.
8_46	0.13059595	They said part of the reason they did not change it was that they were awaiting the results of the European study.
8_47	0.096096648	Plaintiffs' attorneys also tried to show the company sought to avoid the most serious type of warning label, bordered by black boxes, because it would drastically cut sales.
8_48	0.12536422	Company officials said the boldfaced warning that was used was adequate and approved by the FDA, which had determined that the drugs' benefits outweighed the risks.

15_0	0.29477587	NEW YORK --American Home Products, already facing thousands of lawsuits related to its once popular diet drugs, was sued on Monday by its marketing partner Interneuron Pharmaceuticals for allegedly concealing the health risks of the pills.
15_1	0.33737593	Lexington, Mass.-based Interneuron is seeking unspecified damages against American Home in the suit filed in the Superior Court of Massachusetts.
15_2	0.27451351	In the complaint, Interneuron accuses American Home of deliberately concealing information regarding possible health risks associated with the use of "fen-phen," a combination of the anti-obesity drugs Pondimin (fenfluramine) and phentermine.
15_3	0.15345104	Interneuron said the information was vital to help it assess the safety of Redux, a chemical cousin of Pondimin, which was developed by Interneuron and marketed by AHP.
15_4	0.16035001	American Home's failure to disclose the safety risks from February 1997 through June 1997 prevented Interneuron from taking action, including possibly moving to take Redux off the market earlier, it said.

15_22	0.24176978	Because of the chemical similarity between Pondimin and Redux, American Home should have immediately alerted Interneuron of the information, the complaint said.

15_24	0.29243324	American Home withheld the data on the Mayo study because it feared the results would have on the diet drugs' sales, the lawsuit said.
