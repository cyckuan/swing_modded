3_2	0.28621465	Kennedy Jr.'s powerful single-engine aircraft plummeted toward the Atlantic Ocean at 4,700 feet per minute in the seconds before the fatal crash that killed him, his wife and her sister, federal officials said Monday.
3_3	0.18143474	Although officials with the National Transportation Safety Board were coy about characterizing the descent rate, it was far faster than first believed and other pilots said that it would have been virtually impossible for Kennedy to have pulled his Piper Saratoga II HP out of such a freefall.

3_5	0.092662623	``The normal rate of descent you're shooting for as a pilot is 500 to 700 feet per minute for passenger comfort''.
3_6	0.19053106	NTSB officials released more information Monday from additional radar data received from a Nantucket airport that showed Kennedy's plane dropped 1,100 feet in only 14 seconds on that hazy Friday night as the plane flew about four miles southwest of Martha's Vineyard on its final approach to the island's airport.
3_7	0.12572662	Robert Pearce, the NTSB's chief investigator in the case, said the new numbers paint ``a different picture'' for investigators, but he and others with the NTSB declined to characterize the plane's rapid descent as being out of control.

3_9	0.13576229	Although investigators believe they have several promising sites within the 24-square-mile ``target area'' off the Martha's Vineyard coast, a team of 10 divers from the Massachusetts State Police were unable to find the main portion of the wreckage.

3_20	0.12700247	Based on those interviews and on the few maintenance records investigators have reviewed, there appears to have been no obvious mechanical problems with the plane, which Kennedy bought for a reported $300,000 only three months ago.
3_21	0.24516893	Pearce said witnesses led investigators to believe most of the plane's maintenance records were on board at the time of the crash.
3_22	0.13948144	However, an annual inspection of the 1996 model plane was conducted June 28 and showed that the plane had logged only 622 flight hours since its manufacture.

3_24	0.11540634	Pearce said there were no indications that the plane had been flown between that refueling and Friday's fatal crash.
3_25	0.14012932	Pearce also noted that the plane's magnetic compass was readjusted two days later.
3_26	0.095973082	Because no witnesses have reported seeing or hearing the plane anywhere along its flight path after its takeoff at 7:38 p.m.
3_27	0.115845	EDT, investigators are unable to determine what type of trouble Kennedy may have had.
3_28	0.25728252	NTSB officials also confirmed Monday that Kennedy's plane was equipped with a relatively new voice recorder.
3_29	0.16708471	Pearce said the recorder appears to have been the type that records the last radio transmissions made from the plane, although it was unknown if Kennedy, a novice pilot, was familiar with the equipment.

6_18	0.30810456	The National Transportation Safety Board determined the cause of the crash was pilot error and said Kennedy likely became disoriented in the night sky.

7_2	0.23357007	, hobbled by a broken foot, limped to the flight line of a small airport in Fairfield, N.J. to inspect his Piper Saratoga HP airplane.
7_3	0.26655034	Satisfied with the plane's condition, Kennedy eased himself into the left pilot's seat and prepared for the routine 125-mile flight to an airport near his late mother's homestead on Martha's Vineyard.
7_4	0.89230569	His wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her older sister, Lauren Bessette, climbed aboard the six-seat plane.

7_8	0.077165492	No one has seen it since.
7_9	0.099973842	Although his trip to Massachusetts was routine, the series of decisions Kennedy made that night _ flying a complex aircraft without a flight plan, choosing not to have his flight instructor accompany him in marginal weather conditions, and piloting an airplane with a foot injury _ have grown in significance against the backdrop of a massive search-and-rescue operation under way just off Aquinnah, Mass.
7_10	0.098831769	The Piper Saratoga vanished from radar screens after a rapid descent at 9:38 p.m.
7_11	0.20303617	Friday, about an hour into his flight and about 17 miles away from Martha's Vineyard airport.
7_12	0.083196144	Sunday, searchers recovered bits of the aircraft's fuselage and interior; on Saturday, they had found a wheel strut and a piece of canvas luggage with one of Lauren Bissette's business cards attached.
7_13	0.13718351	While Kennedy had not mastered all the intricacies of the plane's equipment, officials hope he was familiar with at least one: the cockpit voice recording equipment that had been installed in the Saratoga by its first owner in 1997.
7_14	0.11238919	``It was an easy on-off switch,'' said Munir Hussein, its second owner, who sold the plane to Kennedy through a broker in April for $300,000.
7_15	0.075747342	``I used it several times and it worked perfectly''.
7_16	0.10313068	Investigators say the recorder, which captures the words of a pilot uttered both on the radio and within the cockpit, can shed light on what could have caused the plane to dive 700 feet in 29 seconds and apparently plunge into the Atlantic Ocean just off Aquinnah, known as Gay Head.
7_17	0.13847371	The details of what happened in the hour before Kennedy's plane disappeared may not be known until _ or unless _ the aircraft is recovered.
7_18	0.099549691	But investigators do know the flight seemed routine until the very end, according to the review of radar tapes from at least a half-dozen Federal Aviation Adminsitration facilities along the south coast of New England.
7_19	0.099912094	Kennedy had intended to make a daytime flight Friday, but was delayed when his sister-in-law couldn't leave work early enough, and he encountered traffic coming out of New York, the Associated Press quoted a friend as saying.
7_20	0.14670053	But family friends told the Globe they believed Kennedy had planned to leave when he did.
7_21	0.11305532	After takeoff, Kennedy cruised eastward, flying at 5,500 feet, a standard altitude for a plane flying east under visual flight rules, procedures that govern pilots who are qualified only to fly by what they can see.
7_22	0.084953832	As he flew through gathering darkness, only a few stars emerged through the haze, and a slim crescent moon glowed in the night sky.
7_23	0.13281476	Two other pilots familiar with Kennedy's flight experience _ fewer than 100 hours of time alone _ shook their heads as his plane lifted off.
7_24	0.13143482	They knew that Kennedy was learning to fly the Saratoga by instruments alone, but that he wasn't yet qualified to do it on a solo flight.
7_25	0.11031461	In fact, Kennedy told a business associate in Canada last Monday that for the time being, he'd rather fly with a copilot because his broken foot made it difficult for him to operate pedals controlling the plane's rudder.
7_26	0.17139935	Radar stations along the southern New England coast tracked the plane.
7_27	0.1384855	But because Kennedy chose not to file an official flight plan, and had no contact with air-traffic controllers after leaving New Jersey, no one knew his precise route _ or that he was piloting the airplane.
7_28	0.21111008	Warren Morningstar, a private pilot and spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, said it was not unusual for a pilot to fly without filing a plan.
7_29	0.096385426	Still, Morningstar said, ``a flight plan is really an insurance policy, not an air traffic control document''.
7_30	0.097930452	``Would a VFR flight plan have started search and rescue earlier''? he said.
7_31	0.078813033	``Yes, it probably would have''.
7_32	0.10029406	But for most of Kennedy's flight, everything went smoothly.
7_33	0.18174609	At 9:39, nearly an hour after it had taken off from New Jersey, Kennedy's plane was about 10 minutes away from the Martha's Vineyard airport when it began a sudden and steady descent.
7_34	0.1601226	Over the next 29 seconds, the plane dropped 700 feet.
7_35	0.08223198	It then disappeared from all radar screens.
7_36	0.36742345	Investigators said Sunday that the air controllers at the Martha's Vineyard airport did not realize that Kennedy's plane was overdue until sometime Saturday morning.
7_37	0.20902604	The air-traffic controller at Martha's Vineyard airport was scheduled to leave at 10 p.m.
7_38	0.087696648	Friday, and the airport's runway lights were dimmed.

7_42	0.096523182	``We had a plot on him, we were able to determine which plane was his and he was flying at 5,500 feet,'' said Howard Barte, the controller's union local president in Rhode Island.
7_43	0.11156846	``He came within 17 miles west of Martha's Vineyard, and then in the last few minutes he seemed to descend rather steeply for that airplane.
7_44	0.085639336	The last hit was at 1,800 feet and then we lost contact.
7_45	0.11989526	``It was just over the last couple of minutes of the flight that this happened,'' Barte said.
7_46	0.12013655	``Maybe in five more minutes he would have contacted the Martha's Vineyard tower and begun his descent, but this rate of descent was not normal.
7_47	0.13836724	``When you see something like this, you have to ask: Was there something wrong with the plane, or with the pilot?

8_4	0.19350087	Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board's investigation continues.
8_5	0.13842766	One source close to the probe said that all the wreckage of the Piper Saratoga HP II had been brought up, including the crumbled fuselage and the cockpit panel.
8_6	0.12204895	The panel, which contains the flight instruments, including plane's air-speed indicator and attitude indicator, could provide a wealth of information on the plane's performance at the moment it hit the water.
8_7	0.12964316	All three victims were probably alive when the plane hit, but died instantaneously, according to the report of Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner Richard J.
8_8	0.07646644	Evans. After an examination that occurred sometime within a four-hour period, Evans reported that all of them died from ``multiple traumatic injuries''.
8_9	0.11867308	But investigators would not comment further on the condition of the bodies or the details of coroner's report.
8_10	0.13926538	And they would not say whether their study yielded insight into the biggest lingering question: Why Kennedy lost control of his plane the night of July 16.
8_11	0.10185536	The autopsy of a pilot or a passenger in a plane crash is usually less complex than that of a murder victim, experts in forensic pathology said Thursday.
8_12	0.14575879	The cause of death is generally known, and the bodies often don't lead investigators closer to the cause of the wreck.
8_13	0.12312635	Still, the autopsies in the Kennedy case were performed especially quickly, pathologists said.
8_14	0.10709258	The remains were taken to a Bourne hospital at about 7:15 p.m. on Wednesday night, and released to the victims' families at 11 p.m., according to the medical examiner's office and the Cape &AMP; Islands District Attorney's office.
8_15	0.081583338	Many jurisdictions refuse to perform autopsies at night, said Robert Kirschner, a former deputy chief medical examiner for Cook County, Ill.
8_16	0.085340715	The haste in this case, he said, could lead to questions about the investigation's thoroughness.
8_17	0.083234255	In a high-profile case, he said, the pressures are high, and so are the risks of carelessness.
8_18	0.21981503	He pointed to other ``autopsies associated with the Kennedy family'' _ the botched investigation that followed President John F.
8_19	0.15709146	Kennedy's assassination, and the questions surrounding the death of Mary Jo Kopechne 30 years ago, in the Martha's Vineyard car crash that has come to be known as Chappaquiddick.
8_20	0.094137982	``You can't let. . .those kinds of pressures alter your routines,'' he said.
8_21	0.10358952	``If you alter your procedure and do things differently, then you're always going to run into problems''.
8_22	0.088341826	Still, Jay Dix, chief medical examiner for several Missouri counties, said autopsies can usually be completed anywhere from 45 minutes to several hours, depending on the circumstances of the death.
8_23	0.098029147	In a plane crash case, pathologists first try to determine whether a medical condition, such as heart disease or a brain rupture, could have led the pilot to lose control, Kirschner said.
8_24	0.11540225	Examiners might look at the pilot's lower extremities, checking for the impact of a rudder on the bottom of a shoe, or some other sign of what the pilot was doing.
8_25	0.090724708	Pathologists also follow a complex set of rules that govern the testing of a pilot for drug and alcohol use, Dix said.
8_26	0.096987811	After every plane crash, the NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration send investigating pathologists a box of containers and bags, used to collect a series of specimens.
8_27	0.10239436	Autopsies of the plane's passengers aren't always needed, Dix said, though pathologists will usually perform x-rays to determine the victims' injuries.
8_28	0.094852799	Passenger autopsies are also useful, Kirschner said, if a victim's family sues for damages related to the crash.
8_29	0.10373404	A medical examiner could determine whether the victim suffered in the moments before death, or survived in the minutes or hours after the crash.
8_30	0.27367657	The timing of the Kennedy investigation, Kirschner said, makes it highly unlikely that pathologists performed autopsies on Carolyn Bessette Kennedy or Lauren Bessette.
8_31	0.086738609	``You can't possibly do three investigations in four hours,'' he said.
8_32	0.12365665	Still, Dix said, the speed of the investigation, and the fact that it was performed at night, probably won't affect the results.
8_33	0.077730326	``You have qualified people doing it,'' he said.
8_34	0.10830146	Signals from the authorities in the Kennedy case _ the local district attorney and the state coroner _ indicate an unusual intensity to complete the autopsy, presumably in time for the burial.
8_35	0.085286835	Officials were especially reluctant to give out information on Thursday, citing concern for the families.
8_36	0.085210976	Deference to a family, especially a famous family, is typical and reasonable, Kirschner said.
8_37	0.089966975	``You just have to be careful not to be too deferential,'' he said.

9_4	0.69481948	Kennedy Jr.'s flight.
9_5	0.12476679	But experts in airplane crashes said those bits of debris, and the radar signals that tracked Kennedy's plane just before it disappeared Friday night, are enough to confirm a much-feared fact: that a plane could not have survived such a crash intact.
9_6	0.078779353	``If you're finding the airplane in parts, that means it has come apart,'' said Arthur Alan Wolk, a Philadelphia pilot and lawyer who specializes in air crash cases.
9_7	0.080298561	``It's no longer a single airplane''.
9_8	0.10881358	Kennedy's plane followed a familiar trajectory as it fell into the ocean, Wolk said _ so common that air crash investigators have given it the macabre name ``graveyard spiral''.
9_9	0.08969601	It begins, Wolk said, when one wing dips down and the plane no longer generates upward lift.
9_10	0.10222697	The nose points downward as the plane begins to plunge at ever-increasing speed.
9_11	0.08243551	To escape such a catastrophic dive, Wolk added, a pilot must try to level the wings, reduce speed, and lift the nose back above the horizon.
9_12	0.12276584	But Kennedy, who had already started his descent toward Martha's Vineyard, had less than 30 seconds, according to Wolk's calculations of radar records of the doomed flight, to do all this before he hit the water _ not enough time to pull out of a steep dive.
9_13	0.13088595	His plane would have been traveling at least 4,500 feet per minute when it crashed, Wolk said.
9_14	0.086607959	``It's almost like landing on pavement at that point,'' said Len Carroll, operations manager at Wiggins Airport in Norwood, Mass..
9_15	0.15450775	Finding more debris or any signs of Kennedy, his wife, and sister-in law might take some time, Carroll said.
9_16	0.17999351	In similar crashes off the Martha's Vineyard coast, Carroll said, locating wreckages has sometimes taken weeks.
9_17	0.089973733	Tides and currents can carry debris far from a crash site, he said.
9_18	0.17259815	And the depth of the water _ 25 feet to 100 feet _ where Kennedy's plane is believed to have plunged makes a search more difficult.
9_19	0.089248067	From above the water's surface, it is hard to see objects that have sunk below 10 feet.
9_20	0.16242644	Federal investigators cautioned Sunday that the search could take months and that the cause of the crash might never be determined.
9_21	0.093397663	But that didn't stop amateur pilots from speculating over what could have gone wrong.
9_22	0.12285976	Intense discussion has focused on Kennedy's relative inexperience in the cockpit, the difficult visibility on a hazy, moonless night and Kennedy's recent upgrade to a more powerful plane than the one he'd used for flight training.
9_23	0.11364133	But Wolk believes the facts, so far, suggest that airplane malfunction was as likely a potential cause of the crash as pilot error.
9_24	0.092875181	A sudden change in altitude after a seemingly normal flight could indicate, Wolk said, one of several mechanical errors: a malfunction of the autopilot, the ``artificial horizon'' that feeds information to the autopilot, or the vacuum pumps that drive the plane's gyroscopic information.
9_25	0.0927382	``All of these small planes have a long history of malfunction of various components,'' Wolk said.
9_26	0.16795641	Kennedy's plane may have crashed, he said, because of ``something that suddenly overcame him''.
9_27	0.088602615	But Carroll said physical malfunctions are far less common than pilot error.
9_28	0.081762356	``Mechanical things don't happen a lot,'' he said.
9_29	0.090014996	``Most of it's something a pilot does.''

10_4	0.14902126	Rather than use the words ''pilot error,'' however, the NTSB is likely to attribute the cause to Kennedy becoming ''spatially disoriented,'' which is when a pilot loses track of the plane's position in the sky, NBC reported.
10_5	0.18160635	The NTSB also is likely to point to a host of factors the night of July 16, when the plane Kennedy was piloting crashed off the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard: thick haze, the darkness of night, and the fact Kennedy was flying over open water with no lights below to guide him.
10_6	0.10426464	But the NTSB is not expected to criticize Kennedy's experience, and will not address the question of whether pilots without instrument rating should be allowed to fly at night, NBC said.
10_7	0.24864083	Kennedy did not have instrument rating, meaning he was not qualified to fly by instruments alone.

11_36	0.21034078	Kennedy, who obtained a pilot's license last year, did not file a flight plan and did not make radio contact with air controllers during the flight, officials said.
11_37	0.080432186	For that reason, the initial search covered a broad swath of the Eastern Seaboard, from Long Island to Cape Cod.
11_38	0.090275086	About 3:30 a.m.
11_39	0.15651401	Saturday, the Coast Guard received a signal from an emergency beacon off Long Island, but it proved to be unrelated to the Kennedy airplane.

11_45	0.15475656	New York Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the Police Department, acting on a request from the Kennedy family early Saturday, had dispatched officers to Kennedy's Manhattan apartment to make sure he was not there.
11_46	0.24521731	The search continued along the presumed flight path of Kennedy's plane, until the discovery of debris off Martha's Vineyard early Saturday afternoon.
11_47	0.17096218	That, combined with an analysis of information captured by air-control radar towers, focused the search efforts along a 17-mile expanse of water southwest of Martha's Vineyard, the resort community where Kennedy had planned to drop off Lauren Bessette before flying on to the wedding at the Kennedy compound.
11_48	0.14460994	Another clue came from a man who was fishing on Friday night off Squibnocket, a rock formation on the southern shore of Martha's Vineyard.
11_49	0.10153693	Officer Henry Meyer, of the West Tisbury Police Department, said the fisherman reported to the police Saturday morning that he saw a small airplane flying several miles off shore between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m on Friday.
11_50	0.11977803	The man, a lawyer whom Meyer refused to identify, said the plane was flying extremely low, perhaps 40 feet over the water.
11_51	0.13717482	On Martha's Vineyard, law enforcement authorities quickly closed off public access to the beach along Gay Head.
11_52	0.11781056	Coast Guard officials refused to speculate on the fate of the passengers, and they insisted they had not given up hope.
11_53	0.087803744	But as the day wore on, it became clear that hopes of finding survivors were fading with each passing hour.
11_54	0.084298431	Navy salvage experts were consulted.
11_55	0.089925378	An oceanographic survey ship, the Rude, was called in to use its sonar equipment to examine the ocean floor, a rippled plain of fine sand which reaches depths of up to 100 feet in the search area.

11_57	0.31908236	Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates all plane crashes, announced it will conduct an investigation of the plane's disappearance.
11_58	0.26966784	The Safety Board sent investigators early Saturday to the airport in Fairfield and later dispatched investigators to Martha's Vineyard.
11_59	0.13644122	Kyle Bailey, 25, a merchandising analyst and a pilot from Cedar Grove, N.J., who has flown from the Essex airport for 13 years, said he saw Kennedy and his wife about 8 p.m.
11_60	0.28805064	Friday as they walked toward Kennedy's plane at the airport.
11_61	0.12755094	Bailey said he watched as Kennedy walked around the outside of the plane and then went through a routine series of preflight checks.
11_62	0.088920247	One thing about Kennedy's routine struck Bailey as odd.
11_63	0.095282087	Usually pilots take their planes down the runway a bit to do their engine ``rev-ups,'' to avoid creating too much noise in the parking area, he said.
11_64	0.20784409	But he said Kennedy did his rev-ups in the parking space.
11_65	0.14461632	``The impression I got was maybe there was something wrong with the plane,'' Bailey said.
11_66	0.10796017	``It just caught my attention, like, `Why is he doing this here'''?
11_67	0.29519692	He said Kennedy's plane took off without incident, first heading south before turning toward Martha's Vineyard.
11_68	0.1258969	Bailey, who flew to Martha's Vineyard two weeks ago, said the route over water can be hazardous, especially at night.
11_69	0.096255542	Aircraft like the Piper do not carry flight data recorders or cockpit voice recorders, the ``black boxes'' that investigators use to piece together the details of jet crashes.
11_70	0.19175322	The plane was flying under visual flight rules, meaning that the pilot took responsibility for picking his route and avoiding other traffic, rather than relying on air traffic controllers to guide the plane.
11_71	0.13939736	Though wind conditions were mild on Friday night, visibility in the area was poor, pilots said.
11_72	0.11409506	``It was very hazy, and it was very dark, and it was very hard to see the horizon,'' said Michael C.

11_75	0.12351629	Larry Lorenzo, the owner of Caldwell Flight Academy, which operates at the Essex airport, said he believed Kennedy was in the process of getting his instrument license, which allows pilots to fly in cloudy or bad weather using only instruments.

12_5	0.16028351	The search began Saturday morning in an area covering some 1,000 square miles, presumably the flight path of Kennedy's plane, searchers said.
12_6	0.29208275	The plane carrying also Kennedy's wife and his sister-in-law reportedly took off from Caldwell, N.J. at 8:40 pm Friday and was due to arrive at Martha's Vineyard, Mass..
12_7	0.092221361	a little more than one hour later, but it did not.
12_8	0.24397455	The first report about the missing of the single-engine plane came from members of Kennedy family, airport sources said.
12_9	0.095871725	John F.Kennedy Jr.
12_10	0.10387936	, 38 and living in New York, is the founder of George magazine.

13_0	0.7974192	John F.
13_1	1.0646299	Kennedy Jr.
13_2	0.19693502	was a relatively new pilot, apparently relatively cautious, flying a new, expensive and well-equipped private plane.
13_3	0.2290442	Kennedy earned his private pilot's license in early 1998, according to officials at the Federal Aviation Administration, who did not have a more precise date Saturday.
13_4	0.12492152	Public records show that he was still a flight student in December 1997.
13_5	0.17407828	He apparently did not have an instrument rating, meaning that he was not qualified to fly in conditions that required reliance on instrument navigation, but the weather on Friday night was suitable for a pilot of his rating.
13_6	0.099744414	The flight may have been challenging, though, authorities said, because on the most direct route, the distance to shore far exceeds the distance that the plane could glide if the single engine failed.
13_7	0.42169335	Kennedy had registered the plane, a Piper Saratoga, in April.
13_8	0.19639113	A pilot who flies from the same airfield, Essex Airport in Fairfield, N.J., said that he and Kennedy used the same flight instructor, and that Kennedy frequently flew with the instructor to Martha's Vineyard on Friday nights, and returned on Sunday nights or Monday mornings.
13_9	0.18642488	The instructor, the pilot said, was not aboard the Saratoga on Friday night; he was in Europe.
13_10	0.12846602	Kennedy had been flying from Essex Airport for about a year, said James Paganelli, chairman of the Essex County Improvement Authority, speaking at a news conference at the airport.
13_11	0.075766137	About 350 planes are registered there, he said.
13_12	0.14178974	The pilot, who asked not to be identified by name, said he saw the Kennedy party preparing to depart Friday night at about 8:15.
13_13	0.21377533	Kennedy was dressed in white slacks and T-shirt; his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, wore black pants and black T-shirt, and another woman was wearing a beige dress, he said.
13_14	0.076053838	(Other reports said that Ms.
13_15	0.27684229	Bessette Kennedy's sister, Lauren Bessette, flew with them).
13_16	0.10661268	Kennedy appeared to have an injury to one foot or leg, the pilot said, and was ``pivoting around on one spot''.
13_17	0.10069472	He had what appeared from a distance to be a crutch, but was not using it, the other pilot said.
13_18	0.094411619	The plane's rudder is controlled with foot pedals.
13_19	0.20379172	It was not clear Saturday whether Kennedy's apparent injury might have affected his ability to control the plane.
13_20	0.14682672	The pilot said he had previously spoken to Kennedy about their mutual instructor.
13_21	0.13656699	``He always said he had an instructor fly with him a lot in the Saratoga,'' said the pilot.
13_22	0.10225915	``He may have been getting accustomed to a new plane, and trying to enhance his skills, even though he had the license''.
13_23	0.091301892	Aviation experts said he might have been practicing for obtaining an instrument rating.
13_24	0.15031859	The instructor, the pilot said, had said that ``he had a good time'' flying with Kennedy.
13_25	0.10606501	An air traffic controller, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Kennedy had been given clearance by the tower to take off, but had not contacted the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, which would be the first air traffic control office with jurisdiction over a flight under instrument rules.
13_26	0.096565171	But under visual flight rules, which were in effect during the flight, if Kennedy chose to take responsibility himself for spotting other air traffic and staying a safe distance away, and if he did not need to ask about weather conditions ahead, he was under no obligation to check in.
13_27	0.13702637	Private planes commonly do not fly under air traffic control.
13_28	0.10418488	The plane carried a transponder, a device that automatically responds to a query from FAA radar, stating the airplane's identity and altitude.
13_29	0.098179386	But for private flights like this one, the transponder would be responding with a generic code meaning it was a general aviation flight and not giving its precise identity.
13_30	0.093360343	FAA technicians Saturday were sorting through all such flights the previous night.
13_31	0.16124856	Kennedy's Saratoga was almost new, the pilot said.
13_32	0.096437135	The Saratoga can carry six or seven people, including two people in the front, each of whom has flight controls.
13_33	0.10653533	The plane has a single, 300-horsepower, six-cylinder engine, a little bigger than an engine in a large car.
13_34	0.090086435	It can carry about 1,100 pounds, including people, baggage and fuel.

14_0	0.12997254	WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) --The wreckage of John F.
14_1	0.53717916	Kennedy Jr.'s small plane was located Wednesday, with Kennedy's body still aboard, off the coast of Martha's Vineyard in the Massachusetts State of the United States, senior government sources said.
14_2	0.12903232	"They've got the fuselage and John Kennedy's in it," said a government source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation.
14_3	0.21200453	There was no immediate information about the bodies of Kennedy's wife and sister-in-law, who also were on board the plane when it crashed on July 16.

14_5	0.10898942	Richard Larrabee, who was overseeing the search, canceled a round of morning TV appearances and went to the USS Grasp, the ship where the wreckage was to be deposited after being raised from the ocean floor.
14_6	0.14370174	The heightened activity took place after ships from the Navy, Coast Guard and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration spent Tuesday night scouring a site 11 kilometers southwest of the Martha's Vineyard coast, a spot that investigators had speculated was the likely splash point for the plane.
14_7	0.89922607	The plane crashed while carrying Kennedy, 38, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her sister Lauren Bessette, 34.
14_8	0.23302316	Kennedy, the pilot, planned to drop off his sister-in-law on the island and continue to his cousin's wedding in Hyannis Port.
15_0	0.39708379	One of John F.
15_1	0.29102188	Kennedy Jr.'s flight instructors, believing him unprepared for a solo flight over water on a dark, hazy night, offered to fly with him on the night of Kennedy's fatal crash.
15_2	0.21748449	But Kennedy responded that he ``wanted to do it alone,'' the instructor told the National Transportation Safety Board.
15_3	0.1603441	The instructor's concerns and Kennedy's reply were revealed in the board's final report on the July 16, 1999, accident which was released Thursday.
15_4	0.35207452	The report concludes that, during the flight from New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard, Kennedy became disoriented in the hazy night over the Atlantic Ocean and lost control of his airplane, which crashed, killing him, his wife Carolyn, and her sister.
15_5	0.11484166	The report, like many issued by the NTSB in the wake of general aviation accidents, offers only a simple description of the accident's probable cause and never identifies the pilot, passengers, or persons interviewed by name.
15_6	0.20543841	But appended to the report is an unusual extended narrative portrait of Kennedy's skills as a pilot and his training.
15_7	0.26238247	The narrative reveals that Kennedy and his instructor had flown his Piper Saratoga II to Martha's Vineyard on the night of July 1 _ about two weeks before the crash _ when visibility was restricted at the island airport.
15_8	0.10363979	The instructor told investigators that Kennedy ``seemed competent. . . but may have had difficulty performing additional tasks under such conditions''.
15_9	0.15101516	The unnamed instructor told investigators he was not aware that Kennedy had ever previously flown the Saratoga without an instructor on board.
15_10	0.12409344	And he said he believed at the time that Kennedy would need additional training before he would be ready to be tested on flying by instruments alone.
15_11	0.10635597	The instructor ``also stated that he would not have felt comfortable with the accident pilot conducting night flight operations on a route similar to the one flown on, and in weather conditions similar to those that existed on the night of the accident.
15_12	0.16414595	The instructor further stated that he had talked to the pilot on the day of the accident and offered to fly with him on the accident flight.
15_13	0.094112715	He stated that the accident pilot replied that `he wanted to do it alone,' '' the report states.
15_14	0.12228475	The report, whose basic conclusions were revealed in news stories last month, states the accident was caused by ``the pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation.
15_15	0.11947734	Factors in the accident were haze, and the dark night''.
15_16	0.10651043	Spatial disorientation refers to the confusion that can occur when no horizon is visible and a pilot loses a sense of how the plane is headed.
15_17	0.16256242	The pilot may believe the plane is flying with wings level when it is out of control, or, conversely, feel that the plane is turning or rolling when it is not.
15_18	0.13285923	The NTSB findings confirm early speculation that pilot error caused the crash.
15_19	0.23976663	No mechanical problem with the aircraft was found after the wreckage was recovered in about 120 feet of water seven miles off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.
15_20	0.11168861	Kennedy's uncle, Senator Edward M.
15_21	0.17454904	Kennedy, had no comment on the report, a spokesman said.
15_22	0.12704993	The 24-page narrative appended to the NTSB report describes Kennedy as a generally competent pilot for his experience level _ he had more than 300 hours of flight time, with about 260 in the two years before the crash.
15_23	0.10621946	But, also in keeping with his level of experience and training, Kennedy was viewed as a pilot who could find it difficult to handle several cockpit tasks at once.
15_24	0.11509495	Kennedy also appears to have been eager to obtain a rating that would have permitted him to fly in poor visibility using only cockpit instruments for guidance _ the sort of skills he would have had to rely on the night of the crash.
15_25	0.085257338	On March 12, 1999, he completed the Federal Aviation Administration written test on airplane instruments and received a score of 78 percent, eight points above a passing grade.
15_26	0.090430558	And in April, he returned to Flight Safety International (where he had enrolled in 1998 in a pilot training program and got his license) in Florida to begin an instrument rating course.
15_27	0.091976894	Kennedy's instructor there told investigators that he had completed the first 12 of 25 lesson plans and had no problems until lesson 11, which is designed to develop a student's familiarity with radio beacon navigation aids while flying under guidance from air-traffic controllers.
15_28	0.089359	It took him four attempts to pass that section.
15_29	0.17648769	The flight instructor ``stated that the pilot's basic instrument flying skills and simulator work were excellent,'' according to the report.
15_30	0.11287041	``However (the instructor) stated that the pilot had trouble managing multiple tasks while flying, which he felt was normal for the pilot's level of experience''.
15_31	0.12079278	Kennedy had flown his Piper Saratoga II airplane, which he bought in April 1999, for some 36 hours, fewer than 10 of them at night.
15_32	0.18799873	Most of the flights were with instructors from New Jersey, where the plane was based, and they included several flights from Caldwell, N.J., to Martha's Vineyard, at least one of which required the use of instruments to land.
15_33	0.1118443	Kennedy handled that feat, according to the report, but he needed assistance with the rudder pedals because of a broken ankle he suffered while hang gliding.
15_34	0.13066195	Another New Jersey flight instructor flew with Kennedy in several airplanes for 39 hours, including 21 at night, and nearly an hour in instrument conditions.
15_35	0.13471682	An unspecified amount of that flight time was in the Saratoga.
15_36	0.097331833	And still another flight instructor who signed Kennedy off in the high-performance Saratoga said that once or twice the airplane's autopilot turned to a heading other than the one selected, which required turning the autopilot off and then on again.
15_37	0.11352341	In the final moments of Kennedy's flight before it went into a steep dive, falling more than 4,700 feet per minute, the plane made some turns in course and changes in altitude that indicate either the autopilot was turned off or was malfunctioning.
15_38	0.093753174	Investigators also interviewed several pilots who flew that night.
15_39	0.19216968	The FAA told Kennedy that visual flight conditions existed all along the route, meaning that Kennedy did not technically need to have an instrument rating to continue his flight to the Vineyard, where he planned to drop off his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette.
15_40	0.41559554	John and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy then planned to continue on to Hyannis for the wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy.
15_41	0.18500935	One pilot flying to Nantucket told investigators that his global positioning system told him he was over Martha's Vineyard.
15_42	0.073093365	``He looked down and `there was nothing to see.
15_43	0.075679871	There was no horizon, no light.
15_44	0.11477857	. . . I turned left toward Martha's Vineyard to see if it was visible but could see no lights of any kind nor any evidence of the island.
15_45	0.090131161	. . . I thought the island might have suffered a power failure,' '' the report quotes the pilot as saying.
15_46	0.10136588	And as the pilot neared Nantucket, he turned on to a final approach and had to use his instruments because he could not hold his altitude by observations of the horizon or the ground.
15_47	0.10350745	The narrative also revealed that, earlier in the flight, Kennedy may have violated a rule requiring all pilots to contact air traffic and get clearance before entering controlled airspace around busy airports.
15_48	0.14919938	Apparently Kennedy's plane wandered into such airspace near the Westchester County Airport.
15_49	0.10194485	An American Airlines Fokker 100 was preparing to land when air-traffic controllers alerted the plane to an unidentified airplane nearby that was ``not talking to anybody''.

22_11	0.095435153	He said the move was based on four factors: the expected length of survival time in the 68-degree waters is just 12 to 18 hours; the plane had no emergency survival equipment; the two days of searching found nothing to indicate anyone had survived; and the NTSB's experience in assessing the probability of survival in this type of crash.
22_12	0.2075675	Meanwhile, federal safety investigators said a rare feature aboard Kennedy's small plane _ a voice recorder _ might provide clues to the Friday night crash.
22_13	0.10721657	Also Sunday, questions arose whether search and rescue operations might have begun five hours earlier had proper procedures been followed when a Martha's Vineyard Airport employee tried to alert authorities that the flight was overdue.
22_14	0.10101069	Even before Larrabee's announcement, the mood grew increasingly somber at the Kennedy family's Hyannis Port compound, where three priests clad in white celebrated Mass under a white tent.

22_19	0.11432478	At an afternoon press briefing, the chairman of the NTSB cautioned that the investigation into the crash would take six to nine months, and the cause might remain elusive.
22_20	0.07525272	``At this point we do not know.
22_21	0.079747291	We will not know for some time.
22_22	0.083392981	There is even a possibility we will never know,'' NTSB Chairman James Hall said.
22_23	0.12606294	Sunday, Coast Guard searchers turned up only bits of a headrest and foam insulation they believe came from Kennedy's single-engine airplane.
22_24	0.081159454	The insulation, in pieces ranging from 2 to 10 inches in diameter, were found along a mile-long stretch of beach by Aquinnah, an area known as Gay Head.
22_25	0.095267651	Coast Guard officials said widespread reports of an oil slick near the search area Sunday were unrelated.
22_26	0.13123326	On Saturday, investigators found a seat, a headrest, a nose wheel, several other airplane parts, a suitcase belonging to Lauren Bessette, and a prescription bottle belonging to Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.
22_27	0.10992357	Kennedy's six-seat Piper Saratoga II HP did not have ``black boxes,'' devices required on all commercial planes that record cockpit conversations and radio transmissions as well as many parameters of an airplane's performance.
22_28	0.11446216	However, Kennedy's plane did have a manual voice recorder, a device that is mostly unheard of on all but the most recent models of private planes.
22_29	0.12908771	The voice recorder, installed after the plane left the factory, would capture any radio transmissions and possibly some of Kennedy's utterances to his passengers, but would have had to be turned on by the pilot for it to operate.
22_30	0.092537529	It was unclear whether the recorder would yield much information.
22_31	0.15637668	An official with the NTSB, which assumed control of the investigation Sunday, said a review of radio traffic showed that ground controllers received no communications or distress calls from the plane in the last 40 minutes it was known to have been in the air.
22_32	0.11574235	Still, investigators were hoping that Kennedy turned on the recorder before he taxied out to takeoff and that it might capture something that air traffic controllers never heard _ a mayday call, or something that would reveal details of the final moments of the flight.
22_33	0.08528496	The NTSB assigned an investigator to track down the person who installed the device in an attempt to learn more about it, federal sources said.
22_34	0.20008885	Questions about the response time of the search effort were prompted by the actions Friday night of Adam Budd, a ramp attendent at the Martha's Vineyard Airport.
22_35	0.082093537	Budd, 21, of Sharon, Mass.
22_36	0.19511753	, said he waited with a couple and their young daughter for the Kennedy plane to arrive.
22_37	0.16851847	After 10 p.m., the anticipated arrival time, Budd said, he checked with the tower but was told there was no sign of the plane and there was no indication that Kennedy had radioed a request to land.
22_38	0.097177922	Budd said he then telephoned Bridgeport Automated Flight Service Station in Connecticut, an FAA-run facility where pilots sometimes file their flight plans.
22_39	0.25246362	Kennedy was not required to file a flight plan, and had not done so.
22_40	0.091229036	Budd said he talked to an operator at the Bridgeport station, whose toll-free number is well-known to area pilots.
22_41	0.098884361	``I told him the tail number (of Kennedy's plane), and I asked them if they had the tail number'' on a flight plan, Budd said.
22_42	0.090061986	The operator was unresponsive, Budd said: ``He just didn't want to talk to me''.
22_43	0.089411965	George Mackie, an operations supervisor at the Bridgeport station, said Sunday that Budd's call should have triggered a search by the center.
22_44	0.1520371	Even if a pilot is flying under visual flight rules, as Kennedy was, and has not filed a flight plan, the flight service is expected to begin searching for an aircraft once it has been identified as late, Mackie said.
22_45	0.089978725	``If someone calls us and tells us an airplane is late, we will begin a search that usually starts with telephone calls,'' he said.
22_46	0.090649923	The telephone inquiry usually consists of contacting small airports in the area, the FAA, and, eventually, the Air Force's Air Rescue Coordination Center in Virginia, Mackie said.
22_47	0.15326364	As it turned out, a search was not initiated until after a Kennedy family friend called the Coast Guard at Woods Hole at about 2:15 a.m.
22_48	0.095095733	Saturday. The first search vessel was launched at about 4:30 a.m.
22_49	0.10207411	The FAA, which oversees the Bridgeport center, has declined to comment on the investigation and the response time.
22_50	0.11982594	Excitement that the plane might have been found was triggered Sunday when Coast Guard officials said a beacon signal was heard at about 3:30 p.m. by a huge Air Force C-130 that has been providing in-flight air control for the intensive air, water, and land search that began early Saturday.
22_51	0.095048439	The Coast Guard immediately dispatched the Rude (pronounced Rudy), a 90-foot ship belonging to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration that is equipped with sonar capable of creating detailed images of objects beneath the surface.
22_52	0.1040067	Sunday night, however, Larrabbee said the beacon signal appeared to have been a false alarm, possibly set off by a marker the Coast Guard had placed in the water to keep track of areas already searched.
22_53	0.13269424	An earlier beacon signal picked up before dawn Saturday off Montauk, Long Island, also was said to be unrelated to the Kennedy search.

22_59	0.1095488	A friend of the Kennedy family said hope had dimmed by Saturday evening, and talk of survivors had been replaced by discussions of memorial services.
22_60	0.14043182	Inside the compound at Hyannis Port, where so many of the family's joys and tragedies have been played out, the Kennedys had no illusions about the news from Martha's Vineyard, family friends and associates said Sunday.

22_62	0.075734324	``It is obviously very difficult''.
22_63	0.10590608	Also Sunday, NTSB officials gave the most complete account to date of Kennedy's fateful flight.
22_64	0.15078367	Robert Pearce, an NTSB regional director who is heading the Kennedy investigation, said the plane took off at 8:38 p.m. from Runway 22 at Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J.
22_65	0.13536	Kennedy had to make an immediate 180-degree turn to point his plane in a northeasterly direction.
22_66	0.086501812	He headed north at an altitude of 5,600 feet along the Connecticut coast.
22_67	0.095015615	He passed over Westerly, R.I., at 9:26 p.m., at that same altitude.
22_68	0.14810281	He then began his descent toward Martha's Vineyard, though Pearce said his precise rate of descent was not clear.
22_69	0.13360806	At 9:40 p.m., two radar stations at Cape Cod picked up the plane at 2,500 feet, 17 or 18 miles west of Martha's Vineyard Airport, which means he was about 10 or 11 miles off the island's coast.
22_70	0.11191	During the next 29 seconds, the plane dropped from 2,500 to 1,800 feet.
22_71	0.085348954	After that point _ at 9:40:29 p.m.

23_6	0.1079693	What was the original schedule for Kennedy's flight?
23_7	0.24884811	A. Kennedy took off from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J. at 8:38 p.m.
23_8	0.21475799	Friday night, flying a Piper Saratoga single-engine plane.
23_9	1.095392	On board were Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren.
23_10	0.28549069	The flight was expected to arrive at Martha's Vineyard Airport at about 10 p.m., but never did.
23_11	0.33476445	The last radar signal from Kennedy's plane was received at 9:38 p.m., as the plane made its approach into Martha's Vineyard.
23_12	0.080295627	&QL; &QL; Q.
23_13	0.21181699	What were the conditions at the time of the flight?
23_14	0.15562168	A. According to the National Weather Service, visibility at Essex County Airport was 4-5 miles in haze, with clear skies, at about the time Kennedy took off.
23_15	0.1000577	Those are considered marginal conditions for the use of Visual Flight Rules: piloting a plane by using visual or ground references to guide you.
23_16	0.091051758	If visibility is 1,000 to 3,000 miles and the cloud ceiling is between 500 and 1,000 feet, pilots are required to use Instrument Flight Rules, using a plane's mechanical systems to guide the flight.
23_17	0.15966341	Flying under IFR requires additional certification, which Kennedy did not have.
23_18	0.1030113	Flight instructors say hazy conditions are difficult for VFR flying, especially at night, and especially over the water, where pilots have no visual reference points to guide them.
23_19	0.28752518	At the time Kennedy was due to arrive at Martha's Vineyard, visibility had improved, increasing to 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.
23_20	0.086169447	&QL; &QL; Q.
23_21	0.25226267	Are runway lights on at the Martha's Vineyard Airport at all times?
23_22	0.2181758	A. The lights would have been on as Kennedy's plane made its final approach to Martha's Vineyard at about 9:30 p.m.
23_23	0.097759011	Lights are turned off when the airport tower closes at 10 p.m., but pilots can turn them on by radio.

23_25	0.089026129	&QL; &QL; Q.
23_26	0.20625726	Should anyone in the airport have been concerned that Kennedy's flight did not arrive, or that his radar dropped off?
23_27	0.093164841	A. Probably not.
23_28	0.47215887	Kennedy was not required to file a flight plan for his trip to Martha's Vineyard.
23_29	0.11847294	If a plane has not filed a flight plan, and is not in radio contract with controllers, any deviation would not cause alarm.
23_30	0.26375653	It is unclear whether Kennedy communicated with the control tower at Martha's Vineyard.

23_35	0.07417327	have? A.
23_36	0.12540128	Kennedy received his basic pilot's license two years ago in Florida, and frequently flew in his Cessna Skyline 182.
23_37	0.1150861	In April, he purchased the Piper Saratoga plane, which has far more engine power and requires additional training to fly.
23_38	0.089130025	&QL; &QL; Q.
23_39	0.078904675	What are the requirements for flight certification?
23_40	0.090002738	A. To receive an initial certification, a student pilot must complete a written exam, log at least 40 hours of flight time, and pass a final ``check ride'' with an FAA examiner.
23_41	0.090394437	Most students log 60 or 70 hours before seeking certification.
23_42	0.10818147	To fly a plane with complex gear or a more powerful engine, a student needs further instruction and the endorsement of a flight instructor.
23_43	0.11076374	It is not known now whether Kennedy received additional instruction before or after buying a more powerful plane.
23_44	0.087807014	&QL; &QL; Q.
23_45	0.1388892	Is there anything special about the type of plane Kennedy was flying, and what is its safety record?
23_46	0.087786012	A. The Piper Saratoga II is a 300-horsepower six-seater with a maximum speed of 192 knots and a cruising range of 188 nautical miles, or about five hours of flying time if the fuel tanks are topped off.
