3_2	0.34703601	Kennedy Jr.'s powerful single-engine aircraft plummeted toward the Atlantic Ocean at 4,700 feet per minute in the seconds before the fatal crash that killed him, his wife and her sister, federal officials said Monday.
3_3	0.24100633	Although officials with the National Transportation Safety Board were coy about characterizing the descent rate, it was far faster than first believed and other pilots said that it would have been virtually impossible for Kennedy to have pulled his Piper Saratoga II HP out of such a freefall.

3_5	0.084657825	``The normal rate of descent you're shooting for as a pilot is 500 to 700 feet per minute for passenger comfort''.
3_6	0.24514841	NTSB officials released more information Monday from additional radar data received from a Nantucket airport that showed Kennedy's plane dropped 1,100 feet in only 14 seconds on that hazy Friday night as the plane flew about four miles southwest of Martha's Vineyard on its final approach to the island's airport.
3_7	0.16348075	Robert Pearce, the NTSB's chief investigator in the case, said the new numbers paint ``a different picture'' for investigators, but he and others with the NTSB declined to characterize the plane's rapid descent as being out of control.

3_9	0.17538486	Although investigators believe they have several promising sites within the 24-square-mile ``target area'' off the Martha's Vineyard coast, a team of 10 divers from the Massachusetts State Police were unable to find the main portion of the wreckage.

3_19	0.48855578	Federal investigators with the NTSB have been interviewing witnesses at the Essex County Airport in New Jersey, from which the 38-year-old Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her 34-year-old sister, Lauren Bessette departed Friday night.
3_20	0.14570093	Based on those interviews and on the few maintenance records investigators have reviewed, there appears to have been no obvious mechanical problems with the plane, which Kennedy bought for a reported $300,000 only three months ago.
3_21	0.1720205	Pearce said witnesses led investigators to believe most of the plane's maintenance records were on board at the time of the crash.
3_22	0.17644477	However, an annual inspection of the 1996 model plane was conducted June 28 and showed that the plane had logged only 622 flight hours since its manufacture.
3_23	0.17134706	Kennedy last refueled the plane on July 11, topping off the tank with 62 gallons.
3_24	0.10039969	Pearce said there were no indications that the plane had been flown between that refueling and Friday's fatal crash.
3_25	0.1206302	Pearce also noted that the plane's magnetic compass was readjusted two days later.
3_26	0.089630596	Because no witnesses have reported seeing or hearing the plane anywhere along its flight path after its takeoff at 7:38 p.m.
3_27	0.10066552	EDT, investigators are unable to determine what type of trouble Kennedy may have had.
3_28	0.21883982	NTSB officials also confirmed Monday that Kennedy's plane was equipped with a relatively new voice recorder.
3_29	0.20161973	Pearce said the recorder appears to have been the type that records the last radio transmissions made from the plane, although it was unknown if Kennedy, a novice pilot, was familiar with the equipment.

6_17	0.35100182	Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga fell into the waters late at night, seven miles south of the Kennedy home on Martha's Vineyard as he was flying from New Jersey to attend his cousin Rory Kennedy's wedding.
6_18	0.27193262	The National Transportation Safety Board determined the cause of the crash was pilot error and said Kennedy likely became disoriented in the night sky.

7_1	1.5842177	Kennedy Jr.
7_2	0.2764355	, hobbled by a broken foot, limped to the flight line of a small airport in Fairfield, N.J. to inspect his Piper Saratoga HP airplane.
7_3	0.30279622	Satisfied with the plane's condition, Kennedy eased himself into the left pilot's seat and prepared for the routine 125-mile flight to an airport near his late mother's homestead on Martha's Vineyard.
7_4	0.823502	His wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her older sister, Lauren Bessette, climbed aboard the six-seat plane.
7_5	0.093420832	The engine turned.

7_7	0.076457059	Within minutes, the powerful single-engine plane roared down Runway 22 and climbed into the hazy evening sky.
7_8	0.091620369	No one has seen it since.
7_9	0.12131501	Although his trip to Massachusetts was routine, the series of decisions Kennedy made that night _ flying a complex aircraft without a flight plan, choosing not to have his flight instructor accompany him in marginal weather conditions, and piloting an airplane with a foot injury _ have grown in significance against the backdrop of a massive search-and-rescue operation under way just off Aquinnah, Mass.
7_10	0.094276441	The Piper Saratoga vanished from radar screens after a rapid descent at 9:38 p.m.
7_11	0.19582593	Friday, about an hour into his flight and about 17 miles away from Martha's Vineyard airport.
7_12	0.083800074	Sunday, searchers recovered bits of the aircraft's fuselage and interior; on Saturday, they had found a wheel strut and a piece of canvas luggage with one of Lauren Bissette's business cards attached.
7_13	0.17348124	While Kennedy had not mastered all the intricacies of the plane's equipment, officials hope he was familiar with at least one: the cockpit voice recording equipment that had been installed in the Saratoga by its first owner in 1997.
7_14	0.12524875	``It was an easy on-off switch,'' said Munir Hussein, its second owner, who sold the plane to Kennedy through a broker in April for $300,000.
7_15	0.093013788	``I used it several times and it worked perfectly''.
7_16	0.1259067	Investigators say the recorder, which captures the words of a pilot uttered both on the radio and within the cockpit, can shed light on what could have caused the plane to dive 700 feet in 29 seconds and apparently plunge into the Atlantic Ocean just off Aquinnah, known as Gay Head.
7_17	0.11511682	The details of what happened in the hour before Kennedy's plane disappeared may not be known until _ or unless _ the aircraft is recovered.
7_18	0.10650705	But investigators do know the flight seemed routine until the very end, according to the review of radar tapes from at least a half-dozen Federal Aviation Adminsitration facilities along the south coast of New England.
7_19	0.099148036	Kennedy had intended to make a daytime flight Friday, but was delayed when his sister-in-law couldn't leave work early enough, and he encountered traffic coming out of New York, the Associated Press quoted a friend as saying.
7_20	0.12001235	But family friends told the Globe they believed Kennedy had planned to leave when he did.
7_21	0.1189578	After takeoff, Kennedy cruised eastward, flying at 5,500 feet, a standard altitude for a plane flying east under visual flight rules, procedures that govern pilots who are qualified only to fly by what they can see.
7_22	0.068007794	As he flew through gathering darkness, only a few stars emerged through the haze, and a slim crescent moon glowed in the night sky.
7_23	0.13379774	Two other pilots familiar with Kennedy's flight experience _ fewer than 100 hours of time alone _ shook their heads as his plane lifted off.
7_24	0.11532381	They knew that Kennedy was learning to fly the Saratoga by instruments alone, but that he wasn't yet qualified to do it on a solo flight.
7_25	0.11766159	In fact, Kennedy told a business associate in Canada last Monday that for the time being, he'd rather fly with a copilot because his broken foot made it difficult for him to operate pedals controlling the plane's rudder.
7_26	0.19175307	Radar stations along the southern New England coast tracked the plane.
7_27	0.15336662	But because Kennedy chose not to file an official flight plan, and had no contact with air-traffic controllers after leaving New Jersey, no one knew his precise route _ or that he was piloting the airplane.
7_28	0.23549765	Warren Morningstar, a private pilot and spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, said it was not unusual for a pilot to fly without filing a plan.
7_29	0.097892578	Still, Morningstar said, ``a flight plan is really an insurance policy, not an air traffic control document''.
7_30	0.092469982	``Would a VFR flight plan have started search and rescue earlier''? he said.
7_31	0.089460882	``Yes, it probably would have''.
7_32	0.10705971	But for most of Kennedy's flight, everything went smoothly.
7_33	0.2027986	At 9:39, nearly an hour after it had taken off from New Jersey, Kennedy's plane was about 10 minutes away from the Martha's Vineyard airport when it began a sudden and steady descent.
7_34	0.17916734	Over the next 29 seconds, the plane dropped 700 feet.
7_35	0.092086996	It then disappeared from all radar screens.
7_36	0.3750717	Investigators said Sunday that the air controllers at the Martha's Vineyard airport did not realize that Kennedy's plane was overdue until sometime Saturday morning.
7_37	0.23074363	The air-traffic controller at Martha's Vineyard airport was scheduled to leave at 10 p.m.
7_38	0.10180762	Friday, and the airport's runway lights were dimmed.
7_39	0.073223114	To brighten them, an approaching pilot must tune his or her radio to the tower frequency and click the microphone five times in five seconds, or seven times in seven seconds to reach their maximum wattage.

7_41	0.069092803	Green Airport airspace in Rhode Island indicate a normal flight.
7_42	0.10293642	``We had a plot on him, we were able to determine which plane was his and he was flying at 5,500 feet,'' said Howard Barte, the controller's union local president in Rhode Island.
7_43	0.12682318	``He came within 17 miles west of Martha's Vineyard, and then in the last few minutes he seemed to descend rather steeply for that airplane.
7_44	0.089472539	The last hit was at 1,800 feet and then we lost contact.
7_45	0.10118966	``It was just over the last couple of minutes of the flight that this happened,'' Barte said.
7_46	0.130811	``Maybe in five more minutes he would have contacted the Martha's Vineyard tower and begun his descent, but this rate of descent was not normal.
7_47	0.10339386	``When you see something like this, you have to ask: Was there something wrong with the plane, or with the pilot?
7_48	0.092026949	Because that is all there is''.

8_3	0.48731246	, his wife, and her sister died instantly when their plane plunged into the ocean off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, the Massachusetts coroner said Thursday.
8_4	0.39660356	Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board's investigation continues.
8_5	0.16612602	One source close to the probe said that all the wreckage of the Piper Saratoga HP II had been brought up, including the crumbled fuselage and the cockpit panel.
8_6	0.12608666	The panel, which contains the flight instruments, including plane's air-speed indicator and attitude indicator, could provide a wealth of information on the plane's performance at the moment it hit the water.
8_7	0.12842251	All three victims were probably alive when the plane hit, but died instantaneously, according to the report of Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner Richard J.
8_8	0.045892927	Evans. After an examination that occurred sometime within a four-hour period, Evans reported that all of them died from ``multiple traumatic injuries''.
8_9	0.095855013	But investigators would not comment further on the condition of the bodies or the details of coroner's report.
8_10	0.14388356	And they would not say whether their study yielded insight into the biggest lingering question: Why Kennedy lost control of his plane the night of July 16.
8_11	0.096483087	The autopsy of a pilot or a passenger in a plane crash is usually less complex than that of a murder victim, experts in forensic pathology said Thursday.
8_12	0.10188939	The cause of death is generally known, and the bodies often don't lead investigators closer to the cause of the wreck.
8_13	0.10493173	Still, the autopsies in the Kennedy case were performed especially quickly, pathologists said.
8_14	0.13119016	The remains were taken to a Bourne hospital at about 7:15 p.m. on Wednesday night, and released to the victims' families at 11 p.m., according to the medical examiner's office and the Cape &AMP; Islands District Attorney's office.
8_15	0.039810206	Many jurisdictions refuse to perform autopsies at night, said Robert Kirschner, a former deputy chief medical examiner for Cook County, Ill.
8_16	0.091819195	The haste in this case, he said, could lead to questions about the investigation's thoroughness.
8_17	0.091353704	In a high-profile case, he said, the pressures are high, and so are the risks of carelessness.
8_18	0.22196705	He pointed to other ``autopsies associated with the Kennedy family'' _ the botched investigation that followed President John F.
8_19	0.17932207	Kennedy's assassination, and the questions surrounding the death of Mary Jo Kopechne 30 years ago, in the Martha's Vineyard car crash that has come to be known as Chappaquiddick.
8_20	0.059584669	``You can't let. . .those kinds of pressures alter your routines,'' he said.
8_21	0.099795208	``If you alter your procedure and do things differently, then you're always going to run into problems''.
8_22	0.073616048	Still, Jay Dix, chief medical examiner for several Missouri counties, said autopsies can usually be completed anywhere from 45 minutes to several hours, depending on the circumstances of the death.
8_23	0.085825419	In a plane crash case, pathologists first try to determine whether a medical condition, such as heart disease or a brain rupture, could have led the pilot to lose control, Kirschner said.
8_24	0.11283187	Examiners might look at the pilot's lower extremities, checking for the impact of a rudder on the bottom of a shoe, or some other sign of what the pilot was doing.
8_25	0.07863378	Pathologists also follow a complex set of rules that govern the testing of a pilot for drug and alcohol use, Dix said.
8_26	0.083244494	After every plane crash, the NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration send investigating pathologists a box of containers and bags, used to collect a series of specimens.
8_27	0.10562582	Autopsies of the plane's passengers aren't always needed, Dix said, though pathologists will usually perform x-rays to determine the victims' injuries.
8_28	0.097210533	Passenger autopsies are also useful, Kirschner said, if a victim's family sues for damages related to the crash.
8_29	0.11384863	A medical examiner could determine whether the victim suffered in the moments before death, or survived in the minutes or hours after the crash.
8_30	0.2753704	The timing of the Kennedy investigation, Kirschner said, makes it highly unlikely that pathologists performed autopsies on Carolyn Bessette Kennedy or Lauren Bessette.
8_31	0.084118621	``You can't possibly do three investigations in four hours,'' he said.
8_32	0.11747772	Still, Dix said, the speed of the investigation, and the fact that it was performed at night, probably won't affect the results.
8_33	0.09364154	``You have qualified people doing it,'' he said.
8_34	0.11334388	Signals from the authorities in the Kennedy case _ the local district attorney and the state coroner _ indicate an unusual intensity to complete the autopsy, presumably in time for the burial.
8_35	0.092057008	Officials were especially reluctant to give out information on Thursday, citing concern for the families.
8_36	0.08999486	Deference to a family, especially a famous family, is typical and reasonable, Kirschner said.
8_37	0.087369378	``You just have to be careful not to be too deferential,'' he said.

9_4	1.1395238	Kennedy Jr.'s flight.
9_5	0.13986022	But experts in airplane crashes said those bits of debris, and the radar signals that tracked Kennedy's plane just before it disappeared Friday night, are enough to confirm a much-feared fact: that a plane could not have survived such a crash intact.
9_6	0.048331218	``If you're finding the airplane in parts, that means it has come apart,'' said Arthur Alan Wolk, a Philadelphia pilot and lawyer who specializes in air crash cases.
9_7	0.095511695	``It's no longer a single airplane''.
9_8	0.10158814	Kennedy's plane followed a familiar trajectory as it fell into the ocean, Wolk said _ so common that air crash investigators have given it the macabre name ``graveyard spiral''.
9_9	0.087346797	It begins, Wolk said, when one wing dips down and the plane no longer generates upward lift.
9_10	0.09376082	The nose points downward as the plane begins to plunge at ever-increasing speed.
9_11	0.055337495	To escape such a catastrophic dive, Wolk added, a pilot must try to level the wings, reduce speed, and lift the nose back above the horizon.
9_12	0.13929834	But Kennedy, who had already started his descent toward Martha's Vineyard, had less than 30 seconds, according to Wolk's calculations of radar records of the doomed flight, to do all this before he hit the water _ not enough time to pull out of a steep dive.
9_13	0.124156	His plane would have been traveling at least 4,500 feet per minute when it crashed, Wolk said.
9_14	0.062648678	``It's almost like landing on pavement at that point,'' said Len Carroll, operations manager at Wiggins Airport in Norwood, Mass..
9_15	0.11658728	Finding more debris or any signs of Kennedy, his wife, and sister-in law might take some time, Carroll said.
9_16	0.17139685	In similar crashes off the Martha's Vineyard coast, Carroll said, locating wreckages has sometimes taken weeks.
9_17	0.093901643	Tides and currents can carry debris far from a crash site, he said.
9_18	0.16794493	And the depth of the water _ 25 feet to 100 feet _ where Kennedy's plane is believed to have plunged makes a search more difficult.
9_19	0.085692497	From above the water's surface, it is hard to see objects that have sunk below 10 feet.
9_20	0.1123425	Federal investigators cautioned Sunday that the search could take months and that the cause of the crash might never be determined.
9_21	0.09259611	But that didn't stop amateur pilots from speculating over what could have gone wrong.
9_22	0.11946319	Intense discussion has focused on Kennedy's relative inexperience in the cockpit, the difficult visibility on a hazy, moonless night and Kennedy's recent upgrade to a more powerful plane than the one he'd used for flight training.
9_23	0.11226758	But Wolk believes the facts, so far, suggest that airplane malfunction was as likely a potential cause of the crash as pilot error.
9_24	0.098204916	A sudden change in altitude after a seemingly normal flight could indicate, Wolk said, one of several mechanical errors: a malfunction of the autopilot, the ``artificial horizon'' that feeds information to the autopilot, or the vacuum pumps that drive the plane's gyroscopic information.
9_25	0.090952169	``All of these small planes have a long history of malfunction of various components,'' Wolk said.
9_26	0.12323202	Kennedy's plane may have crashed, he said, because of ``something that suddenly overcame him''.
9_27	0.093388257	But Carroll said physical malfunctions are far less common than pilot error.
9_28	0.091654538	``Mechanical things don't happen a lot,'' he said.
9_29	0.10242707	``Most of it's something a pilot does.''

10_4	0.2212744	Rather than use the words ''pilot error,'' however, the NTSB is likely to attribute the cause to Kennedy becoming ''spatially disoriented,'' which is when a pilot loses track of the plane's position in the sky, NBC reported.
10_5	0.26552741	The NTSB also is likely to point to a host of factors the night of July 16, when the plane Kennedy was piloting crashed off the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard: thick haze, the darkness of night, and the fact Kennedy was flying over open water with no lights below to guide him.
10_6	0.13533248	But the NTSB is not expected to criticize Kennedy's experience, and will not address the question of whether pilots without instrument rating should be allowed to fly at night, NBC said.
10_7	0.13422203	Kennedy did not have instrument rating, meaning he was not qualified to fly by instruments alone.

11_37	0.062306765	For that reason, the initial search covered a broad swath of the Eastern Seaboard, from Long Island to Cape Cod.
11_38	0.025591106	About 3:30 a.m.
11_39	0.16487099	Saturday, the Coast Guard received a signal from an emergency beacon off Long Island, but it proved to be unrelated to the Kennedy airplane.
11_40	0.078845536	Later Saturday morning, two boaters found some debris floating off the Connecticut coast.
11_41	0.089928883	That, too, was a false alert.
11_42	0.093413405	Other agencies joined the search.
11_43	0.088704344	The Air National Guard dispatched a C-130 cargo plane.
11_44	0.091318084	Fifteen planes from the Civil Air Patrol were searching, too.
11_45	0.17599742	New York Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the Police Department, acting on a request from the Kennedy family early Saturday, had dispatched officers to Kennedy's Manhattan apartment to make sure he was not there.
11_46	0.24677896	The search continued along the presumed flight path of Kennedy's plane, until the discovery of debris off Martha's Vineyard early Saturday afternoon.
11_47	0.19833222	That, combined with an analysis of information captured by air-control radar towers, focused the search efforts along a 17-mile expanse of water southwest of Martha's Vineyard, the resort community where Kennedy had planned to drop off Lauren Bessette before flying on to the wedding at the Kennedy compound.
11_48	0.15617034	Another clue came from a man who was fishing on Friday night off Squibnocket, a rock formation on the southern shore of Martha's Vineyard.
11_49	0.11131183	Officer Henry Meyer, of the West Tisbury Police Department, said the fisherman reported to the police Saturday morning that he saw a small airplane flying several miles off shore between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m on Friday.
11_50	0.12297874	The man, a lawyer whom Meyer refused to identify, said the plane was flying extremely low, perhaps 40 feet over the water.
11_51	0.13815268	On Martha's Vineyard, law enforcement authorities quickly closed off public access to the beach along Gay Head.
11_52	0.10597784	Coast Guard officials refused to speculate on the fate of the passengers, and they insisted they had not given up hope.
11_53	0.092121597	But as the day wore on, it became clear that hopes of finding survivors were fading with each passing hour.
11_54	0.084172476	Navy salvage experts were consulted.
11_55	0.083940806	An oceanographic survey ship, the Rude, was called in to use its sonar equipment to examine the ocean floor, a rippled plain of fine sand which reaches depths of up to 100 feet in the search area.
11_56	0.069059096	Currents are moderate in the area and should not interfere with searchers, said John Fish, the president of American Underwater Search and Survey, a Massachusetts company that searches for sunken airplanes.
11_57	0.30204335	Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates all plane crashes, announced it will conduct an investigation of the plane's disappearance.
11_58	0.26151507	The Safety Board sent investigators early Saturday to the airport in Fairfield and later dispatched investigators to Martha's Vineyard.
11_59	0.15368611	Kyle Bailey, 25, a merchandising analyst and a pilot from Cedar Grove, N.J., who has flown from the Essex airport for 13 years, said he saw Kennedy and his wife about 8 p.m.
11_60	0.16087483	Friday as they walked toward Kennedy's plane at the airport.
11_61	0.11553871	Bailey said he watched as Kennedy walked around the outside of the plane and then went through a routine series of preflight checks.
11_62	0.098312674	One thing about Kennedy's routine struck Bailey as odd.
11_63	0.093253338	Usually pilots take their planes down the runway a bit to do their engine ``rev-ups,'' to avoid creating too much noise in the parking area, he said.
11_64	0.12037326	But he said Kennedy did his rev-ups in the parking space.
11_65	0.099259307	``The impression I got was maybe there was something wrong with the plane,'' Bailey said.
11_66	0.098499628	``It just caught my attention, like, `Why is he doing this here'''?
11_67	0.25021785	He said Kennedy's plane took off without incident, first heading south before turning toward Martha's Vineyard.
11_68	0.12585301	Bailey, who flew to Martha's Vineyard two weeks ago, said the route over water can be hazardous, especially at night.
11_69	0.084056888	Aircraft like the Piper do not carry flight data recorders or cockpit voice recorders, the ``black boxes'' that investigators use to piece together the details of jet crashes.
11_70	0.19963709	The plane was flying under visual flight rules, meaning that the pilot took responsibility for picking his route and avoiding other traffic, rather than relying on air traffic controllers to guide the plane.
11_71	0.1214145	Though wind conditions were mild on Friday night, visibility in the area was poor, pilots said.
11_72	0.092227181	``It was very hazy, and it was very dark, and it was very hard to see the horizon,'' said Michael C.
11_73	0.13799121	Bard, a private pilot, who left Martha's Vineyard about 9:15 p.m. on Friday and flew back to his home in Danbury, Conn.
11_74	0.091566922	``If you're not instrument rated, it could be difficult maintaining the airplane in an upright condition,'' he said.
11_75	0.13489824	Larry Lorenzo, the owner of Caldwell Flight Academy, which operates at the Essex airport, said he believed Kennedy was in the process of getting his instrument license, which allows pilots to fly in cloudy or bad weather using only instruments.
11_76	0.097258448	While his family roots run deep in Boston, Kennedy came of age _ personally and professionally _ in New York City.
11_77	0.09211775	He grew up with his mother on Fifth Avenue, and later moved to a loft in TriBeCa.

12_0	0.21883275	NEW YORK, July 17 (Xinhua) --The U.S.
12_1	0.44223412	Coast Guard and the Air National Guard are conducting a massive search off the coast of Long Island, N.Y. for a small plane carrying John F.

12_3	0.11809974	, son of the 35th U.S.
12_4	0.069466789	President, U.S. media reported Saturday.
12_5	0.18107345	The search began Saturday morning in an area covering some 1,000 square miles, presumably the flight path of Kennedy's plane, searchers said.
12_6	0.34218269	The plane carrying also Kennedy's wife and his sister-in-law reportedly took off from Caldwell, N.J. at 8:40 pm Friday and was due to arrive at Martha's Vineyard, Mass..
12_7	0.088332889	a little more than one hour later, but it did not.
12_8	0.1858812	The first report about the missing of the single-engine plane came from members of Kennedy family, airport sources said.
12_9	0.14281413	John F.Kennedy Jr.
12_10	0.11737721	, 38 and living in New York, is the founder of George magazine.
12_11	0.1058962	Before going to publishing, he was an assistant district attorney in Manhattan of New York.
13_0	1.2606431	John F.
13_1	1.5332533	Kennedy Jr.
13_2	0.12017878	was a relatively new pilot, apparently relatively cautious, flying a new, expensive and well-equipped private plane.
13_3	0.21408011	Kennedy earned his private pilot's license in early 1998, according to officials at the Federal Aviation Administration, who did not have a more precise date Saturday.
13_4	0.10934974	Public records show that he was still a flight student in December 1997.
13_5	0.19831729	He apparently did not have an instrument rating, meaning that he was not qualified to fly in conditions that required reliance on instrument navigation, but the weather on Friday night was suitable for a pilot of his rating.
13_6	0.10095123	The flight may have been challenging, though, authorities said, because on the most direct route, the distance to shore far exceeds the distance that the plane could glide if the single engine failed.
13_7	0.30418114	Kennedy had registered the plane, a Piper Saratoga, in April.
13_8	0.23998157	A pilot who flies from the same airfield, Essex Airport in Fairfield, N.J., said that he and Kennedy used the same flight instructor, and that Kennedy frequently flew with the instructor to Martha's Vineyard on Friday nights, and returned on Sunday nights or Monday mornings.
13_9	0.13266144	The instructor, the pilot said, was not aboard the Saratoga on Friday night; he was in Europe.
13_10	0.13928057	Kennedy had been flying from Essex Airport for about a year, said James Paganelli, chairman of the Essex County Improvement Authority, speaking at a news conference at the airport.
13_11	0.094330987	About 350 planes are registered there, he said.
13_12	0.13427744	The pilot, who asked not to be identified by name, said he saw the Kennedy party preparing to depart Friday night at about 8:15.
13_13	0.2437964	Kennedy was dressed in white slacks and T-shirt; his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, wore black pants and black T-shirt, and another woman was wearing a beige dress, he said.
13_14	0.093013204	(Other reports said that Ms.
13_15	0.52767032	Bessette Kennedy's sister, Lauren Bessette, flew with them).
13_16	0.11152821	Kennedy appeared to have an injury to one foot or leg, the pilot said, and was ``pivoting around on one spot''.
13_17	0.093918455	He had what appeared from a distance to be a crutch, but was not using it, the other pilot said.
13_18	0.11778292	The plane's rudder is controlled with foot pedals.
13_19	0.12134497	It was not clear Saturday whether Kennedy's apparent injury might have affected his ability to control the plane.
13_20	0.10482935	The pilot said he had previously spoken to Kennedy about their mutual instructor.
13_21	0.10138781	``He always said he had an instructor fly with him a lot in the Saratoga,'' said the pilot.
13_22	0.096585215	``He may have been getting accustomed to a new plane, and trying to enhance his skills, even though he had the license''.
13_23	0.091530528	Aviation experts said he might have been practicing for obtaining an instrument rating.
13_24	0.11569726	The instructor, the pilot said, had said that ``he had a good time'' flying with Kennedy.
13_25	0.11067052	An air traffic controller, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Kennedy had been given clearance by the tower to take off, but had not contacted the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control, which would be the first air traffic control office with jurisdiction over a flight under instrument rules.
13_26	0.092998636	But under visual flight rules, which were in effect during the flight, if Kennedy chose to take responsibility himself for spotting other air traffic and staying a safe distance away, and if he did not need to ask about weather conditions ahead, he was under no obligation to check in.
13_27	0.11220856	Private planes commonly do not fly under air traffic control.
13_28	0.094667763	The plane carried a transponder, a device that automatically responds to a query from FAA radar, stating the airplane's identity and altitude.
13_29	0.097703262	But for private flights like this one, the transponder would be responding with a generic code meaning it was a general aviation flight and not giving its precise identity.
13_30	0.088303354	FAA technicians Saturday were sorting through all such flights the previous night.
13_31	0.18184108	Kennedy's Saratoga was almost new, the pilot said.
13_32	0.08836171	The Saratoga can carry six or seven people, including two people in the front, each of whom has flight controls.
13_33	0.099828526	The plane has a single, 300-horsepower, six-cylinder engine, a little bigger than an engine in a large car.
13_34	0.090176238	It can carry about 1,100 pounds, including people, baggage and fuel.

13_37	0.10875548	Small private airplanes typically do not carry cockpit voice recorders or flight data recorders, but accident investigators can usually determine from the wreckage such questions as whether the propeller was intact and rotating at impact, and whether the plane broke up in flight.
13_38	0.09139197	Radar can also give useful information, including the path of the descent.
14_0	0.39657881	WASHINGTON, July 21 (Xinhua) --The wreckage of John F.
14_1	0.66870077	Kennedy Jr.'s small plane was located Wednesday, with Kennedy's body still aboard, off the coast of Martha's Vineyard in the Massachusetts State of the United States, senior government sources said.
14_2	0.13502951	"They've got the fuselage and John Kennedy's in it," said a government source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation.
14_3	0.17402896	There was no immediate information about the bodies of Kennedy's wife and sister-in-law, who also were on board the plane when it crashed on July 16.
14_4	0.4736317	Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, and Coast Guard Rear Adm.
14_5	0.19614496	Richard Larrabee, who was overseeing the search, canceled a round of morning TV appearances and went to the USS Grasp, the ship where the wreckage was to be deposited after being raised from the ocean floor.
14_6	0.24068691	The heightened activity took place after ships from the Navy, Coast Guard and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration spent Tuesday night scouring a site 11 kilometers southwest of the Martha's Vineyard coast, a spot that investigators had speculated was the likely splash point for the plane.
14_7	0.95058846	The plane crashed while carrying Kennedy, 38, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her sister Lauren Bessette, 34.
14_8	0.24873572	Kennedy, the pilot, planned to drop off his sister-in-law on the island and continue to his cousin's wedding in Hyannis Port.
15_0	0.27420876	One of John F.
15_1	0.31849492	Kennedy Jr.'s flight instructors, believing him unprepared for a solo flight over water on a dark, hazy night, offered to fly with him on the night of Kennedy's fatal crash.
15_2	0.1516948	But Kennedy responded that he ``wanted to do it alone,'' the instructor told the National Transportation Safety Board.
15_3	0.15362515	The instructor's concerns and Kennedy's reply were revealed in the board's final report on the July 16, 1999, accident which was released Thursday.
15_4	0.42109397	The report concludes that, during the flight from New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard, Kennedy became disoriented in the hazy night over the Atlantic Ocean and lost control of his airplane, which crashed, killing him, his wife Carolyn, and her sister.
15_5	0.13428764	The report, like many issued by the NTSB in the wake of general aviation accidents, offers only a simple description of the accident's probable cause and never identifies the pilot, passengers, or persons interviewed by name.
15_6	0.13108991	But appended to the report is an unusual extended narrative portrait of Kennedy's skills as a pilot and his training.
15_7	0.33800614	The narrative reveals that Kennedy and his instructor had flown his Piper Saratoga II to Martha's Vineyard on the night of July 1 _ about two weeks before the crash _ when visibility was restricted at the island airport.
15_8	0.09143575	The instructor told investigators that Kennedy ``seemed competent. . . but may have had difficulty performing additional tasks under such conditions''.
15_9	0.1195267	The unnamed instructor told investigators he was not aware that Kennedy had ever previously flown the Saratoga without an instructor on board.
15_10	0.10778837	And he said he believed at the time that Kennedy would need additional training before he would be ready to be tested on flying by instruments alone.
15_11	0.13305472	The instructor ``also stated that he would not have felt comfortable with the accident pilot conducting night flight operations on a route similar to the one flown on, and in weather conditions similar to those that existed on the night of the accident.
15_12	0.1223633	The instructor further stated that he had talked to the pilot on the day of the accident and offered to fly with him on the accident flight.
15_13	0.096732028	He stated that the accident pilot replied that `he wanted to do it alone,' '' the report states.
15_14	0.1543527	The report, whose basic conclusions were revealed in news stories last month, states the accident was caused by ``the pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation.
15_15	0.093511014	Factors in the accident were haze, and the dark night''.
15_16	0.10149008	Spatial disorientation refers to the confusion that can occur when no horizon is visible and a pilot loses a sense of how the plane is headed.
15_17	0.16800234	The pilot may believe the plane is flying with wings level when it is out of control, or, conversely, feel that the plane is turning or rolling when it is not.
15_18	0.1185492	The NTSB findings confirm early speculation that pilot error caused the crash.
15_19	0.29035754	No mechanical problem with the aircraft was found after the wreckage was recovered in about 120 feet of water seven miles off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.
15_20	0.24974964	Kennedy's uncle, Senator Edward M.
15_21	0.10742097	Kennedy, had no comment on the report, a spokesman said.
15_22	0.15312761	The 24-page narrative appended to the NTSB report describes Kennedy as a generally competent pilot for his experience level _ he had more than 300 hours of flight time, with about 260 in the two years before the crash.
15_23	0.12154022	But, also in keeping with his level of experience and training, Kennedy was viewed as a pilot who could find it difficult to handle several cockpit tasks at once.
15_24	0.13609906	Kennedy also appears to have been eager to obtain a rating that would have permitted him to fly in poor visibility using only cockpit instruments for guidance _ the sort of skills he would have had to rely on the night of the crash.
15_25	0.041190748	On March 12, 1999, he completed the Federal Aviation Administration written test on airplane instruments and received a score of 78 percent, eight points above a passing grade.
15_26	0.078061821	And in April, he returned to Flight Safety International (where he had enrolled in 1998 in a pilot training program and got his license) in Florida to begin an instrument rating course.
15_27	0.071905558	Kennedy's instructor there told investigators that he had completed the first 12 of 25 lesson plans and had no problems until lesson 11, which is designed to develop a student's familiarity with radio beacon navigation aids while flying under guidance from air-traffic controllers.
15_28	0.096693322	It took him four attempts to pass that section.
15_29	0.1727506	The flight instructor ``stated that the pilot's basic instrument flying skills and simulator work were excellent,'' according to the report.
15_30	0.13076571	``However (the instructor) stated that the pilot had trouble managing multiple tasks while flying, which he felt was normal for the pilot's level of experience''.
15_31	0.13274328	Kennedy had flown his Piper Saratoga II airplane, which he bought in April 1999, for some 36 hours, fewer than 10 of them at night.
15_32	0.22770922	Most of the flights were with instructors from New Jersey, where the plane was based, and they included several flights from Caldwell, N.J., to Martha's Vineyard, at least one of which required the use of instruments to land.
15_33	0.13048112	Kennedy handled that feat, according to the report, but he needed assistance with the rudder pedals because of a broken ankle he suffered while hang gliding.
15_34	0.14124876	Another New Jersey flight instructor flew with Kennedy in several airplanes for 39 hours, including 21 at night, and nearly an hour in instrument conditions.
15_35	0.10060363	An unspecified amount of that flight time was in the Saratoga.
15_36	0.088118105	And still another flight instructor who signed Kennedy off in the high-performance Saratoga said that once or twice the airplane's autopilot turned to a heading other than the one selected, which required turning the autopilot off and then on again.
15_37	0.12667592	In the final moments of Kennedy's flight before it went into a steep dive, falling more than 4,700 feet per minute, the plane made some turns in course and changes in altitude that indicate either the autopilot was turned off or was malfunctioning.
15_38	0.11270751	Investigators also interviewed several pilots who flew that night.
15_39	0.22036195	The FAA told Kennedy that visual flight conditions existed all along the route, meaning that Kennedy did not technically need to have an instrument rating to continue his flight to the Vineyard, where he planned to drop off his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette.
15_40	0.40223698	John and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy then planned to continue on to Hyannis for the wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy.
15_41	0.2091794	One pilot flying to Nantucket told investigators that his global positioning system told him he was over Martha's Vineyard.
15_42	0.08799934	``He looked down and `there was nothing to see.
15_43	0.086670165	There was no horizon, no light.
15_44	0.10941409	. . . I turned left toward Martha's Vineyard to see if it was visible but could see no lights of any kind nor any evidence of the island.
15_45	0.091644472	. . . I thought the island might have suffered a power failure,' '' the report quotes the pilot as saying.
15_46	0.11558176	And as the pilot neared Nantucket, he turned on to a final approach and had to use his instruments because he could not hold his altitude by observations of the horizon or the ground.
15_47	0.10765636	The narrative also revealed that, earlier in the flight, Kennedy may have violated a rule requiring all pilots to contact air traffic and get clearance before entering controlled airspace around busy airports.
15_48	0.12860377	Apparently Kennedy's plane wandered into such airspace near the Westchester County Airport.
15_49	0.11509612	An American Airlines Fokker 100 was preparing to land when air-traffic controllers alerted the plane to an unidentified airplane nearby that was ``not talking to anybody''.

22_11	0.11800061	He said the move was based on four factors: the expected length of survival time in the 68-degree waters is just 12 to 18 hours; the plane had no emergency survival equipment; the two days of searching found nothing to indicate anyone had survived; and the NTSB's experience in assessing the probability of survival in this type of crash.
22_12	0.24915378	Meanwhile, federal safety investigators said a rare feature aboard Kennedy's small plane _ a voice recorder _ might provide clues to the Friday night crash.
22_13	0.12324198	Also Sunday, questions arose whether search and rescue operations might have begun five hours earlier had proper procedures been followed when a Martha's Vineyard Airport employee tried to alert authorities that the flight was overdue.
22_14	0.11029319	Even before Larrabee's announcement, the mood grew increasingly somber at the Kennedy family's Hyannis Port compound, where three priests clad in white celebrated Mass under a white tent.

22_19	0.12948117	At an afternoon press briefing, the chairman of the NTSB cautioned that the investigation into the crash would take six to nine months, and the cause might remain elusive.
22_20	0.09115693	``At this point we do not know.
22_21	0.093934362	We will not know for some time.
22_22	0.096246539	There is even a possibility we will never know,'' NTSB Chairman James Hall said.
22_23	0.14601898	Sunday, Coast Guard searchers turned up only bits of a headrest and foam insulation they believe came from Kennedy's single-engine airplane.
22_24	0.015777862	The insulation, in pieces ranging from 2 to 10 inches in diameter, were found along a mile-long stretch of beach by Aquinnah, an area known as Gay Head.
22_25	0.10540051	Coast Guard officials said widespread reports of an oil slick near the search area Sunday were unrelated.
22_26	0.16516001	On Saturday, investigators found a seat, a headrest, a nose wheel, several other airplane parts, a suitcase belonging to Lauren Bessette, and a prescription bottle belonging to Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.
22_27	0.12472523	Kennedy's six-seat Piper Saratoga II HP did not have ``black boxes,'' devices required on all commercial planes that record cockpit conversations and radio transmissions as well as many parameters of an airplane's performance.
22_28	0.11323749	However, Kennedy's plane did have a manual voice recorder, a device that is mostly unheard of on all but the most recent models of private planes.
22_29	0.16111363	The voice recorder, installed after the plane left the factory, would capture any radio transmissions and possibly some of Kennedy's utterances to his passengers, but would have had to be turned on by the pilot for it to operate.
22_30	0.088992439	It was unclear whether the recorder would yield much information.
22_31	0.2086486	An official with the NTSB, which assumed control of the investigation Sunday, said a review of radio traffic showed that ground controllers received no communications or distress calls from the plane in the last 40 minutes it was known to have been in the air.
22_32	0.14244912	Still, investigators were hoping that Kennedy turned on the recorder before he taxied out to takeoff and that it might capture something that air traffic controllers never heard _ a mayday call, or something that would reveal details of the final moments of the flight.
22_33	0.056155314	The NTSB assigned an investigator to track down the person who installed the device in an attempt to learn more about it, federal sources said.
22_34	0.25327653	Questions about the response time of the search effort were prompted by the actions Friday night of Adam Budd, a ramp attendent at the Martha's Vineyard Airport.
22_35	0.061046048	Budd, 21, of Sharon, Mass.
22_36	0.13036061	, said he waited with a couple and their young daughter for the Kennedy plane to arrive.
22_37	0.21886599	After 10 p.m., the anticipated arrival time, Budd said, he checked with the tower but was told there was no sign of the plane and there was no indication that Kennedy had radioed a request to land.
22_38	0.084378758	Budd said he then telephoned Bridgeport Automated Flight Service Station in Connecticut, an FAA-run facility where pilots sometimes file their flight plans.
22_39	0.12805757	Kennedy was not required to file a flight plan, and had not done so.
22_40	0.08502827	Budd said he talked to an operator at the Bridgeport station, whose toll-free number is well-known to area pilots.
22_41	0.083809845	``I told him the tail number (of Kennedy's plane), and I asked them if they had the tail number'' on a flight plan, Budd said.
22_42	0.096307723	The operator was unresponsive, Budd said: ``He just didn't want to talk to me''.
22_43	0.082791509	George Mackie, an operations supervisor at the Bridgeport station, said Sunday that Budd's call should have triggered a search by the center.
22_44	0.18628266	Even if a pilot is flying under visual flight rules, as Kennedy was, and has not filed a flight plan, the flight service is expected to begin searching for an aircraft once it has been identified as late, Mackie said.
22_45	0.081971525	``If someone calls us and tells us an airplane is late, we will begin a search that usually starts with telephone calls,'' he said.
22_46	0.069104923	The telephone inquiry usually consists of contacting small airports in the area, the FAA, and, eventually, the Air Force's Air Rescue Coordination Center in Virginia, Mackie said.
22_47	0.18682513	As it turned out, a search was not initiated until after a Kennedy family friend called the Coast Guard at Woods Hole at about 2:15 a.m.
22_48	0.095684993	Saturday. The first search vessel was launched at about 4:30 a.m.
22_49	0.10301305	The FAA, which oversees the Bridgeport center, has declined to comment on the investigation and the response time.
22_50	0.14370547	Excitement that the plane might have been found was triggered Sunday when Coast Guard officials said a beacon signal was heard at about 3:30 p.m. by a huge Air Force C-130 that has been providing in-flight air control for the intensive air, water, and land search that began early Saturday.
22_51	0.10199956	The Coast Guard immediately dispatched the Rude (pronounced Rudy), a 90-foot ship belonging to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration that is equipped with sonar capable of creating detailed images of objects beneath the surface.
22_52	0.11897122	Sunday night, however, Larrabbee said the beacon signal appeared to have been a false alarm, possibly set off by a marker the Coast Guard had placed in the water to keep track of areas already searched.
22_53	0.16675069	An earlier beacon signal picked up before dawn Saturday off Montauk, Long Island, also was said to be unrelated to the Kennedy search.

22_59	0.11960312	A friend of the Kennedy family said hope had dimmed by Saturday evening, and talk of survivors had been replaced by discussions of memorial services.
22_60	0.17092086	Inside the compound at Hyannis Port, where so many of the family's joys and tragedies have been played out, the Kennedys had no illusions about the news from Martha's Vineyard, family friends and associates said Sunday.

22_62	0.087500287	``It is obviously very difficult''.
22_63	0.10825407	Also Sunday, NTSB officials gave the most complete account to date of Kennedy's fateful flight.
22_64	0.17985185	Robert Pearce, an NTSB regional director who is heading the Kennedy investigation, said the plane took off at 8:38 p.m. from Runway 22 at Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J.
22_65	0.10979583	Kennedy had to make an immediate 180-degree turn to point his plane in a northeasterly direction.
22_66	0.072476041	He headed north at an altitude of 5,600 feet along the Connecticut coast.
22_67	0.090868969	He passed over Westerly, R.I., at 9:26 p.m., at that same altitude.
22_68	0.14248738	He then began his descent toward Martha's Vineyard, though Pearce said his precise rate of descent was not clear.
22_69	0.1593254	At 9:40 p.m., two radar stations at Cape Cod picked up the plane at 2,500 feet, 17 or 18 miles west of Martha's Vineyard Airport, which means he was about 10 or 11 miles off the island's coast.
22_70	0.11518602	During the next 29 seconds, the plane dropped from 2,500 to 1,800 feet.
22_71	0.089433497	After that point _ at 9:40:29 p.m.

23_6	0.10658051	What was the original schedule for Kennedy's flight?
23_7	0.24956909	A. Kennedy took off from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J. at 8:38 p.m.
23_8	0.47734975	Friday night, flying a Piper Saratoga single-engine plane.
23_9	0.81915601	On board were Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren.
23_10	0.23905449	The flight was expected to arrive at Martha's Vineyard Airport at about 10 p.m., but never did.
23_11	0.24941628	The last radar signal from Kennedy's plane was received at 9:38 p.m., as the plane made its approach into Martha's Vineyard.
23_12	0.0059128578	&QL; &QL; Q.
23_13	0.1053467	What were the conditions at the time of the flight?
23_14	0.18547339	A. According to the National Weather Service, visibility at Essex County Airport was 4-5 miles in haze, with clear skies, at about the time Kennedy took off.
23_15	0.1035848	Those are considered marginal conditions for the use of Visual Flight Rules: piloting a plane by using visual or ground references to guide you.
23_16	0.087713104	If visibility is 1,000 to 3,000 miles and the cloud ceiling is between 500 and 1,000 feet, pilots are required to use Instrument Flight Rules, using a plane's mechanical systems to guide the flight.
23_17	0.12628539	Flying under IFR requires additional certification, which Kennedy did not have.
23_18	0.094393187	Flight instructors say hazy conditions are difficult for VFR flying, especially at night, and especially over the water, where pilots have no visual reference points to guide them.
23_19	0.31207964	At the time Kennedy was due to arrive at Martha's Vineyard, visibility had improved, increasing to 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.
23_20	0.013897798	&QL; &QL; Q.
23_21	0.14718457	Are runway lights on at the Martha's Vineyard Airport at all times?
23_22	0.16109602	A. The lights would have been on as Kennedy's plane made its final approach to Martha's Vineyard at about 9:30 p.m.
23_23	0.087847276	Lights are turned off when the airport tower closes at 10 p.m., but pilots can turn them on by radio.

23_25	0.023173203	&QL; &QL; Q.
23_26	0.14587766	Should anyone in the airport have been concerned that Kennedy's flight did not arrive, or that his radar dropped off?
23_27	0.095510211	A. Probably not.
23_28	0.22968963	Kennedy was not required to file a flight plan for his trip to Martha's Vineyard.
23_29	0.10480385	If a plane has not filed a flight plan, and is not in radio contract with controllers, any deviation would not cause alarm.
23_30	0.15719551	It is unclear whether Kennedy communicated with the control tower at Martha's Vineyard.

23_35	0.11716311	have? A.
23_36	0.12513613	Kennedy received his basic pilot's license two years ago in Florida, and frequently flew in his Cessna Skyline 182.
23_37	0.11441606	In April, he purchased the Piper Saratoga plane, which has far more engine power and requires additional training to fly.
23_38	0.048305686	&QL; &QL; Q.
23_39	0.089631141	What are the requirements for flight certification?
23_40	0.078829669	A. To receive an initial certification, a student pilot must complete a written exam, log at least 40 hours of flight time, and pass a final ``check ride'' with an FAA examiner.
23_41	0.072289443	Most students log 60 or 70 hours before seeking certification.
23_42	0.10105127	To fly a plane with complex gear or a more powerful engine, a student needs further instruction and the endorsement of a flight instructor.
23_43	0.098307023	It is not known now whether Kennedy received additional instruction before or after buying a more powerful plane.
23_44	0.055347581	&QL; &QL; Q.
23_45	0.10103265	Is there anything special about the type of plane Kennedy was flying, and what is its safety record?
23_46	0.094685665	A. The Piper Saratoga II is a 300-horsepower six-seater with a maximum speed of 192 knots and a cruising range of 188 nautical miles, or about five hours of flying time if the fuel tanks are topped off.
