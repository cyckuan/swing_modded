1_2	0.28442696	Kennedy Jr.'s powerful single-engine aircraft plummeted toward the Atlantic Ocean at 4,700 feet per minute in the seconds before the fatal crash that killed him, his wife and her sister, federal officials said Monday.
1_3	0.19289833	Although officials with the National Transportation Safety Board were coy about characterizing the descent rate, it was far faster than first believed and other pilots said that it would have been virtually impossible for Kennedy to have pulled his Piper Saratoga II HP out of such a freefall.
1_4	0.12350458	``That airplane would not come down that fast in any normal configuration,'' said Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.
1_5	0.095045311	``The normal rate of descent you're shooting for as a pilot is 500 to 700 feet per minute for passenger comfort''.
1_6	0.19396852	NTSB officials released more information Monday from additional radar data received from a Nantucket airport that showed Kennedy's plane dropped 1,100 feet in only 14 seconds on that hazy Friday night as the plane flew about four miles southwest of Martha's Vineyard on its final approach to the island's airport.
1_7	0.13184406	Robert Pearce, the NTSB's chief investigator in the case, said the new numbers paint ``a different picture'' for investigators, but he and others with the NTSB declined to characterize the plane's rapid descent as being out of control.
1_8	0.14857671	Searchers recovered other small pieces of debris from the crash, but failed to pinpoint the plane's underwater location.
1_9	0.14048516	Although investigators believe they have several promising sites within the 24-square-mile ``target area'' off the Martha's Vineyard coast, a team of 10 divers from the Massachusetts State Police were unable to find the main portion of the wreckage.
1_10	0.083127708	Police divers will be joined this morning by the USS Grasp, a Navy salvage and recovery vessel based in Little Creek, Va.
1_11	0.085090044	The Grasp, with a crew of 100 _ including 22 Navy divers _ arrived at the scene Monday afternoon, but dive preparations were not concluded in time to send divers into the 68-degree waters.
1_12	0.065765245	Those divers are expected to search the area this morning, weather permitting.
1_13	0.081484207	Capt. Jack Gallant, a public information officer with the Navy, said the divers would make tethered dives, meaning they would not be as limited in time and depth as divers with oxygen tanks might be.
1_14	0.083329386	Should the wreckage be located, Gallant said, the Grasp would be able to bring it to the surface, using a 40-foot crane with a 200-foot depth capacity.

1_17	0.088315945	Richard Larrabee said that, while Monday had been primarily ``a day of preparation,'' today's operations would be ``extensive''.
1_18	0.22146481	Several other ships from the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will join in the operation.
1_19	0.41929625	Federal investigators with the NTSB have been interviewing witnesses at the Essex County Airport in New Jersey, from which the 38-year-old Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her 34-year-old sister, Lauren Bessette departed Friday night.
1_20	0.13683851	Based on those interviews and on the few maintenance records investigators have reviewed, there appears to have been no obvious mechanical problems with the plane, which Kennedy bought for a reported $300,000 only three months ago.
1_21	0.24113637	Pearce said witnesses led investigators to believe most of the plane's maintenance records were on board at the time of the crash.
1_22	0.14229188	However, an annual inspection of the 1996 model plane was conducted June 28 and showed that the plane had logged only 622 flight hours since its manufacture.
1_23	0.16232779	Kennedy last refueled the plane on July 11, topping off the tank with 62 gallons.
1_24	0.10877098	Pearce said there were no indications that the plane had been flown between that refueling and Friday's fatal crash.
1_25	0.13298062	Pearce also noted that the plane's magnetic compass was readjusted two days later.
1_26	0.10322773	Because no witnesses have reported seeing or hearing the plane anywhere along its flight path after its takeoff at 7:38 p.m.
1_27	0.10600998	EDT, investigators are unable to determine what type of trouble Kennedy may have had.
1_28	0.24825744	NTSB officials also confirmed Monday that Kennedy's plane was equipped with a relatively new voice recorder.
1_29	0.18625902	Pearce said the recorder appears to have been the type that records the last radio transmissions made from the plane, although it was unknown if Kennedy, a novice pilot, was familiar with the equipment.
1_30	0.090786422	Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the NTSB, said Monday that, when operating, the system is automatically activated every time the microphone key is depressed.
1_31	0.13566927	In the meantime, as the reality of the tragedy of the three deaths finally became obvious Monday, the families of the victims briefly broke their silence.

5_5	0.12516831	But experts in airplane crashes said those bits of debris, and the radar signals that tracked Kennedy's plane just before it disappeared Friday night, are enough to confirm a much-feared fact: that a plane could not have survived such a crash intact.
5_6	0.080812926	``If you're finding the airplane in parts, that means it has come apart,'' said Arthur Alan Wolk, a Philadelphia pilot and lawyer who specializes in air crash cases.
5_7	0.05789165	``It's no longer a single airplane''.
5_8	0.11346138	Kennedy's plane followed a familiar trajectory as it fell into the ocean, Wolk said _ so common that air crash investigators have given it the macabre name ``graveyard spiral''.
5_9	0.10501676	It begins, Wolk said, when one wing dips down and the plane no longer generates upward lift.
5_10	0.09781775	The nose points downward as the plane begins to plunge at ever-increasing speed.
5_11	0.091391782	To escape such a catastrophic dive, Wolk added, a pilot must try to level the wings, reduce speed, and lift the nose back above the horizon.
5_12	0.12479676	But Kennedy, who had already started his descent toward Martha's Vineyard, had less than 30 seconds, according to Wolk's calculations of radar records of the doomed flight, to do all this before he hit the water _ not enough time to pull out of a steep dive.
5_13	0.13624715	His plane would have been traveling at least 4,500 feet per minute when it crashed, Wolk said.
5_14	0.086091358	``It's almost like landing on pavement at that point,'' said Len Carroll, operations manager at Wiggins Airport in Norwood, Mass..
5_15	0.15267691	Finding more debris or any signs of Kennedy, his wife, and sister-in law might take some time, Carroll said.
5_16	0.17151862	In similar crashes off the Martha's Vineyard coast, Carroll said, locating wreckages has sometimes taken weeks.
5_17	0.080157792	Tides and currents can carry debris far from a crash site, he said.
5_18	0.1621159	And the depth of the water _ 25 feet to 100 feet _ where Kennedy's plane is believed to have plunged makes a search more difficult.
5_19	0.085349837	From above the water's surface, it is hard to see objects that have sunk below 10 feet.
5_20	0.15719023	Federal investigators cautioned Sunday that the search could take months and that the cause of the crash might never be determined.
5_21	0.083649059	But that didn't stop amateur pilots from speculating over what could have gone wrong.
5_22	0.12722996	Intense discussion has focused on Kennedy's relative inexperience in the cockpit, the difficult visibility on a hazy, moonless night and Kennedy's recent upgrade to a more powerful plane than the one he'd used for flight training.
5_23	0.12429676	But Wolk believes the facts, so far, suggest that airplane malfunction was as likely a potential cause of the crash as pilot error.
5_24	0.091563169	A sudden change in altitude after a seemingly normal flight could indicate, Wolk said, one of several mechanical errors: a malfunction of the autopilot, the ``artificial horizon'' that feeds information to the autopilot, or the vacuum pumps that drive the plane's gyroscopic information.
5_25	0.093592632	``All of these small planes have a long history of malfunction of various components,'' Wolk said.
5_26	0.1675399	Kennedy's plane may have crashed, he said, because of ``something that suddenly overcame him''.
5_27	0.079184603	But Carroll said physical malfunctions are far less common than pilot error.

6_7	0.11594636	Kennedy purchased his new plane _ a 1996 model Piper Saratoga II TC, a 300-horsepower, single-engine six-seater _ in April for an estimated $300,000.

6_13	0.1022875	Then he ``traded up'' to the Saratoga, doubtless looking for more carrying capacity and power, fellow pilots say.
6_14	0.1050096	The Saratoga has state-of-the-art equipment, including an automatic pilot.

6_21	0.15481579	Kennedy was not licensed to fly using instruments only, did not have a flight instructor accompanying him and may have had an injured foot as well _ although one N.J.-based pilot, Larry Lorenzo, said Kennedy could have operated the rudder pedals on the plane fairly easily.
6_22	0.069528898	``If he could walk, he could fly''.
6_23	0.15709713	Kennedy also didn't file a flight plan with authorities, though he was not required to, and did not ask for a private service that tracks private flights, either.
6_24	0.070550944	``He shouldn't have been in the air, in my opinion.
6_25	0.074626292	He should have been at home or in a bus or a train,'' Goulian said.
6_26	0.086092379	``That was a bad judgment call, to leave, especially that late at night.
6_27	0.067314825	From what I hear it was a horrible night''.
6_28	0.099115286	The less-than-perfect visibility conditions _ known in flying parlance as ``marginal VFR (visual flight rules),'' made Kennedy's trip more challenging than normal, agreed Warren Morningstar, director of media relations for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, a general aviation lobbying group.
6_29	0.091259194	Pilots under those conditions would have ``a more difficult time discerning the horizon.
6_30	0.10770806	The ability to see the horizon, or having a view of the ground, is needed for spatial oreintation to keep the plane upright,'' Morningstar said.
6_31	0.096581211	Concerning the more powerful aircraft, Goulian said, ``you just adjust to the performance capability of the airplane, and you need the experience level to keep up with it.

6_35	0.11432628	Morningstar said the Saratoga ``is not the sort of plane you would want to learn to fly in, but it should not be a handful for a low-time pilot who had proper training in the aircraft.

13_4	0.14350457	Public records show that he was still a flight student in December 1997.
13_5	0.17251284	He apparently did not have an instrument rating, meaning that he was not qualified to fly in conditions that required reliance on instrument navigation, but the weather on Friday night was suitable for a pilot of his rating.
13_6	0.10272069	The flight may have been challenging, though, authorities said, because on the most direct route, the distance to shore far exceeds the distance that the plane could glide if the single engine failed.

16_4	0.37361559	Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board's investigation continues.
16_5	0.14388595	One source close to the probe said that all the wreckage of the Piper Saratoga HP II had been brought up, including the crumbled fuselage and the cockpit panel.
16_6	0.13169946	The panel, which contains the flight instruments, including plane's air-speed indicator and attitude indicator, could provide a wealth of information on the plane's performance at the moment it hit the water.
16_7	0.13506483	All three victims were probably alive when the plane hit, but died instantaneously, according to the report of Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner Richard J.
16_8	0.087551979	Evans. After an examination that occurred sometime within a four-hour period, Evans reported that all of them died from ``multiple traumatic injuries''.
16_9	0.10310588	But investigators would not comment further on the condition of the bodies or the details of coroner's report.
16_10	0.15861309	And they would not say whether their study yielded insight into the biggest lingering question: Why Kennedy lost control of his plane the night of July 16.
16_11	0.1209	The autopsy of a pilot or a passenger in a plane crash is usually less complex than that of a murder victim, experts in forensic pathology said Thursday.
16_12	0.13003763	The cause of death is generally known, and the bodies often don't lead investigators closer to the cause of the wreck.
16_13	0.12607557	Still, the autopsies in the Kennedy case were performed especially quickly, pathologists said.
16_14	0.10902666	The remains were taken to a Bourne hospital at about 7:15 p.m. on Wednesday night, and released to the victims' families at 11 p.m., according to the medical examiner's office and the Cape &AMP; Islands District Attorney's office.
16_15	0.084770569	Many jurisdictions refuse to perform autopsies at night, said Robert Kirschner, a former deputy chief medical examiner for Cook County, Ill.
16_16	0.072826531	The haste in this case, he said, could lead to questions about the investigation's thoroughness.
16_17	0.070929536	In a high-profile case, he said, the pressures are high, and so are the risks of carelessness.
16_18	0.22833801	He pointed to other ``autopsies associated with the Kennedy family'' _ the botched investigation that followed President John F.
16_19	0.15838522	Kennedy's assassination, and the questions surrounding the death of Mary Jo Kopechne 30 years ago, in the Martha's Vineyard car crash that has come to be known as Chappaquiddick.
16_20	0.087923653	``You can't let. . .those kinds of pressures alter your routines,'' he said.
16_21	0.09888295	``If you alter your procedure and do things differently, then you're always going to run into problems''.
16_22	0.087200198	Still, Jay Dix, chief medical examiner for several Missouri counties, said autopsies can usually be completed anywhere from 45 minutes to several hours, depending on the circumstances of the death.
16_23	0.10560605	In a plane crash case, pathologists first try to determine whether a medical condition, such as heart disease or a brain rupture, could have led the pilot to lose control, Kirschner said.
16_24	0.12707458	Examiners might look at the pilot's lower extremities, checking for the impact of a rudder on the bottom of a shoe, or some other sign of what the pilot was doing.
16_25	0.097722743	Pathologists also follow a complex set of rules that govern the testing of a pilot for drug and alcohol use, Dix said.
16_26	0.1034992	After every plane crash, the NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration send investigating pathologists a box of containers and bags, used to collect a series of specimens.
16_27	0.11719311	Autopsies of the plane's passengers aren't always needed, Dix said, though pathologists will usually perform x-rays to determine the victims' injuries.
16_28	0.10480015	Passenger autopsies are also useful, Kirschner said, if a victim's family sues for damages related to the crash.
16_29	0.11645871	A medical examiner could determine whether the victim suffered in the moments before death, or survived in the minutes or hours after the crash.
16_30	0.28329093	The timing of the Kennedy investigation, Kirschner said, makes it highly unlikely that pathologists performed autopsies on Carolyn Bessette Kennedy or Lauren Bessette.
16_31	0.086069446	``You can't possibly do three investigations in four hours,'' he said.
16_32	0.13193258	Still, Dix said, the speed of the investigation, and the fact that it was performed at night, probably won't affect the results.
16_33	0.066115943	``You have qualified people doing it,'' he said.
16_34	0.11408505	Signals from the authorities in the Kennedy case _ the local district attorney and the state coroner _ indicate an unusual intensity to complete the autopsy, presumably in time for the burial.
16_35	0.074877644	Officials were especially reluctant to give out information on Thursday, citing concern for the families.
16_36	0.080824214	Deference to a family, especially a famous family, is typical and reasonable, Kirschner said.
16_37	0.070449276	``You just have to be careful not to be too deferential,'' he said.
16_38	0.078802254	``Because when you're too deferential, you're not thinking of the things you should be thinking of.''

17_8	0.03299503	No one has seen it since.
17_9	0.1123119	Although his trip to Massachusetts was routine, the series of decisions Kennedy made that night _ flying a complex aircraft without a flight plan, choosing not to have his flight instructor accompany him in marginal weather conditions, and piloting an airplane with a foot injury _ have grown in significance against the backdrop of a massive search-and-rescue operation under way just off Aquinnah, Mass.
17_10	0.11574692	The Piper Saratoga vanished from radar screens after a rapid descent at 9:38 p.m.
17_11	0.21301172	Friday, about an hour into his flight and about 17 miles away from Martha's Vineyard airport.
17_12	0.08799854	Sunday, searchers recovered bits of the aircraft's fuselage and interior; on Saturday, they had found a wheel strut and a piece of canvas luggage with one of Lauren Bissette's business cards attached.
17_13	0.14484184	While Kennedy had not mastered all the intricacies of the plane's equipment, officials hope he was familiar with at least one: the cockpit voice recording equipment that had been installed in the Saratoga by its first owner in 1997.
17_14	0.1290146	``It was an easy on-off switch,'' said Munir Hussein, its second owner, who sold the plane to Kennedy through a broker in April for $300,000.
17_15	0.060032063	``I used it several times and it worked perfectly''.
17_16	0.11160293	Investigators say the recorder, which captures the words of a pilot uttered both on the radio and within the cockpit, can shed light on what could have caused the plane to dive 700 feet in 29 seconds and apparently plunge into the Atlantic Ocean just off Aquinnah, known as Gay Head.
17_17	0.14270402	The details of what happened in the hour before Kennedy's plane disappeared may not be known until _ or unless _ the aircraft is recovered.
17_18	0.10687137	But investigators do know the flight seemed routine until the very end, according to the review of radar tapes from at least a half-dozen Federal Aviation Adminsitration facilities along the south coast of New England.
17_19	0.10731569	Kennedy had intended to make a daytime flight Friday, but was delayed when his sister-in-law couldn't leave work early enough, and he encountered traffic coming out of New York, the Associated Press quoted a friend as saying.
17_20	0.13677107	But family friends told the Globe they believed Kennedy had planned to leave when he did.
17_21	0.12297707	After takeoff, Kennedy cruised eastward, flying at 5,500 feet, a standard altitude for a plane flying east under visual flight rules, procedures that govern pilots who are qualified only to fly by what they can see.
17_22	0.094269846	As he flew through gathering darkness, only a few stars emerged through the haze, and a slim crescent moon glowed in the night sky.
17_23	0.13400829	Two other pilots familiar with Kennedy's flight experience _ fewer than 100 hours of time alone _ shook their heads as his plane lifted off.
17_24	0.14170862	They knew that Kennedy was learning to fly the Saratoga by instruments alone, but that he wasn't yet qualified to do it on a solo flight.
17_25	0.11870468	In fact, Kennedy told a business associate in Canada last Monday that for the time being, he'd rather fly with a copilot because his broken foot made it difficult for him to operate pedals controlling the plane's rudder.
17_26	0.18553921	Radar stations along the southern New England coast tracked the plane.
17_27	0.14827839	But because Kennedy chose not to file an official flight plan, and had no contact with air-traffic controllers after leaving New Jersey, no one knew his precise route _ or that he was piloting the airplane.
17_28	0.23025617	Warren Morningstar, a private pilot and spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, said it was not unusual for a pilot to fly without filing a plan.
17_29	0.10907131	Still, Morningstar said, ``a flight plan is really an insurance policy, not an air traffic control document''.
17_30	0.1037361	``Would a VFR flight plan have started search and rescue earlier''? he said.
17_31	0.044066642	``Yes, it probably would have''.
17_32	0.1303973	But for most of Kennedy's flight, everything went smoothly.
17_33	0.19553772	At 9:39, nearly an hour after it had taken off from New Jersey, Kennedy's plane was about 10 minutes away from the Martha's Vineyard airport when it began a sudden and steady descent.
17_34	0.15762855	Over the next 29 seconds, the plane dropped 700 feet.
17_35	0.068314771	It then disappeared from all radar screens.
17_36	0.38712097	Investigators said Sunday that the air controllers at the Martha's Vineyard airport did not realize that Kennedy's plane was overdue until sometime Saturday morning.
17_37	0.2191395	The air-traffic controller at Martha's Vineyard airport was scheduled to leave at 10 p.m.

18_0	0.25561457	In a final report issued Thursday on last year's July 19 crash of the aircraft near Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts State, the United States,the NTSB said Kennedy, son of the late U.S. president, had become disorientated during a descent over water at night.
18_1	0.88421689	Killed were Kennedy, 38, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her 34-year-old sister, Lauren Bessette.
18_2	0.2234918	The crash probably occurred because of "the pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night," the report said.
18_3	0.15024821	Kennedy's piloting difficulties were likely to have been caused by "spatial disorientation," a problem when pilots lose track of the position and motion of their plane relative to the earth's surface, it added.
18_4	0.11166437	This type of disorientation is one of the leading causes of fatal aircraft accidents, according to a U.S.

20_3	0.16489649	The plane was small but powerful, the conditions tough for navigation.
20_4	0.20892079	The disappearance of Kennedy's plane has raised familiar questions about the rules regarding flights, the safety of flying small aircraft, and the weather conditions that might have made Kennedy's flight especially difficult.
20_5	0.15125091	Here are some of the issues that may have come in to play when Kennedy's six-seater plane took off from New Jersey: &QL; &QL; Q.
20_6	0.15482523	What was the original schedule for Kennedy's flight?
20_7	0.23654468	A. Kennedy took off from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J. at 8:38 p.m.
20_8	0.36233111	Friday night, flying a Piper Saratoga single-engine plane.
20_9	0.99254696	On board were Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren.
20_10	0.29872985	The flight was expected to arrive at Martha's Vineyard Airport at about 10 p.m., but never did.
20_11	0.34763274	The last radar signal from Kennedy's plane was received at 9:38 p.m., as the plane made its approach into Martha's Vineyard.
20_12	0.046086471	&QL; &QL; Q.
20_13	0.15355227	What were the conditions at the time of the flight?
20_14	0.14832406	A. According to the National Weather Service, visibility at Essex County Airport was 4-5 miles in haze, with clear skies, at about the time Kennedy took off.
20_15	0.12036213	Those are considered marginal conditions for the use of Visual Flight Rules: piloting a plane by using visual or ground references to guide you.
20_16	0.096601752	If visibility is 1,000 to 3,000 miles and the cloud ceiling is between 500 and 1,000 feet, pilots are required to use Instrument Flight Rules, using a plane's mechanical systems to guide the flight.
20_17	0.15919964	Flying under IFR requires additional certification, which Kennedy did not have.
20_18	0.10916153	Flight instructors say hazy conditions are difficult for VFR flying, especially at night, and especially over the water, where pilots have no visual reference points to guide them.
20_19	0.26748098	At the time Kennedy was due to arrive at Martha's Vineyard, visibility had improved, increasing to 10 miles, according to the National Weather Service.
20_20	0.061403783	&QL; &QL; Q.
20_21	0.21541233	Are runway lights on at the Martha's Vineyard Airport at all times?
20_22	0.22966245	A. The lights would have been on as Kennedy's plane made its final approach to Martha's Vineyard at about 9:30 p.m.
20_23	0.10944724	Lights are turned off when the airport tower closes at 10 p.m., but pilots can turn them on by radio.
20_24	0.058042802	The airport operates 24 hours a day.
20_25	0.066480094	&QL; &QL; Q.
20_26	0.20795267	Should anyone in the airport have been concerned that Kennedy's flight did not arrive, or that his radar dropped off?
20_27	0.078337086	A. Probably not.
20_28	0.44477099	Kennedy was not required to file a flight plan for his trip to Martha's Vineyard.
20_29	0.11900631	If a plane has not filed a flight plan, and is not in radio contract with controllers, any deviation would not cause alarm.
20_30	0.24139024	It is unclear whether Kennedy communicated with the control tower at Martha's Vineyard.
20_31	0.093722705	Airport officials Saturday declined to comment.

20_35	0.038156082	have? A.
20_36	0.12133932	Kennedy received his basic pilot's license two years ago in Florida, and frequently flew in his Cessna Skyline 182.
20_37	0.13179457	In April, he purchased the Piper Saratoga plane, which has far more engine power and requires additional training to fly.
20_38	0.063458006	&QL; &QL; Q.
20_39	0.06072894	What are the requirements for flight certification?
20_40	0.091420688	A. To receive an initial certification, a student pilot must complete a written exam, log at least 40 hours of flight time, and pass a final ``check ride'' with an FAA examiner.
20_41	0.071572709	Most students log 60 or 70 hours before seeking certification.
20_42	0.11623228	To fly a plane with complex gear or a more powerful engine, a student needs further instruction and the endorsement of a flight instructor.
20_43	0.11121222	It is not known now whether Kennedy received additional instruction before or after buying a more powerful plane.
20_44	0.059677408	&QL; &QL; Q.
20_45	0.13567838	Is there anything special about the type of plane Kennedy was flying, and what is its safety record?
20_46	0.088162183	A. The Piper Saratoga II is a 300-horsepower six-seater with a maximum speed of 192 knots and a cruising range of 188 nautical miles, or about five hours of flying time if the fuel tanks are topped off.

20_53	0.073258917	There is no flight data recorder as with large commercial jets.
20_54	0.11749737	Since 1996, the Saratoga has been involved in 118 accidents or incidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, and 26 crashes in which a fatality occured.
21_0	0.6557719	One of John F.
21_1	0.29355983	Kennedy Jr.'s flight instructors, believing him unprepared for a solo flight over water on a dark, hazy night, offered to fly with him on the night of Kennedy's fatal crash.
21_2	0.22634293	But Kennedy responded that he ``wanted to do it alone,'' the instructor told the National Transportation Safety Board.
21_3	0.17794832	The instructor's concerns and Kennedy's reply were revealed in the board's final report on the July 16, 1999, accident which was released Thursday.
21_4	0.34700723	The report concludes that, during the flight from New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard, Kennedy became disoriented in the hazy night over the Atlantic Ocean and lost control of his airplane, which crashed, killing him, his wife Carolyn, and her sister.
21_5	0.12238126	The report, like many issued by the NTSB in the wake of general aviation accidents, offers only a simple description of the accident's probable cause and never identifies the pilot, passengers, or persons interviewed by name.
21_6	0.20066623	But appended to the report is an unusual extended narrative portrait of Kennedy's skills as a pilot and his training.
21_7	0.26316088	The narrative reveals that Kennedy and his instructor had flown his Piper Saratoga II to Martha's Vineyard on the night of July 1 _ about two weeks before the crash _ when visibility was restricted at the island airport.
21_8	0.12565028	The instructor told investigators that Kennedy ``seemed competent. . . but may have had difficulty performing additional tasks under such conditions''.
21_9	0.15652857	The unnamed instructor told investigators he was not aware that Kennedy had ever previously flown the Saratoga without an instructor on board.
21_10	0.13160293	And he said he believed at the time that Kennedy would need additional training before he would be ready to be tested on flying by instruments alone.
21_11	0.11488247	The instructor ``also stated that he would not have felt comfortable with the accident pilot conducting night flight operations on a route similar to the one flown on, and in weather conditions similar to those that existed on the night of the accident.
21_12	0.16586555	The instructor further stated that he had talked to the pilot on the day of the accident and offered to fly with him on the accident flight.
21_13	0.090317025	He stated that the accident pilot replied that `he wanted to do it alone,' '' the report states.
21_14	0.12705859	The report, whose basic conclusions were revealed in news stories last month, states the accident was caused by ``the pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation.
21_15	0.079552815	Factors in the accident were haze, and the dark night''.
21_16	0.11274394	Spatial disorientation refers to the confusion that can occur when no horizon is visible and a pilot loses a sense of how the plane is headed.
21_17	0.18196841	The pilot may believe the plane is flying with wings level when it is out of control, or, conversely, feel that the plane is turning or rolling when it is not.
21_18	0.12038987	The NTSB findings confirm early speculation that pilot error caused the crash.
21_19	0.24635043	No mechanical problem with the aircraft was found after the wreckage was recovered in about 120 feet of water seven miles off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.
21_20	0.14131534	Kennedy's uncle, Senator Edward M.
21_21	0.12709587	Kennedy, had no comment on the report, a spokesman said.
21_22	0.13437595	The 24-page narrative appended to the NTSB report describes Kennedy as a generally competent pilot for his experience level _ he had more than 300 hours of flight time, with about 260 in the two years before the crash.
21_23	0.12402228	But, also in keeping with his level of experience and training, Kennedy was viewed as a pilot who could find it difficult to handle several cockpit tasks at once.
21_24	0.12870065	Kennedy also appears to have been eager to obtain a rating that would have permitted him to fly in poor visibility using only cockpit instruments for guidance _ the sort of skills he would have had to rely on the night of the crash.
21_25	0.090057234	On March 12, 1999, he completed the Federal Aviation Administration written test on airplane instruments and received a score of 78 percent, eight points above a passing grade.
21_26	0.094821273	And in April, he returned to Flight Safety International (where he had enrolled in 1998 in a pilot training program and got his license) in Florida to begin an instrument rating course.
21_27	0.10013151	Kennedy's instructor there told investigators that he had completed the first 12 of 25 lesson plans and had no problems until lesson 11, which is designed to develop a student's familiarity with radio beacon navigation aids while flying under guidance from air-traffic controllers.
21_28	0.087741058	It took him four attempts to pass that section.
21_29	0.18655703	The flight instructor ``stated that the pilot's basic instrument flying skills and simulator work were excellent,'' according to the report.
21_30	0.12933946	``However (the instructor) stated that the pilot had trouble managing multiple tasks while flying, which he felt was normal for the pilot's level of experience''.
21_31	0.12605314	Kennedy had flown his Piper Saratoga II airplane, which he bought in April 1999, for some 36 hours, fewer than 10 of them at night.
21_32	0.20751081	Most of the flights were with instructors from New Jersey, where the plane was based, and they included several flights from Caldwell, N.J., to Martha's Vineyard, at least one of which required the use of instruments to land.
21_33	0.1283454	Kennedy handled that feat, according to the report, but he needed assistance with the rudder pedals because of a broken ankle he suffered while hang gliding.
21_34	0.13434209	Another New Jersey flight instructor flew with Kennedy in several airplanes for 39 hours, including 21 at night, and nearly an hour in instrument conditions.
21_35	0.10729245	An unspecified amount of that flight time was in the Saratoga.
21_36	0.10418507	And still another flight instructor who signed Kennedy off in the high-performance Saratoga said that once or twice the airplane's autopilot turned to a heading other than the one selected, which required turning the autopilot off and then on again.
21_37	0.12443101	In the final moments of Kennedy's flight before it went into a steep dive, falling more than 4,700 feet per minute, the plane made some turns in course and changes in altitude that indicate either the autopilot was turned off or was malfunctioning.
21_38	0.10022438	Investigators also interviewed several pilots who flew that night.
21_39	0.20881918	The FAA told Kennedy that visual flight conditions existed all along the route, meaning that Kennedy did not technically need to have an instrument rating to continue his flight to the Vineyard, where he planned to drop off his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette.
21_40	0.45395046	John and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy then planned to continue on to Hyannis for the wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy.
21_41	0.20688976	One pilot flying to Nantucket told investigators that his global positioning system told him he was over Martha's Vineyard.
21_42	0.056584853	``He looked down and `there was nothing to see.
21_43	0.041639444	There was no horizon, no light.
21_44	0.12370974	. . . I turned left toward Martha's Vineyard to see if it was visible but could see no lights of any kind nor any evidence of the island.
21_45	0.1036046	. . . I thought the island might have suffered a power failure,' '' the report quotes the pilot as saying.
21_46	0.11407812	And as the pilot neared Nantucket, he turned on to a final approach and had to use his instruments because he could not hold his altitude by observations of the horizon or the ground.
21_47	0.1122612	The narrative also revealed that, earlier in the flight, Kennedy may have violated a rule requiring all pilots to contact air traffic and get clearance before entering controlled airspace around busy airports.
21_48	0.14901435	Apparently Kennedy's plane wandered into such airspace near the Westchester County Airport.
21_49	0.1046634	An American Airlines Fokker 100 was preparing to land when air-traffic controllers alerted the plane to an unidentified airplane nearby that was ``not talking to anybody''.
21_50	0.11544804	The planes were close enough that the on-board traffic collision avoidance system sounded an alert on the American Airlines plane.
21_51	0.083813332	No course correction was required and the American plane landed safely.
21_52	0.12884086	The NTSB report indicates that a review of radar data correlated the unknown aircraft with the track of Kennedy's final flight .

22_47	0.17785615	That, combined with an analysis of information captured by air-control radar towers, focused the search efforts along a 17-mile expanse of water southwest of Martha's Vineyard, the resort community where Kennedy had planned to drop off Lauren Bessette before flying on to the wedding at the Kennedy compound.

22_61	0.14313997	Bailey said he watched as Kennedy walked around the outside of the plane and then went through a routine series of preflight checks.
22_62	0.1083019	One thing about Kennedy's routine struck Bailey as odd.
22_63	0.10019595	Usually pilots take their planes down the runway a bit to do their engine ``rev-ups,'' to avoid creating too much noise in the parking area, he said.
22_64	0.17973216	But he said Kennedy did his rev-ups in the parking space.
22_65	0.13058166	``The impression I got was maybe there was something wrong with the plane,'' Bailey said.
22_66	0.088717489	``It just caught my attention, like, `Why is he doing this here'''?
22_67	0.31697362	He said Kennedy's plane took off without incident, first heading south before turning toward Martha's Vineyard.

23_0	0.31197057	BOSTON --Forty-eight hours after John F.
23_1	0.46607142	Kennedy Jr.'s plane plunged into the ocean off Martha's Vineyard, federal officials Sunday ended their search for survivors, effectively declaring Kennedy, his wife and her sister the victims of a fatal crash.
23_2	0.10881469	The move came as an announcement by Coast Guard officials that the intensive, multiagency mission had shifted from ``search and rescue'' to ``search and recovery,'' a bureaucratic way of saying hope had ended of finding them alive.
23_3	0.050635163	``This is not the result that we were looking for.
23_4	0.09961534	This is not the result we were hoping for,'' said Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard Larrabbee.
23_5	0.1174086	Meanwhile, Larrabbee said divers from the Massachusetts State Police would begin work Monday investigating two ``potential targets'' identified by sophisticated sonar as unusual objects on the ocean floor.
23_6	0.09127792	He strongly cautioned that, based on the information available Sunday night, the targets ``don't in any way represent an aircraft or any parts of it''.
23_7	0.10644854	He said the objects were in 60 feet to 80 feet of water.
23_8	0.45240451	Larrabbee said the decision to end the rescue efforts were made in consultation with the National Transportation Safety Board and had been communicated to Kennedy's family and the family of his passengers: his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister, Lauren Bessette.
23_9	0.074037223	``I've spent some very painful moments with the families tonight,'' a somber Larrabbee said.
23_10	0.060119554	``It was very difficult for me to share the information with them''.
23_11	0.10704765	He said the move was based on four factors: the expected length of survival time in the 68-degree waters is just 12 to 18 hours; the plane had no emergency survival equipment; the two days of searching found nothing to indicate anyone had survived; and the NTSB's experience in assessing the probability of survival in this type of crash.
23_12	0.19700555	Meanwhile, federal safety investigators said a rare feature aboard Kennedy's small plane _ a voice recorder _ might provide clues to the Friday night crash.
23_13	0.11674941	Also Sunday, questions arose whether search and rescue operations might have begun five hours earlier had proper procedures been followed when a Martha's Vineyard Airport employee tried to alert authorities that the flight was overdue.
23_14	0.11003239	Even before Larrabee's announcement, the mood grew increasingly somber at the Kennedy family's Hyannis Port compound, where three priests clad in white celebrated Mass under a white tent.
23_15	0.030590762	Senator Edward M.
23_16	0.11189095	Kennedy held a wine chalice while one of the priests distributed Communion wafers.
23_17	0.15419539	Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F.
23_18	0.10310113	Kennedy, also served consecrated wine to the dozen or so people who attended the service.
23_19	0.13203552	At an afternoon press briefing, the chairman of the NTSB cautioned that the investigation into the crash would take six to nine months, and the cause might remain elusive.
23_20	0.046940378	``At this point we do not know.
23_21	0.060149026	We will not know for some time.
23_22	0.082133768	There is even a possibility we will never know,'' NTSB Chairman James Hall said.
23_23	0.13853414	Sunday, Coast Guard searchers turned up only bits of a headrest and foam insulation they believe came from Kennedy's single-engine airplane.
23_24	0.088587642	The insulation, in pieces ranging from 2 to 10 inches in diameter, were found along a mile-long stretch of beach by Aquinnah, an area known as Gay Head.
23_25	0.10712365	Coast Guard officials said widespread reports of an oil slick near the search area Sunday were unrelated.
23_26	0.139404	On Saturday, investigators found a seat, a headrest, a nose wheel, several other airplane parts, a suitcase belonging to Lauren Bessette, and a prescription bottle belonging to Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.
23_27	0.12059961	Kennedy's six-seat Piper Saratoga II HP did not have ``black boxes,'' devices required on all commercial planes that record cockpit conversations and radio transmissions as well as many parameters of an airplane's performance.
23_28	0.13364322	However, Kennedy's plane did have a manual voice recorder, a device that is mostly unheard of on all but the most recent models of private planes.
23_29	0.14382444	The voice recorder, installed after the plane left the factory, would capture any radio transmissions and possibly some of Kennedy's utterances to his passengers, but would have had to be turned on by the pilot for it to operate.
23_30	0.062201646	It was unclear whether the recorder would yield much information.
23_31	0.16580895	An official with the NTSB, which assumed control of the investigation Sunday, said a review of radio traffic showed that ground controllers received no communications or distress calls from the plane in the last 40 minutes it was known to have been in the air.
23_32	0.12656255	Still, investigators were hoping that Kennedy turned on the recorder before he taxied out to takeoff and that it might capture something that air traffic controllers never heard _ a mayday call, or something that would reveal details of the final moments of the flight.
23_33	0.093124879	The NTSB assigned an investigator to track down the person who installed the device in an attempt to learn more about it, federal sources said.
23_34	0.20671869	Questions about the response time of the search effort were prompted by the actions Friday night of Adam Budd, a ramp attendent at the Martha's Vineyard Airport.
23_35	0.09305501	Budd, 21, of Sharon, Mass.
23_36	0.18531898	, said he waited with a couple and their young daughter for the Kennedy plane to arrive.
23_37	0.18173495	After 10 p.m., the anticipated arrival time, Budd said, he checked with the tower but was told there was no sign of the plane and there was no indication that Kennedy had radioed a request to land.
23_38	0.10493354	Budd said he then telephoned Bridgeport Automated Flight Service Station in Connecticut, an FAA-run facility where pilots sometimes file their flight plans.
23_39	0.22541813	Kennedy was not required to file a flight plan, and had not done so.
23_40	0.098709019	Budd said he talked to an operator at the Bridgeport station, whose toll-free number is well-known to area pilots.
23_41	0.10986138	``I told him the tail number (of Kennedy's plane), and I asked them if they had the tail number'' on a flight plan, Budd said.
23_42	0.078247344	The operator was unresponsive, Budd said: ``He just didn't want to talk to me''.
23_43	0.098821432	George Mackie, an operations supervisor at the Bridgeport station, said Sunday that Budd's call should have triggered a search by the center.
23_44	0.16567969	Even if a pilot is flying under visual flight rules, as Kennedy was, and has not filed a flight plan, the flight service is expected to begin searching for an aircraft once it has been identified as late, Mackie said.
23_45	0.092247827	``If someone calls us and tells us an airplane is late, we will begin a search that usually starts with telephone calls,'' he said.
23_46	0.095146611	The telephone inquiry usually consists of contacting small airports in the area, the FAA, and, eventually, the Air Force's Air Rescue Coordination Center in Virginia, Mackie said.
23_47	0.16742401	As it turned out, a search was not initiated until after a Kennedy family friend called the Coast Guard at Woods Hole at about 2:15 a.m.
23_48	0.091380339	Saturday. The first search vessel was launched at about 4:30 a.m.
23_49	0.098667269	The FAA, which oversees the Bridgeport center, has declined to comment on the investigation and the response time.
23_50	0.13103992	Excitement that the plane might have been found was triggered Sunday when Coast Guard officials said a beacon signal was heard at about 3:30 p.m. by a huge Air Force C-130 that has been providing in-flight air control for the intensive air, water, and land search that began early Saturday.
23_51	0.099246606	The Coast Guard immediately dispatched the Rude (pronounced Rudy), a 90-foot ship belonging to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration that is equipped with sonar capable of creating detailed images of objects beneath the surface.
23_52	0.11185328	Sunday night, however, Larrabbee said the beacon signal appeared to have been a false alarm, possibly set off by a marker the Coast Guard had placed in the water to keep track of areas already searched.
23_53	0.15248139	An earlier beacon signal picked up before dawn Saturday off Montauk, Long Island, also was said to be unrelated to the Kennedy search.
23_54	0.17037642	The tent at the Kennedy compound where the Mass was said had been intended for 275 guests invited to the wedding of Rory Kennedy, the youngest daughter of RFK.

23_58	0.095491658	The wedding was postponed indefinitely, and would-be wedding guests began trickling into Barnstable Municipal Airport in Hyannis Sunday to catch flights home.
23_59	0.12407308	A friend of the Kennedy family said hope had dimmed by Saturday evening, and talk of survivors had been replaced by discussions of memorial services.
23_60	0.15547328	Inside the compound at Hyannis Port, where so many of the family's joys and tragedies have been played out, the Kennedys had no illusions about the news from Martha's Vineyard, family friends and associates said Sunday.
23_61	0.10048391	``They are doing as they always do: getting through this and dealing with it,'' said Robert Shrum, a friend and adviser of Edward Kennedy.
23_62	0.036169305	``It is obviously very difficult''.
23_63	0.12528158	Also Sunday, NTSB officials gave the most complete account to date of Kennedy's fateful flight.
23_64	0.15985639	Robert Pearce, an NTSB regional director who is heading the Kennedy investigation, said the plane took off at 8:38 p.m. from Runway 22 at Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J.
23_65	0.12855745	Kennedy had to make an immediate 180-degree turn to point his plane in a northeasterly direction.
23_66	0.092895168	He headed north at an altitude of 5,600 feet along the Connecticut coast.
23_67	0.087837998	He passed over Westerly, R.I., at 9:26 p.m., at that same altitude.
23_68	0.15829874	He then began his descent toward Martha's Vineyard, though Pearce said his precise rate of descent was not clear.
23_69	0.13950095	At 9:40 p.m., two radar stations at Cape Cod picked up the plane at 2,500 feet, 17 or 18 miles west of Martha's Vineyard Airport, which means he was about 10 or 11 miles off the island's coast.
23_70	0.11732992	During the next 29 seconds, the plane dropped from 2,500 to 1,800 feet.
23_71	0.071229886	After that point _ at 9:40:29 p.m.
