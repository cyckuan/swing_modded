1_0	0.17391304347826086	DETROIT _ Crippling strikes at General Motors parts factories have left the United Automobile Workers union and GM fighting over whether the auto maker is pursuing an ``America Last'' strategy, but the reality lies somewhere in between their positions.
1_1	2.0	The UAW is accusing the General Motors Corp.
1_2	1.6363636363636365	of spending billions of dollars on factories in developing countries while failing to invest in aging American factories.
1_3	0.0	GM has responded by publicizing what it calls plans to invest $21 billion in the United States by 2001.
1_4	0.0	The company's financial statements and projections show that its investments in the United States are substantial _ but that the amount invested annually will not increase in coming years and may actually decline.
1_5	0.3333333333333333	GM's annual investments overseas are rising.
1_6	0.0	With few signs of progress toward resolving the strikes that began June 5, the union raised the prospect Monday that the walkouts could last into mid-August, which would make it the most serious strike against the company since 1970.
1_7	0.0	GM executives have made no secret that they think the best long-term opportunities now in the global auto industry lie in countries such as Brazil and China where adults still outnumber cars, unlike in the United States.
1_8	0.0	But in the last two weeks they have also been promoting their U.S. investment plans.
1_9	0.0	The $21 billion figure GM uses works out to an average of $4.2 billion a year.
1_10	0.15789473684210525	``I'm unaware of any other company making that kind of investment in the United States,'' Donald Hackworth, GM's group vice president for North American car operations, said last week.
1_11	0.0	Most big companies do not disclose their investment plans, but Hackworth's assertion is plausible because G.M. is the nation's biggest company and it operates in a heavy-investment industry.
1_12	0.2631578947368421	But notes at the back of GM's annual report show that GM invested $5.39 billion last year in North America automotive operations and $5.18 billion in 1996.
1_13	0.0	These figures include relatively small investments in Mexico and Canada, although GM refused to provide exact figures.
1_14	0.1111111111111111	Gerald Holmes, a GM spokesman, said the annual amount of GM's car-building investments in the United States would stay flat or decline slightly in the coming years.
1_15	0.18181818181818182	But he said that these investments remained a majority of GM's planned investments worldwide in building cars.
1_16	0.0	The level of investments is also not important, Holmes said, because GM has been working to make its investments more efficient.

1_20	0.0	GM also announced Monday that it would invest another $100 million in its joint venture in China.
1_21	0.11764705882352941	By contrast, GM has not committed itself to building any new factories in the United States, where it still has more assembly plants than can be justified by its market share, which has been shrinking for more than 20 years.
1_22	0.09090909090909091	Hackworth said in an interview last week that GM might cut back even its current investment plans in the United States if the UAW did not heed the company's demands for labor peace and more flexible work rules in factories.
1_23	0.0	``Strikes and noncompetitive work practices jeopardize that investment,'' Hackworth said.
1_24	0.3333333333333333	He said that the main issue in the strikes at two parts factories in Flint, Mich.
1_25	0.2857142857142857	, was not where GM builds factories but rather the insistence of some workers there on collecting eight hours' pay for only four to six hours of work.
1_26	0.25	UAW officials have said that they are willing to change work rules in Flint, but only if GM follows through on a promise to invest another $180 million in one of the parts factories on strike there.
1_27	0.11764705882352941	UAW officials had no immediate comment when told Monday evening that GM's investments in the United States would show no year-over-year increase and would likely decline.
1_28	0.20689655172413793	GM's claim to be putting a majority of its investments in the United States also comes with a qualifier: All of its investment calculations, including the $21 billion figure, are for GM's car-building operations only, and exclude Delphi Automotive Systems, GM's large auto parts subsidiary.
1_29	0.1111111111111111	Delphi, with $1.26 billion in worldwide investment last year, has been the most aggressive of GM's units in building new factories in Mexico and overseas while selling or closing them in the United States.
1_30	0.0	GM has also chosen to focus on investment rather than jobs as the measure of commitment to the United States.
1_31	0.23529411764705882	But GM investments in the United States are mostly in costly operations like new assembly plant equipment, which preserves a few high-paying jobs for highly skilled workers.
1_32	0.23076923076923078	GM's investments abroad tend to be parts factories that cost little to build but can employ thousands of low-skilled workers.

2_3	0.0967741935483871	In conversations with reporters here, Richard Shoemaker, the vice president for GM issues at the UAW, and Gerald Knechtel, GM's vice president for labor relations, said they were pressing for a settlement before the automaker's two-week summer shutdown ended Monday but conceded talks were moving slowly.
2_4	0.22727272727272727	``I would be absolutely shocked'' if the strike was settled by Monday, said Shoemaker, who tried to rein in some of the speculation about an imminent settlement in the walkout, which has idled 26 of GM's 29 North American assembly plants.
2_5	0.0	But a more optimistic Knechtel said, ``It's very important that we get it done by this weekend, if it's at all possible''.
2_6	0.0	Neither side would specify the issues standing in the way of an agreement, but people close to the union said the talks were focused on resolving important investment and compensation disputes.
2_7	0.10526315789473684	Knechtel said it was critical for GM also to resolve lingering strike threats at parts factories in Dayton, Ohio, where workers have already authorized a strike, and in Indianapolis, where a strike-authorization vote is scheduled for Sunday.
2_8	0.08333333333333333	``We're trying to get them all done,'' he said, declining to say whether GM is seeking a no-strike guarantee regarding those plants.
2_9	0.0	Shoemaker said the union would prefer to focus only on the strikes at two plants here because adding the other disputes would only prolong the process.
2_10	0.0	Among major remaining issues for the union, officials close to the discussions said, is whether the 9,200 striking workers here and the 161,000 workers laid off in the dispute will be granted 32 hours of vacation pay and a week off sometime later in the year.
2_11	0.0	Those are benefits they would have normally received as part of the company's annual two-week shutdown.
2_12	0.1111111111111111	They are thought to be protected by language in the national contract, according to one senior union official.
2_13	0.0	``We won't leave here without an agreement on that issue,'' he said.
2_14	0.17391304347826086	People close to the talks said the union also wanted a formal time line for when GM will invest the remaining $180 million of a $300 million investment plan at the metal-stamping plant, where the first strike began on June 5.
2_15	0.07142857142857142	The company has said it scaled back investment in the plant because the union failed to help rid the factory of inefficient work rules.
2_16	0.07692307692307693	At the Delphi East spark plug and speedometer factory, the other plant on strike here, the two sides were still at an impasse over GM's plan to send work to outside sources, a move that the union contended would cut at least 2,500 jobs.
2_17	0.17647058823529413	UAW officials said negotiators at both plants had resolved many of the hundreds of worker-safety grievances that centered on issues such as exposure to hazardous materials, noise levels and use of old equipment.
2_18	0.0625	These people, while declining to specify how those disputes were settled, said the union had begun to look for places to hold ratification meetings once an overall agreement was reached.

2_22	0.0	GM and the UAW reached an understanding more than a year ago that GM may sell up to 20 percent of the division, possibly through an initial public offering.
2_23	0.0	Industry analysts said the press for a settlement was on because GM needed to begin to make up some of its losses, which are calculated at $1.18 billion through June 30, before the strikes have a chance to dent its third-quarter results.

3_20	0.09090909090909091	But Hargrove works closely with the UAW, and his willingness to express a preference for starting with Ford so close to the expiration of the labor contracts suggests that the UAW will not select Ford, although he added that he did not know what the UAW would do.

10_9	0.14285714285714285	The union's rules require that candidates for the presidency, an elected position, be younger than 65, and Yokich has no heir apparent.
10_10	0.0	A longer contract would not assure labor peace in the auto industry, however.
10_11	0.17647058823529413	Unlike most unions, the UAW won from the automakers long ago the right to hold factory-level strikes for health and safety reasons at any time, even while a contract is in force.

10_14	0.7692307692307693	The UAW has traditionally negotiated a contract with one auto company first, and then demanded that the other two sign virtually identical pacts.
10_15	0.08333333333333333	The company that negotiates the first pact has an advantage, in that it can tailor an agreement to its own needs while driving up its rivals' costs.

10_26	0.0	Inflation and obscure accounting rules discouraged the union and the companies alike from pursuing longer agreements.
10_27	0.13043478260869565	Inflation caused by the Korean War ravaged the earnings power of auto workers during a five-year pact in the 1950s and prompted union leaders then to vow that future deals would not exceed three years, a decision followed until now.
10_28	0.0	Recent contracts have only partly protected workers against inflation, guaranteeing that, in addition to wage increases, workers will receive an extra 1 percent raise for every 2.6 percentage points of inflation.
10_29	0.125	But the decline in the inflation rate has reduced union worries on this score.
10_30	0.0	Accounting rules also require the companies to charge certain pension concessions against their profits in the first year of an agreement, and the cost of these concessions rises with longer agreements.
10_31	0.23076923076923078	But with all three automakers posting record or near-record profits, they are in unusually strong financial condition to take such a charge.

10_37	0.06666666666666667	If Ford goes first, it would probably try to work out the terms of an eventual spinoff of Visteon Automotive Systems, its auto parts unit.
10_38	0.08333333333333333	Such a settlement could have major implications for GM In previous spinoffs of smaller subsidiaries by Ford and GM contracts guaranteed that workers in the subsidiary could retire within the next few years with full pensions and health benefits from the automaker, not the subsidiary.
10_39	0.08333333333333333	In May, GM spun off its 200,000-employee auto parts unit, Delphi Automotive Systems.
10_40	0.0	A big question now is whether Ford will agree to accept huge numbers of workers back from Visteon if it is ever spun off.
10_41	0.0	While Ford could use those workers in its expanding sport utility vehicle factories, GM has too many workers already and does not need more from Delphi.

11_29	0.0	But GM has managed to continue offending UAW leaders as it seeks ways to cut costs.
11_30	0.0	Until recently, GM had been publicly promoting ambitious plans to assemble small cars using ``modular'' assembly techniques.

24_1	0.19230769230769232	metal stamping factory has closed seven assembly plants from Kansas to Canada and parts of three other plants, idling more than 18,000 workers by GM's count and quieting cash registers at nearly every business in Flint, Mich.

24_3	0.2608695652173913	But those problems are minuscule compared with what GM faces Thursday night when 5,000 workers at a second parts-making factory in Flint are expected to decide whether to strike over what they call unmet job security demands.

24_5	0.06896551724137931	Auto analysts said a strike there would ripple across North America within days, quickly shutting most of the 22 assembly plants not yet affected by the metal-stamping plant strike, causing hundreds of temporary layoffs at independent parts supply companies and depleting dealer inventories of cars and trucks.

24_39	0.2631578947368421	GM's response is that the plant's productivity lags behind other stamping plants because of union work rules that bar managers from shifting workers into jobs outside their union classification.
24_40	0.10526315789473684	What makes GM so vulnerable to UAW strikes is its reliance on an industry practice of delivering parts just in time for production, rather than warehousing supplies as automakers did years ago.
24_41	0.0625	In addition, automakers are now able to become more efficient by producing parts at only a few factories, a trend that makes those factories easy targets for the long union strikes.
