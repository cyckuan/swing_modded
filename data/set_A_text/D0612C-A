0_0	0.36363636363636365	WASHINGTON (AP) --First, parents clamored for the hormone secretin in hopes it would help their autistic children.
0_1	0.0	Put to the test, however, secretin is proving disappointing.
0_2	0.1111111111111111	Now a new theory is triggering desperate parents' interest --and this time the stakes are higher because it could spur misuse of the nation's most precious antibiotic, vancomycin.
0_3	0.06666666666666667	An Illinois mother persuaded scientists to try a bizarre-sounding experiment, testing whether vancomycin might help her son's severe autism.
0_4	0.0	To their surprise, little Andrew Bolte got better.
0_5	0.0	Dr. Richard Sandler of Rush Children's Hospital in Chicago was skeptical of Ellen Bolte's theory that a neurotoxin-producing intestinal infection was behind some of her son's symptoms.
0_6	0.0	He administered the antibiotic anyway.
0_7	0.0	Andrew ''was not cured, but all of a sudden he started saying words, became toilet-trained,'' Sandler recalled.
0_8	0.0	''I found that very intriguing.
0_9	0.0	It's not supposed to happen''.
0_10	0.3333333333333333	So Sandler treated 11 autistic children who, like about a third of children with this serious brain disorder, also suffer painful gastrointestinal problems.
0_11	0.0	Neuropsychological testing concluded that 10 children improved, he reports in this month's Journal of Child Neurology --but only for a while.
0_12	0.0	And that's the problem: Andrew and the others worsened again after just a few months.
0_13	0.0	Yet already parents are calling doctors about vancomycin.
0_14	0.0	That's worrisome because overuse of vancomycin, considered the best weapon against the problem of antibiotic-resistant infections, will spur germs to become impervious to it.
0_15	0.0	''It is a danger,'' said Sandler, who has quit using vancomycin, calling it inappropriate until more research proves if it is a real clue or a false lead.
0_16	0.0	Another Chicagoan, Dr.
0_17	0.15	Michael Chez, plans to compare vancomycin to a dummy drug this fall, important because simple attention during medical research markedly helps autistic children, the so-called ''placebo effect''.

0_19	0.0	Like other autism experts, Johns Hopkins University neurologist Dr.
0_20	0.0	Andrew Zimmerman is bracing for families' calls.
0_21	0.0	''It's heartbreaking, because you know they really want answers,'' yet the study is far too weak to back antibiotic use, he said.
0_22	0.05555555555555555	Still, it's ''provocative,'' Zimmerman said, because scientists are scrutinizing whether bowel problems are caused by or worsen autistic symptoms, or are a coincidental side effect of the terrible brain disorder.
0_23	0.14285714285714285	More than 400,000 Americans have autism, characterized by profound social withdrawal, inability to communicate, repetitive behavior and sometimes aggression.
0_24	0.6363636363636364	No one knows what causes it, although much research suggests something goes wrong during critical fetal brain development.
0_25	0.0	Several thousand children have taken secretin, an intestinal hormone, after a mother said one dose brought her son out of autistic isolation.
0_26	0.0	But in scientific studies, secretin so far has proved no better than a dummy injection.
0_27	0.14285714285714285	Intense behavior therapy is autism's only proven treatment.
0_28	0.0	But Andrew Bolte was so aggressive the therapy didn't stand a chance, his mother said.
0_29	0.0	He screamed for hours.
0_30	0.0	He even chewed drywall from the walls.
0_31	0.3333333333333333	Complicating matters were severe diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
0_32	0.0	Bolte blames antibiotics prescribed for fluid in Andrew's ears shortly before he became autistic at 19 months.
0_33	0.0	Her unproven theory: those drugs killed Andrew's normal gut-protective bacteria, allowing an intestinal infection that can produce nerve-killing toxins, which entered his brain.
0_34	0.0	Vancomycin, she thought, could kill that infection.
0_35	0.0	Thirty-six doctors scoffed.
0_36	0.0	After all, autism typically appears between ages 14 and 22 months, and no sufferers have ever been found with neurotoxic infections.
0_37	0.0	Sandler called it ''highly improbable,'' too, but he tried because Andrew, by now 3, was miserable.
0_38	0.0	Two months later, Andrew was ''very calm,'' allowed Bolte to hug him and finally followed verbal commands.
0_39	0.0	Aggression and other symptoms soon returned.
0_40	0.0625	But Bolte believes vancomycin eased his bowel problem enough to open a window for behavior therapy, saying Andrew retained his language improvements.
0_41	0.0	Even she cautions against demanding vancomycin, however.
0_42	0.0	Instead, she is raising money for bacterial research.

1_0	0.5263157894736842	The discovery that autistic children appear to have subtle abnormalities in body movements that can be diagnosed as early as 3 months old is leading researchers to hope for new treatments.
1_1	0.0	The findings, by Philip Teitelbaum, a psychologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville, are preliminary.
1_2	0.3076923076923077	But they have generated intense interest because for the first time, a method is being proposed for diagnosing the condition in babies whose brains are still developing rapidly.
1_3	0.0	Most autism is not diagnosed in children until they are at least 3 years old.
1_4	0.058823529411764705	But if there were a reliable way to diagnose autism earlier, Teitelbaum and other researchers said, doctors might be able to devise therapies to alleviate or eliminate the condition, when the brain is its most malleable.
1_5	0.4444444444444444	Autism is a disorder of the brain and behavior that affects about 5 of every 10,000 children.
1_6	0.15	While autistic children appear healthy, they may stare into space for hours, throw tantrums, show no interest in people and pursue repetitive activities, like head banging, with no apparent purpose.
1_7	0.0	Teitelbaum made the discovery by examining videotapes of babies who were later found to be autistic.
1_8	0.0	These infants showed a specific cluster of movement abnormalities when rolling over, sitting up, crawling and walking, Teitelbaum said in a telephone interview.
1_9	0.0	But, he cautioned, the results are still preliminary.
1_10	0.0	Researchers need to look at many more babies, he said, to see exactly which movement abnormalities can predict autism and which suggest developmental disorders like schizophrenia or attention deficit disorder.

1_16	0.0	It may be, she cautioned, that Teitelbaum has discovered general problems in the nervous system that are not unique to autism.
1_17	0.1	But even that, she said, is a benefit for doctors, parents and teachers, who now have nothing to go on before children are 2 or 3 years old.
1_18	0.05555555555555555	Anne Donnellan, a professor of rehabilitation psychology and special education at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, said: ``Teitelbaum's work is important because it reflects a reality about autism that has been missed.
1_19	0.0	We tend to think it's a problem with the mind.
1_20	0.0	But now that we are really beginning to see how the brain works, we know that the mind is embodied.
1_21	0.0	Body is part of mind and there's no way to separate them''.
1_22	0.0	(STORY CAN END HERE.
1_23	0.0	OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Teitelbaum said he got the idea of looking at autism as a movement disorder partly because of his work with brain-damaged animals.
1_24	0.0	As they recover, he said, they go through predictable stages, for example recovery of movement, that reflect fundamental aspects of brain organization.
1_25	0.0	Because human babies also pass through predictable stages of development, he theorized that defects in the brain might be reflected in early movements.
1_26	0.2	A few years ago, Teitelbaum sent out word to parents of autistic children through various national organizations that he was looking for videotapes of babies before their autism was diagnosed.
1_27	0.0	He received 17 tapes that showed the babies during major milestones of motor development, including rolling over, sitting, crawling, standing and walking.
1_28	0.0	He also videotaped 15 normal infants as they passed through the same milestones.
1_29	0.0	Portions of each tape were analyzed, using a special technique, for subtle differences in patterns of movement.
1_30	0.0625	No two babies develop motor skills in exactly the same way, but the autistic babies show a specific cluster of movement abnormalities, Teitelbaum said.
1_31	0.0	Some were subtle and others quite obvious.
1_32	0.0	Normal children may temporarily show some of the same movements.
1_33	0.1	For example, none of the autistic babies in the tapes learned to roll over like normal children did, he said.
1_34	0.0	Normal babies use a corkscrew motion to go from back to stomach or vice versa.
1_35	0.16666666666666666	Starting at about 3 months old, they first turn their pelvis to one side, followed by the trunk and finally the shoulders and head.
1_36	0.0	By 6 months, the order is reversed: the head goes first and the rest of the body parts follow, corkscrew fashion.
1_37	0.16666666666666666	Some of the autistic babies in the tapes never learned to roll over.
1_38	0.0	Others did, but in a peculiar fashion, Teitelbaum said.
1_39	0.0	Starting from lying on their sides, they rolled to their stomachs or backs by raising heads and pelvises.
1_40	0.0	Then they threw the upper legs forward and toppled over, moving all body segments together.
1_41	0.0	And unlike healthy babies who usually learn to sit up at 6 months, even while turning the torso or head, some of the infants whose autism was diagnosed later on toppled easily, falling to one side ``like a log'' and failing to break the falls with their hands.
1_42	0.058823529411764705	Teitelbaum, who described his findings in a recent issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, also noted anomalies in the way the autistic babies in the tapes learned to crawl and walk.
1_43	0.0	Babies typically start to crawl at about the same time they begin to sit, holding their bodies symmetrically with arms vertical at shoulder width, palms on floor, fingers pointed forward.
1_44	0.0	Thighs are vertical and hip-width apart with knees on the ground and lower legs and feet resting on the floor pointing backward.
1_45	0.0	Weight is commonly distributed equally on all four limbs.
1_46	0.2727272727272727	The autistic children in the study showed an asymmetrical lack of support in the arms or legs, Teitelbaum said.
1_47	0.0	One baby supported himself on his forearms rather than his hands.
1_48	0.0	He raised his pelvis high in the air, bird-dog fashion, but could not move forward.
1_49	0.0	Another baby crawled by scooting his left knee on the floor but used his right foot to push himself forward.
1_50	0.2857142857142857	Teitelbaum said that every autistic child showed some degree of asymmetry in walking.
1_51	0.0	Many tended to shift their weight at the wrong moment, which made their walking appear slightly stiff.
1_52	0.0	Others kept their arms in a more infantile position, arms extended forward.
1_53	0.2	Interestingly, many autistic children walk more slowly and with shorter steps, like Parkinson's disease patients whose motor skills are damaged, Teitelbaum said.
1_54	0.5	Early diagnosis has long been a goal of autism researchers, who theorize that the condition results from brain abnormalities that develop before birth.
1_55	0.07692307692307693	Some researchers think the glitch occurs as early as the 20th to 24th day of gestation, long before women know they are pregnant.
1_56	0.0	Others believe the injury, which could be a mutation or environmental insult, occurs later on, perhaps in the second trimester of pregnancy.
1_57	0.0	In any event, researchers say that in autistic people, most of the brain forms normally but that some basic scaffolding of nerve fibers is incomplete or improperly developed.
1_58	0.0	Because the human brain grows rapidly in the first year of life _ literally constructing circuits that will last a lifetime _ this is the best time to intervene.
1_59	0.5333333333333333	The goal of intervention would be to stimulate the baby's brain to circumvent the bad wiring or develop connections to compensate for a defect, Donnellan said.
1_60	0.3333333333333333	By correcting movements through some form of physical therapy, it may be possible to used feedback to help correct abnormal brain development.

8_7	0.14285714285714285	When these rogue peptides get into the brain, they interfere with normal development.
8_8	0.0	Other theories postulate that autism develops after something triggers an autoimmune response in the brain.
8_9	0.125	One recent study, for example, found that the autistic children who had antibodies to the measles virus in their blood also had higher levels of antibodies to their own brain tissue, particularly to a protein found in myelin, the substance that forms the protective sheath around nerve fibers.

10_6	0.2727272727272727	The doctor injected the boy with porcine secretin, a hormone commonly used to assess gastrointestinal problems.
10_7	0.0	Shortly after the doctor's visit, Parker's autistic traits began improving dramatically.
10_8	0.0	He went from being non-verbal before the injection to saying words.
10_9	0.0	Initially, the Becks had to fight with skeptical doctors to get them to acknowledge that secretin might have had something to do with the results.
10_10	0.0	The biological explanation is not as far-fetched as it might seem.
10_11	0.0	On a basic level, the ``purpose of the brain is to keep the stomach full,'' said Dr.
10_12	0.16666666666666666	Alan Unis, professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington.
10_13	0.0	The brain and the gut communicate with each other.
10_14	0.0	``They need to have a common language,'' Unis said.
10_15	0.0	Secretin, which binds to receptors in both the gut and the brain, could form that link.
10_16	0.0	It is plausible that altering secretin levels could affect brain function.
10_17	0.0	It has not taken much convincing for other parents.
10_18	0.0	Publicity about the Becks story has fueled worldwide demand for the hormone, creating shortages and driving up prices.
10_19	0.0	That worried the National Institutes of Health.
10_20	0.0	Although secretin is approved for use as a one-time injection as a diagnostic agent for stomach problems, it hasn't yet been approved for multiple injections as a therapeutic agent.
10_21	0.0	Concerned that children were being given an untried drug with unknown results, the NIH expedited a clinical trial to study the drug's potential.
10_22	0.0	The Seattle group is testing a preparation similar to that used in the Becks' case.
10_23	0.0	The preparation, derived from pigs, is about 60 percent secretin and 40 percent unknown ``pig gut'' ingredients.
10_24	0.0	Researchers are also testing a pure, synthesized version of secretin.
10_25	0.0	The purpose of including both is to rule out the possibility that some other unknown compound in the porcine secretin preparation is having an effect.
10_26	0.0	Each child will get one injection of secretin or a placebo and be evaluated for effects one month later.
10_27	0.0	Researchers expect to have preliminary results in about six months.
10_28	0.0	Children began receiving the injections late last month.
10_29	0.0	However high the hopes, experts warn that secretin is not the first treatment to look promising.
10_30	0.0	``Autism has a terrible history of wild cures,'' said Eric Trupin, a UW psychology professor who is also director of the child and adolescent psychiatry at Children's Hospital in Seattle.
10_31	0.0	Some work for a few families.
10_32	0.0	None seems to work for all.
10_33	0.0	Most have not been scientifically tested.
10_34	0.0	``We are a very vulnerable group,'' said Audrey Horne, president of the Autism Society of America.
10_35	0.0	``Most parents, there's not a thing they wouldn't do if they thought it would cure their child''.
10_36	0.15384615384615385	That has led to a parade of treatments, including megavitamins, special diets, auditory training, ``holding therapy'' and swimming with dolphins.
10_37	0.0	Such treatments gain footholds in part because there is a powerful ``placebo effect'' at work.
10_38	0.0	Parents are often so hopeful for results, they see them where objective observers would not.
10_39	0.0	Researchers have seen hopes raised by drugs before.
10_40	0.0	In the 1980s, fenfluramine, a drug that reduces the blood level of serotonin, was being touted as a wonder drug for autism.
10_41	0.0	About one-third of children with autism have higher than normal levels of serotonin, another chemical that acts in both the digestive system and the brain.
10_42	0.0	Initial optimism about the drug faded after studies failed to find beneficial effects.
10_43	0.0	So far, secretin seems promising.
10_44	0.0	Researchers caution, however, that although it is tempting to hope for a pill or a shot that will make autism go away, the reality is likely to be much more complicated.
10_45	0.0	Based on anecdotal reports, secretin seems to have some beneficial effect in about half the families that try it, Unis said.
10_46	0.0	It may be that there is a subtype of autism that responds to secretin.
10_47	0.0	Frustrated by the lack of scientific backing for many treatments, parents have begun organizing to raise money and press for better research.
10_48	0.5	In addition to lobbying for more research funding, the Cure Autism Now Foundation also has established a gene bank of ``multiplex'' families with more than one autistic child to help speed the identification of genes associated with autism.
10_49	0.3076923076923077	In just over three years, the bank has enrolled 465 families, creating an unrivaled genetic data bank for researchers.

10_52	0.0	The legislation failed this fall, but autism advocates have vowed to redouble their efforts to get the funding this spring.
10_53	0.0	Better understanding of the disease is likely to lead to better treatments, Horne said.

11_15	0.0	They may also have genetic disorders such as Tourette's syndrome or Williams syndrome.
11_16	0.25	Q: What causes autism?
11_17	0.0	A: Current research links autism to biological or neurological differences in the brain, but no specific cause.
11_18	0.0	Autism is not a mental illness.
11_19	0.0	It is not caused by bad parenting, and children with autism are not kids who choose to misbehave.

11_23	0.2	Q: Is there a way to diagnose autism?
11_24	0.0	A: There are no medical tests.
11_25	0.2	Accurate diagnoses should be based on observation of an individual's communication, behavior and developmental levels.
11_26	1.0	Signs of autism typically appear during the first three years of life.
11_27	0.0	Q: Should parents shelter their children once it is determined they have autism?
11_28	0.0	A: ``It is very important that children be kept close to other developing children,'' said Gail McGee, director of the autism center at Emory University.
11_29	0.0	Parents should push for children's inclusion in normal social activities to induce growth and development in that area, she said.

14_21	0.0	Researchers have long suspected that autism and mental retardation are caused by faulty brain wiring or abnormal brain chemistry that are present from birth, Nelson said.
14_22	0.0	But this notion has been very difficult to prove because the main symptoms of the disorders, severe social withdrawal in autism and low IQ in mental retardation, are generally not diagnosed until children are around 3 years old.

14_27	0.0	``We chose eight of them,'' Nelson said, ``and went on a fishing expedition''.
14_28	0.0	The ``fishing'' took place at the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program, which is in Berkeley.
14_29	0.0	The program, established nearly 20 years ago, takes and preserves blood samples from one in seven babies born in California each year and uses the blood to help track down causes of birth defects.

14_33	0.0	In this case, staff members in the program went to clinics in Northern California and located teen-agers _ 64 with autism, 66 with an IQ below 50 but no autism, 65 with cerebral palsy and 54 normal controls.
14_34	0.0	All the teen-agers were born between 1983 and 1985 and all had blood samples stored in the warehouse.

14_37	0.6	Four of the brain proteins looked the same in all the teen-agers, he said.
14_38	0.0	But the other four _ vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), calcitonin-related gene peptide (CGRP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT4) _ were extremely high in nearly all the autistic and mentally retarded teen-agers.
14_39	0.1	None of the controls and fewer than 10 percent of those with cerebral palsy had elevated levels of these proteins, he said.
14_40	0.625	High levels of these four proteins are like ``smoking guns'' present at birth in the brains of infants who go on to develop autism and mental retardation in early childhood, the researchers said.
14_41	0.0	While these disabilities have many manifestations and run a gamut from severe to mild, they often overlap, Nelson said.
14_42	0.3333333333333333	Too much or too little of these brain chemicals at different points in development could help explain the spectrum seen in so many children.
14_43	0.0	Nelson stressed several caveats: that the findings would have to be replicated using other groups of children, that the technique used for testing blood was new and not widely available and that more work needed to be done to show exactly what was normal and not normal in regard to these proteins at birth.

14_48	0.2727272727272727	It exerts powerful effects on at least a dozen brain chemicals, including the other three identified in this study, he said.
14_49	0.0	Early in development, fetuses get VIP from the mother's immune cells.
14_50	0.0625	After birth, the baby makes VIP in parts of the brain that underlie cognition, learning and memory and also in other parts of the body, including the intestines, where it dilates tissues.
14_51	0.3333333333333333	Secretin, a digestive hormone that is being given to many autistic children with the hope that it will alleviate their behavioral problems, is in the VIP family, Brenneman said.
14_52	0.0	But there is no evidence that VIP-like substances from the intestines can ever get into the brain, he said.
14_53	0.0	Nearly every controlled clinical trial of secretin has failed to show that the hormone works as claimed, Amaral said.
14_54	0.0	On the other hand, there could be ``brain and gut interactions'' that are not yet understood.
