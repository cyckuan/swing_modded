3_23	0.058823529411764705	Retrieving the second recorder is important because in some past jetliner accidents, information from the two flight recorders, together, has provided a level of detail that has enabled investigators to pinpoint causes.

3_26	0.38095238095238093	The flight data recorder later revealed that the instrumentation problem was with three small vents on the side of the plane, known as static ports, which are used to measure air pressure and determine air speed.
3_27	0.0	The static ports are crucial because speed cannot be determined visually from a jet flying at high altitude at night, and if a plane flies too fast or too slow, it will crash.
3_28	0.03125	Investigators, zeroing in on the static ports after reviewing the two flight recorders, eventually found that maintenance workers had covered the 757's static ports with protective masking tape when they washed the plane, and had neglected to remove it _ an oversight that meant the pilots could not read their airspeed from the instruments and flew the plane to its doom.
3_29	0.16666666666666666	In some cases, however, flight recorders have proved insufficient.

8_4	0.15789473684210525	The Egyptian minister, who was commenting on a report in the New York Review of Books magazine, said, however, the theory was speculative, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
8_5	0.5238095238095238	The U.S. magazine's report said that electromagnetic interferences by military radars in the area, over which the EgyptAir plane was flying, could have caused the sudden shutdown of its computerized auto pilot, the elevators and engines.
8_6	0.32	El-Demiri said Egypt is still demanding the U.S. to release additional information on the plane's elevators, which controls the nose up or down, and to publish radar images, which the U.S. withheld for reasons of classified military data and might give clues to the tragic incident.
9_0	0.43478260869565216	WASHINGTON (AP) --Public release of reports compiling the facts in the EgyptAir Flight 990 crash is a routine step, but one likely to fan the international dispute over what caused the tragedy last fall off the New England coast.
9_1	0.14285714285714285	U.S. investigators have suggested that a co-pilot of the jetliner may have deliberately plunged the plane into the sea, killing all 217 people aboard on Oct.
9_2	0.26666666666666666	31. That idea has been vehemently rejected by Egyptian officials, who contend that mechanical failure is the probable cause, or possibly even a bomb or missile.

9_21	1.0	The flight data show the plane's elevators were uneven during the rapid descent, indicating a major problem.
9_22	0.0	The elevators are designed to operate in unison.
9_23	0.29411764705882354	Investigators are trying to determine if the split was caused by the plane's breakup, a jamming problem in one of the elevators, crew panic or even a struggle for control by two people in the cockpit.

12_0	0.88	Cruising at 33,000 feet, EgyptAir Flight 990 was ``uneventful'' until the plane's autopilot disconnected about 8 seconds before the jetliner, with 217 people aboard, began to drop down toward the Atlantic Ocean, crash investigators said Wednesday.
12_1	0.25	It is not yet clear whether the autopilot disconnected by itself or was turned off by the crew of the Cairo-bound jet that was some 40 minutes out of New York's Kennedy Airport at the time.
12_2	0.41379310344827586	National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall, releasing the first tidbits of information that his investigators have gleaned from examining one of the jet's two black boxes, said the Boeing 767 made what appears to be a ``controlled descent'' from 33,000 feet down to 19,000 feet.
12_3	0.375	The flight data recorder stopped shortly afterward and the final five to 10 seconds of information on its tape are still being analyzed, Hall told a news conference at the safety board's headquarters in Washington, D.C.
12_4	0.1	All aboard the jet died when it crashed into the Atlantic less than two minutes after the autopilot disconnected..
12_5	0.45	Although the information made public so far raises still more questions about what could have gone wrong on Flight 990, Hall did say investigators do not believe the jet's thrust reversers deployed in flight.
12_6	0.45	One of the thrust reversers on the twin-engine 767, which are used to slow a jet after landing, had been deactivated because of a problem before the jet left Cairo for New York, and there has been speculation that perhaps a thrust reverser deployed during flight.
12_7	0.36363636363636365	That speculation was fueled because another 767 crashed in Thailand in 1991 when a thrust reverser deployed in flight.
12_8	0.125	The Lauda Air crash killed all 223 people on board.
12_9	1.1	``There is no evidence of thrust reverser deployment in the data we have,'' Hall said of EgyptAir Flight 990.

12_11	1.2	The Navy is still trying to recover the second black box _ the cockpit voice recorder.
12_12	0.55	It would have recorded crew conversations in the jet's cockpit during the final 30 minutes of flight, and could prove to be even more important than the flight data recorder in helping investigators determine the cause of the crash.
12_13	0.23809523809523808	A former 767 pilot told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer last night the jet may have experienced an in-flight electrical or computer problem, based on the limited amount of information made public so far by the safety board.
12_14	0.25	The autopilot on a 767 would disconnect from flying the airplane if there there were a problem with the cockpit computers or the plane's electrical system, said Dan Gellert of Sequim, a former pilot with Eastern Airlines who later trained 767 pilots.
12_15	0.0	A light would flash and an alarm would sound to let the crew know immediately that the autopilot was off, he said.

12_18	0.0	The pilots, believing they were still in level flight, could have put the big jet into a dive, he theorized.
12_19	1.3333333333333333	An electrical problem would also explain why the plane's transponder stopped working, he said.

12_21	0.7142857142857143	Until Wednesday, the only information about what happened to EgyptAir Flight 990 had come from an analysis of radar data by the NTSB and the Air Force.
12_22	0.42105263157894735	Safety board investigators said last week the radar analysis showed the jet, flying at 33,000 feet, suddenly entered a steep but straight dive down to 16,700 feet.
12_23	0.7	At that point, air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane's transponder.
12_24	0.9230769230769231	But Air Force radar continued to plot the plane's course and altitude down to 16,000 feet.

12_26	0.18181818181818182	At that point, radar showed multiple targets, indicating the plane broke up before it hit the ocean.
12_27	0.5	The transponder operates on a separate electrical buss, or pathway, from the plane's computers and autopilot, Gellert said.
12_28	0.5454545454545454	That would explain why it kept working longer, assuming an electrical problem caused the autopilot to disconnect.
12_29	0.2777777777777778	Based on preliminary analysis, investigators had said last week that early in its 17,000-foot dive, the plane may have exceeded the speed of sound, though it began to slow as it neared 16,000 feet.
12_30	0.8181818181818182	But Hall said Wednesday the flight data recorder indicates the plane did not reach such speeds.
12_31	0.0	Even so, the 767 did dive much faster than it would have in an emergency.
12_32	0.29411764705882354	Based on the radar analysis, the jet took 40 second to reach 16,700 feet, which would have meant it was going down at more than 24,000 feet per minute.
12_33	0.4166666666666667	A Boeing spokesman said the recommended emergency descent rate for the 767 is 8,000 feet per minute.
12_34	0.14285714285714285	An emergency descent, for example, might be used if the plane suddenly lost cabin pressure and pilots needed to get to a lower altitude as fast as possible.
12_35	0.09090909090909091	Gellert said pilots are trained to bank a commercial jetliner about 30 degree before making an emergency descent.
12_36	0.42857142857142855	That is to keep the passengers from flying out of their seats in a steep dive.
12_37	0.0	Centrifugal force during the turn presses passengers into their seats.
12_38	0.2222222222222222	Investigators have said the radar data shows the plane did not turn in its initial dive.
12_39	1.0833333333333333	Neither the pilot nor co-pilot of EgyptAir Flight 990 radioed any kind of distress call to air traffic controllers.
12_40	0.0	Their last contact with controllers a few minutes before the plane began its descent did not indicate any problem.
12_41	0.36363636363636365	Gellert said an electrical problem could have knocked out communications, or the crew might have been preoccupied trying to regain control of their airplane.
12_42	0.07692307692307693	Hall did not comment Wednesday on how the airplane behaved after the brief climb shown by radar data, or in its final plunge to the ocean.
12_43	0.0	That subsequent climb is consistent with a loss of the computers, Gellert said.
12_44	0.0	``Somewhere along the way you realize you are diving, then you try and recover,'' he said.
12_45	0.0	``Perhaps the crew overcorrected.
12_46	0.0	Now they are zooming back up, putting the plane on its tail.
