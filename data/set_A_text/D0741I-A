0_1	0.20775364	5: &QL; The tragedy of Mark Barton in no way proves that day trading, in which he lost a lot of money quite rapidly, is evil.
0_2	0.078253767	But it is a reminder that technological advances have made it easier to treat stock trading as something like casino gambling.
0_3	0.073948978	It must be closely regulated, particularly to assure that the gamblers understand the risks.
0_4	0.30263008	Barton is believed to have started his killing spree in Georgia on the day that his account at one day trading firm, Momentum Securities, ran out of money with losses of more than $105,000.
0_5	0.088311131	Day traders, so called because they usually engage in quick purchases and sales of securities and try to end each day owning no stocks, can use modern computer technology to take speedy advantage of market anomalies, such as when a brokerage firm is slow in changing the posted price at which it is willing to buy or sell a stock.
0_6	0.088468028	Those opportunities were relatively large several years ago, but diminished as rules changed and markets became more efficient.
0_7	0.13377141	Many current day traders try to anticipate short-term price moves in volatile stocks.
0_8	0.16787643	Some of the most successful day traders in the old days do little trading now, and instead run classes that purport to teach people how to be successful day traders.
0_9	0.13011503	Barton took one such class, offered by All-Tech Investment Group, whose Internet Web site warns of risks but also says that it is not necessary to know anything about the stock market to learn to be a successful day trader.
0_10	0.094488821	Whatever is required, it appears that most of those who try day trading lose money at it.
0_11	0.091953429	The Securities and Exchange Commission and state regulators need to make sure that day trading companies disclose the risks, do not make exaggerated profit claims and do not violate the margin rules that limit how much money can be lent for stock trading.
0_12	0.085795365	But the regulators cannot stop foolish customers from gambling their money away.

1_1	0.16920244	Barton could have prevented the multiple killings if employees had scrutinized their traders more carefully.
1_2	0.086122407	Attorney Michael Weinstock said All-Tech Securities Inc.
1_3	0.20093943	, one of the companies where Barton traded regularly, should have known of Barton's volatile personality, given the hundreds of thousands of dollars he lost while trading there and his reaction to those losses.
1_4	0.082891852	The complaint, filed on behalf of Dr.
1_5	0.3019885	Gulsham Harjee, whose husband, Dean Delawalla, was killed by Barton while he traded at All-Tech on the afternoon of July 29, also claims the firm should have foreseen the killings because of the stressful nature inherent in the day trading arena.
1_6	0.069527552	Harjee declined to comment Monday.
1_7	0.10849753	``Despite it's knowledge of the extreme pressures of day trading, All-Tech did not screen its clients for criminal or violent tendencies or emotional stability before allowing them to participate as day traders at its facilities,'' the complaint read.
1_8	0.088713321	All-Tech officials should have known Barton especially posed a threat to its employees and customers, Weinstock said Tuesday.
1_9	0.13464151	``Barton was no choir boy,'' Weinstock said.
1_10	0.091271818	``Shouldn't these firms where so much pressure and high-risk trading is done every day check these people out''?
1_11	0.19189082	Barton was losing a lot of money, and the company chose not to check him out, Weinstock said.
1_12	0.075617413	``They buried their head,'' Weinstock said.
1_13	0.12948072	Though he had not seen the 16-page complaint, All-Tech's chief executive officer, Harry Houtkin, said he was not surprised by the suit.
1_14	0.091016293	``This is a tragedy,'' he said, ``but in today's litigious society, I expected this to happen''.

1_17	0.16278552	The security company's chief financial officer, David Brazel, also declined comment on the suit, as did officials of the Piedmont Center.
1_18	0.089499836	The complaint also alleges the four parties failed to maintain a safe working environment for Delawalla and other victims and seeks damages for wrongful death, negligence, violation of a private duty, negligent supervision, negligent infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium.

2_0	0.16781483	ATLANTA _ Thursday's shootings shined an unwanted light on a high-stakes way to make it or break it: day-trading.
2_1	0.80687015	The man identified as the shooter, Mark Barton, was a day trader.
2_2	0.24625471	He had lost a total of $105,000 over a period of 15 days, ending July 27 at one of the two day trading establishments he used.
2_3	0.35855721	A number of eye witnesses to the shootings said Barton talked about losing money while he was shooting.
2_4	0.10574317	Friday, traders bantering in chat rooms discussed the shootings.
2_5	0.075964493	One posting asked whether ``the wild risks and intense pressures of market speculation'' were to blame.
2_6	0.33333854	``The Atlanta killings are not surprising'' said another member of the Lakeside Trading Club.
2_7	0.10828239	``It was only a matter of time before someone who blew out their account couldn't handle the stress and took it out on innocent victims''.
2_8	0.18863196	However, James Lee, president of Momentum Securities where Barton traded as late as Tuesday, said Friday in a statement that Barton had _ as all traders do _ signed documents saying he understood the risk.
2_9	0.082893515	``It is important to remember, the trading decisions he made were his own,'' said Lee.
2_10	0.074438926	Day-trading is not investing, it's more speculative than that.
2_11	0.10679704	It is an intricately complex way to try to stay a split-second ahead of the direction of a stock price.
2_12	0.073739071	Day-traders feed off a stock's volatile intraday movement.
2_13	0.09126818	The shares most often traded are technology stocks, most of which are on the Nasdaq market, which processes trades electronically.
2_14	0.53894052	Day traders typically work out of places like All-Tech Investment Group and Momentum Securities, the Atlanta businesses where Barton traded.
2_15	0.083085337	These companies provide staff to help the traders and dedicated computers loaded with software on which to trade.
2_16	0.13221152	The typical day trader tends to focus on a handful of companies and to buy and sell those stocks many times in a single session to take advantage of spikes in the prices.
2_17	0.21524958	At the end of the day, the trader cashes out, returning the next day to roll the dice again.
2_18	0.078486944	Tim Bourquin, a 30-year old California day-trader, said traders get a feel for a stock's direction by watching what market makers do.
2_19	0.090582232	Market makers are brokerage firms that keep an inventory in a particular stock to sell to customers.
2_20	0.08057319	They buy or sell stock to keep an orderly market.
2_21	0.085654803	Watching the market makers, lets traders like Bourquin stay a step ahead of the general public.
2_22	0.092257029	That step might be only a few-minute lead, but for a day-trader, who can make a trade in a second, a minute is plenty.
2_23	0.083033115	The losses and gains can be huge, but almost all traders lose money in their first few months, Borquin said.
2_24	0.1019474	The ones who last a year tend to make a living, he said.
2_25	0.084155681	Bourquin, like many day-traders, worried that the actions of one man would stain an industry.
2_26	0.085420264	``I knew people would try and make this a day-trader thing,'' Bourquin said.
2_27	0.084872238	``But it probably had nothing to do with it, or very little.
2_28	0.076125737	This guy was just a lunatic.
2_29	0.074667101	He could have been a mechanic or a doctor.
2_30	0.095563709	What happened in Atlanta has more to do with him being a lunatic than him being a day-trader''.
2_31	0.088961019	How difficult is day-trading?
2_32	0.089391242	Here are some answers to commonly asked questions about day-trading, compiled with the help of David Floyd, a partner at San Diego-based careerdaytrader.com.
2_33	0.12201621	Q: How do day traders know which way a stock will go?
2_34	0.078890378	A: They don't.
2_35	0.11257168	Many day traders, however, keep a keen eye on S&AMP;P futures.
2_36	0.07910526	The reason?
2_37	0.089239471	The prices of these tradeable futures contracts and the actual index normally shadow each other quite closely.
2_38	0.10443442	When the gap between the futures and the index narrows or widens, day traders see this as a buy or sell signal.
2_39	0.093137354	Successful day traders rarely bet against this market gauge.
2_40	0.089488259	They buy shares when the futures suggest the market will rise.
2_41	0.08621086	Sometimes they're right.
2_42	0.082815074	Sometimes they're wrong.
2_43	0.094131691	Q: What is the attraction of day trading?
2_44	0.087794904	A: Consider the case of IBM, which fell $3 on Thursday to close at $125.38.
2_45	0.091967284	A normal investor who owned 100 shares of IBM lost $300.
2_46	0.10424588	But a day trader could have ``shorted'' 100 shares of IBM --a bet that the stock would fall, and the only strategy to follow on a day when the S&AMP;P 500 was falling -- until it reached its lowest point.
2_47	0.14861649	That day trader could have made as much as $400.
2_48	0.075844113	Q: What are the risks of day-trading?
2_49	0.093526701	A: Enormous.
2_50	0.077286369	Investing is inherently risky.
2_51	0.07805997	Day-trading is extreme investing and can be extremely risky.
2_52	0.094746031	Doing it without proper training is folly, especially if you buy or sell on margin (with borrowed funds), which geometrically increases the impact of unexpected market events.
2_53	0.086184732	This is not the way to invest your retirement savings or bet next month's mortgage payment.

3_0	0.35055186	ATLANTA _ Mark Orrin Barton's life was as unsettled as his death was unsettling.
3_1	0.17766119	He changed jobs frequently, lost tens of thousands of dollars in the stock market and, for the last six years, couldn't help but listen to whispers and outright accusations about his role in his first wife's death.
3_2	0.21064764	As authorities continued to investigate a three-day killing spree that left 13 people dead, including Barton, even his mother said she couldn't fathom what transformed the 44-year-old chemist-turned-day trader into the worst mass murderer in Georgia history.
3_3	0.14877889	``Even though I am deeply hurt by the actions of my son, Mark, I loved him very much,'' Barton's 76-year-old mother, Gladys, said in a statement issued Thursday at her home in Sumter, S.C.
3_4	0.13649573	``I wish there was some way to explain why this tragedy occurred or some way that it could have been prevented''.
3_5	0.52420657	Police say they have been unable to determine what motivated Barton to kill his wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday, his children, Matthew and Mychelle, on Wednesday, and nine people in two Atlanta office buildings on Thursday before taking his own life.
3_6	0.45727926	But the securities firm where Barton began his shooting rampage disclosed Friday that he had lost $105,000 on 15 trading days between June 9 and Tuesday _ the day he went home and killed his wife.
3_7	0.29124834	Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard described Barton as ``distraught and troubled,'' a man who ``also felt his wife and his children were suffering and hurting as well''.
3_8	0.11039103	From interviews and court records, a picture emerges of a man whose life continually lacked a semblance of the normalcy he tried to display.
3_9	0.27428999	``I have come to hate this life and this system of things,'' he wrote early Thursday in a note that police later found in the living room of his Henry County apartment.
3_10	0.085250766	``I have come to have no hope''.
3_11	0.08153505	It's difficult to trace the origins of Barton's despair.
3_12	0.090341112	Certainly it does not appear to be rooted in his rather unremarkable childhood.
3_13	0.24581135	An only child whose father worked for the Air Force, Barton moved with his family to Sumter, S.C., when he was 11.
3_14	0.082743527	After graduating from Sumter High School in 1973, Barton attended Clemson University but dropped out.
3_15	0.13557771	Two years later, he enrolled at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, where he received his bachelor's degree in chemistry and met the woman who would become his first wife, Debra Spivey.
3_16	0.12039389	The university's dormitories in Columbia, S.C., were full, and Debra lived at the Wade Hampton Hotel where Barton worked nights.
3_17	0.079225163	They were married May 5, 1979.
3_18	0.23945105	Soon they were living in Atlanta.
3_19	0.092784782	That year, he took a job as a chemist for a company called Zep Manufacturing, which soon transferred him to its Dallas laboratory.
3_20	0.087776156	He remained with the company about four years, said Andy Logue, vice president of human resources for Zep's parent company, National Service Industries.
3_21	0.098517699	From then on, however, Barton's professional and personal lives followed a rocky path.
3_22	0.089795	In 1984, Barton accepted a job at TLC Manufacturing, a Texarkana, Texas, company that made cleaning compounds.
3_23	0.077796553	By 1988, he had been named TLC's president.
3_24	0.10793439	He made as much as $86,000 a year and controlled 5 percent of the company's stock.
3_25	0.15044515	But two years later, he was fired.
3_26	0.16676178	In a deposition, Barton said TLC executives became upset when they learned he was moving back to Atlanta to start his own business.
3_27	0.12709245	But Texarkana police records also show that, after being fired from TLC, Barton was arrested Sept.
3_28	0.079851102	25, 1990, and briefly jailed on charges that he stole computer discs and notebook binders filled with information from the company.
3_29	0.083404764	Charges against him were dropped a day later because TLC board members declined to prosecute him, Texarkana police spokesman Jeff Heminger said.
3_30	0.11243774	After moving back to Georgia, Barton started his own company, a chemistry consulting firm called Highlander Pride Inc.
3_31	0.074455551	, in July 1990.
3_32	0.081734339	But the company was more ``like having a paper route,'' he testified, because it never generated more than a few thousand dollars of business a year.
3_33	0.08284523	In January 1992, after resigning from a raw material distribution company in Kennesaw, Barton became a sales representative for Macon-based Lomas International, selling raw materials to manufacturers in the rubber, ink and paint industries, said Julie Van Brunt, a spokeswoman for the company, now known as Lintech International.
3_34	0.12770344	With a $50,000 salary and a company Taurus, Barton oversaw sales from North Georgia to the Florida Panhandle.
3_35	0.09737621	A year after he joined the company, he met a new employee: 20-year-old Leigh Ann Vandiver, a customer-support telephone operator.
3_36	0.085854501	She married David Lang a month after starting work, in February 1993.
3_37	0.10155402	By that spring, she and Barton were having an affair.
3_38	0.36817128	On the road most of the time, Barton said he always seemed to get Leigh Ann when he called the office.
3_39	0.1996448	Leigh Ann told him she liked older guys and had told Barton he was ``pretty,'' based on his photo in the company annual.
3_40	0.11382328	``We flirted with each other on the phone,'' Barton said, adding that he began buying new clothes and going to a tanning salon.
3_41	0.085433479	They consummated their relationship in May 1993, Barton testified.
3_42	0.26456592	Barton was playing golf with his buddies at the end of August when he called Leigh Ann using one of his friend's cell phones.
3_43	0.12980277	During this call, Barton testified, she told him she planned to leave her husband.
3_44	0.12785287	Barton was scheduled to make a quarterly sales trip through the Florida Panhandle in September 1993, and Leigh Ann was to accompany him to Panama City.
3_45	0.30804754	The trip was to take place the weekend after Labor Day _ the weekend after Barton's wife and mother-in-law were killed.
3_46	0.21686511	OPTIONAL TRIM Leigh Ann moved out of the home she shared with her husband two days before the bodies of Debra Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59, were found in a travel trailer at the Riverside Campground at Weiss Lake in Alabama.
3_47	0.20871116	They had been hacked to death with a sharp, heavy blade.

3_49	0.089335243	, where Debra and her mother were killed,said evidence indicated the victims knew their killer, since there were no signs of forced entry or struggle.
3_50	0.14125543	Bloody footprints led to the trailer's driveway and witnesses said they saw a car like Barton's company-leased Ford the night of the murders.
3_51	0.096070109	He was told not to wash his car, but drove it through a car wash the next day and wiped up the interior after supposedly spilling a Sprite, Smith said.
3_52	0.17046947	Investigators said they found blood in Barton's car, garage and home.
3_53	0.16658907	Barton's defense lawyer, Michael Hauptman, said in an interview that the killer was an unspecified itinerate roofer who confessed to the killing.
3_54	0.093480428	This person is now serving an unrelated prison sentence in Indiana, Hauptman said.
3_55	0.14433575	But Smith said this man was ruled out as a suspect after his statements did not match evidence and investigators learned he had spent the night of the murders with friends.
3_56	0.14862678	During his deposition, Barton said the last time he saw Debra alive was when she pulled out of their home in her mother's red Thunderbird for the Labor Day camping weekend.
3_57	0.15697749	It was the first time he'd kept the children overnight by himself, he testified.
3_58	0.12248925	That night, with the children worn out and tired, Barton said he sang them songs, read them stories and then put them to bed.
3_59	0.091470471	He played on the computer, listened to a new Mary-Chapin Carpenter album and finished off a six-pack, falling asleep on the sofa, awoke during the night and headed to bed.
3_60	0.15622796	ADDITONAL TRIM In the weeks before Debra Barton's killing, her husband had taken out twin life insurance policies _ $600,000 for him, $600,000 for her.
3_61	0.11694199	Barton testified Debra insisted she have a policy equal to his own.
3_62	0.10339424	``She developed the concept that her worth was equal to mine and that if something happened to her, I would have my hands full taking care of the two kids,'' Barton testified.
3_63	0.090360736	``And she wanted the exact same life insurance that I had, rather than having a smaller amount''.
3_64	0.16667993	But after Debra and her mother, Eloise Spivey, were found hacked to death, the insurers holding the policies didn't buy Barton's story.
3_65	0.10820913	Two companies, Investors Life Insurance Co.
3_66	0.081822255	of Nebraska and Primerica Life Co.
3_67	0.12777625	, took Barton to court.
3_68	0.14007901	Lawyers for Investors Life went so far as to accuse Barton of the slayings.
3_69	0.1145856	``I am convinced that he was involved in those deaths,'' Ben Kingree III, an Atlanta lawyer who represented Investors Life, said Friday.
3_70	0.16729492	``She was a housewife with no income and a $600,000 life insurance policy.
3_71	0.083192513	Come on''.
3_72	0.10719855	Investors Life, which filed suit in 1994, settled with Barton in September 1997.
3_73	0.19530603	The company paid out $450,000 as part of a settlement, with $150,000 going to a trust fund to Barton's children and almost $300,000 being shared by Barton and his lawyers.
3_74	0.1190546	Barton collected $5,000 on another policy and received almost $66,000 on a $100,000 rider policy he had bought for his wife years before from Primerica, according to court records.
3_75	0.17814515	In the insurance lawsuit, Smith testified that he believed only Barton could have been guilty.
3_76	0.093174147	But the case never went to a grand jury for indictment.
3_77	0.081060887	Smith pursued the case through a different tack, though.
3_78	0.10326165	He met with Leigh Ann in Macon, he said in an interview Friday, to warn her that she might be next.
3_79	0.096745065	``I told her then, whenever she ceased to fill his needs, then he'd kill her, too,'' he said.
3_80	0.090555266	``The lifestyle that he had indicated that he needed (required) a young, sexy wife to maintain the status quo.
3_81	0.079818573	That's what he felt like he needed.
3_82	0.099107522	I told her, I said, `When you cease to fill those needs, you know he's going to kill you'.
3_83	0.099641157	'' ADDITONAL TRIM Barton and Lang both resigned from Lomas in October 1994.
3_84	0.095884587	The following May 26, they were married in Clayton County.

7_1	0.45969876	(AP) --Police always suspected Mark Barton was at the end of the bloody trail that led out the door of the travel trailer where his wife and mother-in-law were hacked to death in 1993.
7_2	0.4365016	Barton had the motive, they believed: a $600,000 life insurance policy on his wife and a girlfriend on the side.
7_3	0.28968132	Investigators knew he had a temper and an opportunity to kill.
7_4	0.2130514	But Barton denied he did it, and authorities lacked the one thing they needed to arrest him: proof he had ever been to the camper where Debra Barton and her mother, Eloise Spivey, were slain.
7_5	0.14843369	``We didn't have any witnesses who could put him there,'' said Danny Smith, an investigator with the Cherokee County district attorney's office.
7_6	0.074130822	``We didn't have any fingerprints''.
7_7	0.68399609	Barton shot and killed nine people in two Atlanta stock-trading offices on Thursday, injuring 13 others.
7_8	0.65824289	Afterward, his wife and two children were found dead in their apartment.

7_10	0.33883417	In a letter left at his apartment in Henry County, Ga.
7_11	0.41557286	, Barton acknowledged that the murders of his family were similar to the Alabama killings, in which police believe the victims were killed with a hatchet.
7_12	0.17262933	But Barton, writing that ``there's no reason for me to lie now,'' continued to deny committing the '93 killings.
7_13	0.22277285	In the aftermath of the Georgia rampage, Alabama authorities said Friday they were still troubled by the '93 killings but believed they did all they could.
7_14	0.33535135	Barton was the only suspect ever considered.
7_15	0.094283008	``I don't know of anything we could have done differently,'' Smith said.

7_20	0.11958826	Investigators found bloody footprints leading out the camper door, but the FBI laboratory could not identify the brand of the shoe, taking away one possible link to Barton.
7_21	0.213587	Police talked with everyone who was at the campground that day, but no one remembered seeing Barton.
7_22	0.12248544	Early tests on Barton's company car indicated the possible presence of blood around the front seat.
7_23	0.12511188	But before police could analyze the spot again, Barton --a chemist -- claimed to have spilled a soft drink in the vehicle, ruining any potential evidence, Smith said.
7_24	0.15107909	Another investigator involved in the case, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police first became suspicious of Barton after he gave ``rehearsed'' answers during an interview.
7_25	0.079024138	He also refused a polygraph test.
7_26	0.23336374	It was only after that, the source said, that officers found out about the $600,000 insurance policy on Debra Barton that took effect less than a month before she was killed.
7_27	0.17113402	Investigators believe Barton, involved with another woman, came to Alabama to ask her for a divorce and she refused, prompting the killings.
7_28	0.18008393	Smith said the insurance company, Investors Life Insurance of Nebraska, offered to pay the full amount of the policy, provided all the money went into a trust fund for the couple's two children.
7_29	0.10379101	Barton refused and eventually settled.
7_30	0.22217169	Court records show the insurer paid $450,000 on the policy, with $150,000 of that going into trust for Barton's children and the remainder going to Barton and his lawyers.
7_31	0.14938669	Michael Hauptman, Barton's criminal lawyer, who was not involved in the civil case, said he believed the lawyers got about $100,000.
7_32	0.48015551	Alabama authorities said they didn't know whether Barton's second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, was the woman he had been dating during his first marriage.
7_33	0.21566603	However, her ex-husband, David Lang, told the New York Daily News that she was, and he said he believes she helped Barton cover up his involvement in the slayings to collect the insurance policy.
7_34	0.12061016	Lang did not return messages left by The Associated Press on Friday.
7_35	0.2288444	Smith said that after Barton remarried, he would periodically call the investigator and ask why he was a suspect in the slayings.
7_36	0.14693196	``It was a game to him.

10_0	0.23170258	ATLANTA _ The gunman who slaughtered his family and then nine people at two stock trading firms left behind a chilling letter filled with a mix of remorse and revenge but offering few clues as to what caused his three-day rampage.

10_69	0.11188882	Next to Matthew's body was a video game, and next to Michelle a stuffed toy.
10_70	0.26709692	But Barton blamed his wife in the letter.

10_78	0.27911501	Vincent said it appeared Barton planned to kill the people at the day trading firms simply because they symbolized those who were profiting at his expense.

18_6	0.26236	In addition, Atlanta police said Wednesday, Barton was in debt to fellow traders, some of whom were among the nine people he methodically killed last Thursday when he opened fire in two stock trading offices in Buckhead.
18_7	0.13515426	The man other traders called Rocket because of how excited he got when a stock soared knew that he had a problem: He couldn't afford the day trading and he couldn't stop, Kelly Argo, his sister-in-law, said Tuesday.

22_6	0.39998809	Barton had the motive, they believed: a $600,000 life insurance policy on his wife and a girlfriend on the side.
22_7	0.2600638	Investigators knew he had a temper and an opportunity to kill.
22_8	0.12922007	But Barton denied he did it, and authorities lacked the one thing they needed to arrest him: proof he had ever been to the camper where the women were found butchered, apparently with a hatchet.

22_31	0.17458889	Smith said the insurance company, Investors Life Insurance of Nebraska, offered to pay the full amount of the policy, provided all the money went into a trust fund for the couple's two children.
22_32	0.10327704	Barton refused and eventually settled.
22_33	0.21315256	Court records show the insurer paid $450,000 on the policy, with $150,000 of that going into trust for Barton's children and the remainder going to Barton and his lawyers.

24_5	0.19273372	, which includes the Atlanta suburb of Stockbridge, released the letter Friday as the authorities searched for clues to the motive behind Thursday's killing spree, the deadliest in the state's history.
24_6	0.23151948	Because Barton, 44, shot and killed himself in his van as he was apprehended by police Thursday night, law enforcement officials said they were unlikely to ever know exactly what caused him to snap.
24_7	0.10903649	But the often rambling letter, printed neatly on Barton's letterhead and signed robustly in large script, offered a remarkable glimpse into the twisted thinking of a man who seems to have carefully calculated his three-day rampage.
24_8	0.12644586	The letter, along with recollections from people who knew Barton, suggests that the rage that played out on a hot afternoon in a glitzy suburb here had its roots in the earliest years of his life.
24_9	0.10135315	And perhaps, authorities say, he had expressed the rage before.
24_10	0.78405481	He was the only suspect in the 1993 bludgeoning deaths of his first wife and her mother.

24_42	0.17990759	He said the suspected murder weapon, a hammer, also was found.
24_43	0.19867456	Barton noted in his letter that investigators might notice similarities between the deaths of his family members and those of his previous wife, Debra Spivey Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59, both of whom were found in a camping trailer, bludgeoned with a sharp, heavy blade.

24_51	0.090322845	Ultimately, nothing could be done to challenge Barton's custody because the child was too young to testify, McDade said.
24_52	0.097284772	But during the investigation, Barton was evaluated by a clinical psychologist who, McDade said, found he ``certainly was capable of homicidal thought and homicidal action''.
24_53	0.23539591	nn Suspicion fell on Barton in the Alabama case, investigators said, because he had taken out a $600,000 life insurance policy on his wife four days before her death, because they were known to be having marital problems, and because he was already having an affair with the woman who would become his second wife, Leigh Ann Vandiver.
24_54	0.15844016	``He was the number one suspect all the way through and still is,'' said Richard Igou, the district attorney in Cedar Bluff at the time.
