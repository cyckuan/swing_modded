0_1	0.19706311	5: &QL; The tragedy of Mark Barton in no way proves that day trading, in which he lost a lot of money quite rapidly, is evil.
0_2	0.092082574	But it is a reminder that technological advances have made it easier to treat stock trading as something like casino gambling.
0_3	0.092177561	It must be closely regulated, particularly to assure that the gamblers understand the risks.
0_4	0.33251024	Barton is believed to have started his killing spree in Georgia on the day that his account at one day trading firm, Momentum Securities, ran out of money with losses of more than $105,000.
0_5	0.097803543	Day traders, so called because they usually engage in quick purchases and sales of securities and try to end each day owning no stocks, can use modern computer technology to take speedy advantage of market anomalies, such as when a brokerage firm is slow in changing the posted price at which it is willing to buy or sell a stock.
0_6	0.092453848	Those opportunities were relatively large several years ago, but diminished as rules changed and markets became more efficient.
0_7	0.12309194	Many current day traders try to anticipate short-term price moves in volatile stocks.
0_8	0.18379964	Some of the most successful day traders in the old days do little trading now, and instead run classes that purport to teach people how to be successful day traders.
0_9	0.14101553	Barton took one such class, offered by All-Tech Investment Group, whose Internet Web site warns of risks but also says that it is not necessary to know anything about the stock market to learn to be a successful day trader.
0_10	0.090700122	Whatever is required, it appears that most of those who try day trading lose money at it.
0_11	0.10309589	The Securities and Exchange Commission and state regulators need to make sure that day trading companies disclose the risks, do not make exaggerated profit claims and do not violate the margin rules that limit how much money can be lent for stock trading.
0_12	0.093035579	But the regulators cannot stop foolish customers from gambling their money away.

1_1	0.1028305	Barton could have prevented the multiple killings if employees had scrutinized their traders more carefully.
1_2	0.16675959	Attorney Michael Weinstock said All-Tech Securities Inc.
1_3	0.23490039	, one of the companies where Barton traded regularly, should have known of Barton's volatile personality, given the hundreds of thousands of dollars he lost while trading there and his reaction to those losses.

1_5	0.38474849	Gulsham Harjee, whose husband, Dean Delawalla, was killed by Barton while he traded at All-Tech on the afternoon of July 29, also claims the firm should have foreseen the killings because of the stressful nature inherent in the day trading arena.
1_6	0.069499798	Harjee declined to comment Monday.
1_7	0.14485306	``Despite it's knowledge of the extreme pressures of day trading, All-Tech did not screen its clients for criminal or violent tendencies or emotional stability before allowing them to participate as day traders at its facilities,'' the complaint read.
1_8	0.084023631	All-Tech officials should have known Barton especially posed a threat to its employees and customers, Weinstock said Tuesday.
1_9	0.13720556	``Barton was no choir boy,'' Weinstock said.
1_10	0.09452636	``Shouldn't these firms where so much pressure and high-risk trading is done every day check these people out''?
1_11	0.14055128	Barton was losing a lot of money, and the company chose not to check him out, Weinstock said.
1_12	0.083220759	``They buried their head,'' Weinstock said.
1_13	0.12779314	Though he had not seen the 16-page complaint, All-Tech's chief executive officer, Harry Houtkin, said he was not surprised by the suit.
1_14	0.090977397	``This is a tragedy,'' he said, ``but in today's litigious society, I expected this to happen''.

1_17	0.17886031	The security company's chief financial officer, David Brazel, also declined comment on the suit, as did officials of the Piedmont Center.
1_18	0.072080503	The complaint also alleges the four parties failed to maintain a safe working environment for Delawalla and other victims and seeks damages for wrongful death, negligence, violation of a private duty, negligent supervision, negligent infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium.

2_0	0.11379942	ATLANTA _ Thursday's shootings shined an unwanted light on a high-stakes way to make it or break it: day-trading.
2_1	0.29208094	The man identified as the shooter, Mark Barton, was a day trader.
2_2	0.19484619	He had lost a total of $105,000 over a period of 15 days, ending July 27 at one of the two day trading establishments he used.
2_3	0.17069338	A number of eye witnesses to the shootings said Barton talked about losing money while he was shooting.
2_4	0.13245291	Friday, traders bantering in chat rooms discussed the shootings.
2_5	0.087720698	One posting asked whether ``the wild risks and intense pressures of market speculation'' were to blame.
2_6	0.19420068	``The Atlanta killings are not surprising'' said another member of the Lakeside Trading Club.
2_7	0.093670032	``It was only a matter of time before someone who blew out their account couldn't handle the stress and took it out on innocent victims''.
2_8	0.17653128	However, James Lee, president of Momentum Securities where Barton traded as late as Tuesday, said Friday in a statement that Barton had _ as all traders do _ signed documents saying he understood the risk.
2_9	0.091069304	``It is important to remember, the trading decisions he made were his own,'' said Lee.
2_10	0.090826717	Day-trading is not investing, it's more speculative than that.
2_11	0.094359915	It is an intricately complex way to try to stay a split-second ahead of the direction of a stock price.
2_12	0.087479824	Day-traders feed off a stock's volatile intraday movement.
2_13	0.09414698	The shares most often traded are technology stocks, most of which are on the Nasdaq market, which processes trades electronically.
2_14	0.30096433	Day traders typically work out of places like All-Tech Investment Group and Momentum Securities, the Atlanta businesses where Barton traded.
2_15	0.089369872	These companies provide staff to help the traders and dedicated computers loaded with software on which to trade.
2_16	0.1246119	The typical day trader tends to focus on a handful of companies and to buy and sell those stocks many times in a single session to take advantage of spikes in the prices.
2_17	0.14984776	At the end of the day, the trader cashes out, returning the next day to roll the dice again.
2_18	0.069591326	Tim Bourquin, a 30-year old California day-trader, said traders get a feel for a stock's direction by watching what market makers do.
2_19	0.095662395	Market makers are brokerage firms that keep an inventory in a particular stock to sell to customers.
2_20	0.090438568	They buy or sell stock to keep an orderly market.
2_21	0.087253759	Watching the market makers, lets traders like Bourquin stay a step ahead of the general public.
2_22	0.09203227	That step might be only a few-minute lead, but for a day-trader, who can make a trade in a second, a minute is plenty.
2_23	0.089413057	The losses and gains can be huge, but almost all traders lose money in their first few months, Borquin said.
2_24	0.091753916	The ones who last a year tend to make a living, he said.
2_25	0.091488564	Bourquin, like many day-traders, worried that the actions of one man would stain an industry.
2_26	0.091562363	``I knew people would try and make this a day-trader thing,'' Bourquin said.
2_27	0.087667583	``But it probably had nothing to do with it, or very little.
2_28	0.087058142	This guy was just a lunatic.
2_29	0.086893092	He could have been a mechanic or a doctor.
2_30	0.088024843	What happened in Atlanta has more to do with him being a lunatic than him being a day-trader''.
2_31	0.09614537	How difficult is day-trading?
2_32	0.082954796	Here are some answers to commonly asked questions about day-trading, compiled with the help of David Floyd, a partner at San Diego-based careerdaytrader.com.
2_33	0.095892579	Q: How do day traders know which way a stock will go?
2_34	0.094281799	A: They don't.
2_35	0.10347894	Many day traders, however, keep a keen eye on S&AMP;P futures.
2_36	0.089431252	The reason?
2_37	0.092763791	The prices of these tradeable futures contracts and the actual index normally shadow each other quite closely.
2_38	0.10076792	When the gap between the futures and the index narrows or widens, day traders see this as a buy or sell signal.
2_39	0.1200506	Successful day traders rarely bet against this market gauge.
2_40	0.091376757	They buy shares when the futures suggest the market will rise.
2_41	0.08044523	Sometimes they're right.
2_42	0.095700221	Sometimes they're wrong.
2_43	0.10162858	Q: What is the attraction of day trading?
2_44	0.08291007	A: Consider the case of IBM, which fell $3 on Thursday to close at $125.38.
2_45	0.077171125	A normal investor who owned 100 shares of IBM lost $300.
2_46	0.10988437	But a day trader could have ``shorted'' 100 shares of IBM --a bet that the stock would fall, and the only strategy to follow on a day when the S&AMP;P 500 was falling -- until it reached its lowest point.
2_47	0.098158942	That day trader could have made as much as $400.
2_48	0.088709351	Q: What are the risks of day-trading?
2_49	0.079133644	A: Enormous.
2_50	0.093187721	Investing is inherently risky.
2_51	0.089715892	Day-trading is extreme investing and can be extremely risky.
2_52	0.077650079	Doing it without proper training is folly, especially if you buy or sell on margin (with borrowed funds), which geometrically increases the impact of unexpected market events.
2_53	0.091956018	This is not the way to invest your retirement savings or bet next month's mortgage payment.

3_0	0.20634157	ATLANTA _ Mark Orrin Barton's life was as unsettled as his death was unsettling.
3_1	0.21010123	He changed jobs frequently, lost tens of thousands of dollars in the stock market and, for the last six years, couldn't help but listen to whispers and outright accusations about his role in his first wife's death.
3_2	0.27196338	As authorities continued to investigate a three-day killing spree that left 13 people dead, including Barton, even his mother said she couldn't fathom what transformed the 44-year-old chemist-turned-day trader into the worst mass murderer in Georgia history.
3_3	0.17750953	``Even though I am deeply hurt by the actions of my son, Mark, I loved him very much,'' Barton's 76-year-old mother, Gladys, said in a statement issued Thursday at her home in Sumter, S.C.
3_4	0.091212197	``I wish there was some way to explain why this tragedy occurred or some way that it could have been prevented''.
3_5	0.56794321	Police say they have been unable to determine what motivated Barton to kill his wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday, his children, Matthew and Mychelle, on Wednesday, and nine people in two Atlanta office buildings on Thursday before taking his own life.
3_6	0.51757201	But the securities firm where Barton began his shooting rampage disclosed Friday that he had lost $105,000 on 15 trading days between June 9 and Tuesday _ the day he went home and killed his wife.
3_7	0.33448174	Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard described Barton as ``distraught and troubled,'' a man who ``also felt his wife and his children were suffering and hurting as well''.
3_8	0.098610618	From interviews and court records, a picture emerges of a man whose life continually lacked a semblance of the normalcy he tried to display.
3_9	0.27974267	``I have come to hate this life and this system of things,'' he wrote early Thursday in a note that police later found in the living room of his Henry County apartment.
3_10	0.090633696	``I have come to have no hope''.
3_11	0.095329906	It's difficult to trace the origins of Barton's despair.
3_12	0.088741477	Certainly it does not appear to be rooted in his rather unremarkable childhood.
3_13	0.27115573	An only child whose father worked for the Air Force, Barton moved with his family to Sumter, S.C., when he was 11.
3_14	0.063951326	After graduating from Sumter High School in 1973, Barton attended Clemson University but dropped out.
3_15	0.17568937	Two years later, he enrolled at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, where he received his bachelor's degree in chemistry and met the woman who would become his first wife, Debra Spivey.
3_16	0.1412073	The university's dormitories in Columbia, S.C., were full, and Debra lived at the Wade Hampton Hotel where Barton worked nights.
3_17	0.10256785	They were married May 5, 1979.
3_18	0.15604581	Soon they were living in Atlanta.
3_19	0.087629577	That year, he took a job as a chemist for a company called Zep Manufacturing, which soon transferred him to its Dallas laboratory.
3_20	0.075893062	He remained with the company about four years, said Andy Logue, vice president of human resources for Zep's parent company, National Service Industries.
3_21	0.090670588	From then on, however, Barton's professional and personal lives followed a rocky path.
3_22	0.084660468	In 1984, Barton accepted a job at TLC Manufacturing, a Texarkana, Texas, company that made cleaning compounds.
3_23	0.097288548	By 1988, he had been named TLC's president.
3_24	0.12313981	He made as much as $86,000 a year and controlled 5 percent of the company's stock.
3_25	0.12802778	But two years later, he was fired.
3_26	0.14900494	In a deposition, Barton said TLC executives became upset when they learned he was moving back to Atlanta to start his own business.
3_27	0.13997664	But Texarkana police records also show that, after being fired from TLC, Barton was arrested Sept.
3_28	0.077642004	25, 1990, and briefly jailed on charges that he stole computer discs and notebook binders filled with information from the company.
3_29	0.084145543	Charges against him were dropped a day later because TLC board members declined to prosecute him, Texarkana police spokesman Jeff Heminger said.
3_30	0.11919997	After moving back to Georgia, Barton started his own company, a chemistry consulting firm called Highlander Pride Inc.
3_31	0.040167788	, in July 1990.
3_32	0.078338104	But the company was more ``like having a paper route,'' he testified, because it never generated more than a few thousand dollars of business a year.
3_33	0.085631983	In January 1992, after resigning from a raw material distribution company in Kennesaw, Barton became a sales representative for Macon-based Lomas International, selling raw materials to manufacturers in the rubber, ink and paint industries, said Julie Van Brunt, a spokeswoman for the company, now known as Lintech International.
3_34	0.14766203	With a $50,000 salary and a company Taurus, Barton oversaw sales from North Georgia to the Florida Panhandle.
3_35	0.10239195	A year after he joined the company, he met a new employee: 20-year-old Leigh Ann Vandiver, a customer-support telephone operator.
3_36	0.080243764	She married David Lang a month after starting work, in February 1993.
3_37	0.091900804	By that spring, she and Barton were having an affair.
3_38	0.18999686	On the road most of the time, Barton said he always seemed to get Leigh Ann when he called the office.
3_39	0.21924458	Leigh Ann told him she liked older guys and had told Barton he was ``pretty,'' based on his photo in the company annual.
3_40	0.11031337	``We flirted with each other on the phone,'' Barton said, adding that he began buying new clothes and going to a tanning salon.
3_41	0.11180641	They consummated their relationship in May 1993, Barton testified.
3_42	0.29552446	Barton was playing golf with his buddies at the end of August when he called Leigh Ann using one of his friend's cell phones.
3_43	0.10976618	During this call, Barton testified, she told him she planned to leave her husband.
3_44	0.15538738	Barton was scheduled to make a quarterly sales trip through the Florida Panhandle in September 1993, and Leigh Ann was to accompany him to Panama City.
3_45	0.20975371	The trip was to take place the weekend after Labor Day _ the weekend after Barton's wife and mother-in-law were killed.
3_46	0.26526596	OPTIONAL TRIM Leigh Ann moved out of the home she shared with her husband two days before the bodies of Debra Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59, were found in a travel trailer at the Riverside Campground at Weiss Lake in Alabama.
3_47	0.11104909	They had been hacked to death with a sharp, heavy blade.

3_49	0.088224379	, where Debra and her mother were killed,said evidence indicated the victims knew their killer, since there were no signs of forced entry or struggle.
3_50	0.16479425	Bloody footprints led to the trailer's driveway and witnesses said they saw a car like Barton's company-leased Ford the night of the murders.
3_51	0.11201632	He was told not to wash his car, but drove it through a car wash the next day and wiped up the interior after supposedly spilling a Sprite, Smith said.
3_52	0.13186538	Investigators said they found blood in Barton's car, garage and home.
3_53	0.18797384	Barton's defense lawyer, Michael Hauptman, said in an interview that the killer was an unspecified itinerate roofer who confessed to the killing.
3_54	0.072916199	This person is now serving an unrelated prison sentence in Indiana, Hauptman said.
3_55	0.15527812	But Smith said this man was ruled out as a suspect after his statements did not match evidence and investigators learned he had spent the night of the murders with friends.
3_56	0.17756102	During his deposition, Barton said the last time he saw Debra alive was when she pulled out of their home in her mother's red Thunderbird for the Labor Day camping weekend.
3_57	0.11692135	It was the first time he'd kept the children overnight by himself, he testified.
3_58	0.14208828	That night, with the children worn out and tired, Barton said he sang them songs, read them stories and then put them to bed.
3_59	0.093499707	He played on the computer, listened to a new Mary-Chapin Carpenter album and finished off a six-pack, falling asleep on the sofa, awoke during the night and headed to bed.
3_60	0.18294997	ADDITONAL TRIM In the weeks before Debra Barton's killing, her husband had taken out twin life insurance policies _ $600,000 for him, $600,000 for her.
3_61	0.10375421	Barton testified Debra insisted she have a policy equal to his own.
3_62	0.11020529	``She developed the concept that her worth was equal to mine and that if something happened to her, I would have my hands full taking care of the two kids,'' Barton testified.
3_63	0.094667576	``And she wanted the exact same life insurance that I had, rather than having a smaller amount''.
3_64	0.19148344	But after Debra and her mother, Eloise Spivey, were found hacked to death, the insurers holding the policies didn't buy Barton's story.
3_65	0.17892439	Two companies, Investors Life Insurance Co.
3_66	0.075834976	of Nebraska and Primerica Life Co.
3_67	0.16399256	, took Barton to court.
3_68	0.10393894	Lawyers for Investors Life went so far as to accuse Barton of the slayings.
3_69	0.12517895	``I am convinced that he was involved in those deaths,'' Ben Kingree III, an Atlanta lawyer who represented Investors Life, said Friday.
3_70	0.11743742	``She was a housewife with no income and a $600,000 life insurance policy.
3_71	0.074003692	Come on''.
3_72	0.10311283	Investors Life, which filed suit in 1994, settled with Barton in September 1997.
3_73	0.21418501	The company paid out $450,000 as part of a settlement, with $150,000 going to a trust fund to Barton's children and almost $300,000 being shared by Barton and his lawyers.
3_74	0.13623317	Barton collected $5,000 on another policy and received almost $66,000 on a $100,000 rider policy he had bought for his wife years before from Primerica, according to court records.
3_75	0.11800154	In the insurance lawsuit, Smith testified that he believed only Barton could have been guilty.
3_76	0.090616526	But the case never went to a grand jury for indictment.
3_77	0.094841231	Smith pursued the case through a different tack, though.
3_78	0.10186103	He met with Leigh Ann in Macon, he said in an interview Friday, to warn her that she might be next.
3_79	0.10826534	``I told her then, whenever she ceased to fill his needs, then he'd kill her, too,'' he said.
3_80	0.094504476	``The lifestyle that he had indicated that he needed (required) a young, sexy wife to maintain the status quo.
3_81	0.09070359	That's what he felt like he needed.
3_82	0.10624189	I told her, I said, `When you cease to fill those needs, you know he's going to kill you'.

7_1	0.44255104	(AP) --Police always suspected Mark Barton was at the end of the bloody trail that led out the door of the travel trailer where his wife and mother-in-law were hacked to death in 1993.
7_2	0.21380961	Barton had the motive, they believed: a $600,000 life insurance policy on his wife and a girlfriend on the side.
7_3	0.11174499	Investigators knew he had a temper and an opportunity to kill.
7_4	0.24202114	But Barton denied he did it, and authorities lacked the one thing they needed to arrest him: proof he had ever been to the camper where Debra Barton and her mother, Eloise Spivey, were slain.
7_5	0.13841367	``We didn't have any witnesses who could put him there,'' said Danny Smith, an investigator with the Cherokee County district attorney's office.
7_6	0.088888123	``We didn't have any fingerprints''.
7_7	0.56908403	Barton shot and killed nine people in two Atlanta stock-trading offices on Thursday, injuring 13 others.
7_8	0.22807776	Afterward, his wife and two children were found dead in their apartment.

7_10	0.17981736	In a letter left at his apartment in Henry County, Ga.
7_11	0.31058405	, Barton acknowledged that the murders of his family were similar to the Alabama killings, in which police believe the victims were killed with a hatchet.
7_12	0.11955531	But Barton, writing that ``there's no reason for me to lie now,'' continued to deny committing the '93 killings.
7_13	0.1950517	In the aftermath of the Georgia rampage, Alabama authorities said Friday they were still troubled by the '93 killings but believed they did all they could.
7_14	0.21630925	Barton was the only suspect ever considered.
7_15	0.093788685	``I don't know of anything we could have done differently,'' Smith said.
7_16	0.089590126	``We knew morally that he had done it, but we could not prove it legally''.

7_20	0.12577798	Investigators found bloody footprints leading out the camper door, but the FBI laboratory could not identify the brand of the shoe, taking away one possible link to Barton.
7_21	0.13353401	Police talked with everyone who was at the campground that day, but no one remembered seeing Barton.
7_22	0.11496767	Early tests on Barton's company car indicated the possible presence of blood around the front seat.
7_23	0.1226695	But before police could analyze the spot again, Barton --a chemist -- claimed to have spilled a soft drink in the vehicle, ruining any potential evidence, Smith said.
7_24	0.14538677	Another investigator involved in the case, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police first became suspicious of Barton after he gave ``rehearsed'' answers during an interview.
7_25	0.09161787	He also refused a polygraph test.
7_26	0.21161195	It was only after that, the source said, that officers found out about the $600,000 insurance policy on Debra Barton that took effect less than a month before she was killed.
7_27	0.14405261	Investigators believe Barton, involved with another woman, came to Alabama to ask her for a divorce and she refused, prompting the killings.
7_28	0.16325031	Smith said the insurance company, Investors Life Insurance of Nebraska, offered to pay the full amount of the policy, provided all the money went into a trust fund for the couple's two children.
7_29	0.1276599	Barton refused and eventually settled.
7_30	0.19103807	Court records show the insurer paid $450,000 on the policy, with $150,000 of that going into trust for Barton's children and the remainder going to Barton and his lawyers.
7_31	0.13203233	Michael Hauptman, Barton's criminal lawyer, who was not involved in the civil case, said he believed the lawyers got about $100,000.
7_32	0.36329091	Alabama authorities said they didn't know whether Barton's second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, was the woman he had been dating during his first marriage.
7_33	0.18631028	However, her ex-husband, David Lang, told the New York Daily News that she was, and he said he believes she helped Barton cover up his involvement in the slayings to collect the insurance policy.
7_34	0.10392558	Lang did not return messages left by The Associated Press on Friday.
7_35	0.15354822	Smith said that after Barton remarried, he would periodically call the investigator and ask why he was a suspect in the slayings.
7_36	0.1262718	``It was a game to him.

10_0	0.19129859	ATLANTA _ The gunman who slaughtered his family and then nine people at two stock trading firms left behind a chilling letter filled with a mix of remorse and revenge but offering few clues as to what caused his three-day rampage.

10_6	0.25798545	In the one-page letter printed from a computer and dated Thursday, Mark Orrin Barton described how he killed his estranged second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, 27, with a hammer Tuesday, then beat and drowned his two children the following day.
10_7	0.20124799	``Where the kids were (the 24 hours after Leigh Ann Barton was killed), I have absolutely no way of knowing,'' said Jimmy Mercer, chief of the Henry County Police, the agency investigating the three deaths in Stockbridge, near Atlanta.

10_54	0.12681697	The only explanation Barton does reveal is that he killed his children out of what appears to be a distorted sense of compassion.

10_66	0.08620259	There was certainly not any visible blood that I saw...

10_69	0.10179455	Next to Matthew's body was a video game, and next to Michelle a stuffed toy.
10_70	0.26285585	But Barton blamed his wife in the letter.

10_76	0.084590859	``It's chilling to hear those words,'' Vincent said.
10_77	0.086976879	``This pattern is not nearly as common as a typical outraged employee seeking revenge on a higher authority or a co-worker''.
10_78	0.17585298	Vincent said it appeared Barton planned to kill the people at the day trading firms simply because they symbolized those who were profiting at his expense.
10_79	0.089064301	``It's a sense of somebody has to pay,'' Vincent said.

18_6	0.32802441	In addition, Atlanta police said Wednesday, Barton was in debt to fellow traders, some of whom were among the nine people he methodically killed last Thursday when he opened fire in two stock trading offices in Buckhead.
18_7	0.18091141	The man other traders called Rocket because of how excited he got when a stock soared knew that he had a problem: He couldn't afford the day trading and he couldn't stop, Kelly Argo, his sister-in-law, said Tuesday.

18_25	0.1368723	He had set up a meeting that morning with a Momentum manager, purportedly to pay off his debt at the firm, said Detective Steve Walden, the lead Atlanta homicide investigator on the case.

22_6	0.22059279	Barton had the motive, they believed: a $600,000 life insurance policy on his wife and a girlfriend on the side.
22_7	0.11228635	Investigators knew he had a temper and an opportunity to kill.
22_8	0.14152661	But Barton denied he did it, and authorities lacked the one thing they needed to arrest him: proof he had ever been to the camper where the women were found butchered, apparently with a hatchet.

22_31	0.16081308	Smith said the insurance company, Investors Life Insurance of Nebraska, offered to pay the full amount of the policy, provided all the money went into a trust fund for the couple's two children.
22_32	0.1261521	Barton refused and eventually settled.
22_33	0.18845316	Court records show the insurer paid $450,000 on the policy, with $150,000 of that going into trust for Barton's children and the remainder going to Barton and his lawyers.

24_5	0.22057443	, which includes the Atlanta suburb of Stockbridge, released the letter Friday as the authorities searched for clues to the motive behind Thursday's killing spree, the deadliest in the state's history.
24_6	0.24475575	Because Barton, 44, shot and killed himself in his van as he was apprehended by police Thursday night, law enforcement officials said they were unlikely to ever know exactly what caused him to snap.
24_7	0.11895605	But the often rambling letter, printed neatly on Barton's letterhead and signed robustly in large script, offered a remarkable glimpse into the twisted thinking of a man who seems to have carefully calculated his three-day rampage.
24_8	0.1385224	The letter, along with recollections from people who knew Barton, suggests that the rage that played out on a hot afternoon in a glitzy suburb here had its roots in the earliest years of his life.
24_9	0.094064559	And perhaps, authorities say, he had expressed the rage before.
24_10	0.29715979	He was the only suspect in the 1993 bludgeoning deaths of his first wife and her mother.
24_11	0.096660454	The next year, he was under investigation for possible molestation of his then 3-year-old daughter.

24_31	0.32999856	Three weeks ago, he said, Barton and his two children from his first marriage, showed up at the apartment, needing a place to live.
24_32	0.53210245	Leigh Ann Barton took them in.
24_33	0.40990815	Barton wrote that he killed his wife because ``she was one of the main reasons for my demise,'' but then added that he regretted killing her.
24_34	0.094496318	``She really couldn't help it and I love her so much anyway''.

24_41	0.1461057	Ms. Barton's body was found in a bedroom closet, placed behind boxes and under clothes, presumably so that it would not be discovered by the children, Mercer said.
24_42	0.10620994	He said the suspected murder weapon, a hammer, also was found.
24_43	0.2455597	Barton noted in his letter that investigators might notice similarities between the deaths of his family members and those of his previous wife, Debra Spivey Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59, both of whom were found in a camping trailer, bludgeoned with a sharp, heavy blade.
24_44	0.12652096	But he denied killing them.

24_51	0.08484382	Ultimately, nothing could be done to challenge Barton's custody because the child was too young to testify, McDade said.
24_52	0.10534341	But during the investigation, Barton was evaluated by a clinical psychologist who, McDade said, found he ``certainly was capable of homicidal thought and homicidal action''.
24_53	0.26824311	nn Suspicion fell on Barton in the Alabama case, investigators said, because he had taken out a $600,000 life insurance policy on his wife four days before her death, because they were known to be having marital problems, and because he was already having an affair with the woman who would become his second wife, Leigh Ann Vandiver.
24_54	0.17172784	``He was the number one suspect all the way through and still is,'' said Richard Igou, the district attorney in Cedar Bluff at the time.

24_56	0.093120132	He gave what they felt were ``rehearsed'' answers to questions and refused to take a polygraph test, investigators said.
