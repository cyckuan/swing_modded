1_0	0.19979859	ATLANTA _ The gunman who slaughtered his family and then nine people at two stock trading firms left behind a chilling letter filled with a mix of remorse and revenge but offering few clues as to what caused his three-day rampage.

1_6	0.38247436	In the one-page letter printed from a computer and dated Thursday, Mark Orrin Barton described how he killed his estranged second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, 27, with a hammer Tuesday, then beat and drowned his two children the following day.
1_7	0.20969601	``Where the kids were (the 24 hours after Leigh Ann Barton was killed), I have absolutely no way of knowing,'' said Jimmy Mercer, chief of the Henry County Police, the agency investigating the three deaths in Stockbridge, near Atlanta.
1_8	0.10134876	``He went to pains to conceal the body so you can't help but think the kids were in and out during that time,'' Mercer said.

1_14	0.12289164	Their mother and maternal grandmother were savagely beaten to death with a tool in Alabama in 1993.

1_16	0.40608327	The former chemist turned day trader in stocks likened his wife's death to the shooting rampage he went on Thursday.
1_17	0.31401279	He gave no clear motive for those killings other than he blamed his wife and the people at the companies for his depression.
1_18	0.2469558	Officials at one of the businesses, Momentum Securities, said Barton used the Atlanta office for 15 days of trading beginning June 9, and lost $105,000.

1_35	0.2717857	I killed her Tuesday night.

1_53	0.058102957	I have come to have no hope''.
1_54	0.20889642	The only explanation Barton does reveal is that he killed his children out of what appears to be a distorted sense of compassion.
1_55	0.1744533	``I killed the children to exchange for them five minutes of pain for a lifetime of pain,'' he wrote.

1_66	0.064998434	There was certainly not any visible blood that I saw...

1_68	0.076697095	The beds containing the children appeared to be some sort of shrine in tribute to each.
1_69	0.10630991	Next to Matthew's body was a video game, and next to Michelle a stuffed toy.
1_70	0.53531086	But Barton blamed his wife in the letter.

1_75	0.11713812	That Barton's depression led him to kill at home and the workplace is unusual, said John Vincent, a professor of psychology at the University of Houston.
1_76	0.093405043	``It's chilling to hear those words,'' Vincent said.
1_77	0.084991697	``This pattern is not nearly as common as a typical outraged employee seeking revenge on a higher authority or a co-worker''.
1_78	0.29205126	Vincent said it appeared Barton planned to kill the people at the day trading firms simply because they symbolized those who were profiting at his expense.
1_79	0.062968699	``It's a sense of somebody has to pay,'' Vincent said.
1_80	0.11385823	Despite the denial of his involvement in the Alabama slaying, authorities there have said they consider the murder case of Debra Benton and Eloise Spivey to be closed now.

5_3	0.15231082	Liz Webb, whose brother Scott Webb was killed July 29, 1999, said she decided to visit the building where her brother traded and died.
5_4	0.042371183	But it didn't ease her grief, she said.
5_5	0.071581142	''It never leaves,'' Webb said after the service, wiping tears from her eyes.
5_6	0.036611606	''It never goes away''.
5_7	0.036217853	The service was organized by Dr.
5_8	0.54287059	Gulshan Harjee, whose husband was killed in Barton's spree at All-Tech and Momentum Securities.
5_9	0.080377869	Harjee said she hoped the service might allow victims' families to visit and offer each other solace.
5_10	0.58594668	Police said Barton, who had reportedly lost more than $400,000 from his investments, killed his wife and two young children the day before his rampage.
5_11	0.24753253	The three --Leigh Ann Barton, and her children, Matthew and Michelle -- were included in the service bulletin, and a candle for each victim was lighted at the front of the church.
5_12	0.31089527	Hours after the shooting, Barton fatally shot himself when police stopped his minivan at a convenience store northwest of Atlanta.
5_13	0.094025073	The incident has prompted close public scrutiny of the industry, in which people rapidly buy and sell shares electronically, hoping to profit from the market's slight price swings.
5_14	0.11763916	Victims and their relatives also have filed 10 lawsuits in the past year, naming as defendants the brokerages, their landlords, their security firms and Barton's estate.
5_15	0.078149669	But Sunday, the focus remained the pain of loss and the search for strength coping with it.
5_16	0.082981884	About 2,000 people attended the ecumenical service at The Cathedral at Chapel Hill, an interdenominational church.
5_17	0.08892564	''Sometimes survival depends on our ability to cry, to feel the hurt,'' said Archbishop Earl Paulk, the church's founder, urging the families to strive for a ''sense of forgiveness'' even if they consider Barton's actions unforgivable.

5_19	0.069406151	For some at the service, dealing with it is almost a full-time occupation.

6_0	0.31269362	ATLANTA _ Last Christmas, Mark O.
6_1	0.50457305	Barton sat down with his estranged wife and confessed to huge financial losses as a day trader in the stock market.
6_2	0.015002251	``I lost it all.
6_3	0.34148224	I need help,'' he told Leigh Ann Barton, one of the 12 people he would kill in July in a bloody rampage that spanned three days and about 30 miles, from Stockbridge to the office suites of Buckhead, ending in his suicide at a BP service station in Acworth.
6_4	0.24967721	As the story unfolds of a man haunted by mounting debt and persistent accusations he had killed his first wife, new details emerge daily about the astounding losses Barton suffered in the market.
6_5	0.17901637	Barton lost as much as $450,000 gambling on Internet stocks in the past year, ventures financed by money he obtained from his first wife's life insurance settlement and possibly by tapping into a trust fund set up for his two children, according to family members and police.
6_6	0.26140488	In addition, Atlanta police said Wednesday, Barton was in debt to fellow traders, some of whom were among the nine people he methodically killed last Thursday when he opened fire in two stock trading offices in Buckhead.
6_7	0.13857221	The man other traders called Rocket because of how excited he got when a stock soared knew that he had a problem: He couldn't afford the day trading and he couldn't stop, Kelly Argo, his sister-in-law, said Tuesday.
6_8	0.23994775	Last October, about the time his wife left him, Barton went to a Macon suburb to see Argo and her husband, Gary, Barton's confidant.
6_9	0.14081865	The Argos said Barton told them he had lost $250,000 and had only about $20,000 left.
6_10	0.090210007	``He's called Gary before in tears when he has lost big amounts of money,'' Kelly Argo said.
6_11	0.23798024	By the time Barton faced Leigh Ann at Christmas, the losses were approaching $300,000.
6_12	0.070207027	She was furious with him, Kelly Argo recalled.
6_13	0.28804154	But Barton couldn't stop his day trading, nor stem the losses.
6_14	0.18857273	In March, according to his sister-in-law, Barton told Gary Argo that he had tapped the children's trust fund and that he was facing a repayment deadline.
6_15	0.060232622	If he missed it, he thought he would go to jail.
6_16	0.13150831	Later, the Argos said, Barton told them he had obtained the money and met the repayment deadline.
6_17	0.39063966	Shortly afterward, Barton left All-Tech Investment Group, the first place he had traded, and went to Momentum Securities Inc.
6_18	0.17015733	He eventually gunned down five people at All-Tech, including four traders, before going across Piedmont Road to Momentum, where he killed four more.
6_19	0.15955968	The size of Barton's debts at the trading offices could not be verified, because such trading information is not public record.
6_20	0.12226331	But the Wall Street Journal, quoting unnamed sources, has reported that Barton lost $400,000 at All-Tech before leaving there in April.
6_21	0.36150847	Several of the day traders killed or injured in the Buckhead shootings had lent Barton money to pay off numerous debts, according to Atlanta police.
6_22	0.14605704	Police declined to say how much money Barton had borrowed from his colleagues.
6_23	0.31799333	In addition to those killed, 13 people were injured in the Buckhead shooting rampage before Barton fled and killed himself when cornered by police in Cobb County.
6_24	0.23853322	By that time, police had learned that Barton used a hammer to kill his estranged wife in her Stockbridge apartment on July 27 and to take the lives of their children Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 8, the same way the next day _ the day before he packed his van with four pistols and set out for Buckhead.
6_25	0.1222151	He had set up a meeting that morning with a Momentum manager, purportedly to pay off his debt at the firm, said Detective Steve Walden, the lead Atlanta homicide investigator on the case.
6_26	0.054240017	``He had no money,'' Walden said Wednesday.
6_27	0.1673961	``He had no intention of going to pay off his debt _ he knew exactly what he was going to do over there'' Witnesses told police that the Momentum manager was not available when Barton first arrived.
6_28	0.15904147	Barton waited about 25 minutes, exchanging small talk with other traders in the room, and then could wait no longer.
6_29	0.17959021	``People said he began shutting the blinds in the office,'' Walden said.
6_30	0.42500791	``Then he closed one of the doors in the office.
6_31	0.072485715	He turned around and whipped out two guns, one in each hand''.
6_32	0.043915607	The gunfire was not erratic or ill-planned.
6_33	0.1718792	``This wasn't a shooting spree,'' Walden said.
6_34	0.036307996	``His shots were intentional.
6_35	0.076787093	Everyone was shot at close range.

7_0	0.26757094	The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug.
7_1	0.22532445	5: &QL; The tragedy of Mark Barton in no way proves that day trading, in which he lost a lot of money quite rapidly, is evil.
7_2	0.07269261	But it is a reminder that technological advances have made it easier to treat stock trading as something like casino gambling.
7_3	0.063423148	It must be closely regulated, particularly to assure that the gamblers understand the risks.
7_4	0.30417833	Barton is believed to have started his killing spree in Georgia on the day that his account at one day trading firm, Momentum Securities, ran out of money with losses of more than $105,000.
7_5	0.091071107	Day traders, so called because they usually engage in quick purchases and sales of securities and try to end each day owning no stocks, can use modern computer technology to take speedy advantage of market anomalies, such as when a brokerage firm is slow in changing the posted price at which it is willing to buy or sell a stock.
7_6	0.087873438	Those opportunities were relatively large several years ago, but diminished as rules changed and markets became more efficient.
7_7	0.12616731	Many current day traders try to anticipate short-term price moves in volatile stocks.
7_8	0.18432753	Some of the most successful day traders in the old days do little trading now, and instead run classes that purport to teach people how to be successful day traders.
7_9	0.1340809	Barton took one such class, offered by All-Tech Investment Group, whose Internet Web site warns of risks but also says that it is not necessary to know anything about the stock market to learn to be a successful day trader.
7_10	0.08318422	Whatever is required, it appears that most of those who try day trading lose money at it.
7_11	0.092042188	The Securities and Exchange Commission and state regulators need to make sure that day trading companies disclose the risks, do not make exaggerated profit claims and do not violate the margin rules that limit how much money can be lent for stock trading.
7_12	0.073812948	But the regulators cannot stop foolish customers from gambling their money away.

12_31	0.17528268	Smith said the insurance company, Investors Life Insurance of Nebraska, offered to pay the full amount of the policy, provided all the money went into a trust fund for the couple's two children.

13_2	0.47019459	Barton had the motive, they believed: a $600,000 life insurance policy on his wife and a girlfriend on the side.
13_3	0.23835722	Investigators knew he had a temper and an opportunity to kill.
13_4	0.20330195	But Barton denied he did it, and authorities lacked the one thing they needed to arrest him: proof he had ever been to the camper where Debra Barton and her mother, Eloise Spivey, were slain.
13_5	0.13819732	``We didn't have any witnesses who could put him there,'' said Danny Smith, an investigator with the Cherokee County district attorney's office.

13_10	0.31395386	In a letter left at his apartment in Henry County, Ga.
13_11	0.43348405	, Barton acknowledged that the murders of his family were similar to the Alabama killings, in which police believe the victims were killed with a hatchet.
13_12	0.17111194	But Barton, writing that ``there's no reason for me to lie now,'' continued to deny committing the '93 killings.
13_13	0.23861151	In the aftermath of the Georgia rampage, Alabama authorities said Friday they were still troubled by the '93 killings but believed they did all they could.
13_14	0.60053918	Barton was the only suspect ever considered.

13_20	0.11896763	Investigators found bloody footprints leading out the camper door, but the FBI laboratory could not identify the brand of the shoe, taking away one possible link to Barton.
13_21	0.21311679	Police talked with everyone who was at the campground that day, but no one remembered seeing Barton.
13_22	0.12901393	Early tests on Barton's company car indicated the possible presence of blood around the front seat.
13_23	0.11491757	But before police could analyze the spot again, Barton --a chemist -- claimed to have spilled a soft drink in the vehicle, ruining any potential evidence, Smith said.
13_24	0.15976311	Another investigator involved in the case, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police first became suspicious of Barton after he gave ``rehearsed'' answers during an interview.
13_25	0.05424307	He also refused a polygraph test.
13_26	0.25174793	It was only after that, the source said, that officers found out about the $600,000 insurance policy on Debra Barton that took effect less than a month before she was killed.
13_27	0.18844739	Investigators believe Barton, involved with another woman, came to Alabama to ask her for a divorce and she refused, prompting the killings.
13_28	0.17635753	Smith said the insurance company, Investors Life Insurance of Nebraska, offered to pay the full amount of the policy, provided all the money went into a trust fund for the couple's two children.
13_29	0.14232348	Barton refused and eventually settled.
13_30	0.23026637	Court records show the insurer paid $450,000 on the policy, with $150,000 of that going into trust for Barton's children and the remainder going to Barton and his lawyers.

13_32	0.51681755	Alabama authorities said they didn't know whether Barton's second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, was the woman he had been dating during his first marriage.
13_33	0.20837938	However, her ex-husband, David Lang, told the New York Daily News that she was, and he said he believes she helped Barton cover up his involvement in the slayings to collect the insurance policy.
13_34	0.10510834	Lang did not return messages left by The Associated Press on Friday.
13_35	0.24440434	Smith said that after Barton remarried, he would periodically call the investigator and ask why he was a suspect in the slayings.

14_0	0.3651687	ATLANTA _ Mark Orrin Barton's life was as unsettled as his death was unsettling.
14_1	0.18267093	He changed jobs frequently, lost tens of thousands of dollars in the stock market and, for the last six years, couldn't help but listen to whispers and outright accusations about his role in his first wife's death.
14_2	0.21440337	As authorities continued to investigate a three-day killing spree that left 13 people dead, including Barton, even his mother said she couldn't fathom what transformed the 44-year-old chemist-turned-day trader into the worst mass murderer in Georgia history.
14_3	0.15185403	``Even though I am deeply hurt by the actions of my son, Mark, I loved him very much,'' Barton's 76-year-old mother, Gladys, said in a statement issued Thursday at her home in Sumter, S.C.
14_4	0.12469816	``I wish there was some way to explain why this tragedy occurred or some way that it could have been prevented''.
14_5	0.52252971	Police say they have been unable to determine what motivated Barton to kill his wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday, his children, Matthew and Mychelle, on Wednesday, and nine people in two Atlanta office buildings on Thursday before taking his own life.
14_6	0.45588866	But the securities firm where Barton began his shooting rampage disclosed Friday that he had lost $105,000 on 15 trading days between June 9 and Tuesday _ the day he went home and killed his wife.
14_7	0.29655819	Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard described Barton as ``distraught and troubled,'' a man who ``also felt his wife and his children were suffering and hurting as well''.
14_8	0.1227276	From interviews and court records, a picture emerges of a man whose life continually lacked a semblance of the normalcy he tried to display.
14_9	0.28743668	``I have come to hate this life and this system of things,'' he wrote early Thursday in a note that police later found in the living room of his Henry County apartment.
14_10	0.067046408	``I have come to have no hope''.
14_11	0.084034932	It's difficult to trace the origins of Barton's despair.
14_12	0.065882727	Certainly it does not appear to be rooted in his rather unremarkable childhood.
14_13	0.2542142	An only child whose father worked for the Air Force, Barton moved with his family to Sumter, S.C., when he was 11.
14_14	0.073748186	After graduating from Sumter High School in 1973, Barton attended Clemson University but dropped out.
14_15	0.13568268	Two years later, he enrolled at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, where he received his bachelor's degree in chemistry and met the woman who would become his first wife, Debra Spivey.
14_16	0.11659451	The university's dormitories in Columbia, S.C., were full, and Debra lived at the Wade Hampton Hotel where Barton worked nights.
14_17	0.09794557	They were married May 5, 1979.
14_18	0.36697937	Soon they were living in Atlanta.
14_19	0.10742869	That year, he took a job as a chemist for a company called Zep Manufacturing, which soon transferred him to its Dallas laboratory.
14_20	0.090014947	He remained with the company about four years, said Andy Logue, vice president of human resources for Zep's parent company, National Service Industries.
14_21	0.10054014	From then on, however, Barton's professional and personal lives followed a rocky path.
14_22	0.091168152	In 1984, Barton accepted a job at TLC Manufacturing, a Texarkana, Texas, company that made cleaning compounds.
14_23	0.065455106	By 1988, he had been named TLC's president.
14_24	0.12126818	He made as much as $86,000 a year and controlled 5 percent of the company's stock.
14_25	0.19549035	But two years later, he was fired.
14_26	0.18614943	In a deposition, Barton said TLC executives became upset when they learned he was moving back to Atlanta to start his own business.
14_27	0.13672507	But Texarkana police records also show that, after being fired from TLC, Barton was arrested Sept.
14_28	0.090647442	25, 1990, and briefly jailed on charges that he stole computer discs and notebook binders filled with information from the company.
14_29	0.079090149	Charges against him were dropped a day later because TLC board members declined to prosecute him, Texarkana police spokesman Jeff Heminger said.
14_30	0.11188717	After moving back to Georgia, Barton started his own company, a chemistry consulting firm called Highlander Pride Inc.
14_31	0.025819703	, in July 1990.
14_32	0.089322344	But the company was more ``like having a paper route,'' he testified, because it never generated more than a few thousand dollars of business a year.
14_33	0.087151041	In January 1992, after resigning from a raw material distribution company in Kennesaw, Barton became a sales representative for Macon-based Lomas International, selling raw materials to manufacturers in the rubber, ink and paint industries, said Julie Van Brunt, a spokeswoman for the company, now known as Lintech International.
14_34	0.13978454	With a $50,000 salary and a company Taurus, Barton oversaw sales from North Georgia to the Florida Panhandle.
14_35	0.10098412	A year after he joined the company, he met a new employee: 20-year-old Leigh Ann Vandiver, a customer-support telephone operator.
14_36	0.068887328	She married David Lang a month after starting work, in February 1993.
14_37	0.076501071	By that spring, she and Barton were having an affair.
14_38	0.36734036	On the road most of the time, Barton said he always seemed to get Leigh Ann when he called the office.
14_39	0.21586056	Leigh Ann told him she liked older guys and had told Barton he was ``pretty,'' based on his photo in the company annual.
14_40	0.1287344	``We flirted with each other on the phone,'' Barton said, adding that he began buying new clothes and going to a tanning salon.
14_41	0.12879374	They consummated their relationship in May 1993, Barton testified.
14_42	0.27749048	Barton was playing golf with his buddies at the end of August when he called Leigh Ann using one of his friend's cell phones.
14_43	0.12002192	During this call, Barton testified, she told him she planned to leave her husband.
14_44	0.12890206	Barton was scheduled to make a quarterly sales trip through the Florida Panhandle in September 1993, and Leigh Ann was to accompany him to Panama City.
14_45	0.32036379	The trip was to take place the weekend after Labor Day _ the weekend after Barton's wife and mother-in-law were killed.
14_46	0.22670465	OPTIONAL TRIM Leigh Ann moved out of the home she shared with her husband two days before the bodies of Debra Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey, 59, were found in a travel trailer at the Riverside Campground at Weiss Lake in Alabama.

14_53	0.18394452	Barton's defense lawyer, Michael Hauptman, said in an interview that the killer was an unspecified itinerate roofer who confessed to the killing.
14_54	0.089322932	This person is now serving an unrelated prison sentence in Indiana, Hauptman said.
14_55	0.16484335	But Smith said this man was ruled out as a suspect after his statements did not match evidence and investigators learned he had spent the night of the murders with friends.
14_56	0.16073272	During his deposition, Barton said the last time he saw Debra alive was when she pulled out of their home in her mother's red Thunderbird for the Labor Day camping weekend.
14_57	0.1409717	It was the first time he'd kept the children overnight by himself, he testified.
14_58	0.13520844	That night, with the children worn out and tired, Barton said he sang them songs, read them stories and then put them to bed.
14_59	0.090915172	He played on the computer, listened to a new Mary-Chapin Carpenter album and finished off a six-pack, falling asleep on the sofa, awoke during the night and headed to bed.
14_60	0.15413452	ADDITONAL TRIM In the weeks before Debra Barton's killing, her husband had taken out twin life insurance policies _ $600,000 for him, $600,000 for her.
14_61	0.10271597	Barton testified Debra insisted she have a policy equal to his own.
14_62	0.11221305	``She developed the concept that her worth was equal to mine and that if something happened to her, I would have my hands full taking care of the two kids,'' Barton testified.
14_63	0.079555926	``And she wanted the exact same life insurance that I had, rather than having a smaller amount''.
14_64	0.17822117	But after Debra and her mother, Eloise Spivey, were found hacked to death, the insurers holding the policies didn't buy Barton's story.

22_0	0.1520922	ATLANTA _ Thursday's shootings shined an unwanted light on a high-stakes way to make it or break it: day-trading.
22_1	0.81195894	The man identified as the shooter, Mark Barton, was a day trader.
22_2	0.18463827	He had lost a total of $105,000 over a period of 15 days, ending July 27 at one of the two day trading establishments he used.
22_3	0.36667974	A number of eye witnesses to the shootings said Barton talked about losing money while he was shooting.
22_4	0.19828162	Friday, traders bantering in chat rooms discussed the shootings.
22_5	0.082454205	One posting asked whether ``the wild risks and intense pressures of market speculation'' were to blame.
22_6	0.35076665	``The Atlanta killings are not surprising'' said another member of the Lakeside Trading Club.
22_7	0.11831679	``It was only a matter of time before someone who blew out their account couldn't handle the stress and took it out on innocent victims''.
22_8	0.14188154	However, James Lee, president of Momentum Securities where Barton traded as late as Tuesday, said Friday in a statement that Barton had _ as all traders do _ signed documents saying he understood the risk.
22_9	0.070369636	``It is important to remember, the trading decisions he made were his own,'' said Lee.
22_10	0.046940371	Day-trading is not investing, it's more speculative than that.
22_11	0.099706268	It is an intricately complex way to try to stay a split-second ahead of the direction of a stock price.
22_12	0.07849171	Day-traders feed off a stock's volatile intraday movement.
22_13	0.098040917	The shares most often traded are technology stocks, most of which are on the Nasdaq market, which processes trades electronically.
22_14	0.43023958	Day traders typically work out of places like All-Tech Investment Group and Momentum Securities, the Atlanta businesses where Barton traded.
22_15	0.080671619	These companies provide staff to help the traders and dedicated computers loaded with software on which to trade.
22_16	0.12388043	The typical day trader tends to focus on a handful of companies and to buy and sell those stocks many times in a single session to take advantage of spikes in the prices.
22_17	0.24043773	At the end of the day, the trader cashes out, returning the next day to roll the dice again.
22_18	0.070376026	Tim Bourquin, a 30-year old California day-trader, said traders get a feel for a stock's direction by watching what market makers do.
22_19	0.092807073	Market makers are brokerage firms that keep an inventory in a particular stock to sell to customers.
22_20	0.060724772	They buy or sell stock to keep an orderly market.
22_21	0.086664156	Watching the market makers, lets traders like Bourquin stay a step ahead of the general public.
22_22	0.095109415	That step might be only a few-minute lead, but for a day-trader, who can make a trade in a second, a minute is plenty.
22_23	0.087574542	The losses and gains can be huge, but almost all traders lose money in their first few months, Borquin said.
22_24	0.080769805	The ones who last a year tend to make a living, he said.
22_25	0.072819327	Bourquin, like many day-traders, worried that the actions of one man would stain an industry.
22_26	0.084381008	``I knew people would try and make this a day-trader thing,'' Bourquin said.
22_27	0.061321699	``But it probably had nothing to do with it, or very little.
22_28	0.038154791	This guy was just a lunatic.
22_29	0.053974998	He could have been a mechanic or a doctor.
22_30	0.081567734	What happened in Atlanta has more to do with him being a lunatic than him being a day-trader''.
22_31	0.066728128	How difficult is day-trading?
22_32	0.088935667	Here are some answers to commonly asked questions about day-trading, compiled with the help of David Floyd, a partner at San Diego-based careerdaytrader.com.
22_33	0.098379555	Q: How do day traders know which way a stock will go?
22_34	0.0070385649	A: They don't.
22_35	0.11967252	Many day traders, however, keep a keen eye on S&AMP;P futures.
22_36	-0.027523533	The reason?
22_37	0.078824394	The prices of these tradeable futures contracts and the actual index normally shadow each other quite closely.
22_38	0.11195841	When the gap between the futures and the index narrows or widens, day traders see this as a buy or sell signal.
22_39	0.15099687	Successful day traders rarely bet against this market gauge.
22_40	0.073090243	They buy shares when the futures suggest the market will rise.
22_41	0.089918453	Sometimes they're right.
22_42	0.044858925	Sometimes they're wrong.
22_43	0.10589469	Q: What is the attraction of day trading?
22_44	0.095918492	A: Consider the case of IBM, which fell $3 on Thursday to close at $125.38.
22_45	0.05234855	A normal investor who owned 100 shares of IBM lost $300.
22_46	0.081627761	But a day trader could have ``shorted'' 100 shares of IBM --a bet that the stock would fall, and the only strategy to follow on a day when the S&AMP;P 500 was falling -- until it reached its lowest point.
22_47	0.11618118	That day trader could have made as much as $400.
22_48	0.053510551	Q: What are the risks of day-trading?
22_49	-0.029524647	A: Enormous.
22_50	0.039174683	Investing is inherently risky.
22_51	0.063268024	Day-trading is extreme investing and can be extremely risky.
22_52	0.087388529	Doing it without proper training is folly, especially if you buy or sell on margin (with borrowed funds), which geometrically increases the impact of unexpected market events.
22_53	0.077327229	This is not the way to invest your retirement savings or bet next month's mortgage payment.

23_0	0.29030124	ATLANTA _ A third lawsuit resulting from Mark O.
23_1	0.43406989	Barton's July 29 killing spree at two day trading firms has been filed in Fulton County State Court.
23_2	0.051085289	Alyce F.
23_3	0.16247691	Wenzel, the mother of 30-year-old shooting victim Scott Allyn Webb, claims in her lawsuit that Momentum Securities, Jones Lang LaSalle Americas and Barton Protective Services failed to prevent the killing of her son.
23_4	0.14940593	Momentum should have known Barton was engaging in high-stakes trading and suffering major losses, the lawsuit said.
23_5	0.12294283	``Momentum. . . knew or should have known through exercise of due care, that the business of day trading is a high risk, stressful and volatile enterprise,'' according to the lawsuit.
23_6	0.12222015	Furthermore, the three companies ``should have known of the potentially dangerous conditions contained on the premises and failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the invitees within the office complex from the reasonably foreseeable criminal acts of a third person''.
23_7	0.36444391	Momentum Securities is the company where Webb and three other people were shot and killed July 29 by Barton.
23_8	0.34466283	Five other people were shot to death across the street at a second day trading firm.
23_9	0.22728153	Jones Lang LaSalle Americas is the owner and manager of the building at 3500 Piedmont Road where the killings took place, and Barton Protective Services is the company responsible for the building's security.
23_10	0.10706451	Barton's estate is also named as a defendant.
23_11	0.22453337	Momentum Securities released a brief statement expressing sympathy for the victims of the shooting rampage, but said it is not responsible for it.
23_12	0.14623241	``It is important to remember that Mark Barton, not Momentum Securities, is the one who was and is responsible for these tragic and unforeseeable events,'' the statement read in part.
23_13	0.079668384	Other defendants either declined comment or could not be reached.
23_14	0.10825458	Wenzel is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, court costs and attorney's fees.

24_0	0.19515687	ATLANTA (AP) --Authorities are grimly piecing together what they know about Mark O.
24_1	0.38675641	Barton, the 44-year-old father, investor and former murder suspect who walked into two Atlanta brokerages and killed nine people.
24_2	0.28040595	Some questions may never be answered: Barton sped away after the shooting rampage, driving to a suburb where he killed himself Thursday evening as police closed in.
24_3	0.70367081	Authorities later said he had killed his wife and two children before committing one of the worst workplace massacres in the nation's history.
24_4	0.090529562	Twelve people were injured, some by bullets and others by their frantic attempts to avoid the killer.
24_5	0.038947542	Seven remained in critical condition today.
24_6	0.24337226	This morning, both buildings where the shootings happened were open.

24_9	0.16238541	At the building where the first victims were killed, Allegiance Telecom sales manager Eric Blaier was already at work but took a break to sip a Diet Coke and gaze at the TV satellite trucks parked outside.

24_11	0.075403765	``Unfortunately true''.
24_12	0.23088583	Speculation on a motive has centered on Barton's work as a day trader, investors who dabble in risky, moment-by-moment changes in the stock market, which dropped sharply Thursday.
24_13	0.25319803	But Barton's family was slain earlier in the week and company officials said he hadn't traded since April at the firm where five of his victims died.
24_14	0.039492279	``We have no idea what caused Mr.
24_15	0.12720692	Barton to begin shooting,'' Mayor Bill Campbell said.
24_16	0.30061469	Clues may be found in notes left with the bodies of his family.
24_17	0.140526	Police have not disclosed their contents, except to say that they had found a list indicating Barton had intended to kill at least three more people.
24_18	0.1561695	The shooting rampage --the third in the Atlanta area in little more than two months -- and the ensuing manhunt stunned the city of 3.1 million and quickly captured national attention.
24_19	0.13481337	It was the latest in a grisly wave of mass slayings at schools and workplaces, and President Clinton today expressed sadness at the bloodshed.
24_20	0.23459776	Barton, dark-haired and 6-foot-4, was wearing khaki shorts when he walked into the Momentum Securities brokerage at the Two Securities Centre building in the trendy Buckhead section of Atlanta about 3 p.m.

24_26	0.065535894	Five died there.
24_27	0.15053794	Barton, who was carrying a pistol in each hand, at one point reportedly said: ``I hope this doesn't upset your trading day''.
