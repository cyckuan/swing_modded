0_0	0.29321307	WASHINGTON _ The tapes that Linda Tripp secretly made of telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky may not be released next week with other evidence given to Congress by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said Thursday.
0_1	0.0907532	Rather than the actual tapes, the Illinois Republican said, the committee may release an edited transcript.
0_2	0.17063523	In a series of conversations last year, Lewinsky told Tripp about her White House affair with President Clinton and, allegedly, about attempts to cover it up.
0_3	0.14880582	It was Tripp's decision to give Starr the tapes that spurred an eight-month investigation that is now likely to lead to hearings on impeachment.
0_4	0.56689989	``Linda Tripp's tapes are very long.
0_5	0.010943987	They are very garrulous.
0_6	0.073535204	There is a lot of information that really does not pertain to this investigation,'' said Hyde.
0_7	0.067808966	``There is information there that really could be embarrassing to innocent people, third parties''.
0_8	0.051824755	``We don't want to alter tapes,'' he explained.
0_9	0.054014316	``On the other hand, there is information that should be released.
0_10	0.10012301	We can redact transcripts of the taped material and release those.
0_11	0.051555079	That, so far, seems to be the best way''.
0_12	0.087144045	Democrats on Hyde's committee questioned whether the real Republican motive was to withhold evidence that was damaging to Tripp's motives and methods.
0_13	0.090925428	``My suspicion is that if Republicans thought the tapes hurt the president, they wouldn't hesitate to release them,'' said Rep.
0_14	0.030875494	Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.
0_15	0.091239978	Nadler said he hadn't heard the tapes and noted that Starr's report indicated they may have been altered.
0_16	0.069498165	If there are questions of authenticity, the FBI should verify the tapes, he said.
0_17	0.072697266	``But it makes no sense to release the transcript and not the tape,'' Nadler said.
0_18	0.08535228	``You either release both or you don't release either''.
0_19	0.15257698	``Can anyone think of a principled justification for releasing the videotape of the president but not the audio tape of Linda Tripp''? asked Rep.
0_20	0.010358232	Barney Frank, D-Mass.
0_21	0.075624283	``The Republicans started out saying they were going to treat the president like everybody else.
0_22	0.15479335	Well, apparently, Linda Tripp isn't everybody else''.
0_23	0.089940727	However, Frank noted that the committee Democrats had opposed last week's massive release of evidence and ``are going to be consistent.
0_24	0.082694001	I don't think we're going to be for releasing those tapes either, although obviously the transcript ought to be released''.
0_25	0.096230842	(Story can end here.
0_26	0.10332266	Optional add follows).
0_27	0.033537475	Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla.
0_28	0.091732422	, said withholding the Tripp tapes would continue the pattern of partisanship by the committee's majority Republicans.
0_29	0.083666137	Although he hadn't heard the Tripp tapes, Wexler said he wants the evidence released but all at once, in a fair manner, rather than being dribbled out.
0_30	0.18902912	Both Tripp and Lewinsky had been exiled from White House jobs to the Pentagon, and the tapes reportedly recount Lewinsky confiding her most intimate thoughts with Tripp.
0_31	0.11294354	``I'm really sorry for everything that happened,'' a tearful Lewinsky told the grand jury as she finished her testimony.
0_32	0.40715313	``And I hate Linda Tripp''.
0_33	0.10624571	Indeed, the grand jury testimony, e-mail and other evidence already released by Congress indicates that Tripp practically assembled the case before going to Starr.
0_34	0.12518829	It was Tripp, Lewinsky told the grand jury, who was at least partly responsible that the semen-stained Gap dress was never cleaned, thus preserving genetic evidence of the sexual relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky.
0_35	0.10153807	Lewinsky said Tripp ``told me that I should put it in a safe deposit box because it could be evidence one day''.
0_36	0.075835506	Lewinsky testified that she told her friend that would never happen.
0_37	0.081282021	But then ``she told me I looked fat in the dress'' and loaned her a jacket to wear to an event instead, Lewinsky recalled.
0_38	0.080260115	Lewinsky also said Tripp urged her not to sign an affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit denying both the affair and obtaining presidential assistance in securing a job.
0_39	0.10581285	Lewinsky said she had already signed and misled Tripp about the timing.
0_40	0.083458116	Starr has raised suspicions about the audio tapes, noting that some seem to have been altered or copied.
0_41	0.15713837	Tripp has denied duplicating or altering the tapes.
0_42	0.11192442	It is illegal to tape someone without their knowledge in Maryland, and a state grand jury is investigating the case.
0_43	0.073248277	Hyde said that probe would not affect the decision on whether to release the tapes.
0_44	0.10104811	``I, frankly, think an impeachment inquiry takes precedence over the grand jury in Maryland,'' he explained.
0_45	0.096603646	``The information that should go out should go out, but there's an awful lot there that shouldn't go out''.

1_5	0.066482543	Her deepest regret, she said, was the pain she had caused her young friend, Monica.
1_6	0.060124734	She said she saw Monica ``as a kid'' and wanted to save her.

3_11	0.07851574	``Please give me a break,'' Mrs.

3_18	0.057269002	Earlier this week, Mrs.

3_28	0.11461131	After the grand jury recessed for the day, one of her lawyers said that Mrs.
3_29	0.14668097	Tripp was ``very encouraged by the quality and the content of the questions presented by the grand jurors and by the prosecutor''.
3_30	0.091141936	The lawyer, Joseph Murtha refused to say what questions Mrs.

3_41	0.067512469	If she does not, they say, she almost certainly will be indicted.

17_0	0.2236192	WASHINGTON (AP) --Under criminal investigation in Maryland, Linda Tripp is returning to the Pentagon to a different job than the one she had a year ago when her secret tape-recordings triggered the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
17_1	0.1064351	Mrs. Tripp will be a public affairs specialist in the Defense Department's Manpower Data Center, two people familiar with the matter said Monday night.
17_2	0.11024223	Mrs. Tripp was informed of the change Monday at the Pentagon in a meeting with her supervisor, Doug Wilson, the principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for public affairs.
17_3	0.053190315	Army Col.

17_16	0.1803012	Mrs. Tripp's federal immunity from prosecution from independent counsel Kenneth Starr may not save her from the Maryland prosecutor, who is gathering evidence independent of the tapes and her sworn testimony to Starr.
18_0	0.27622439	Linda Tripp was a lot easier to take when she was slinking around in Ken Starr's shadow and refusing to comment on his investigation of the president.
18_1	0.070670339	She was also a lot easier to ignore, because her self-imposed silence prevented her from standing in front of TV cameras and making statements so outrageous and insulting that they required a response.

18_8	0.11168008	Even Starr never asked _ at least not before Tripp took her trash heap of tape-recorded gossip to the independent counsel and left him little choice but to investigate.
18_9	0.088672163	The fact is, just about no one asked to be involved in the sex-and-lies scandal that has dominated public discussion in this country for six months.
18_10	0.070229901	But Tripp not only invited herself into this mess _ she started it.
18_11	0.29374104	It was Tripp who decided to secretly tape conversations with Lewinsky in which Lewinsky talked about an alleged affair with Clinton.
18_12	0.24420153	It was Tripp who ultimately tipped off Starr and the news media to the existence of the tapes.
18_13	0.10260736	It was Tripp who reportedly baited the perjury trap by providing information about Lewinsky to lawyers in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton.
18_14	0.081267263	Tripp didn't ``ask'' to be involved?
18_15	0.10342477	Maybe she's right.
18_16	0.038926506	She ``demanded'' to be involved.
18_17	0.082320645	There are undoubtedly some among the American people who look upon Tripp as a great public servant, or even as a hero, for her role in exposing alleged misconduct by the president and others.
18_18	0.077606777	These folks are entitled to their opinion, of course.
18_19	0.10128343	And maybe her admirers agreed when Tripp stood on the steps of the federal courthouse in Washington and declared herself the embodiment of the ``average American''.

18_32	0.077067653	She obviously doesn't think she asked for all that, either.
18_33	0.086751687	But she asked for it the minute she set out to discredit a president she despised _ and to do it by betraying the friendship of a young woman who trusted her.
18_34	0.076323887	Tripp surely must understand that she volunteered to be a target for vilification.
18_35	0.092208816	No one who is inventive enough to touch off a scandal that some say could topple a president could possibly be so naive as to underestimate the price she would pay for doing so.
18_36	0.10041672	Linda Tripp is many things _ and those things are good or bad, depending on your point of view _ but one thing she is not is an average American.
