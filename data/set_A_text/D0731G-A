17_0	0.18002228	WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) --Linda Tripp, whose secret recording of phone conversations started a White House sex scandal investigation, entered the federal courthouse Tuesday for her third day of testimony.
17_1	0.36800863	Mrs. Tripp is reportedly providing a federal grand jury a detailed account of her contact with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
17_2	0.10191685	Phil Coughter, a spokesman for Tripp's lawyers, says he doesn't know whether this grand jury appearance will be her last in the investigation of possible perjury, obstruction and witness tampering.
17_3	0.33995649	Independent counsel Kenneth Starr is investigating an alleged presidential affair and cover-up.
17_4	0.097479134	Starr's spokesman, Charles Bakaly, said over the weekend that the grand jury has been asking a lot of questions and that Starr is moving the probe along as quickly as possible.
17_5	0.1877594	Tripp testified last Tuesday and Thursday before the grand jury.
17_6	0.14425675	The probe was triggered by Tripp's 20 hours of secretly recorded phone calls with Lewinsky in which the former intern confided an alleged affair with President Bill Clinton.
18_0	0.26715088	Linda Tripp was a lot easier to take when she was slinking around in Ken Starr's shadow and refusing to comment on his investigation of the president.
18_1	0.083218091	She was also a lot easier to ignore, because her self-imposed silence prevented her from standing in front of TV cameras and making statements so outrageous and insulting that they required a response.
18_2	0.10033208	But all that changed on Wednesday, when Tripp emerged from her final session of grand jury testimony in the Great Clinton Sex Probe of 1998 and tried to engender public sympathy by passing herself off as a victim.
18_3	0.11919382	``I never, ever asked to be placed in this position,'' Tripp declared.
18_4	0.087210504	There are any number of people who could honestly claim that they never asked to be involved in the Great Sex Probe.
18_5	0.10653603	Bill Clinton never asked.
18_6	0.33849415	Monica Lewinsky never asked.
18_7	0.073002336	The Secret Service never asked.
18_8	0.10831802	Even Starr never asked _ at least not before Tripp took her trash heap of tape-recorded gossip to the independent counsel and left him little choice but to investigate.
18_9	0.078342807	The fact is, just about no one asked to be involved in the sex-and-lies scandal that has dominated public discussion in this country for six months.
18_10	0.082704253	But Tripp not only invited herself into this mess _ she started it.
18_11	0.29003467	It was Tripp who decided to secretly tape conversations with Lewinsky in which Lewinsky talked about an alleged affair with Clinton.
18_12	0.25363793	It was Tripp who ultimately tipped off Starr and the news media to the existence of the tapes.
18_13	0.11615587	It was Tripp who reportedly baited the perjury trap by providing information about Lewinsky to lawyers in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton.
18_14	0.087805803	Tripp didn't ``ask'' to be involved?
18_15	0.092825653	Maybe she's right.
18_16	0.076516236	She ``demanded'' to be involved.
18_17	0.085667154	There are undoubtedly some among the American people who look upon Tripp as a great public servant, or even as a hero, for her role in exposing alleged misconduct by the president and others.
18_18	0.086176513	These folks are entitled to their opinion, of course.
18_19	0.10166796	And maybe her admirers agreed when Tripp stood on the steps of the federal courthouse in Washington and declared herself the embodiment of the ``average American''.
18_20	0.088519272	``I understand that there has been a great deal of speculation about just who I am and how I got here,'' she said.
18_21	0.10096039	``Well, the answer is simple.
18_22	0.088835066	I'm you.
18_23	0.085978764	I'm just like you.

18_27	0.080757574	She's an average American?
18_28	0.087299515	Here's a news flash.
18_29	0.090687758	Average Americans don't tape private conversations with people who are supposed to be their friends; they don't egg friends on when they consider doing something illegal; and they don't encourage federal prosecutors to root through their friends' sex lives.
18_30	0.094671239	The average American is not a scheming, back-stabbing, double-dealing creep who would rather indulge some perverse hatred for a politician than help a friend who's clearly in need of help.
18_31	0.08906013	Tripp devoted much of her post-testimony statement to whining about the vilification she has endured at the hands of Clintonian spinmeisters, show-business jokemasters and ``legions of paid prevaricators''.
18_32	0.093854502	She obviously doesn't think she asked for all that, either.
18_33	0.088230323	But she asked for it the minute she set out to discredit a president she despised _ and to do it by betraying the friendship of a young woman who trusted her.
18_34	0.094185006	Tripp surely must understand that she volunteered to be a target for vilification.
18_35	0.095144162	No one who is inventive enough to touch off a scandal that some say could topple a president could possibly be so naive as to underestimate the price she would pay for doing so.
18_36	0.095568014	Linda Tripp is many things _ and those things are good or bad, depending on your point of view _ but one thing she is not is an average American.
18_37	0.08662505	And she is not a victim, though she has victimized others.
18_38	0.093370893	She would do herself and the rest of us a favor if she would retreat to her previous status: seldom seen and never heard.

24_22	0.12185251	Well, apparently, Linda Tripp isn't everybody else''.
24_23	0.085718269	However, Frank noted that the committee Democrats had opposed last week's massive release of evidence and ``are going to be consistent.
24_24	0.088356165	I don't think we're going to be for releasing those tapes either, although obviously the transcript ought to be released''.

24_29	0.090290115	Although he hadn't heard the Tripp tapes, Wexler said he wants the evidence released but all at once, in a fair manner, rather than being dribbled out.
24_30	0.20067066	Both Tripp and Lewinsky had been exiled from White House jobs to the Pentagon, and the tapes reportedly recount Lewinsky confiding her most intimate thoughts with Tripp.

24_34	0.13777887	It was Tripp, Lewinsky told the grand jury, who was at least partly responsible that the semen-stained Gap dress was never cleaned, thus preserving genetic evidence of the sexual relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky.
24_35	0.097664787	Lewinsky said Tripp ``told me that I should put it in a safe deposit box because it could be evidence one day''.
24_36	0.0967877	Lewinsky testified that she told her friend that would never happen.

24_38	0.091653904	Lewinsky also said Tripp urged her not to sign an affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit denying both the affair and obtaining presidential assistance in securing a job.
24_39	0.1253717	Lewinsky said she had already signed and misled Tripp about the timing.

24_43	0.085928833	Hyde said that probe would not affect the decision on whether to release the tapes.
24_44	0.090331967	``I, frankly, think an impeachment inquiry takes precedence over the grand jury in Maryland,'' he explained.
24_45	0.10302168	``The information that should go out should go out, but there's an awful lot there that shouldn't go out''.
