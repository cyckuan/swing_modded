17_0	0.26061167	WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) --Linda Tripp, whose secret recording of phone conversations started a White House sex scandal investigation, entered the federal courthouse Tuesday for her third day of testimony.
17_1	0.47001516	Mrs. Tripp is reportedly providing a federal grand jury a detailed account of her contact with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
17_2	0.15635254	Phil Coughter, a spokesman for Tripp's lawyers, says he doesn't know whether this grand jury appearance will be her last in the investigation of possible perjury, obstruction and witness tampering.
17_3	0.29033852	Independent counsel Kenneth Starr is investigating an alleged presidential affair and cover-up.
17_4	0.14141418	Starr's spokesman, Charles Bakaly, said over the weekend that the grand jury has been asking a lot of questions and that Starr is moving the probe along as quickly as possible.
17_5	0.16461182	Tripp testified last Tuesday and Thursday before the grand jury.
17_6	0.21588333	The probe was triggered by Tripp's 20 hours of secretly recorded phone calls with Lewinsky in which the former intern confided an alleged affair with President Bill Clinton.
18_0	0.2014003	Linda Tripp was a lot easier to take when she was slinking around in Ken Starr's shadow and refusing to comment on his investigation of the president.
18_1	0.025223376	She was also a lot easier to ignore, because her self-imposed silence prevented her from standing in front of TV cameras and making statements so outrageous and insulting that they required a response.
18_2	0.11058439	But all that changed on Wednesday, when Tripp emerged from her final session of grand jury testimony in the Great Clinton Sex Probe of 1998 and tried to engender public sympathy by passing herself off as a victim.
18_3	0.10253664	``I never, ever asked to be placed in this position,'' Tripp declared.
18_4	0.091856625	There are any number of people who could honestly claim that they never asked to be involved in the Great Sex Probe.
18_5	0.13351847	Bill Clinton never asked.
18_6	0.3950775	Monica Lewinsky never asked.
18_7	0.088958613	The Secret Service never asked.
18_8	0.10974943	Even Starr never asked _ at least not before Tripp took her trash heap of tape-recorded gossip to the independent counsel and left him little choice but to investigate.
18_9	0.07967783	The fact is, just about no one asked to be involved in the sex-and-lies scandal that has dominated public discussion in this country for six months.
18_10	0.09166041	But Tripp not only invited herself into this mess _ she started it.
18_11	0.22595115	It was Tripp who decided to secretly tape conversations with Lewinsky in which Lewinsky talked about an alleged affair with Clinton.
18_12	0.13856086	It was Tripp who ultimately tipped off Starr and the news media to the existence of the tapes.
18_13	0.11184923	It was Tripp who reportedly baited the perjury trap by providing information about Lewinsky to lawyers in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton.
18_14	0.10668207	Tripp didn't ``ask'' to be involved?
18_15	0.082243056	Maybe she's right.
18_16	0.091113183	She ``demanded'' to be involved.
18_17	0.075724002	There are undoubtedly some among the American people who look upon Tripp as a great public servant, or even as a hero, for her role in exposing alleged misconduct by the president and others.
18_18	0.095437562	These folks are entitled to their opinion, of course.
18_19	0.110058	And maybe her admirers agreed when Tripp stood on the steps of the federal courthouse in Washington and declared herself the embodiment of the ``average American''.
18_20	0.092952627	``I understand that there has been a great deal of speculation about just who I am and how I got here,'' she said.
18_21	0.10301979	``Well, the answer is simple.

18_23	0.094049058	I'm just like you.

18_28	0.094685192	Here's a news flash.
18_29	0.088165804	Average Americans don't tape private conversations with people who are supposed to be their friends; they don't egg friends on when they consider doing something illegal; and they don't encourage federal prosecutors to root through their friends' sex lives.

18_31	0.078329476	Tripp devoted much of her post-testimony statement to whining about the vilification she has endured at the hands of Clintonian spinmeisters, show-business jokemasters and ``legions of paid prevaricators''.
18_32	0.093069107	She obviously doesn't think she asked for all that, either.
18_33	0.085188494	But she asked for it the minute she set out to discredit a president she despised _ and to do it by betraying the friendship of a young woman who trusted her.
18_34	0.088748215	Tripp surely must understand that she volunteered to be a target for vilification.
18_35	0.085074728	No one who is inventive enough to touch off a scandal that some say could topple a president could possibly be so naive as to underestimate the price she would pay for doing so.
18_36	0.088262314	Linda Tripp is many things _ and those things are good or bad, depending on your point of view _ but one thing she is not is an average American.
18_37	0.088913491	And she is not a victim, though she has victimized others.
18_38	0.096896847	She would do herself and the rest of us a favor if she would retreat to her previous status: seldom seen and never heard.

24_22	0.20035463	Well, apparently, Linda Tripp isn't everybody else''.
24_23	0.076448974	However, Frank noted that the committee Democrats had opposed last week's massive release of evidence and ``are going to be consistent.
24_24	0.092174606	I don't think we're going to be for releasing those tapes either, although obviously the transcript ought to be released''.

24_29	0.092603563	Although he hadn't heard the Tripp tapes, Wexler said he wants the evidence released but all at once, in a fair manner, rather than being dribbled out.
24_30	0.17124649	Both Tripp and Lewinsky had been exiled from White House jobs to the Pentagon, and the tapes reportedly recount Lewinsky confiding her most intimate thoughts with Tripp.
24_31	0.094013955	``I'm really sorry for everything that happened,'' a tearful Lewinsky told the grand jury as she finished her testimony.

24_34	0.13437566	It was Tripp, Lewinsky told the grand jury, who was at least partly responsible that the semen-stained Gap dress was never cleaned, thus preserving genetic evidence of the sexual relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky.
24_35	0.095550731	Lewinsky said Tripp ``told me that I should put it in a safe deposit box because it could be evidence one day''.

24_39	0.098742302	Lewinsky said she had already signed and misled Tripp about the timing.
