8_0	0.14396064	Oprah Winfrey has played a big part in the emergence of our tell-all culture, not with a lurid approach, but with a truth-will-set-you-free attitude.
8_1	0.11880408	From revelations of her own sexually abused girlhood to the stream of guests who work toward emotional health by confessing their problems on television, ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' has become a favorite site for talking cures.
8_2	0.089327203	So it makes sense that the latest film in her ``Oprah Winfrey Presents'' series is ``David and Lisa,'' a remake of the 1962 film about two emotionally disturbed teen-agers who meet at an institution and form a tentative, healing friendship.
8_3	0.082268618	This new version literally brings mental illness into the light.
8_4	0.076316059	The original ``David and Lisa'' was shot in black-and-white so extreme that it looked gothic.
8_5	0.077445089	And though the film was a sympathetic attempt to demystify mental illness, the melodramatic music sounded like it belonged in a movie about institutional horrors, like ``The Snake Pit''.
8_6	0.16265155	``Oprah Winfrey Presents: David and Lisa'' takes place in the California sun.
8_7	0.077600329	The institution where the teen-agers live is filled with windows that let crystal light shine through.
8_8	0.074388409	It shines especially brightly in the immense office of the school's head, who is played by Sidney Poitier and so deserves nothing less.
8_9	0.076822079	But the visual openness is the only dramatic change in this dull film, which turns out to be disappointingly like the old one.
8_10	0.075146505	Such a faithful rendering seems senseless because time has robbed the story of its daring.
8_11	0.07488934	Or maybe ``David and Lisa,'' with its simplistic message about the healing touch of friendship, was always waiting for the psychobabble '90s to catch up to it.
8_12	0.07634377	The key to this film's approach comes in Ms.
8_13	0.090327626	Winfrey's introduction.
8_14	0.077068803	``Like David, sometimes we can get consumed by fears and anxieties,'' she says, explaining why she wanted to produce this story.
8_15	0.079503146	With the help of his psychiatrist, David arrives at ``a place where he can begin to feel and trust again''.
8_16	0.27267738	Like an extension of the ``Oprah Winfrey Show,'' this is television as therapy.
8_17	0.085080065	But David has more serious problems than what might be labeled intimacy issues.
8_18	0.083987239	``Touch can kill,'' he yells, recoiling in terror when he arrives at the school and another student accidentally brushes his hand while trying to help with his luggage.
8_19	0.080449705	His fear of being touched physically seems an impossibly blunt '90s addition, but it was there in the original, too.
8_20	0.091721461	Lukas Haas does not glamorize David, with his lank hair, buttoned-up shirts and gaunt, haunted face.
8_21	0.084110217	David is so obsessed with order and time that he spends his days making precise drawings of the inner mechanisms of clocks.
8_22	0.1088999	If David keeps everything in, Lisa (Brittany Murphy) lets everything out.
8_23	0.096150851	She swirls in circles and speaks in rhymes.
8_24	0.10901004	``Nag, nag, dirty hag,'' she taunts her social worker, Maggie (Debi Mazar).
8_25	0.089631686	She is a shy, pretty girl, with a childlike innocence and blooming sexuality that the film hints at.
8_26	0.097949182	Individually, the actors inhabit David and Lisa convincingly, yet together they fail to make the emotional connection on which the entire story depends.
8_27	0.10845678	Lloyd Kramer's direction is neither mawkish nor tough; it is simply pedestrian.
8_28	0.081017353	Poitier is used for his iconic presence here.
8_29	0.10993486	He can exude authority simply by standing, sitting or walking into a room, and often that's what he's called on to do.
8_30	0.090478728	At other times he is saddled with the film's most babbly aphorisms, including, ``If you don't feel in love with life, you are more dead than alive''.
8_31	0.088551817	The film barely acknowledges the changes that have taken place in the study of psychology in the last three decades.
8_32	0.091491392	In one of the rare instances when it does, the hyperintelligent David says Lisa is ``disassociative'' and sneers at the idea that she might have been diagnosed as schizophrenic.
8_33	0.098166149	(In 1962, schizophrenia was precisely the proud diagnosis David offered).
8_34	0.095222451	Poitier's character says he prefers simple language.

8_36	0.090989734	As disappointing as ``David and Lisa'' is, it would be too bad if it became ammunition in the growing Oprah backlash.
8_37	0.087180157	The two previous television films she produced, ``Before Women Had Wings'' and ``The Wedding,'' were among the most intelligent and finely wrought network films of the past two years.

9_9	0.085203566	``There's a lot of instant power in being the head of a studio,'' Tierney noted.
9_10	0.085861011	Snider, a three-year veteran of Universal who was ranked 19th last year, became co-chairwoman in June as the studio was ending its long box office slump with ``The Mummy,'' ``Notting Hill'' and ``American Pie''.

9_12	0.088121141	Tierney pointed out that the list _ based on position, how much money they control and success in the marketplace of their products _ reflected a generally strong upward shift among women executives in Hollywood.

9_16	0.093894052	The increased power among female executives is the key reason why Winfrey's ranking slid from first to 19th, according to Tierney.

9_18	0.087991437	Winfrey, chairwoman of Chicago-based Harpo Entertainment Group, also saw her ranking fall due to a below-expectations performance by ``Beloved,'' in which she starred, and a slight decline in the overall clout of the talk-show business.

22_16	0.08159846	``It's a cardboard box,'' says Freedman.
22_17	0.073875576	But it's worth it because she considers the training conditions here perfect _ the moderate year-round weather, the trails and hills wending to the coast on which she rides some 350 miles a week and where ``she knows every leaf and rock,'' says her father.
22_18	0.075756158	Even her temporary move indoors, which will end after the Olympics, was planned with Sydney in mind.
22_19	0.073425248	She needs her sleep, Freedman explains, and it's futile trying to get much in the driveway because a train regularly traverses the tracks in the shadow of the neighborhood and sounds its horn throughout the night.

22_52	0.094850938	That continued in high school, where Freedman captained the track team, excelling in events ranging from the 100-yard dash to the 2-mile, and played tennis.
22_53	0.094540903	``She was probably the best all-around athlete I ever had,'' says former Wellesley High track coach Mickey Walsh.
22_54	0.079498825	``What I found special about her was her toughness.

22_57	0.10538307	When she got to MIT, she continued to compete in track and played basketball, but these seemed no more than extracurricular activities as Freedman focused on her studies.

22_59	0.087291531	She discovered that MIT wasn't the best for her.

22_67	0.088307244	``If I fell dead on the track, it wouldn't matter'' to the team.
22_68	0.086496652	So after her junior year, she tried another approach.
