0_3	0.063074925	She'll good-naturedly point out that this old team van has occupied this spot since Miller nursed it here from Colorado despite a crippling generator problem that meant the engine couldn't be restarted once it was turned off.
0_4	0.074203784	And, though she's now the van lord rather than the resident, she'll chuckle through a guided tour of the interior, featuring a spartan bed on which she's placed a futon; a cabinet console that houses an assortment of nutritional supplements _ ``I think I take more pills than my 80-year-old grandmother''; the guest room, also known as the passenger seat; the laundry room, formerly the driver's seat; and an eclectic library scattered along the floor consisting of cycling tomes and works ranging from ``Schindler's List'' to Jackie Joyner-Kersee's autobiography.

0_16	0.089421018	``It's a cardboard box,'' says Freedman.

21_0	0.11041427	LONDON (AP) --Oprah Winfrey is fed up with the sleaze on daytime television -- especially rival Jerry Springer's show -- and is ready to bail out of her long-running show.

21_4	0.10984783	Despite its 32 Daytime Emmys, it recently has been challenged in the ratings by ``The Jerry Springer Show''.
21_5	0.095098066	While in London to promote her new film, ``Beloved,'' she told the newspaper it was depressing to return to television after her stint on the movie set.
21_6	0.079588783	``Coming off that wonderful film to be just interviewing more dysfunctional people was a letdown,'' she said.
21_7	0.08276787	Another reason for her disgust, she said, is Springer, calling his show a ``vulgarity circus''.
21_8	0.087273759	``Unless you are going to kill people on the air, and not just hit them on the head with chairs, and unless you are going to have sexual intercourse --and not just, as I saw the other day, a guy pulling down his pants and pulling out his penis -- then there comes a point when you have oversaturated yourself,'' Winfrey was quoted as telling the Times.

22_1	0.11079254	From revelations of her own sexually abused girlhood to the stream of guests who work toward emotional health by confessing their problems on television, ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' has become a favorite site for talking cures.
22_2	0.083201059	So it makes sense that the latest film in her ``Oprah Winfrey Presents'' series is ``David and Lisa,'' a remake of the 1962 film about two emotionally disturbed teen-agers who meet at an institution and form a tentative, healing friendship.
22_3	0.061792873	This new version literally brings mental illness into the light.
22_4	0.066786341	The original ``David and Lisa'' was shot in black-and-white so extreme that it looked gothic.
22_5	0.078086476	And though the film was a sympathetic attempt to demystify mental illness, the melodramatic music sounded like it belonged in a movie about institutional horrors, like ``The Snake Pit''.

22_9	0.074603101	But the visual openness is the only dramatic change in this dull film, which turns out to be disappointingly like the old one.
22_10	0.06606589	Such a faithful rendering seems senseless because time has robbed the story of its daring.
22_11	0.079827406	Or maybe ``David and Lisa,'' with its simplistic message about the healing touch of friendship, was always waiting for the psychobabble '90s to catch up to it.

22_16	0.23704037	Like an extension of the ``Oprah Winfrey Show,'' this is television as therapy.

22_32	0.087907813	In one of the rare instances when it does, the hyperintelligent David says Lisa is ``disassociative'' and sneers at the idea that she might have been diagnosed as schizophrenic.
