0_1	0.072260034	The new channel, which has yet to be named, will be launched together with an accompanying Web site early next year, the companies announced Thursday.

8_0	0.10987921	Oprah Winfrey has played a big part in the emergence of our tell-all culture, not with a lurid approach, but with a truth-will-set-you-free attitude.
8_1	0.12544487	From revelations of her own sexually abused girlhood to the stream of guests who work toward emotional health by confessing their problems on television, ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' has become a favorite site for talking cures.
8_2	0.086469796	So it makes sense that the latest film in her ``Oprah Winfrey Presents'' series is ``David and Lisa,'' a remake of the 1962 film about two emotionally disturbed teen-agers who meet at an institution and form a tentative, healing friendship.
8_3	0.092857445	This new version literally brings mental illness into the light.
8_4	0.094719911	The original ``David and Lisa'' was shot in black-and-white so extreme that it looked gothic.
8_5	0.031015606	And though the film was a sympathetic attempt to demystify mental illness, the melodramatic music sounded like it belonged in a movie about institutional horrors, like ``The Snake Pit''.
8_6	0.14254542	``Oprah Winfrey Presents: David and Lisa'' takes place in the California sun.
8_7	0.094592771	The institution where the teen-agers live is filled with windows that let crystal light shine through.
8_8	0.074876532	It shines especially brightly in the immense office of the school's head, who is played by Sidney Poitier and so deserves nothing less.
8_9	0.091504226	But the visual openness is the only dramatic change in this dull film, which turns out to be disappointingly like the old one.
8_10	0.091555891	Such a faithful rendering seems senseless because time has robbed the story of its daring.
8_11	0.076151751	Or maybe ``David and Lisa,'' with its simplistic message about the healing touch of friendship, was always waiting for the psychobabble '90s to catch up to it.
8_12	0.093405655	The key to this film's approach comes in Ms.
8_13	0.15245396	Winfrey's introduction.
8_14	0.088875555	``Like David, sometimes we can get consumed by fears and anxieties,'' she says, explaining why she wanted to produce this story.
8_15	0.093763462	With the help of his psychiatrist, David arrives at ``a place where he can begin to feel and trust again''.
8_16	0.13789549	Like an extension of the ``Oprah Winfrey Show,'' this is television as therapy.
8_17	0.094978549	But David has more serious problems than what might be labeled intimacy issues.
8_18	0.061005632	``Touch can kill,'' he yells, recoiling in terror when he arrives at the school and another student accidentally brushes his hand while trying to help with his luggage.
8_19	0.092339896	His fear of being touched physically seems an impossibly blunt '90s addition, but it was there in the original, too.
8_20	0.066614785	Lukas Haas does not glamorize David, with his lank hair, buttoned-up shirts and gaunt, haunted face.
8_21	0.080048833	David is so obsessed with order and time that he spends his days making precise drawings of the inner mechanisms of clocks.
8_22	0.071203698	If David keeps everything in, Lisa (Brittany Murphy) lets everything out.
8_23	0.10195427	She swirls in circles and speaks in rhymes.

8_26	0.075209435	Individually, the actors inhabit David and Lisa convincingly, yet together they fail to make the emotional connection on which the entire story depends.
8_27	0.10007944	Lloyd Kramer's direction is neither mawkish nor tough; it is simply pedestrian.
8_28	0.095116273	Poitier is used for his iconic presence here.
8_29	0.08091948	He can exude authority simply by standing, sitting or walking into a room, and often that's what he's called on to do.
8_30	0.075277025	At other times he is saddled with the film's most babbly aphorisms, including, ``If you don't feel in love with life, you are more dead than alive''.
8_31	0.093002573	The film barely acknowledges the changes that have taken place in the study of psychology in the last three decades.
8_32	0.078056802	In one of the rare instances when it does, the hyperintelligent David says Lisa is ``disassociative'' and sneers at the idea that she might have been diagnosed as schizophrenic.
8_33	0.088844315	(In 1962, schizophrenia was precisely the proud diagnosis David offered).
8_34	0.094392856	Poitier's character says he prefers simple language.

9_18	0.08157724	Winfrey, chairwoman of Chicago-based Harpo Entertainment Group, also saw her ranking fall due to a below-expectations performance by ``Beloved,'' in which she starred, and a slight decline in the overall clout of the talk-show business.

22_16	0.083631994	``It's a cardboard box,'' says Freedman.
22_17	0.076934851	But it's worth it because she considers the training conditions here perfect _ the moderate year-round weather, the trails and hills wending to the coast on which she rides some 350 miles a week and where ``she knows every leaf and rock,'' says her father.
22_18	0.098771709	Even her temporary move indoors, which will end after the Olympics, was planned with Sydney in mind.
22_19	0.0462118	She needs her sleep, Freedman explains, and it's futile trying to get much in the driveway because a train regularly traverses the tracks in the shadow of the neighborhood and sounds its horn throughout the night.

22_25	0.09058252	In the meantime, she follows a trail that almost defies orthodoxy.

22_29	0.090468845	For better or worse, this is Freedman's unique interpretation of the American dream.
22_30	0.022207885	And even while her parents _ who thought she would proceed directly from college into a career _ cautiously wonder when, if ever, she'll use that bachelor's degree in the marketplace, they applaud her resolve.

22_42	0.088150253	At least not on the surface.

22_44	0.09086636	``When she started biking, you knew it was a passion for her''.

22_51	0.092699863	``And she basically was good at everything she tried''.
22_52	0.043832098	That continued in high school, where Freedman captained the track team, excelling in events ranging from the 100-yard dash to the 2-mile, and played tennis.
22_53	0.071070292	``She was probably the best all-around athlete I ever had,'' says former Wellesley High track coach Mickey Walsh.
22_54	0.091085571	``What I found special about her was her toughness.
22_55	0.091055413	She was dynamic, a great kid with a great sense of humor.
22_56	0.098724629	She's the reason people go into coaching''.
22_57	0.096209516	When she got to MIT, she continued to compete in track and played basketball, but these seemed no more than extracurricular activities as Freedman focused on her studies.
22_58	0.091460893	``If I did what I'm best at,'' she says, ``I'd be a mechanical engineer''.
22_59	0.096233213	She discovered that MIT wasn't the best for her.
22_60	0.097022151	For one thing, she wanted to pursue liberal arts.

22_66	0.086550523	At the Division 1 level in track, ``I was thoroughly mediocre,'' says Freedman.
22_67	0.09054176	``If I fell dead on the track, it wouldn't matter'' to the team.
22_68	0.098807271	So after her junior year, she tried another approach.

22_75	0.093315376	``I didn't do any after that,'' she says.

22_83	0.074658274	Freedman helped Stanford win the informal national college championship, then participated in the Ride Across America.
22_84	0.086184471	And she was hooked.

22_87	0.089642911	Some 440 miles from the Stanford campus.
22_88	0.092242755	And on excursions to the beach during their stay, Nicole would ride while they would drive.
22_89	0.081053392	She'd start out earlier, and she'd always be there to meet them when they arrived, having covered a route that included uphill ascents even Corey considered taxing _ and she was in a car.

22_92	0.083566087	Now Nicole is living for the ultimate moment _ the Olympic race, where she'll try to put the pedal to the medal in what would truly be an amazing acccomplishment.
22_93	0.091406583	``It's risk and reward,'' says Miller.
