0_5	0.49592578	The fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords has been marked by clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli soldiers, the Israeli closure of the West Bank and Gaza, and massive peace demonstrations in Israel.

0_7	0.18729317	U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is still shuttling between the two sides to bridge their gaps over the second stage of Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and the prospect of an agreement remains unclear.
0_8	0.15007801	The Oslo peace process went quite smoothly in its first two years.
0_9	0.11552958	Following a series of deadly suicide bombings sponsored by Hamas against Israel in early 1996 and the current Likud government came to power in the middle of that year, the peace process began to falter.
0_10	0.18332594	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had repeatedly attacked the Oslo Accords for being incomplete and failing to address Israeli security concerns, has replaced the "land for peace" principle by "peace with security" since he took office in 1996.
0_11	0.15240874	In line with this policy, Israel began to build Jewish settlements, abolishing the former Labor government's policy of freezing their establishment, and delayed the redeployment in the West Bank.
0_12	0.16288639	Israel also tightened the control over Jerusalem, on which both Israel and the Palestinians claim sovereignty, by intensifying settlement activity and demolishing Palestinian houses.

1_0	0.27075938	GAZA CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) --Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has warned that the failure of the signed Palestinian-Israeli peace accords will lead the region to violence.
1_1	0.091127909	Arafat made the remarks in an exclusive interview with Xinhua on the eve of his visit to China.
1_2	0.061383718	He will start his three-day visit to China on Monday.
1_3	0.1369207	He said the Palestinians are seeking peace --but with several options all open in resisting the abhorred Israeli occupation.
1_4	0.074076013	"We have the longest revolution and the longest intifada (uprising) in the modern history.
1_5	0.090278257	The collapse of the (signed peace) accords...
1_6	0.060900444	will return the region to the circle of violence," he said.
1_7	0.10178373	"The basic rule to push forward the peace process," he said, "only requires the honest implementation of the accords and adherence to land-for-peace principle, in line with international legitimate resolutions, especially Security Council resolution 242 and 338".
1_8	0.22693371	Arafat blamed Israel for the 16-month-old stalemate in the peace process, saying the Israeli side had in reality relinquished the peace accords ever since the Israeli incumbent government came to power two years ago.
1_9	0.2595096	Israel has failed to keep their promises made in signed agreements on issues like redeployment in the West Bank, Jewish settlements, and issues of transition period, Arafat said.
1_10	0.097069512	"These measures constitute grave and flagrant violation of international legitimate resolutions, including Resolution 242 ...
1_11	0.18082417	They also violate the Oslo accords which very distinctly call for refraining from any measures that touch any issues of the final negotiating phase with the issue of Jerusalem in the forefront," he noted.
1_12	0.18984683	He also criticized Israel for its "unjust blockade" of Palestinian areas, including the prevention of the entry of goods and obstruction of the free movement of the Palestinian people.
1_13	0.091131478	"We are regularly losing more than 10 million (U.S).
1_14	0.093819812	dollars each day by the economic blockade, that is to say, many times as much as the donor countries are offering if measured on annual basis," he said, adding that unemployment rate in the Palestinian areas exceeds 65 percent.
1_15	0.10228216	The Israeli policy is causing much frustration to the Palestinians and leading to misery and grave danger, Arafat said, noting that "the situation is approaching starvation, and I ring the bells of danger.
1_16	0.074055158	In as much as peace is in the interest of all, the explosion will hit everyone."
2_0	0.43060945	JERUSALEM, January 15 (Xinhua) --A senior Palestinian National Authority (PNA) official Thursday urged Israel to implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement in a bid to move the Mideast peace process forward.
2_1	0.19257854	Addressing a press conference here, PNA Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath said that Israel should implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed with the PNA instead of making its own decisions which are against the provisions of these agreements.
2_2	0.18041896	Sha'ath made the remark while commenting on an Israeli document concerning PNA's obligations and decisions relating to Israel's security in the West Bank.
2_3	0.078908474	On Tuesday, the Israeli cabinet passed a 12-page document accusing the PNA of violating its obligations.
2_4	0.20849606	And on Wednesday, the cabinet decided to keep all the areas in the West Bank it termed as vital to Israel's security and national interests in a permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians.
2_5	0.17110093	These areas include two security strips on each side of the West Bank, water resources, Jewish settlements, strategic roads and Jewish historical sites.
2_6	0.27577876	Sha'ath said the Hebron agreement signed early last year stipulate that Israel carry out a three-stage troop redeployment in the West Bank by mid-1998, adding the Israeli cabinet's decisions on security issues in the West bank meant that it does not want to redeploy its troops in the West Bank but rather permanently occupy the Palestinian lands.
2_7	0.17702761	Referring to the final-status talks as initiated by Israel, he said how the PNA could enter into such talks with the Israeli government which refused to redeploy its troops in the West Bank and commit to its obligations as specified by the signed accords.
2_8	0.17163507	The permanent solution of the Middle East problem is the establishment of an independent state of Palestine, safe borders between Israel and Palestine, safe cooperation in all fields between the Palestinians and the Israelis, Jerusalem should be the safe capital of the two peoples, Sha'ath said.
2_9	0.10279913	He urged the U.S. and other countries to put pressure on Israel to implement all agreements it signed with the PNA.
3_0	0.5316683	CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) --President of Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat today Condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies on peace process and sanctions against the Palestinians.
3_1	0.18495443	In an interview with the Egyptian TV program "Beit Al Arab" broadcast today, Arafat said Netanyahu does not want peace or respect the signed agreements, adding that Netanyahu has admitted that he ignores the Oslo accords.
3_2	0.12127063	His criticism came two days after the Israeli government has decided to build more homes in Efrat settlement in Jerusalem.
3_3	0.18089822	Netanyahu announced Wednesday night that his government will continue to bolster the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and plans to build 300 homes in the Efrat settlement.
3_4	0.17208	Arafat slammed Israel's economic sanctions against the Palestinian self-rule areas, which has caused many Palestinians vulnerable to starvation.
3_5	0.12261109	He said that the Palestinians lose 9 to 10 million U.S. dollars every day due to the closure imposed by Israel after two multiple suicide bombings hit Jerusalem on July 30 and September 4.
3_6	0.22030579	On the outcome of the United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to the PNA-ruled areas, Arafat said that Albright has reaffirmed the principles based on the United Nations Security Council resolutions, the land for peace formula, and the peace accords signed between the PNA and Israel.
3_7	0.07714564	He said the U.S. stance is positive, yet it needs practical steps to confront the Israeli intransigence.
3_8	0.086387303	Following Israeli decision to expand the Efrat settlement, Albright criticized it as inconsistent to the kind of climate for negotiations that she wanted to create.
4_0	0.10653352	For the first time in Israel's history, its upcoming election is about who will control the Interior Ministry, not the Foreign Ministry.
4_1	0.075920115	It's about what kind of Israel, not what size of Israel.
4_2	0.12776197	Although he didn't set out to do this, no one is more responsible for this shift than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
4_3	0.15067934	By reluctantly embracing the Oslo peace accords and grudgingly advancing them through the Hebron and Wye agreements, he broke down the historic wall between Labor and Likud voters when it came to the peace process.
4_4	0.076640348	It is no longer just Labor that is ready to deal with Yasser Arafat, and Likud that shuns him as a terrorist.
4_5	0.092160445	It is no longer Labor that is ready to accept some kind of Palestinian state while Likud rejects it.
4_6	0.13164779	Thanks to Netanyahu, there is now a loosely unified core of 75 percent of Israelis ready to proceed with the Oslo accords toward a Palestinian state of some size or other.
4_7	0.064864226	With that sort of consensus in the middle, who cares who controls the Foreign Ministry?
4_8	0.1155605	Unfortunately, though, Netanyahu did not knock down the wall between Labor and Likud on the peace issue by synthesizing the two sides.
4_9	0.082320609	He actually knocked that wall down by backing into it, while all the time telling his hard-core religious-nationalist supporters that he was not abandoning their cause.
4_10	0.073666648	It may have been that the only way to bring the majority of Likud voters into Oslo, without triggering a civil war, was by Netanyahu winking, nodding, lying, blaming everything on Labor, the Ashkenazi elites and ``the leftists,'' and constantly bashing Arafat, whether he was living up to his commitments or not.
4_11	0.07701825	Plenty of Likudniks wanted to be lied to as they accepted the inevitability of Oslo _ and he accommodated them by embracing Oslo while constantly denouncing those who delivered it.
4_12	0.087994677	Therein lies the greatest irony about Bibi Netanyahu: He brought a whole new segment of Israel into the peace process _ but he stayed out of it himself.
4_13	0.085535183	That is, he never wanted to take ownership of it, and he still doesn't.
4_14	0.083956939	Bibi struck important deals that legitimized Arafat as a peace partner, but he still runs against him in this election.
4_15	0.086875038	In 1996, Bibi won because a majority of Israelis were overwhelmed by Oslo, the Rabin assassination and the blowing up of Israeli buses.
4_16	0.09697222	But thanks, in part, to his own real success at winning better Palestinian security compliance, a majority of Israelis now accept Oslo.
4_17	0.096594527	In other words, thanks to Bibi's having routinized the peace process, many Israelis want to get on with it, finish it and look to the future.
4_18	0.079177481	But instead of leading that parade, Netanyahu is shying away from his own accomplishment and running instead on the past.
4_19	0.093082126	He repeatedly runs TV ads showing the Israeli buses that were blown up in Jerusalem.
4_20	0.092085067	Because he refuses to embrace his own peace process, he is incapable of painting any positive vision of the future.
4_21	0.096147467	His campaign advertising is virtually devoid of any hope, and when you can't give hope, when you cannot educate, when you cannot articulate people's aspirations, when you cannot unify, you cannot lead.
4_22	0.084974044	I just received two e-mails from friends in Israel that sounded identical themes, although neither knows the other.
4_23	0.077511886	One was from a religiously observant friend who lives in the village of Zichron Yaacov, Victor Friedman (no relation).
4_24	0.078979908	Victor wrote: ``Even people who hate the left, and can't imagine voting for Ehud Barak, are tired of the kind of political and social atmosphere created since Bibi came to power.
4_25	0.10111564	The lying, trickery, corruption, divisiveness, incitement _ people don't like it''.
4_26	0.079800317	The other was from a Jerusalem-based writer, Laura Blumenfeld, who wrote that Israel today is suffering from ``Multiple Israel Disorder _ Bibi thought he could hold onto power by dividing everyone into squabbling tribes.
4_27	-0.0083530045	He was wrong.
4_28	0.074196002	The shot that killed Rabin was like the starting gun on the race between factions.

4_30	0.089155969	By breaking down the divide between Labor and Likud on peace, Bibi created the opportunity for national unity in Israel as never before.
4_31	0.094600466	But by doing it in such a divisive fashion, he has also created a longing for national unity as never before _ a longing that he seems unwilling and unable to satisfy.
4_32	0.087259517	On Monday we will find out if Bibi can survive Bibism.
5_0	0.30122804	JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) --In a stern warning to Israel, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat said Thursday that Palestinians are ready to renew the intifada (uprising) if the peace process collapses.
5_1	0.29022864	In a speech at the ceremony held in Ramallah, West Bank, to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1948 Israeli-Arab war, Arafat renewed his pledge that he would declare Palestinian independence in May 1999 at the end of the Oslo process, even in the absence of a final peace agreement with Israel.
5_2	0.18383831	The Palestinian leader said "the Palestinian people do not remember the painful experience to cry, but to renew our commitment to our national goal - the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital".
5_3	0.11074096	He said that those who oppose the Palestinian move to achieve independence "can drink from the Gaza Sea or Dead Sea".
5_4	0.19492729	Afrafat stressed that he was ready to die in order to put East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since 1967, in the Palestinian hands.
5_5	0.11298049	The PNA is hoping to establish an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital, a move opposed by Israel which has declared the whole Jerusalem as its eternal capital.
5_6	0.17997825	Summarizing the suffering of the Palestinians in the past, Arafat paid tributes to the bravery of his people who have carried on the longest revolution of this century.
5_7	0.089047981	He added that the Palestinians will continue to stay on their land and nothing, even nuclear, biological and other weapons, will force them to leave.
5_8	0.29378402	Arafat's warning came at a time when the Israeli-Palestinian peace process is deeply deadlocked over Israel's prolonged delay in carrying out further troop redeployment in the West Bank.
5_9	0.32130061	Under the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed in January, 1997, Israel should have finished the first two stages of the three-phased redeployment by September last year.
5_10	0.16215779	But Israel has delayed the move due to the dispute over the scope of redeployment.
5_11	0.15129	In order to break the stalemate, the United States is currently hosting Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in Washington to bridge the gap.
5_12	0.12551818	But no breakthrough has been achieved so far, as the Palestinian side has turned down a U.S. proposal on a 13 percent withdrawal in the second redeployment, which is to be implemented in two phases according to the PNA's fulfillment of its obligations.

6_2	0.18919521	The new plan was presented by Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai with a proposal to change the Oslo accords with regard to the extent of Palestinians' control in Hebron.
6_3	0.17609819	Under the plan, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) would only gain the civilian control over the area, and the overriding security control would remain in Israel's hands.
6_4	0.18296744	Under the Oslo accords, the Israeli army is to pull back from about 80 percent of Hebron, leaving all Arab neighborhoods of the town under the full control of the PNA, designated Zone A.
6_5	0.08678438	However, under the new proposal, Hebron would no longer be designated Zone A, but part of Zone B, an area of shared control, with the Israeli army permitted to move freely as it deems necessary for security reasons.

24_0	0.14228427	JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) --Egypt today gave Israel three weeks to implement its peace agreements with Palestinians, otherwise it will cancel a Middle East and North Africa economic summit due to be held in Cairo in November.
