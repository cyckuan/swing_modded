8_1	0.1111111111111111	Putin made the remarks in an open letter to the voters about his program for the upcoming presidential election.
8_2	0.125	"As we have been talking for years about fighting crime, that evil was continuing to entrench itself everywhere.
8_3	0.0	A whole republic, a Russian region, Chechnya, was taken over by the criminal world and turned into a terrorism fortress.

8_5	0.0	This was the first step towards the preeminence of the law, to the dictatorship of a law that treats everybody equally," he wrote in a letter which was published in the Friday issue of Russian newspaper Izvestiya.
8_6	0.0	"Wherever the terrorist and criminal is now hiding, he cannot hope to find refuge in Chechnya.
8_7	0.0	A terrible blow has been dealt at the gangster world," Putin adds.
8_8	0.0	The letter consists of two parts: "Our Problems" and "Our Priorities".
8_9	0.15789473684210525	Russia's greatest problems are the loss of will power, the state's loss of will to bring to completion what it has started, hesitation and the habit to put off the most difficult activities, Putin writes.
8_10	0.0	This results "in the ancient evil --crime -- being driven deep into Russia".
8_11	0.0	"It has gone so far that a whole republic, namely Chechnya, succumbed to the criminal world," Putin says.
8_12	0.0	He is sure that "it was necessary to meet the challenge on the enemy's field and to rout him there".
8_13	0.25	Russia's second "big problem", Putin believes, "is lack of firm and universally recognized rules".
8_14	0.0	"Order requires rules.
8_15	0.0	And it is best for those who are now busy juggling concepts, claiming that lack of order means genuine democracy, to stop seeking dirty tricks and scaring us with the past," it says.

8_17	0.0	"The state must begin with itself.
8_18	0.0	It must set equal rules and comply with them," he stressed.
8_19	0.0	"Only an efficient and strong state can afford to live by the rule of law, and individual is freer in a stronger country," he says.
8_20	0.0	The third problem is that the state is insufficiently aware of its resources, Putin notes.

8_22	0.0	The debt to the elderly should be reimbursed.
8_23	0.0	"It's not just a social but a political and moral task," he says.

8_25	0.3076923076923077	On Russia's foreign policy, Putin emphasizes that "the external policy should be shaped in the national interests of our own country".

9_0	0.2857142857142857	MOSCOW _ With President-elect Vladimir Putin moving to put his government in place, Moscow is rife with behind-the-scenes intrigue as he and his aides try to decide which politicians, economists and tycoons should be included in his inner circle.

9_2	0.15789473684210525	And in his first major personnel decision Tuesday, he caught the capital's attention with a change that he did not make: He decided not to replace Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev.
9_3	0.09523809523809523	Putin's move appeared calculated to give the impression that the Kremlin is satisfied with how the Russian military campaign in Chechnya was going, despite mounting casualties and an adversary that has stubbornly refused to quit.
9_4	0.25	The move also rewards Sergeyev for his loyalty and quiets the infighting with Russia's defense establishment over his post.
9_5	0.23076923076923078	But Putin's decision also affirmed the status quo in a military whose lackluster performance in Chechnya has demonstrated that it is in urgent need of reform.
9_6	0.42857142857142855	Certainly, Putin has moved cautiously since winning the election on Sunday.
9_7	0.0	No one doubts that he will make good on his vow to build a stronger state after he is sworn in as president in early May.
9_8	0.0	And virtually everyone believes this will translate into new faces and stronger authority for himself.

9_16	0.1875	On Monday, Putin met with Boris Yeltsin, the former president, who had anointed Putin as his heir apparent; presumably, they discussed plans for the new government.
9_17	0.0	So far, however, Putin has gone out of his way to lower expectations and perhaps buy a little time.
9_18	0.0	Putin has warned the public not to expect miracles.

9_26	0.1875	(END OPTIONAL TRIM) The decision to keep Sergeyev almost certainly does not reflect satisfaction with the ragged state of Russia's armed forces.

9_29	0.0	Changing ministers might be read as a sign that the Kremlin was worried about the way the war is proceeding.

10_1	0.16666666666666666	On a campaign trip to the southern city of Voronezh, Putin was cautious about the outcome of the March 26 election, saying he would prefer a clear decision to avoid a runoff.

20_25	0.08333333333333333	Another poll, studying reasons for Putin's broad popularity, showed that the majority of respondents like the 47-year-old Putin for his relatively young age and good health --in contrast to the ailing, 69-year-old Yeltsin, who stepped down Dec.

22_0	0.375	MOSCOW (AP) --A string of victories in parliament have solidified President Vladimir Putin's authority and appear to be setting the stage for a calmer, more conciliatory era in Russia after the frenzied confusion of the Boris Yeltsin years.
22_1	0.34615384615384615	Since taking office as acting president in December, Putin has persuaded once-combative lawmakers to do two things they steadfastly refused to do under Yeltsin: approve the START II nuclear disarmament treaty and fire Russia's top prosecutor.

22_11	0.0	The Communists and their allies who dominated the Duma for years lost their majority in December parliamentary elections, and were replaced by centrists who generally back Putin.
22_12	0.0	Much of what Putin has done so far is clean up after Yeltsin.
22_13	0.1111111111111111	It was Yeltsin who signed START II in 1993 then fought with the Duma for years over ratification, and Yeltsin who first tried to fire Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov a year ago.

22_15	0.14285714285714285	Does that mean Putin will continue Yeltsin's policies?

22_34	0.07692307692307693	Still, Skuratov warned that Putin may not tackle high-level graft because of his close ties to Yeltsin's scandal-marred administration.
22_35	0.25	Putin has promised to fight corruption, which plagues every facet of Russian life and is a key obstacle to economic progress.
23_0	0.45	MOSCOW (AP) --Acting President Vladimir Putin and Communist Party head Gennady Zyuganov on Monday agreed on at least one thing in their races for the presidency -- Russia has to eliminate its oligarchy.

23_6	0.0	Government policies are widely believed to be manipulated by a group of ``oligarchs'' --powerful tycoons with close government connections -- who are widely despised in Russia.
23_7	0.047619047619047616	Putin has not yet released an election program, although he published an open letter to voters last week, promising to build a strong state, combat crime, protect private property, streamline the government and lower taxes.

23_9	0.0	``The guarantees of property rights are not subject to any revision,'' he said.
23_10	0.14285714285714285	Meanwhile, Zyuganov --who is trailing a distant second behind Putin in most opinion polls -- criticized Putin's lack of a detailed platform.
23_11	0.0	``There are few specific proposals, mostly good intentions,'' Zyuganov said.
23_12	0.058823529411764705	His own platform remains little changed since his losing 1996 presidential bid, calling for partial nationalization of oil and natural resources companies to raise pensions.
