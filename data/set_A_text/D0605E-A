2_6	0.0	Batters routinely hit balls streaking in at more than 90 mph on any one of a number of trajectories.
2_7	0.0	He suggested the explanation may lie in the overall consistency of what batters see when they step into the box, however varied the pitches.

6_70	0.0	Harkin has since become an aficionado of alternative medicine himself: He takes bee pollen for his allergies, a practice that critics find silly.
6_71	0.0	But Harkin may have had the last laugh.
6_72	0.0	In 1991, he inserted a provision into the NIH appropriations bill requiring the institutes to create an Office of Alternative Medicine, with a $2 million budget.
6_73	0.0	``They fought it and fought it and fought it,'' Harkin said in a recent interview.
6_74	0.0	``You'd think I was single-handedly destroying NIH by spending $2 million on alternative therapies''.
6_75	0.0	The amount was indeed a drop in the bucket for the institutes, an agency that now has a $15 billion annual budget.
6_76	0.0	The tiny office on alternative care was set up in a remote outpost, nowhere near the institutes' main campus in Bethesda, Md.
6_77	0.0	Its mission was complicated.
6_78	0.0	Alternative medicine is such a vast conglomeration of practices, ranging from the use of vitamins and herbs, to meditation, massage, movement therapy and acupuncture, that even its practitioners cannot agree on what to call it.
6_79	0.0	(The terms ``complementary,'' ``integrative'' and ``alternative'' are used interchangeably).
6_80	0.0	The office began by offering small grants of $30,000 each.
6_81	0.0	Soon, it was drawing fierce criticism for spending taxpayers' money on projects of dubious scientific merit.
6_82	0.0	``The quality was incredibly low,'' Varmus said.
6_83	0.0	``The investigators who were applying didn't really know much about science''.
6_84	0.0	In 1994, Congress took a step that would have a major effect on patients' access to alternative therapies.
6_85	0.0	It passed a law that permits manufacturers to make claims about health benefits for herbal medicines whose safety and effectiveness had not been proved by the usual standards applied to prescription drugs.
6_86	0.0	Now, said Cassileth, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, ``Everybody can play doctor and buy anything they want over the counter and treat themselves''.
6_87	0.0	Good research became even more necessary, she said.
6_88	0.0	But the battles at NIH continued.
6_89	0.0	The alternative medicine office ran through a string of directors.
6_90	0.0	The man who took the job in 1995, Dr.
6_91	0.0	Wayne B.
6_92	0.0	Jonas, drew criticism because he practiced homeopathy, a 200-year-old system of medicine in which illnesses are often treated with diluted solutions of plant extracts.
6_93	0.0	Most mainstream scientists, including Varmus, take a dim view of homeopathy.
6_94	0.0	As a result, said Jonas, who left the institutes at the end of 1998, he had a difficult time getting approval of proposals to finance research.
6_95	0.0	But as Congress continued to appropriate more money for the office and public interest grew, Varmus said, ``I came to feel that there was a real public health concern that NIH had a responsibility to address''.
6_96	0.0	By 1996, the alternative medicine office had moved onto the main institutes' campus, and Varmus had formed an advisory group of government scientists to set priorities.
6_97	0.0	The alternative medicine literature contains thousands of studies, but the majority are scientifically flawed.
6_98	0.0	Varmus wants scientists to test the most promising and most widely used therapies.
6_99	0.0	But the critics remain.
6_100	0.0	Herbert, the Mount Sinai professor, calls the institutes' center on alternative medicine ``a worthless waste of money'' that was ``set up to promote fraud''.
6_101	0.0	Dr. Marcia Angell, editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, said the center had so far failed to publish any significant articles in scientific journals.

6_106	0.0	It will be three to four years, Straus predicts, before the current crop of clinical trials is complete.

19_2	0.0	Vioxx is expected to reach pharmacies later this spring after obtaining approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration.
19_3	0.043478260869565216	Vioxx was as effective as prescription-strength Aleve, an aspirin-type drug, in treating moderate to severe menstrual pain, according to a Merck study of 127 women being presented at the American Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics in San Antonio, Texas.

19_5	0.23529411764705882	In a second study of 151 patients who had oral surgery to remove their wisdom teeth, Vioxx proved as effective at postoperative pain relief as ibuprofen.
19_6	0.16666666666666666	The dental study also showed one 50 milligram Vioxx pill could provide relief for a full 24 hours.
19_7	0.0	Ibuprofen must be taken at least three times a day.
19_8	0.15789473684210525	Vioxx will likely become the second in a new class of pain medications which work as well as aspirin and other anti-inflammatory medicines but don't cause stomach irritation that can lead to ulcers and other dangerous ailments.

19_12	0.3333333333333333	Like Celebrex, Merck is looking to get approval for Vioxx to treat osteoarthritis, which affects more than 16 million Americans.
19_13	0.2	But instead of also seeking indication for rheumatoid arthritis, which affects about 2 million Americans, it wants the FDA to approve Vioxx for acute pain treatment --a market of more than 40 million Americans.
19_14	0.0	It's for this reason that Merck is giving the FDA data showing how the drug works against different types of pain.
19_15	0.19047619047619047	Though the risk of stomach ailments is higher when taking aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs for prolonged use, a dilemma faced most arthritis sufferers, the gastrointestinal risks exist even with short duration use, experts say.

20_9	0.42105263157894735	Although Merck and Monsanto have touted tests showing fewer side effects on their drugs, the FDA has ordered both to place standard warnings about the potential for stomach problems on their labels.
20_10	0.13333333333333333	Merck won a slight marketing edge Friday as the FDA approved Vioxx for menstrual pain, acute pain in adults and osteoarthritis.

20_12	0.375	Once the FDA approves a drug for one disease, doctors can prescribe it for other ailments.
20_13	0.0	As a result, analysts say it is likely doctors will use Vioxx and Celebrex interchangeably.

20_18	0.0	Analysts expect both drugs to each eventually surpass $2 billion in annual sales by 2002.
20_19	0.0	For Merck, $2 billion will merely replace sales lost from the hypertension drug Vasotec and ulcer drug Pepsid, both of which lose U.S. patent protection next year.
20_20	0.0	Merck's cholesterol drug Mevacor and hypertension drug Prinivil lose patent protection in 2001.
20_21	0.0	Another factor putting pressure on Merck is that sales growth has slowed for its top-selling drug, the cholesterol pill Zocor.

20_27	0.14285714285714285	Merck hopes to persuade doctors to prescribe Vioxx, by showing results of a yearlong study compared to just three months of data for Celebrex.
20_28	0.0	Additionally, Merck's label will highlight that just 4 out of 3,300 patients studied on Vioxx suffered serious gastrointestinal problems.

22_55	0.0	Overweight individuals have a higher risk of arthritis in the hands too, suggesting that obesity exerts a systemic effect.
22_56	0.0	Inheritance plays a role too, especially in arthritis of the hand.
22_57	0.0	So do hormones, since women's risk of the disease rises sharply after menopause, when estrogen levels decrease sharply.
22_58	0.0	Diet also affects osteoarthritis, especially once the process has begun.
22_59	0.0	Researchers think this may be due in part to the effects on cartilage from oxidation _ a central mechanism of age-related tissue damage.
22_60	0.17857142857142858	In a study of participants in the well-known Framingham Heart Study, Felson's group found those with the highest dietary intake of vitamin C, an antioxidant, had one-third the risk of developing knee pain from arthritis compared to individuals with the lowest vitamin C levels.
22_61	0.4	Vitamin C may also facilitate cartilage repair.
22_62	0.17647058823529413	Vitamin E, another antioxidant, apparently has less effect on the progression of arthritis, but its anti-inflammatory effects may explain why some studies suggest vitamin E supplements may ease pain in some patients.
22_63	0.05263157894736842	For now, the best advice specialists can offer to osteoarthritis sufferers is to attack the disease with a combination of lifestyle, medical, and dietary interventions _ and ultimately, joint replacement surgery when all else fails.
22_64	0.8333333333333334	At the top of the list are weight loss and exercise.
22_65	0.3	``Even a little weight loss can make a difference,'' says Brandt, the Indiana arthritis specialist.
22_66	0.25	Framingham data show that a weight loss of 11 pounds in women of medium height reduced the risk of painful knee arthritis by half.
22_67	0.0	Exercise _ especially gentle and progressive resistance exercise that strengthens leg muscles _ is getting increased attention among arthritis researchers.
22_68	0.0	This doesn't mean going to a gym and working out like Schwarzenegger; cheap ankle weights or elastic bands, used faithfully at home to do leg-lifting exercises, will do the trick.
22_69	0.0	``It takes very little physical activity to improve fitness,'' says Brandt.
22_70	0.0	``Even the very elderly can do it''.
22_71	0.06666666666666667	One reason is that stronger leg muscles brace the knee and hip joints, reducing the wobble that comes with age-related loosening of ligaments.
22_72	0.0	Increased joint stability in turn protects cartilage from the cycle of injury, enzymatic breakdown, and inflammation.
22_73	0.13636363636363635	A Tufts University study presented at the Boston rheumatology meeting showed a home exercise regimen improved leg strength by 71 percent and reduced arthritic knee pain by 36 percent.
22_74	0.25	A larger exercise study from England showed similar improvements in knee pain and physical function.
22_75	0.14285714285714285	When painkillers are necessary, doctors often advise the old standby acetaminophen (Tylenol or generic brands) if inflammation is not an issue, although users should be cautious about combining this drug with alcohol to avoid liver damage.
22_76	0.4	To relieve both pain and inflammation, the standard recommendation has been non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), but chronic use of NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and naproxen can erode the stomach lining and cause potentially dangerous bleeding.
22_77	0.4583333333333333	The new cox-2 inhibitors celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofecoxib (Vioxx) appear to avoid this problem entirely while maintaining equal efficacy against osteoarthritis pain and inflammation, according to two studies published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
22_78	0.0	It's no accident that Celebrex has vaulted into first place among prescription painkillers.
22_79	0.15384615384615385	But Celebrex and Vioxx cost from $90 to $120 a month, which can be prohibitive for many people, especially if they have little or no prescription drug coverage.
22_80	0.5	Eventually, Moskowitz thinks, ``more cox-2 inhibitors will come out and the price will come down''.
22_81	0.0	Whatever improvements emerge in medical therapy _ conventional or alternative _ many osteoarthritis patients will eventually run out of stop-gap options.
22_82	0.16666666666666666	For them, the ultimate treatment is an artificial knee or hip.
22_83	0.13333333333333333	``Total knee and hip replacement have totally revolutionized arthritis treatment, in terms of keeping people walking and off crutches,'' Moskowitz says.
22_84	0.0	``When patients say, `Doc, this is really interfering with my lifestyle and the medicines aren't helping anymore,' it's appropriate to take the risk''.
22_85	0.0	Thomas Ercoline, 64, is glad he did.
22_86	0.05555555555555555	After conventional medicine and acupuncture no longer relieved the excruciating pain caused by his knee arthritis, the Peterborough, N.H. man had joint replacement surgery in July.
22_87	0.0	``Initially the pain was worse than the arthritis.
22_88	0.14285714285714285	The first two weeks after the operation you wonder why you had it done,'' Ercoline said.

23_17	0.0	Because the drug is already on the market, doctors are free to start prescribing it immediately for pain patients.
23_18	0.0	Many already have been using it as a pain remedy, in fact, although they have had little besides rumor and first-hand experience to suggest that it works.

23_20	0.6923076923076923	Results showed that the drug works at least as well and probably better than other treatments for neuropathic pain, but with far fewer side effects.
23_21	0.0	Although the tests were conducted only in diabetes and post-herpetic neuralgia, or shingles, experts said it might also help alleviate nerve pain suffered by people with cancer and AIDS.
