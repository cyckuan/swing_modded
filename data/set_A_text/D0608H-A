2_2	0.8333333333333334	On Monday, police officers throughout New Jersey will have the authority to stop drivers who are not wearing seat belts.
2_3	0.5	Previously, officers issued summonses only after stopping drivers for other reasons --such as speeding -- and found them or their front-seat passengers without seat belts.

2_8	0.5384615384615384	''By enforcing that requirement, we know the percentage of adults who wear seat belts will go up, but more importantly, the number of children will also go up,'' Conaway said.
2_9	0.47619047619047616	The Seat Belt Safety Coalition of New Jersey has said the state's 62 percent compliance rate for seat belt use in the state falls below the national average of 68 percent.

3_0	0.0	OTTAWA, October 26 (Xinhua) --The Canadian government has told automakers to improve airbag safety or face new regulations as early as the next fall.
3_1	0.0	The government wants automakers to change airbag design voluntarily for 1998 models, make airbags to deploy with less force, and not to deploy at speeds as low as they do now.
3_2	0.0	"We must work together urgently to minimize the associated risks," Canadian Transport Minister David Anderson said in a letter to automakers.
3_3	0.0	"If the cooperation isn't there, we would have to regulate," Anderson warned.
3_4	0.2	Auto airbags were introduced in the late 1980s to reduce accident injuries to drivers and passengers.
3_5	0.0	They have since saved an estimated 100 lives in Canada.
3_6	0.0	However, airbags have also been implicated in the deaths of three Canadians, according to today's Financial Post newspaper.
3_7	0.47058823529411764	Now, airbags only meet specifications set by the United States, where they are tested on dummies that do not wear belts, because only 60 percent of Americans regularly wear seat belts.
3_8	0.25	In Canada, 92 percent drivers and passengers wear belts.
3_9	0.09090909090909091	But the airbags are deployed with the same force as in the United States, which can kill or hurt people who are not sitting properly.
3_10	0.15384615384615385	In one case, a Canadian passenger was leaning over to adjust the radio when an airbag blasted him back into his seat and killed him, the paper said.
4_0	0.14285714285714285	There was a time when auto makers could not seem to sell safety to customers.
4_1	0.0	How the times have changed.
4_2	0.0	Now some manufacturers are almost playing one-upmanship in the safety world.
4_3	0.07142857142857142	Volvo has become a name synonymous with safe vehicles, but other makers are saying, ``Hey, Volvo's not the only company making safe vehicles''.
4_4	0.2222222222222222	Saab, which has won Swedish awards for safety, has decided not to take a back seat.
4_5	0.0	It is letting people know it has built, and continues to build, safe vehicles.
4_6	0.07692307692307693	At a presentation, Saab engineers showed how &UR; &LR; the company builds cars not for government-mandated crash tests but for ``real life'' situations, with crumple zones within the vehicle effective if the car is hit on an angle, not just straight on as in federal tests.
4_7	0.0	BMW and Mercedes-Benz are also getting out the message.
4_8	0.2	Mercedes has developed a number of safety features over the years that the company freely allows others to copy.
4_9	0.0	When it comes to a safe vehicle, driving a Mercedes has been compared to driving a tank.
4_10	0.0	It's a solid vehicle.
4_11	0.16666666666666666	Ford is promoting its Windstar minivan as a safe vehicle.
4_12	0.15384615384615385	It received the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's five-star award in crash test ratings.
4_13	0.0	The only other minivan to receive the award is the '98 Toyota Sienna.
4_14	0.06666666666666667	Windstar offers such added features as standard foam and cushioning in the ceiling and window pillars to help reduce head injuries in a crash.
4_15	0.15625	The Ford minivan comes with two options for even safer driving: side airbags designed for front-seat passengers to cushion both the head and torso in a side crash, and a reverse-sensing system that starts beeping when the bumper is 5.9 feet away from an obstacle and sounds more frequently as the vehicle gets closer to the object.
4_16	0.0	The beeping is heard only inside the minivan.
4_17	1.5714285714285714	Almost all cars and most trucks now have dual front air bags as standard equipment.
4_18	2.25	More air bags, though, are on the way.
4_19	0.4	Since their introduction a couple of years ago, side airbags are beginning to show up in more and more vehicles.
4_20	0.0	The bags are mounted either in the front door panels or on the side of the front seats.
4_21	0.0	With the controversy over injuries and, in some cases, deaths as the result of airbag deployments, a number of vehicles now are equipped with ``second generation'' bags.
4_22	0.0	These units tend not to explode with the force of earlier versions.
4_23	0.75	Another recent change came about because of injuries and deaths to children caused by air bags activating in the front seat.
4_24	0.9285714285714286	Many trucks, which tend to have only one seat, are now equipped with key-operated shut offs for the front passenger side air bag to prevent such injuries.
4_25	0.0	Mercedes-Benz is now offering its Baby-Smart seat system in all models.
4_26	0.75	When a baby seat that Mercedes offers is placed in the front, a sensor deactivates the air bag on that side of the car.
4_27	1.125	This year, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo added air bag ``curtains'' to some models.
4_28	0.0	The curtains cover just about the entire door.
4_29	0.0	BMW offers a tube-like airbag that extends across the top of the front doors to help protect the heads of front-seat passengers.
4_30	0.0	As of Sept.
4_31	0.1	1, manufacturers were required to add extra padding around windows to protect against head injuries.
4_32	0.0	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the new curtain-style airbags are innovative technology that surpass the extra padding ruling.
4_33	0.14285714285714285	Side-impact airbags have already found their way into low-priced cars such as the Toyota Corolla.
4_34	0.5714285714285714	Some luxury makers are also adding these for rear seat passengers.
4_35	0.9090909090909091	For true safety, however, the use of seat belts to hold driver and passengers in place is a key element.
4_36	1.5	Relying on the air bags alone won't do the trick.
4_37	0.6	Seat belts have also been greatly improved both for comfort and for holding one in place in the event of a sudden stop.
4_38	0.0	Some makers are giving added protection to avoid whiplash injuries.
4_39	0.42857142857142855	Volvo has a new whiplash Protection System allowing the seat backrest and head restraint to shift backward during rear-end collisions.
4_40	0.0	The system, Volvo says, reduces the force resulting from rear impact by 50 percent.
4_41	0.0	Saab also offers a similar system.
4_42	0.0	Many luxury vehicles are providing driver-systems that sense steering and traction conditions and automatically adjust to prevent spinouts.
4_43	0.0	BMW is including one in its new 3-Series.
4_44	0.14285714285714285	Antilock brakes have been hailed as almost more important in preventing accidents than airbags.
4_45	0.0	The brakes are intended to prevent cars from skidding on slippery surfaces during a sudden stop and to aid in stopping faster.
4_46	0.14285714285714285	The problem with antilock brakes is many people don't know how to use them.
4_47	0.09090909090909091	Unlike regular brakes, which many drivers learned to pump in emergencies, antilock brakes do the pumping automatically.
4_48	0.16666666666666666	Drivers pumping antilock brakes make them less effective.
4_49	0.0	Mercedes-Benz now has a system called Brake-Assist that uses a computer to determine when the use of the brakes is an emergency.
4_50	0.0	When this situation occurs, the computer automatically adds extra pressure to the brakes.
4_51	0.0	Mercedes says stopping distances can be reduced by up to 45 percent.
4_52	0.0	Without proper and well-maintained tires on the vehicle, no brake is going to stop the car or truck effectively.
4_53	0.0	Having the right tires for your make and model and having them properly inflated are very important, in even the simplest of stops.
4_54	0.2857142857142857	Corvette was one of the first to offer a device that warns of low air pressure.
4_55	0.0	The feature can now be found on other General Motors makes.
4_56	0.16666666666666666	The system is tied to the antilock brake system.
4_57	0.0	When a sensor detects a loss of air, it triggers a warning light on the instrument panel indicating which tire is low.
4_58	0.058823529411764705	Stopping by the side of the road to repair a flat tire can be one of the most dangerous things a motorist can do There are too many reports of motorists changing tires being struck by a passing vehicle.
4_59	0.23529411764705882	Some '99s are coming with tires that are capable of running for a while with a complete loss of air _ long enough to find help or a safe place off the highway to change the tire.
4_60	0.0	Getting a better grip on the road is what all-wheel-drive is about.
4_61	0.0	With AWD _ not four-wheel-drive _ power is shifted to the wheel or wheels needing it most.
4_62	0.05555555555555555	Even if traction is lost on three wheels, new systems from Jeep and Mercedes will shift the power to the one wheel with traction, keeping the vehicle from skidding on ice or snow.
4_63	0.1	AWD, once a feature associated with sport-utility vehicles, is now available in sedans and wagons from Subaru, Volvo, and Mercedes.
4_64	0.2	Another new safety feature expected to be adapted by many manufacturers is blue-tint headlights designed to give drivers better road sight at night.
4_65	0.0	High-intensity discharge, or HID, headlights illuminate by creating an electric arc between two electrodes in a bulb filled with xenon gas.
4_66	0.0	These new lights have been designed to help older drivers see better.
5_0	0.2	OK, how many ways can you say ``sport utility''?
5_1	0.2222222222222222	Plenty, would seem to be the answer as more car makers add sport utility models to their lineup.
5_2	0.0	And, there are hints that even more makers are about to enter the competition.

6_1	0.037037037037037035	The new system, unveiled at the Detroit auto show Wednesday, includes an airbag-like curtain on each side of the vehicle and is a response to the federal government's revelation that almost half the people who die in light trucks and SUVs die in rollover accidents.

8_0	0.75	WASHINGTON (AP) --The government announced new air bag standards Friday that seek to improve protection of children and small adults.
8_1	0.6363636363636364	Critics contend larger adults who don't wear seat belts could be put at greater risk.
8_2	0.5263157894736842	The new rule overhauls the government's standards for air bags, which to date are credited with saving more than 5,000 lives and blamed for at least 158 deaths.
8_3	0.4074074074074074	Under the new standards, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will require air bags to protect vehicle occupants in a 25 mph crash test, the level supported by automakers, rather than a test at 30 mph favored by some consumer advocates.
8_4	0.0	The 25 mph standard will be phased in over three years, starting with 2004 model year vehicles.
8_5	0.5263157894736842	Most air bag deaths have involved unrestrained children and small adults in low-speed crashes, victims most often of air bags that deployed so forcefully they caused neck injuries.
8_6	0.8333333333333334	The 25 mph test will not require the air bags to inflate as forcefully as a 30 mph test.
8_7	0.6428571428571429	''At the end of the day, we focused on the most vulnerable and the most at-risk of being killed by the air bags that were supposed to benefit them,'' Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said.
8_8	0.0	Some consumer groups say the new standard will put more adults at risk because the bags will not be designed to deploy with enough force to protect unbelted larger adults.
8_9	0.4	''We need a 30 mph standard because people are more likely to be killed or seriously injured in higher-speed crashes, and this is where air bags have saved the most lives,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's nonprofit group.
8_10	0.42857142857142855	NHTSA required a 30 mph test until 1997, when worries about air bags injuring motorists caused the agency to approve a rule that temporarily allowed automakers to use a 25 mph test.
8_11	0.625	Rather than change the test, Claybrook said automakers should install dual-power air bags that would inflate at different speeds depending on the severity of impact and size of the occupant.
8_12	0.043478260869565216	The real reason the auto industry wants the 25 mph test, Claybrook said, is that popular sport utility vehicles cannot meet the 30 mph standard because of stiff designs that do not absorb impact as well as cars.
8_13	0.0	Lance Roberts of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers rejected that argument.
8_14	0.15789473684210525	If it were true, he said, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the American Trauma Society and the National Transportation Safety Board would not support the 25 mph test as the safer alternative.

8_16	0.0	''This rule is going to go so much further in enhancing vehicle safety, it's unprecedented''.
8_17	0.0	NHTSA also will require vehicles to be tested using a family of dummies --an average-size man, a small woman and 1-, 3- and 6-year-old children.
8_18	0.0	Previous tests involved only average-size men.
8_19	0.2	The new regulations also attempt to recreate real-world conditions by placing child dummies in child seats on the passenger seat and in unbelted sitting, kneeling, standing and lying positions.

14_0	0.65	LOS ANGELES --The evacuation of an apartment complex Friday because of an unexploded, stolen air bag reveals what police say is a thriving, illegal trade in these car safety devices.
14_1	0.0	In L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, investigators suspect there is at least one roving gang of thieves that specializes in taking orders from body shops and then going out to steal them.
14_2	0.5	Nationwide, an estimated $50 million worth of air bags are stolen every year, accounting for 10 percent of all auto theft claims in 1997, double that of just the year before, insurance industry officials said.
14_3	0.0	``It's basically a replacement for the car stereo theft of the '80s and early '90s,'' said Julie Rochman, spokeswoman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, based in Arlington, Va.
14_4	1.0	``The air bags the thieves are going after are worth more than any other item in the passenger compartment''.
14_5	0.42857142857142855	Following a crash, a new air bag can cost $1,000, but police said unscrupulous body shops buy stolen ones for $150 apiece and then charge $1,500, including the installation.
14_6	0.6923076923076923	And removing an explosively armed air bag, particularly if it is done in a hurry, can leave a car in bad shape.
14_7	0.47368421052631576	``When air bags are stolen, they damage the steering wheel, the dash or cut the wiring harness,'' said Frank Tomota, a service consultant at West Valley Toyota in Northridge.
14_8	0.6	Insurance premiums are not expected to rise because officials said the growing cost of air bag thefts is offset by an overall decline in auto thefts.
14_9	0.6428571428571429	The real losers are the motorists because with every theft, they must pay the deductible amount, arrange for the repairs and risk driving without an air bag.
14_10	0.75	The air bag that was found unexploded in Van Nuys on Friday is among the 12 or so that police said are stolen every month in the Valley.
14_11	0.0	Detectives came upon it by happenstance while making an arrest at the Royal Garden Apartments at 14625 Rayen St.
14_12	0.5625	About 24 people were evacuated because the air bags contain an explosive charge that can launch its 25-pound metal casing some 80 feet, police said.
14_13	0.8181818181818182	Details about the arrest were not immediately available, but police said they believe the air bag had been stolen, and that they were trying to track down the owner.
14_14	0.0	Often a group of thieves hits three or four cars on a street or parking lot and then steals from a neighbor a week or two later, said Detective Bob Graybill of the LAPD's auto-theft task force in Van Nuys.
14_15	0.0	The thieves almost always are filling an order from an auto body shop whose owner is trying to cut costs to maximize the payout from the insurance company, he said.
14_16	0.75	This can include splicing, instead of replacing, the wiring harness attached to the air bag, or in some cases not installing an air bag at all.
14_17	0.4090909090909091	``The car looks good and the customer is very happy --and until he gets involved in a crash again and finds out if the air bag works or not, nobody's going to know these are used air bags the guy jury-rigged in there,'' Graybill said.
14_18	0.5625	Los Angeles police are attacking the problem through stepped-up inspections of auto shops to ensure owners are licensed and have receipts for uninstalled air bags.
14_19	0.37037037037037035	By a conservative estimate, 50,000 air bags were stolen in the United States in 1996, roughly triple that of 1993, said Ed Sparkman, a senior manager of vehicle support at the National Insurance Crime Bureau in Palos Hills, Ill.
14_20	0.6	That equates to a $50 million loss to the insurance industry, assuming the average replacement cost for an air bag is $1,000, he said.
14_21	0.42857142857142855	The actual rate of these thefts is believed to be much higher since these statistics did not account for the commercial auto market and because theft of air bags from rental cars, often by the person renting the car, is booming, he said.
14_22	0.6428571428571429	The industry and law enforcement are now mulling over ways to combat air bag theft by using a national registry of serial numbers.
14_23	0.6190476190476191	Auto parts stores sell anti-theft devices for drivers' air bags, which attach to the steering wheel or special bolts that make it more difficult for a thief to remove the safety device.

15_14	0.5263157894736842	The agency also urged manufacturers to allow owners of vehicles with rear side air bags to bring them back to dealers to have them deactivated if the vehicle is likely to be carrying children.
15_15	0.7307692307692307	The advisory noted that children under 12 should always sit in the rear seat and use age-appropriate restraints, but manufacturers and insurance industry officials said the warning failed to point out the benefits of side air bags used in conjunction with seat belts and child seats.

19_2	0.16666666666666666	DaimlerChrysler is the first automaker to accept a federal agency's challenge by creating a permanent free service using trained personnel to help customers fit child seats.
19_3	0.0	The company will spend more than $10 million annually and the service will be available at about 1,000 dealerships, company officials said today.
19_4	0.25	More than 80 percent of child seats are improperly installed in autos.

20_7	0.1111111111111111	The fitting stations could be established across the United States at vehicle inspection sites, motor vehicle administration offices, fire stations or automobile dealerships, Hall said.
20_8	0.0	He said the initiative should be funded out of government transportation dollars but had no cost estimate.
20_9	0.16666666666666666	The board can only recommend auto safety initiatives, but its recommendations carry great weight within the federal government.
20_10	0.0	Hall also reiterated other NTSB initiatives as part of a package the board believes would reduce child deaths and injuries in traffic accidents.

21_27	0.0	Mercury, looking to lessen compartment noise, installed a lightweight instrument panel insulator, designed to absorb sound rather than just attempt to repel it.
21_28	0.0	The repel method can lead to vibrations and rattles, and the new insulation works quite well.
21_29	0.0	Engine noise was minimal, and even during rapid acceleration the engine _ muffled through a single exhaust engineered to keep the same backflow as the dual system it replaces _ was a distant burble.
21_30	0.0	Wind noise, however, was another matter, and it was so encompassing it was hard to tell if it was coming from mirrors, windows, or the sunroof.
21_31	0.0	The engine was plenty powerful _ I'm not sure I'd be happy with the lesser mill in this car _ and pulled the Sable up steep hills, and in and out of highway traffic, with confident surges.

22_0	0.23529411764705882	``Black boxes'' for cars, a technology borrowed from the airline industry, now are poised to help auto-accident investigators pin the blame on drivers responsible for causing crashes.
22_1	0.09090909090909091	Since 1990, many General Motors and Ford cars and trucks have been equipped with a device similar to an airliner's black box, or flight data recorder, which automatically records the vehicle's speed, throttle setting, braking effort and engine rpm for each of the five seconds leading to an air-bag deployment.
22_2	0.9	Until now, however, it was difficult to extract that information from the car's air bag control module.
22_3	0.0	But a California company in March began selling a device that connects a car's onboard computer to a laptop computer to quickly extract such key information from a crashed vehicle.
22_4	0.0	The $2,500 device _ called a Crash Data Retrieval System _ is being marketed to police departments, insurance companies and auto-rental agencies to help them reconstruct crashes to determine fault.

22_8	0.6	Some of the vehicles that have the capability to provide such data also can tell investigators whether the car's occupants were wearing seatbelts and whether the passenger-side air bag had been deactivated.
22_9	0.0	Most of the data that the system gives to crash investigators isn't new _ such information has been used for decades to reconstruct accidents, said Phil Haseltine, president of the Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety, an auto-industry funded group.
22_10	0.0	But investigators had to gather the information using other sources, such as tire skid marks, in the past.

22_15	0.0	But Haseltine and others, including officials at General Motors, say there are privacy issues that have kept the technology from advancing as rapidly as it could have.
22_16	0.0	The data that a police investigator or insurance adjuster extracts from the car's air-bag control module could be translated into hard evidence for use in prosecution of a driver who is at fault in an accident, or for use by plaintiffs in lawsuits over such accidents, critics warn.
22_17	0.0	Vetronix says it is in negotiations with the California Highway Patrol to provide the devices to its officers, and the company plans to market the system aggressively to police agencies and insurance companies nationwide.

22_23	0.0	I can't imagine using it for every little fender-bender''.
22_24	0.0	General Motors has a ``strict policy that the data belongs to whoever owns or leases the vehicle, and it won't be accessed without their consent,'' said Terry Rhadigan, the automaker's safety spokesman.
22_25	0.0	But Vetronix promotes the system as something investigators can use almost immediately, at a crash site, to download the information, and there are concerns that such a situation sometimes might preclude getting a vehicle owner's permission.
22_26	0.15	The impetus to record this information to aid crash investigators came from the National Transportation Safety Board, which recommended in 1997 that automakers develop onboard collision-sensing and -recording devices.
22_27	0.0	The NTSB has long required that such equipment be installed on most modes of public transportation, including airliners, buses and trains.

24_0	0.15789473684210525	WASHINGTON (AP) --The peace of mind offered by child car seats can be deceptively deadly when they are not properly used, and the government's chief transportation safety official says few are.
24_1	0.42105263157894735	Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, asked states Monday to get moving on setting up ``fitting stations'' where parents go to have child restraints installed and checked.
24_2	0.0	Speaking to state highway safety officials in San Antonio, Hall offered a variety of proposals coinciding with the busy driving period of Labor Day holiday week.

24_5	0.5	``Safety advocates know that children should be in child restraints up to the age of 4, in booster seats to the age of 8, and in the back seat,'' said Hall --speaking in a state where 2-year-olds can be legally restrained by nothing other than a seat belt.
24_6	0.42857142857142855	But ``not one of the 50 states has a child restraint law with all of these requirements in it''.
24_7	0.25	Indeed, no state requires booster seats for children 4 to 8, he said.
24_8	0.625	In January, the NTSB asked all states to set up fitting stations.
24_9	0.0	So far, two are doing so, New York and South Carolina.
24_10	0.0	Three others --Hawaii, Idaho and Indiana -- are establishing sites where motorists can get trained in using the seats, according to the board.
24_11	0.16666666666666666	Separately, DaimlerChrysler AG is setting up fitting stations in Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., Denver and Sacramento, Calif.
24_12	0.46153846153846156	Hall also urged states to pitch the value of seat belts to black youths, who he said are half as likely as whites and Hispanics to use them.
24_13	0.6666666666666666	If seat belt use were universal among young blacks, that could save 1,300 lives a year, he said.
24_14	0.3157894736842105	He held out New Mexico's graduated licensing law as a fitting model as the number of young people behind the wheel increases an expected 22 percent by 2005.
24_15	0.7333333333333333	The law requires a learning permit followed by an intermediate license, both restricting night driving and the number of young passengers allowed.
24_16	0.16666666666666666	A full license is granted only with a clean record.
24_17	0.0	Hall praised DaimlerChrysler, but said ``states shouldn't wait for automakers to do something''.
24_18	0.1111111111111111	``They need to take the lead by coordinating the establishment of permanent fitting stations'' --perhaps at repair shops, firehouses, health centers or places where cars are annually inspected for safety, he said.
24_19	0.0	So far the federal government is not weighing in with much money to help.
24_20	0.0625	About $90,000 is available for fitting station demonstration grants for two or three states in the next fiscal year, said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
