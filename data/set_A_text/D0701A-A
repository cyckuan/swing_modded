0_0	0.2079192	SAN ANTONIO _ The conviction of white supremacist John William King last week for the murder of James Byrd Jr.
0_1	0.12594266	, a black man, begins to bring closure to a horrific chapter in the nation's history of race relations.
0_2	0.25598503	But the book didn't begin, nor will it end with the King trial, as a report by the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center demonstrates.
0_3	0.14623277	According to the report, the number of hate groups in the country increased again last year.
0_4	0.092200639	Hate and intolerance are dark threads deeply woven into our society's fabric.
0_5	0.093553304	They give rise to the environment that fostered King's prejudices and threatens all communities, not just his own in Jasper, Texas.
0_6	0.098067714	Consider his writings in the scrapbook of a fellow prison inmate.
0_7	0.088380122	In it, King professed, ``We, my Aryan Brother in arms, will rightfully claim what's ours and in the end our feet will be washed in the blood of the Jews''.
0_8	0.092405226	The scary thing is that King is only 24.
0_9	0.091914269	He didn't evolve overnight into the monster that killed Byrd.
0_10	0.090137548	Neither did his moral moorings come loose in a vacuum.
0_11	0.091878664	King's hate steadily was fed, tattoos on his body eventually mirroring the thoughts in his head: a black man being lynched; a Madonna carrying a baby Jesus with horns; Nazi symbols.
0_12	0.098251975	Other events throughout the country and even in Jasper show how King might have arrived at this point.
0_13	0.13862412	In Louisiana last week, a white man was convicted of a hate crime for trying to burn two cars belonging to black motorists.
0_14	0.08552555	And in Virginia Beach, Va.
0_15	0.10139545	, a 19-year-old man pleaded guilty to trying to burn a cross on the lawn of an interracial couple.
0_16	0.065144493	In Jasper, school officials were haggling with the parents of a student who, amid the raw feelings surrounding Byrd's death and King's murder trial, found it fit to wear to class his Confederate flag belt buckle.
0_17	0.14308151	The boy's parents called in help from a nearby Ku Klux Klan group when the boy was suspended for refusing to leave his buckle at home.
0_18	0.091650477	While not murderous acts, they reveal an indifference to humanity.
0_19	0.092298448	For these folks, Byrd's brutal death was only a blip on their screen, if they even bothered to blink.
0_20	0.094847055	Whites aren't immune from becoming hate-crime victims, but groups that hate minorities, Jews and gays far outnumber other separatist organizations.
0_21	0.09486567	And, make no mistake, they're hungry for more recruits.
0_22	0.14168313	Their new tool, according to the law center, is the Internet.
0_23	0.087682283	Cyberspace gives hate groups a forum from which they can reach not only the traditional working-class white teen-ager, but increasingly the middle-class youth in suburbia.
0_24	0.12075581	Along with white power rock 'n' roll music and the ongoing recruiting efforts of fringe groups, the outreach has bumped the number of hate groups to 537 from 474 in 1997.
0_25	0.31123684	The Southern Poverty Law Center previously recorded a 20-percent increase in hate groups from 1996 to 1997.
0_26	0.0893605	Take a good look.
0_27	0.095398061	This is how John William King learned to hate.

0_32	0.089232371	It's something that spreads from one person to another''.
0_33	0.090484389	But hate also is something that each of us can stop, if only by challenging those who espouse it.

1_7	0.093901997	``We had the sense that benign neglect must come to an end''.
1_8	0.57728509	Triggs called Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit civil rights organization, to ask what East Peoria could do.
1_9	0.089075213	Dees sent Triggs and Mayor Charles Dobbelaire, 59, a copy of the center's publication ``Ten Ways to Fight Hate,'' and advised East Peoria city leaders to do two things: Speak out immediately and form a broad-based coalition on race issues.

1_13	0.055193449	On July 22, with members of Ostendorf's caravan and 200 local residents present, the mayor announced that East Peoria, which has only a few dozen non-whites in its population of 23,400, would set up a Human Relations Commission ``to guide us in combating hate and teaching tolerance''.

1_26	0.08845651	The idea that their town might be seen as some kind of hate capital horrified the mayor and the Human Relations commissioners.
1_27	0.068702013	``This is really causing a bad image for our tri-county area, not just East Peoria,'' said David Mingus, the commission chairman.

17_0	0.48336966	WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) --The number of organized hate groups in the United States grew last year, mostly through new chapters of established white power organizations, the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a report released Tuesday.

17_4	0.28049463	Most of the newer groups, according to the center, come from a growth in the number of chapters of groups like the Ku Klux Klan and churches belonging to the Christian Identity movement, whose followers cite the Bible as the source for their racist views.
17_5	0.14134791	The growth in hate groups has been fueled by the Internet and rock music touting white power and advocating violence against minorities, the report said.

19_5	0.1692248	This fresh round of investigations into the long-ago killings, many of which had been ignored by authorities for years, was inspired by the well-publicized conviction in 1994 of an aging white defendant in the 1963 assassination of the Mississippi civil rights leader Medgar Evers.
19_6	0.093443627	For years, black community leaders and relatives of victims had complained about the lack of action in both the higher-profile and the lesser-known of these cases.
19_7	0.090515178	But recently their urgings have been taken more seriously, experts and historians say, because the South's political, social and legal climate has changed significantly since the era of the killings.

19_10	0.11964731	And a new breed of prosecutors and investigators, feeling an urgency as many witnesses and defendants in the cases grow old, is realizing the important role that resolving these cases can play in the South's efforts to move beyond its past of racial hate and terrorism.

20_0	0.32598272	COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) --Northern Idaho, predominantly white and rural, has been home for nearly three decades to the racist Aryan Nations.
20_1	0.092362153	It has struggled with a reputation as a haven for hate.
20_2	0.23758511	But residents say a $6.3 million jury verdict returned Thursday against Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler and three of his followers for attacking two people near the sect's compound may be the first step toward rehabilitating the region's image.
20_3	0.11020134	''It's a small step for human rights, one giant step for Idaho,'' said Marshall Mend, a human rights activist whose home and business were allegedly targeted for firebombings by Aryan Nations members.
20_4	0.11362131	''The people of Kootenai County said, 'No more hate'.

20_7	0.21350358	, and one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs, said he intended to enforce the judgment, taking everything the Aryan Nations owns, including its trademark name.
20_8	0.11910404	He even suggested turning the 20-acre Aryan Nations compound into a center for tolerance, teaching about the Holocaust.
20_9	0.38802387	But putting a hate group out of business isn't easy: While Dees has won significant civil judgments against the Ku Klux Klan and the White Aryan Resistance, the groups have survived.
20_10	0.1137836	Brian Levin, a California State University professor who has studied hate groups, said legal moves have damaged the groups but their strong ideology has proved as vital as funding.
20_11	0.070534923	''What lawsuits can't do is cripple a movement,'' Levin said, adding that racist organizations now focus on small cells of individuals, rather than larger, organized groups such as Butler's.

20_31	0.1199445	While Butler has never been convicted of any crime, his group has attracted neo-Nazis, supremacists and separatists to the region.
20_32	0.11501766	Most notorious of these groups was The Order, a violent offshoot that embarked on a nationwide crime spree in the 1980s, including armored car robberies and the slaying of Jewish talk show host Alan Berg in Denver.
20_33	0.14113722	Most of the group's followers are in jail and its leader was killed during a 1984 shoot-out with the FBI.
