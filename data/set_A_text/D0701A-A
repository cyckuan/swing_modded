1_0	0.39948643	WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) --The number of organized hate groups in the United States grew last year, mostly through new chapters of established white power organizations, the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a report released Tuesday.
1_1	0.11048924	The research group based in Mongomery, Alabama, said 474 hate groups and their chapters engaged in some form of racist behavior in 1997, The Associated Press reported.

1_4	0.19965325	Most of the newer groups, according to the center, come from a growth in the number of chapters of groups like the Ku Klux Klan and churches belonging to the Christian Identity movement, whose followers cite the Bible as the source for their racist views.
1_5	0.12834913	The growth in hate groups has been fueled by the Internet and rock music touting white power and advocating violence against minorities, the report said.

15_1	0.32838822	Richard Girnt Butler, the 82-year-old self-described pastor of the Aryan Nations compound, and his deputy, Michael Teague, were ordered to pay most of the $6.3 million in damages by the nine-woman, three-man jury.

15_3	0.11139619	The defendants responded defiantly outside the courthouse, even as protesters shouted at them to stop their ``message of hate''.

15_13	0.10698998	The multimillion-dollar award also represented the kind of message from the community that many civic leaders here had openly sought, hoping that it might help the area to shed what they called North Idaho's distorted image as a haven for people with racist views.

15_26	0.085028866	``What goes on at Pastor Butler's property,'' he told the jurors, ``is really more akin to a homeless shelter for exceedingly politically incorrect misfits, malcontents, borderline derelicts and all manner of people that drift in and out''.

17_1	0.15009738	_ A federal grand jury has been hearing evidence for more than a year in a 1963 racist bombing that killed four black girls in a downtown Birmingham church.
17_2	0.1189028	In Louisiana, the wife of one of the first black deputy sheriffs in a small parish met last month with a prosecutor who recently began re-examining the 1965 killing of her husband in an ambush.
17_3	0.16142884	And in Mississippi, a white man pleaded guilty this summer, and three others are to go on trial this week, in the 1970 killing of a black sharecropper who was beaten and found dead in a rural river.
17_4	0.17002388	Across the South, these and other unresolved, racially motivated killings of blacks from the civil rights era are under new scrutiny.
17_5	0.12125435	This fresh round of investigations into the long-ago killings, many of which had been ignored by authorities for years, was inspired by the well-publicized conviction in 1994 of an aging white defendant in the 1963 assassination of the Mississippi civil rights leader Medgar Evers.
17_6	0.088705887	For years, black community leaders and relatives of victims had complained about the lack of action in both the higher-profile and the lesser-known of these cases.
17_7	0.10215848	But recently their urgings have been taken more seriously, experts and historians say, because the South's political, social and legal climate has changed significantly since the era of the killings.
17_8	0.098856173	Blacks have steadily gained political power and have pushed for these cases to be heard before today's racially diverse juries.
17_9	0.079748179	At the same time, more witnesses, perhaps with less fear of retaliation and with heavy consciences they want to unburden, are coming forward.
17_10	0.095517397	And a new breed of prosecutors and investigators, feeling an urgency as many witnesses and defendants in the cases grow old, is realizing the important role that resolving these cases can play in the South's efforts to move beyond its past of racial hate and terrorism.
17_11	0.087509732	``In the South, we now have a black constituency that has political clout, and a white constituency that is not against these hatemongers being brought to justice,'' said David Sansing, professor emeritus of history at the University of Mississippi.

17_14	0.071886883	At least seven of these long-dormant cases are currently being re-examined in the South.
17_15	0.051035793	A few are before grand juries or are being prosecuted.
17_16	0.062656933	But some have only just begun to be reinvestigated and have had little national attention.
17_17	0.067010229	The officials pursuing these cases are mostly Southern and mostly white.

17_20	0.076202876	But they all share some sense that the decades-old cases are still a stumbling block to the South's progress.
17_21	0.073131213	``These prosecutors,'' Sansing said, ``are realizing that they've got to do it now, rather than leave it unsettled forever''.
17_22	0.070747156	For instance, U.S.
17_23	0.092864595	Attorney Doug Jones, 45, a Birmingham native, was 9 when Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church, a center for civil rights activity in the 1960s, was bombed, killing the four girls.
17_24	0.088551076	As a law student in 1977 he skipped classes for a week to watch Bill Baxley, who was the Alabama attorney general, successfully prosecute the Klan leader Robert Chambliss for murder in the bombing.
17_25	0.075331793	Baxley chose not to prosecute other suspects at that time, in the hope that better cases could be developed against them later.
17_26	0.076065655	When Jones became a U.S. attorney in 1997, he pushed for the current grand jury investigation of others named in FBI files as suspects in the bombing.
17_27	0.08474444	``To be able to get back and reopen the case, and let the community know that it's not forgotten, that's important for everybody,'' Jones said.
17_28	0.066223448	``If you can bring it to closure, everyone can finish the healing process''.
17_29	0.38960045	Another reason the climate is better for pursuing these cases today, said Morris Dees, executive director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.
17_30	0.13966579	, is that the FBI, which investigated some of the cases when they occurred, is more cooperative than it was 30 years ago.
17_31	0.070309804	In the Birmingham case, for example, documents show that J.
17_32	0.078710331	Edgar Hoover, who was then the FBI director, prevented bureau agents from meeting with prosecutors to present the voluminous evidence they had collected.

17_45	0.084535027	Stoner was convicted in another church bombing in Birmingham and shared a prison cell with Chambliss.
17_46	0.089015957	Federal civil rights charges were used in the 1960s to convict a few suspects in these kinds of slayings, but the statute of limitations on those charges has run out in the Birmingham case as well as in all the other cases from that time.

17_70	0.039016495	The church's pastor, the Rev.

23_3	0.10714886	According to ``HATE.COM,'' many acts of domestic terrorism, such as the Oklahoma City bombing and the attack at a Jewish community day-care center in Los Angeles, are not the work of ``lone wolves'' but of soldiers in a loosely organized army whose marching orders come via neo-Nazi, white-supremacist and homophobic Web sites.
23_4	0.54666888	Morris Dees, co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center and a crusader against intolerance, says the answer is not to censor the Internet.

24_0	0.36004468	COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho _ Issuing a verdict that civil rights organizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest white-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a state jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan Nations to pay more than $6 million to the victims of an attack two years ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's compound near here.
24_1	0.32588874	Richard Girnt Butler, the 82-year-old self-described pastor of the Aryan Nations compound, and his deputy, Michael Teague, were ordered to pay most of the $6.3 million in damages by the nine-woman, three-man jury.
24_2	0.18014069	The findings, delivered late Thursday afternoon in the Kootenai County Courthouse, prompted tearful hugs among the plaintiffs, a mother and son who were beaten and shot at in the attack, and their lawyers.
24_3	0.10899136	The defendants responded defiantly outside the courthouse, even as protesters shouted at them to stop their ``message of hate''.
24_4	0.73024202	The verdict was obtained by lawyers for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization in Birmingham, Ala.

24_8	0.19129122	, a founder of the center, hailed the jury's finding as a powerful message against racial intolerance and one that could force the group out of its 19-acre property.
24_9	0.14151603	``I'd like to say publicly for Butler to get the message that we consider the every single asset of that compound to be the property of the plaintiffs in this case,'' Dees said after the verdict was announced.
24_10	0.10738784	The multimillion-dollar award also represented the kind of message from the community that many civic leaders here had openly sought, hoping that it might help the area to shed what they called North Idaho's distorted image as a haven for people with racist views.
24_11	0.11462533	But Butler scoffed at the verdict, variously comparing himself to figures in the Bible and to signers of the Declaration of Independence who were harassed for their views.
24_12	0.11878859	``This is nothing,'' he said, after the verdict.
24_13	0.02600896	``We have planted seeds''.

24_16	0.19606691	The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son, Jason, now 21, who were beaten and shot at by three security guards for the Aryan Nations in July 1998, had asked the jury for nearly $12 million in compensatory and punitive damages.
24_17	0.19167576	But the larger purpose of the lawsuit was to bankrupt the Aryan Nations compound, limit Butler's ability to spread a gospel of racial hate and persuade the jury to ``return a verdict that will be heard all over this nation,'' a lawyer for the Keenans, Dees said in closing arguments.
24_18	0.14739781	Butler's lawyer, Edgar Steele, argued throughout the six-day trial that however offensive jurors might find the views of Butler, he should not be held responsible for the actions of a group of drunken young men.
24_19	0.17732307	Steele said the Aryan Nations property was not the incubator of violence that Dees had portrayed it to be.
24_20	0.084614557	``What goes on at Pastor Butler's property,'' he told the jurors, ``is really more akin to a homeless shelter for exceedingly politically incorrect misfits, malcontents, borderline derelicts and all manner of people that drift in and out''.
24_21	0.18159868	Keenan and her son were attacked after stopping their car near the entrance to the 19-acre Aryan Nations property near Hayden Lake, about 20 miles north of here, on their way home from a wedding.

24_25	0.14600404	At the compound, three guards, one of whom later told the police that he had thought the place was about to be attacked by militant Jews, picked up their guns, jumped in a pickup truck and chased the car.
24_26	0.12064207	They shot at the car, flattening a rear tire and forcing the car into a ditch.
24_27	0.11408655	In tearful testimony, Keenan said one guard, Jesse Warfield, 45, struck her with the butt of a rifle, grabbed her by the hair and screamed at her.
24_28	0.20846975	She and her son testified that they thought they were going to be killed.
24_29	0.15671619	Keenan said that she begged the men not to kill her son and that one of the guards then asked her if she was Indian.
24_30	0.097247682	She testified that while she is part Cherokee, she told the men, ``No, I'm a poor white farm girl''.
24_31	0.092705552	A guard then said that because they were white, the men would let them go.
24_32	0.15347228	At the trial, another security guard, John Yeager, 21, testified that he was too drunk that night to remember whether he or the other men had fired at the Keenans.
24_33	0.10160544	Under questioning, Yeager read portions of a letter from jail in which he expressed his allegiance to Butler, saying, ``Next to Christ you are the greatest man to ever walk the face of this earth''.
24_34	0.13711585	Yeager and Warfield have pleaded guilty to criminal assault and are in prison, while the third guard, Shane Wright, 23, remained a fugitive.
