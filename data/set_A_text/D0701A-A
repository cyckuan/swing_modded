0_0	0.20021833	SAN ANTONIO _ The conviction of white supremacist John William King last week for the murder of James Byrd Jr.
0_1	0.20117526	, a black man, begins to bring closure to a horrific chapter in the nation's history of race relations.
0_2	0.31695643	But the book didn't begin, nor will it end with the King trial, as a report by the Montgomery, Ala.-based Southern Poverty Law Center demonstrates.
0_3	0.33919167	According to the report, the number of hate groups in the country increased again last year.
0_4	0.078449534	Hate and intolerance are dark threads deeply woven into our society's fabric.
0_5	0.083919568	They give rise to the environment that fostered King's prejudices and threatens all communities, not just his own in Jasper, Texas.
0_6	0.14059483	Consider his writings in the scrapbook of a fellow prison inmate.
0_7	0.092421109	In it, King professed, ``We, my Aryan Brother in arms, will rightfully claim what's ours and in the end our feet will be washed in the blood of the Jews''.
0_8	0.075634289	The scary thing is that King is only 24.
0_9	0.073894407	He didn't evolve overnight into the monster that killed Byrd.
0_10	0.087353466	Neither did his moral moorings come loose in a vacuum.
0_11	0.083582302	King's hate steadily was fed, tattoos on his body eventually mirroring the thoughts in his head: a black man being lynched; a Madonna carrying a baby Jesus with horns; Nazi symbols.
0_12	0.077899794	Other events throughout the country and even in Jasper show how King might have arrived at this point.
0_13	0.15646952	In Louisiana last week, a white man was convicted of a hate crime for trying to burn two cars belonging to black motorists.
0_14	0.087558339	And in Virginia Beach, Va.
0_15	0.091730034	, a 19-year-old man pleaded guilty to trying to burn a cross on the lawn of an interracial couple.
0_16	0.083079724	In Jasper, school officials were haggling with the parents of a student who, amid the raw feelings surrounding Byrd's death and King's murder trial, found it fit to wear to class his Confederate flag belt buckle.
0_17	0.14147202	The boy's parents called in help from a nearby Ku Klux Klan group when the boy was suspended for refusing to leave his buckle at home.
0_18	0.087091758	While not murderous acts, they reveal an indifference to humanity.
0_19	0.085833566	For these folks, Byrd's brutal death was only a blip on their screen, if they even bothered to blink.
0_20	0.091491567	Whites aren't immune from becoming hate-crime victims, but groups that hate minorities, Jews and gays far outnumber other separatist organizations.
0_21	0.084362452	And, make no mistake, they're hungry for more recruits.
0_22	0.3335382	Their new tool, according to the law center, is the Internet.
0_23	0.089713579	Cyberspace gives hate groups a forum from which they can reach not only the traditional working-class white teen-ager, but increasingly the middle-class youth in suburbia.
0_24	0.10847809	Along with white power rock 'n' roll music and the ongoing recruiting efforts of fringe groups, the outreach has bumped the number of hate groups to 537 from 474 in 1997.
0_25	0.42907313	The Southern Poverty Law Center previously recorded a 20-percent increase in hate groups from 1996 to 1997.
0_26	0.080449662	Take a good look.
0_27	0.077565003	This is how John William King learned to hate.

0_32	0.075766494	It's something that spreads from one person to another''.
0_33	0.088377294	But hate also is something that each of us can stop, if only by challenging those who espouse it.

1_13	0.073262082	On July 22, with members of Ostendorf's caravan and 200 local residents present, the mayor announced that East Peoria, which has only a few dozen non-whites in its population of 23,400, would set up a Human Relations Commission ``to guide us in combating hate and teaching tolerance''.

7_13	0.10197375	The multimillion-dollar award also represented the kind of message from the community that many civic leaders here had openly sought, hoping that it might help the area to shed what they called North Idaho's distorted image as a haven for people with racist views.

17_0	0.38879363	WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) --The number of organized hate groups in the United States grew last year, mostly through new chapters of established white power organizations, the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a report released Tuesday.

19_4	0.16760854	Across the South, these and other unresolved, racially motivated killings of blacks from the civil rights era are under new scrutiny.
19_5	0.1262896	This fresh round of investigations into the long-ago killings, many of which had been ignored by authorities for years, was inspired by the well-publicized conviction in 1994 of an aging white defendant in the 1963 assassination of the Mississippi civil rights leader Medgar Evers.
19_6	0.089231802	For years, black community leaders and relatives of victims had complained about the lack of action in both the higher-profile and the lesser-known of these cases.
19_7	0.098803919	But recently their urgings have been taken more seriously, experts and historians say, because the South's political, social and legal climate has changed significantly since the era of the killings.

19_10	0.098989966	And a new breed of prosecutors and investigators, feeling an urgency as many witnesses and defendants in the cases grow old, is realizing the important role that resolving these cases can play in the South's efforts to move beyond its past of racial hate and terrorism.

20_0	0.29690449	COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) --Northern Idaho, predominantly white and rural, has been home for nearly three decades to the racist Aryan Nations.
20_1	0.15733324	It has struggled with a reputation as a haven for hate.
20_2	0.18511883	But residents say a $6.3 million jury verdict returned Thursday against Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler and three of his followers for attacking two people near the sect's compound may be the first step toward rehabilitating the region's image.
20_3	0.098487053	''It's a small step for human rights, one giant step for Idaho,'' said Marshall Mend, a human rights activist whose home and business were allegedly targeted for firebombings by Aryan Nations members.
20_4	0.078656385	''The people of Kootenai County said, 'No more hate'.

20_7	0.20601644	, and one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs, said he intended to enforce the judgment, taking everything the Aryan Nations owns, including its trademark name.
20_8	0.11633624	He even suggested turning the 20-acre Aryan Nations compound into a center for tolerance, teaching about the Holocaust.
20_9	0.34783404	But putting a hate group out of business isn't easy: While Dees has won significant civil judgments against the Ku Klux Klan and the White Aryan Resistance, the groups have survived.
20_10	0.10206111	Brian Levin, a California State University professor who has studied hate groups, said legal moves have damaged the groups but their strong ideology has proved as vital as funding.
20_11	0.079321049	''What lawsuits can't do is cripple a movement,'' Levin said, adding that racist organizations now focus on small cells of individuals, rather than larger, organized groups such as Butler's.

20_21	0.077394229	Butler, in fact, appeared confident after the verdict.
20_22	0.12660813	Outside the courtroom, the 82-year-old Butler said Idaho's Panhandle would continue to be a haven for racists.

20_31	0.14110349	While Butler has never been convicted of any crime, his group has attracted neo-Nazis, supremacists and separatists to the region.
20_32	0.10076055	Most notorious of these groups was The Order, a violent offshoot that embarked on a nationwide crime spree in the 1980s, including armored car robberies and the slaying of Jewish talk show host Alan Berg in Denver.
20_33	0.16360488	Most of the group's followers are in jail and its leader was killed during a 1984 shoot-out with the FBI.
